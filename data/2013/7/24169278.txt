Objective:To explore the prognostic value of galectin-9 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Galectin-9 was validated by immunohistochemisty in tissue microarrays from HCC patients (n = 147) and statistically assessed for the prognosis. The serum levels of galectin-9 from another independent cohort including HCC patients (n = 31) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Results:Patients with a lower expression of galectin-9 had significantly worse prognosis than those with a higher expression. The serum level of galectin-9 of HCC patients (8.36 ± 2.12) µg/L was significantly lower than that in healthy (4.62 ± 1.59 )µg/L and liver cirrhosis controls (5.11 ± 1.92 )µg/L (P Conclusion:Involved in the poor prognosis of HCC patients, galectin-9 may be a new predictor of recurrence for HCC patients and serve as a high-priority therapeutic target.
