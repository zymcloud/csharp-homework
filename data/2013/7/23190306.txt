Aim:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is primarily treated with hepatic resection and/or locoregional therapy. When HCC recurs and further treatment is no longer possible owing to poor liver function, liver transplantation (LT) or living-donor LT (LDLT) is considered. The aim of this study was to clarify risk factors for tumor recurrence after LDLT in patients with recurrent HCC.Methods:The study comprised 104 patients who had undergone LDLT because of end-stage liver disease with recurrent HCC. The recurrence-free survival rates after the LDLT were calculated. Risk factors for tumor recurrence were identified.Results:The 1-, 3- and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates were 89.6%, 80.3% and 78.4%, respectively. By univariate analysis, the factors affecting recurrence-free survival were the sum of the largest tumor size and number of tumors of 8 or more (P Conclusion:LDLT should not be performed for patients who have both independent risk factors after any treatments for HCC.
