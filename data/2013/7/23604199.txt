The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway plays a central role in cell proliferation and survival in human cancer and is emerging as an attractive therapeutic target. In this study, we synthesized a novel PI3Kα inhibitor, HS-159 [N-(5-(3-(3-cyanophenyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-6-yl)pyridin-3-yl)benzenesulfonamide] and evaluated its anticancer effects on Huh-7 human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. HS-159 effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of downstream PI3K effectors such as Akt, mTOR and P70S6 kinases in a dose-dependent manner. This compound also induced apoptosis and increased the fraction of apoptotic cells in the sub-G1 phase as well as the levels of cleaved PARP, caspase-3 and -9. Furthermore, HS-159 decreased the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor which play important roles in angiogenesis. The anti-angiogenic effect of HS-159 was confirmed by the suppression of tube formation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro. Collectively, our results demonstrate that HS-159 exhibited anticancer activities including the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis by blocking the PI3K/Akt pathway in Huh-7 cells. Therefore, we suggest that this drug may be potentially used for targeted HCC therapy.
