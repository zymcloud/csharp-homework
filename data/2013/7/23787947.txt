An RNase with a molecular mass of 28 kDa and with high ribonucleolytic activity toward poly(A) was purified from the ascocarps of Tuber indicum. The purification procedure involved ion exchange chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose, Q-Sepharose and Mono Q, and gel filtration by fast protein liquid chromatography on Superdex 75. The pH and temperature optima of the RNase were 7.2 and 50 °C, respectively. The ranking of its activity toward various polyhomoribonucleotides was poly(A)>poly(C)>poly(G) ≈ poly(U). All of the metal ions used in this study, except for the K(+) ions, curtailed the activity of the RNase. The RNase activity was reduced by ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), dithiothreitol (DTT), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) by 42.2%, 75.5%, and 96.6%, respectively. The RNase inhibited the proliferation of hepatoma (HepG2) and human breast cancer cell lines (MCF7), with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50 ) of 12.6 and 16.6 μM, respectively.
