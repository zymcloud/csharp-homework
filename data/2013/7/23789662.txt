Objective:This article reviews topics discussed during the Fifth International Forum for Liver MRI (with a focus on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI), which was held in Munich, Germany, in September 2011.Conclusion:Growing evidence shows that gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing liver tumors. Hepatobiliary phase imaging adds new information for the characterization of borderline lesions. However, there is a need to develop standardized criteria for interpretation of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI in patients with cirrhosis or other risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma.
