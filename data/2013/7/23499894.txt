Aberrant regulation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) plays a pivotal role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but, the underlying mechanism leading to HDAC2 overexpression is not well understood. We performed microRNA (miRNA) profiling analysis in a subset of HCCs, and identified four down-regulated miRNAs that may target HDAC2 in HCC. Ectopic expression of miRNA mimics evidenced that miR-145 suppresses HDAC2 expression in HCC cells. This treatment repressed cancer cell growth and recapitulated HDAC2 knockdown effects on HCC cells. In conclusion, we suggest that loss or suppression of miR-145 may cause aberrant overexpression of HDAC2 and promote HCC tumorigenesis.
