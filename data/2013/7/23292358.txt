A 5.4-kDa antifungal peptide was purified from Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. "northeast red bean" using a protocol that entailed affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. The molecular mass was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the peptide was highly homologous to defensins and defensin-like peptides from several plant species. The peptide impeded the growth of a number of pathogenic fungi, including Mycosphaerella arachidicola Khokhr. (IC50 = 1.7 μM), Setosphaeria turcica Luttr., Fusarium oxysporum Schltdl., and Valsa mali Miyabe & G. Yamada. Antifungal activity of the peptide was fully preserved at temperatures up to 100 °C and pH values from 0 to 12. Congo red deposition at the hyphal tip of M. arachidicola was detected after exposure to the peptide, signifying that the peptide had suppressed hyphal growth. The antifungal peptide did not manifest antiproliferative activity toward human breast cancer MCF7 cells and hepatoma HepG2 cells, in contradiction to the bulk of previously reported plant defensins. The data suggest distinct structural requirements for antifungal and antiproliferative activities.
