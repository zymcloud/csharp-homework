A 52-year-old male with a right ventricular mass that filled the entire right ventricle and assumed its shape was evaluated by two-dimensional and real time three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography. Contrast enhanced 3D imaging and quantitative assessments of the size of the mass were performed. The clinical correlation, the imaging characteristics of the mass, and the pattern of vascularity were consistent with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. The case illustrates the incremental role of 3D echo in defining the size, shape, spatial relationship, attachments, consistency, and vascularity of the right ventricular mass.
