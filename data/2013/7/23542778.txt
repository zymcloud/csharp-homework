During an egg-laying cycle, oviparous animals transfer massive amounts of triglycerides, the major lipid component of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), from the liver to the developing oocytes. A major stimulus for this process is the rise in estrogen associated with the onset of an egg-laying cycle. In mammals, the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is required for VLDL assembly and secretion. To enable studies to determine if MTP plays a role in basal and estrogen-stimulated VLDL assembly and secretion in an oviparous vertebrate, we have cloned and sequenced the chicken MTP cDNA. This cDNA encodes a protein of 893 amino acids with an N-terminal signal sequence. The primary sequence of chicken MTP is, on average, 65% identical to that of mammalian homologs, and 23% identical to the Drosophila melanogaster protein. We have obtained a clone of chicken embryo fibroblast cells that stably express the avian MTP cDNA and show that these cells display MTP activity as measured by the transfer of a fluorescently labeled neutral lipid. As in mammals, chicken MTP is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum as revealed by indirect immunofluorescence and by the fact that its N-linked oligosaccharide moiety remains sensitive to endoglycosidase H. Endogenous, enzymatically active MTP is also expressed in an estrogen receptor-expressing chicken hepatoma cell line that secretes apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. In this cell line and in vivo, the expression and activity of MTP are not influenced by estrogen. Therefore, up-regulation of MTP in the liver is not required for the increased VLDL assembly during egg production in the chicken. This indicates that MTP is not rate-limiting, even for the massive estrogen-induced secretion of VLDL accompanying an egg-laying cycle.
