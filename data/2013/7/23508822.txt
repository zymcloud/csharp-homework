Background:Data on the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in combination with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are lacking.Patients and methods:In this multicenter retrospective study, 222 consecutive HCC patients receiving combination therapy were enrolled between June 2008 and July 2011.Results:Chronic hepatitis B was the predominant cause of HCC (86%). Eighty percent patients were at Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C, and 86% patients were in Child-Pugh (CP) A class. The overall median survival was 12 months (95% CI 10.1-13.9). The overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) was 87%. In 177 BCLC-C patients, performance status, the number of HCC nodules, Child-Pugh score and macrovascular invasion were significantly associated with overall survival (OS) and were included in the final risk scores (R), where R = 5 × (vascular invasion: 0 if no, 1 yes) + 6 × (CP: 0 if A, 1 if B) + 7 × (no. of lesions: 0 if 1-2, 1 ≥3) + 8 × ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, ECOG: 0 if 0, 1 ≥1).Conclusions:Sorafenib in combination with TACE should be considered a safe and effective therapy for advanced HCC. Further validation of the new subgroup of BCLC-C stage is warranted in an independent patient cohort.
