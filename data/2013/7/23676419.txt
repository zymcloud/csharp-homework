Background:The objectives of this study are to estimate prevalence and incidence of extrapancreatic malignancies (EPMs) among intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas, and to identify risk factors for their occurrence.Patients and methods:We conducted multicentric cohort study in Italy from January 2010 to January 2011 including 390 IPMN cases. EPMs were grouped as previous, synchronous (both prevalent) and metachronous (incident). We calculated the observed/expected (O/E) ratio of prevalent EPMs, and compared the distribution of demographic, medical history and lifestyle habits.Results:Ninety-seven EPMs were diagnosed in 92 patients (23.6%), among them 78 (80.4%) were previous, 14 (14.4%) were synchronous and 5 (5.2%) were metachronous. O/E ratios for prevalent EPMs were significantly increased for colorectal carcinoma (2.26; CI 95% 1.17-3.96), renal cell carcinoma (6.00; CI 95% 2.74-11.39) and thyroid carcinoma (5.56; CI 95% 1.80-12.96). Increased age, heavy cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption and first-degree family history of gastric cancer are significant risk factors for EPMs, while first-degree family history of colorectal carcinoma was borderline.Conclusion:We report an increased prevalence of EPMs in Italian patients with IPMN, especially for colorectal carcinoma, renal cell and thyroid cancers. A systematic surveillance of IPMN cases for such cancer types would be advised.
