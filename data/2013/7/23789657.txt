Objective:Noninvasive imaging plays critical roles in the treatment of patients with cirrhosis or other risk factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. In recognition of the critical roles played by imaging, numerous international scientific organizations and societies have, in the past 12 years, proposed diagnostic systems for the interpretation of liver imaging examinations performed of at-risk patients.Conclusion:Although these imaging-based diagnostic systems represent important advances, they have limitations and they are not perfectly consistent with each other. The limitations and inconsistencies potentially cause confusion and may impair the integration of the systems into clinical practice as well as their utilization in research studies. The purpose of this article is to synthesize and critically appraise the current published imaging-based diagnostic systems endorsed by major societies for the noninvasive diagnosis and staging of hepatocellular carcinoma and to propose future directions that we hope may be helpful in further advancing the field.
