Background:Radio-frequency ablation (RFA) has been employed in the treatment of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as curative treatments.Aim:To assess the effectiveness and the safety of RFA in patients with early HCC and compensated cirrhosis.Methods:A cohort of 151 consecutive patients with early stage HCC (122 Child-Pugh class A and 29 class B patients) treated with RFA were enrolled. Clinical, laboratory and radiological follow-up data were collected from the time of first RFA. A single lesion was observed in 113/151 (74.8%), two lesions in 32/151 (21.2%), and three lesions in 6/151 (4%) of patients.Results:The overall survival rates were 94%, 80%, 64%, 49%, and 41% at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months, respectively. Complete response (CR) at 1 month (pConclusions:RFA is safe and effective for managing HCC with cirrhosis, especially for patients with HCC â‰¤3 cm and higher baseline albumin levels. Complete response after RFA significantly increases survival.
