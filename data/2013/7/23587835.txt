Background:Internal irradiation with iodine-131 (I)-labeled Lipiodol is one of the currently available forms of palliative therapy for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Despite a cumulative experience of more than 10 years with this treatment, only a few studies have reported on its efficacy and safety.Objective:The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy of intra-arterial I-labeled Lipiodol injection for treatment against advanced HCC.Materials and methods:Fifty patients (47 men and three women; mean age 64 years) given an intra-arterial injection of I-Lipiodol (5 ml of 2.2 GBq Lipiodol labeled with I; number of mean sessions per patient, 1.3; range 1-4) were retrospectively compared with 36 patients (31 men and five women; mean age 64 years) who were given only medical support. Portal vein thrombosis was present in 86 and 100% of patients, respectively. Efficacy was determined on the basis of overall survival as the endpoint using the Kaplan-Meier method. Tumor response was evaluated with computed tomography according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) criteria.Results:For patients treated with I-Lipiodol, median survival was 32 weeks, compared with 8 weeks for the untreated group (P=0.007). Survival at 6 months and at 1 and 2 years was 65, 35, and 22%, respectively, for patients treated with I-Lipiodol compared with 28, 8, and 0% for the untreated group. At 1 month, more than 80% of patients were responders (complete response, partial response, and stable disease) on the basis of the RECIST and EASL criteria, and at 6 months 39% were responders. No radiotoxic effect was observed, especially with respect to interstitial pneumonia. No significant difference was observed between survival and Î±-fetoprotein levels, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer clinical score, and portal vein thrombosis.Conclusion:Intra-arterial injection of I-Lipiodol is safe and provides significant survival benefit in terms of overall survival for patients with advanced HCC.
