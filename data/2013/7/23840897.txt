F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (Fbxw7/hAgo/hCdc4/Fbw7) is a p53-dependent tumor suppressor and leads to ubiquitination-mediated suppression of several oncoproteins including c-Myc, cyclin E, Notch, c-Jun and others. Our previous study has indicated that low expression of Fbxw7 was negatively correlated with c-Myc, cyclin E and mutant-p53 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. But the role and mechanisms of Fbxw7 in HCC are still unknown. Here, we investigated the function of Fbxw7 in HCC cell lines and the anti-tumor activity of recombinant human adenovirus-p53 injection (rAd-p53, Gendicine) administration in vitro and in vivo. Fbxw7-specific siRNA enhanced expression of c-Myc and cyclin E proteins and increased proliferation in cell culture. rAd-p53 inhibited tumor cell growth with Fbxw7 upregulation and c-Myc and cyclin E downregulation in vitro and a murine HCC model. This effect could be partially reverted using Fbxw7-specific siRNA. Here, we suggest that the activation of Fbxw7 by adenoviral delivery of p53 leads to increased proteasomal degradation of c-Myc and cyclin E enabling growth arrest and apoptosis. Addressing this pathway, we identified that rAd-p53 could be a potential therapeutic agent for HCC.
