Objective:To investigate the impact of serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) level on survival and short-term recurrence after R0 resection in primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The clinical data of 582 cases of primary HCC underwent R0 resection from January 1997 to December 2009 was analyzed retrospectively. There were 488 male and 94 female patients whose average age was 51 years (ranging from 31 to 73 years). The survival rate of 1-, 3- and 5-year and clinopathological factors between the AFP-negative group and AFP-positive group were compared. The risk factors of short-term recurrence after R0 resection of HCC patients in AFP-positive group were further analyzed.Results:The age and histological differentiation in AFP-positive group were significantly lower than the AFP-negative group (χ(2) = 11.004, 32.293; P = 0.000). Otherwise the serum γ-glutamyl transferase level, diameter of tumor, TNM stage and short-term recurrence were higher than the AFP-negative group (χ(2) = 9.814 to 14.009, P Conclusion:The increase of preoperative serum AFP level suggests the potency of HCC short-term recurrency.
