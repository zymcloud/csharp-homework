Aim:To investigate the efficacy and safety of capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CapeOx) for extrahepatic metastasis after local treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Thirty-two patients with extrahepatic metastasis of HCC after local treatment were prospectively enrolled. The CapeOx regimen consisted of capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) taken orally twice daily on days 1-14, and oxaliplatin was administered at a total dose of 100 mg/m(2) on day 1. The treatment was repeated every 3 wk until disease progression or unaccetablle toxicity. Efficacy and safety were assessable for all enrolled patients. The primary objective of this study was to assess the overall response rate. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the overall survival (OS), the time to tumor progression (TTP) and the toxicity profile of the combined strategy. TTP and OS were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method and differences between the curves were analyzed using the log-rank test. The statistical software SPSS version 15.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, United States) was used for statistical analysis. All P values were 2-tailed, with statistical significance defined by P ≤ 0.05.Results:Thirty-two patients were assessable for efficacy and toxicity. The median follow-up duration was 15 mo (range, 12-20 mo). At the cut-off date of March 31, 2012, 27 patients died due to tumor progression and one patient died of myocardial infarction. Four patients were still alive (three patients with disease progression). OR was 21.9% (n = 7), the stabilization rate was 40.6% (n = 13), and the disease control rate was 62.5%. The responses lasted from 4 to 19 mo (median, 6 mo). Median TTP was 4.2 mo (95%CI: 2.5-7.4), and the median OS time was 9.2 mo (95%CI: 6.5-17.8). The 1-year survival rate was 43.6% (95%CI: 29.0-66.0). In a multivariate analysis, OS was significantly longer in patients with a Child-Pugh class A compared with class B patients (P = 0.014), with a median OS of 10.1 mo vs 5.4 mo, and there were trends towards longer OS (P = 0.065) in patients without portal vein tumor thrombosis. There were no significant effects of age, gender, performance status, cirrhosis, metastatic sites, and level of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) or hepatitis B virus-DNA on OS. Among the 22 patients with elevated AFP levels at baseline (≥ 400 ng/mL), the level fell by more than 50% during treatment in 6 patients (27.3%). The most frequent treatment-related grade 3 to 4 toxicities included leucopenia/neutropenia, transient elevation of aminotransferases, hand-foot syndrome and fatigue.Conclusion:CapeOx showed modest anti-tumor activity in metastatic HCC. However, the manageable toxicity profile and the encouraging disease control rate deserve further study for these patients.
