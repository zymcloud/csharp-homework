Background:There is no standard treatment for progressive epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE). To investigate the significant vascularization of EHE, the activity/toxicity of sorafenib in patients with progressive EHE was explored.Methods:In this multicenter, 1-stage, phase 2 trial of sorafenib (800 mg daily), the primary endpoint, which was chosen by default, was the 9-month progression-free rate. All patients had documented progressive disease at the time of study entry.Results:Fifteen patients were enrolled between June 2009 and February 2011. The median age was 57 years (range, 31-76 years), and the ratio of men to women was 9:6. The performance status was zero in 10 patients and 1 in 5 patients. Twelve patients had metastases, mainly in the lung (12 patients), liver (5 patients), and bone (3 patients). Five patients had received prior chemotherapy (doxorubicin in 5 patients and taxane in 3 patients). The median sorafenib treatment duration was 124 days (range, from 27 to >271 days). Seven patients required dose reductions or transient treatment discontinuation. The 9-month progression-free rate was 30.7% (4 of 13 patients). The 2-month, 4-month, and 6-month progression-free rate was 84.6% (11 of 13 patients), 46.4% (6 of 13 patients), and 38.4% (5 of 13 patients), respectively. Two partial responses were observed that lasted 2 months and 9 months.Conclusions:Further clinical trials exploring sorafenib as treatment of progressive EHE are needed.
