We report a case of a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who presented with back pain related to bone metastasis. HCC metastasizes by hematogenous and lymphatic routes commonly to the lungs, regional lymph nodes, kidney, bone marrow and adrenals. In this extremely rare case, the patient had no known liver disease, but presented with liver lesions and multiple bone lesions involving vertebrae, ribs, pelvic bones and left femur with associated expansile soft-tissue components. These bone lesions were first detected from a positron emission tomography scan. Pathological examination of biopsy material taken from the left eighth rib confirmed metastatic HCC. In conclusion, if a patient has expansile osteolytic bone lesions, bone metastasis from HCC should be included in the differential diagnosis.
