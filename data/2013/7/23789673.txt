Objective:The purpose of this study is to investigate the dynamic MRI findings and clinical features of benign hypervascular hepatic nodules in childhood-cancer survivors.Materials and methods:We reviewed dynamic MRI findings and clinical features in 15 patients who had been treated for childhood malignant solid tumors and in whom hypervascular hepatic nodules were later found on surveillance imaging by either CT or ultrasound (or both). The benign nature of the lesion was based on histologic examination or clinical and radiologic follow-up (or both).Results:Time between initial diagnosis of malignancy and detection of the hepatic nodule ranged from 4.5 to 13.5 years with the majority of the malignancies being neuroblastoma treated by high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A total of 43 nodules were detected, often multiple and small. Most of the lesions were isointense or slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging and isointense or slightly hypointense on T1-weighted imaging. All nodules had intense enhancement on the arterial phase and were isointense or slightly hyperintense on the delayed phase. A central scar was seen in four. Additionally, hepatic hemosiderosis was noted in four patients, in whom all the lesions were hyperintense on both T1- and T2-weighted imaging.Conclusion:Benign hypervascular hepatic nodules in survivors of childhood malignancy occur years after high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Dynamic MRI findings including intense arterial enhancement and absence of washout in the delayed phase are of great value in the differential diagnosis of these hepatic nodules.
