Introduction:Recent data support liver resection (LR) as first-line approach in patients with preserved liver function who have resectable/transplantable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study was designed to evaluate the outcome of LR in patients with transplantable HCC.Methods:Between 1998 and 2009, 75 patients (65 men, mean age 61 Â± 11 years) with HCC eligible for liver transplantation (LT) underwent LR. The underlying hepatic disease was related to hepatitis C (HCV) in 30 (40 %) patients, hepatitis B (HBV) in 15 (20 %) patients, alcohol abuse in 26 patients (36 %) and other in 10 patients (13 %). Fifty-five (73 %) patients had cirrhosis. Intermittent clamping of the hepatic pedicle was used in 41 (55 %) patients. Treatment of recurrence by salvage LT was performed in 6 (8 %) patients.Results:Operative morbidity and mortality rates were 37 and 5 % respectively. At 1, 3, and 5 years, overall (OS) and disease-free (DFS) survival rates were 81, 69,55 and 56, 31, and 21 %, respectively. On multivariate analysis, HCV infection was the only independent factor associated with decreased OS (p = 0.02). On multivariate analysis, HCV infection (p = 0.05) and intermittent hepatic pedicle clamping (p = 0.003) were associated with decreased DFS. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS and DFS rates in patients with HCV-related HCC were 69, 53, 38 and 50, 18, and 9% respectively.Conclusions:Overall and disease-free survival after liver resection in patients with HCV-related HCC and preserved liver function is poor. Primary LT should be offered to these patients.
