Background:Whether inflammatory bowel disease patients are at increased risk of colonoscopic perforations remains controversial. Aim of this study was to investigate whether these patients are at increased risk of perforations.Methods:Electronic charts of all patients enrolled in the Nancy IBD cohort (1999-2012) were reviewed. All non-inflammatory bowel disease patients who underwent colonoscopy (1999-2012) were used as controls.Results:Of 17,992 colonoscopies, 2375 (13.2%) were performed for inflammatory bowel disease: 1547 for Crohn's disease and 828 for ulcerative colitis. Four IBD patients (0.168%) experienced perforation. Perforation occurred in the sigmoid colon (n = 3) and right colon (n = 1) during disease monitoring or colonic stenosis dilatation. Three patients underwent surgery (2 stomas and no death). Colonoscopic perforation occurred in 16/15,617 controls (0.102%): colonic cancer diagnosis (n = 5, 31.3%) or dilatation (n = 2, 12.5%), polypectomy (n = 5, 31.3%) or mucosectomy (n = 1, 6.3%), and follow-up after diverticulitis (n = 2, 12.5%). Perforation rate was not different between IBD and controls (p = 0.57). Perforations occurred in the sigmoid colon (n = 10, 62.5%), the right colon (n = 4, 25%) and the rectum (n = 2, 12.5%). Twelve controls underwent surgery (9 stomas and one death).Conclusion:In this referral centre-based cohort, inflammatory bowel disease patients were not at increased risk of colonoscopic perforation compared to non-IBD controls.
