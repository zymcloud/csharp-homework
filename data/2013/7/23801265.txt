The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing worldwide due to the growing number of hepatitis C related HCCs. In more than 80% of the patients, HCC arises in a cirrhotic liver. Furthermore, more than half of the patients have an advanced Child-Pugh score or an inoperable tumor stage at the initial diagnosis. Recommendations for the treatment of HCC by national and international guidelines rely on the BCLC ("Barcelona Clinic for Liver Cancer") algorithm. Depending on the stage of liver function and tumor disease it recommends resection, liver transplantation, radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFA), transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE), systemic therapy with sorafenib or best supportive care, but does neither take into consideration combination of therapies nor new therapy modalities. However, there is increasing evidence that combinations i. e. sorafenib with TACE or combination of locoregional techniques enhance effectivity and tumor control compared to monotherapies. TACE with drug-eluting beads, selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) and new locoregional therapy procedures like microwave ablation (MWA) are further promising therapeutic approaches. Patients with HCC should be discussed in a local tumor board in order to provide the optimal and most individual way of treatment.
