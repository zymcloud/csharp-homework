Objective. To identify the efficiency and safety of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with percutaneous ethanol (PEI) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) more than 3 cm in diameter in comparison with those of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization monotherapy. Methods. All databases were searched up to February 22, 2013. The literature retrieval was conducted through Pubmed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. We also searched Chinese databases, including Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biology Medicine (CBM), Wanfang database, and VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals without language limitations. Results. Based on the criteria, we found 12 RCTs including 825 patients. Our results showed that TACE combined with PEI therapy compared with TACE monotherapy improved overall survival and tumor response. Conclusion. The combination of TACE and PEI compared with TACE monotherapy improved overall survival rates and tumor response of patients with large HCC. Besides, larger and more methodologically rigorous clinical trials are needed to confirm this outcome.
