The impact of antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) on survival after curative surgical resection (SR) for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between anti-HBc positivity and survival of HCV-related HCC patients who underwent curative SR. A total of 222 patients with HCV-related, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative HCC who underwent curative SR were analyzed. They included 119 anti-HBc-positive patients (53.6%) and 103 anti-HBc-negative patients (46.4%). Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were compared between the two groups. The median follow-up periods in the anti-HBc-positive and anti-HBc-negative groups were 3.4 years (range, 0.3-10.9 years) and 3.2 years (range, 0.5-10.9 years), respectively. The 1-, 3- and 5-year cumulative OS rates were 88.8, 70.2 and 50.0%, respectively, in the anti-HBc-positive group and 95.8, 77.1 and 61.7% in the anti-HBc-negative group (P=0.300). The corresponding RFS rates were 68.7, 33.0 and 20.0%, respectively, in the anti-HBc-positive group and 74.4, 38.5 and 16.5% in the anti-HBc-negative group (P=0.482). Multivariate analyses identified serum albumin â‰¥3.8 g/dl (P=0.005) and the presence of microvascular invasion (P
