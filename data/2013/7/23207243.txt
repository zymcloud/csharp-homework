Objective:This study aimed to assess the prognostic impact of liver metastases (LM) in patients with colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) who underwent complete cytoreductive surgery and resection of LM, followed by intraperitoneal chemotherapy.Background:Synchronous surgical treatment of PC and LM with curative intent remains controversial.Methods:From a prospective database, all patients with PC and synchronous LM who had undergone cytoreductive surgery and LM resection followed by intraperitoneal chemotherapy were matched with patients with PC alone according to the following criteria: age, peritoneal cancer index (PCI), site and lymph node involvement (pN) of primary cancer, and postoperative chemotherapy.Results:From 1993 to 2009, 37 patients with PC and LM were matched with 61 patients with PC alone. After a mean follow-up of 36 months, 3-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival rates were significantly lower in patients with PC and LM, respectively, 40% and 66% (P = 0.04) and 6% and 27% (P = 0.001). A PCI of 12 or more [odds ratio (OR): 4.6], a pN+ status (OR: 3.3), no adjuvant chemotherapy (OR: 3.0), and presence of LM (OR: 2.0) were identified as independent factors for poor OS. Three groups were singled out: (1) patients with a low PCI (<12) and no LM (median OS: 76 months); (2) patients with a low PCI (<12) and 1 or 2 LM (median OS: 40 months); and (3) patients with a high PCI (â‰¥12) or patients with 3 LMs or more (median OS: 27 months).Conclusions:This case-control study seems to confirm that prolonged survival can be achieved in highly selected patients operated on for limited PC and fewer than 3 LM.
