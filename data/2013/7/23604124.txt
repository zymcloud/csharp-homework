The hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx) has a key role in the molecular pathogenesis of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanism of HBx-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis remains to be elucidated. In this study, we aimed to better understand the effects of HBx on gene-expression profiles that participate in hepatocarcinogenesis and the mechanism by which HBx regulates these genes. Differentially expressed genes between L02-HBx and L02-Vector control cells were identified by microarray and validated using quantitative real-time PCR. HBx upregulates 456 genes and downregulates 843 genes, including programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4). PDCD4 was downregulated in clinical HCC specimens and the downregulation of PDCD4 in HCC is correlated with HBx. Furthermore, overexpression experiments in HCC cells proved that PDCD4 has strong tumor-suppressive effects both in vitro and in vivo, and may induce cell apoptosis to suppress the development of HCC. HBx induces expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), but failed to change the methylation status of the PDCD4 promoter. HBx downregulates PDCD4 expression at least partially through miR-21. Taken together, this study reported for the first time that HBx downregulates PDCD4 and upregulates miR-21 expression. The overexpression of PDCD4 could suppress tumorigenicity. The deregulation of PDCD4 by HBx through miR-21 represents a potential novel mechanism of the downregulation of PDCD4 in HBV-related HCC and provides new insights into HCC development.
