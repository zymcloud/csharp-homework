Objective:To explore the effects of CXCR7 knock-down by CXCR7-shRNA lentiviral vector on the proliferation and invasion of human hepatoma carcinoma cells in vitro.Methods:CXCR7-shRNA lentiviral vector was transfected into hepatocellular carcinoma HCCLM3 cells. The changes in mRNA and protein expression of CXCR7 in the transfected cells were investigated using real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively, and MTT assay was employed to assess the cell proliferation changes. In vitro adhesion assay and transwell chamber test were used to observe the adhesion and invasiveness of HCCLM3 cells, respectively.Results:Transfection of HCCLM3 cells with CXCR7-shRNA lentiviral vector resulted in a significantly decreased expression of CXCR7 at both mRNA and protein levels (PConclusion:CXCR7 knock-down can significantly inhibit the proliferation and invasiveness of human hepatoma carcinoma cells in vitro, suggesting the value of CXCR7 as a potential target for hepatoma carcinoma therapy.
