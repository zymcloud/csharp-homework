We report a case of typical fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) in a 16-year-old Japanese boy. This is very rare malignancy in Japan. The patient was referred for investigation of a large hepatic tumor and the results of tests for hepatitis B virus surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody were negative. Liver function test results and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were normal; however, the prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence/antagonist II was elevated. Computed tomography (CT) showed a large lobulated heterogeneously enhanced tumor in the posterior section of the liver. We diagnosed FL-HCC and performed posterior sectionectomy of the liver. The resected specimen contained a light brown and green tumor with a central fibrous scar, 10.0 cm in diameter. Microscopic and electron microscopic examinations revealed the typical features of FL-HCC. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7, but negative for CK19 and AFP. The patient was alive without recurrence 48 months after surgery. Following this case report, we summarize the clinical features of the Japanese cases documented in the literature.
