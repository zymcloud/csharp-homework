Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) contributes to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through inducing dysregulation of lipogenesis. However, the mechanism by which HBx induces the abnormal lipogenesis is not well known. In this study, we report that the oncogene Rab18, a member of Ras family, enhances the HBx-induced hepatocarcinogenesis through inducing dysregulation of lipogenesis and proliferation. Our data showed that the expression levels of Rab18 were positively associated with those of HBx in clinical HCC tissues. HBx was able to upregulate the expression of Rab18 in p21-HBx transgenic mice and hepatoma cell lines. Next, we identified the mechanism by which HBx upregulated Rab18. The results demonstrated that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) were able to stimulate Rab18 promoter through activating transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1) and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate response element-binding (CREB). In addition, we identified another pathway that HBx activated Rab18. We found that miR-429 was able to directly target the 3' untranslated region of Rab18, suggesting that Rab18 is one of the target genes of miR-429. Then, we found that HBx was able to downregulate miR-429 in hepatoma cells. The oil red O staining showed that HBx resulted in the dysregulation of lipogenesis through Rab18. Moreover, Rab18 contributed to the HBx-enhanced proliferation of hepatoma cells in vitro and in vivo. HBx enhances hepatocarcinogenesis through leading to the dysregulation of lipogenesis and proliferation of hepatoma cells, involving two pathways such as HBx/COX-2/5-LOX/AP-1/CREB/Rab18 and HBx/miR-429/Rab18.
