Aim:The study aimed to determine whether nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an independent risk factor of adenoma after negative baseline colonoscopy.Method:A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 1522 health-check individuals who underwent two consecutive colonoscopies at Taipei Veterans General Hospital between 2003 and 2010. Those developing an adenoma after an initial negative baseline colonoscopy (adenoma group) were compared with those in whom the second colonoscopy was negative (nonadenoma group). Anthropometric measurements, biochemical tests and the presence of NAFLD were compared between the two groups.Results:The adenoma group had a higher prevalence of NAFLD than the nonadenoma group (55.6% vs 38.8%; P < 0.05). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, NAFLD was an independent risk factor (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.07-1.98) for adenoma formation after a negative baseline colonoscopy. The risk of colorectal adenoma increased when NAFLD patients had other morbidities including metabolic syndrome, hypertension or smoking (OR = 2.85, 4.03 and 4.17).Conclusion:NAFLD is an independent risk factor for colorectal adenoma formation after a negative baseline colonoscopy. The risk is higher in individuals with NAFLD and other comorbidities, such as hypertension, smoking or metabolic syndrome.
