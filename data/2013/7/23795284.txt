Liver disease has evolved into a complex discipline with several tiers of service delivery. Patients' needs vary at different phases of their disease, with mobility between local hospitals and specialist centres being increasingly common. Liver transplantation requirements serve as a good illustration of this fluidity and the need for service providers to coordinate care delivery. This is facilitated by the development of networks and satellite relationships that can range in complexity and functionality.
