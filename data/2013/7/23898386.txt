Background/aims:Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) is recommended in populations with anticipated prevalence ≥2%. This study surveyed HBV screening and vaccination practices of Asian American primary care providers (PCPs).Methods:Approximately 15,000 PCPs with Asian surnames in the New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, and Chicago areas were invited to participate in a web-based survey. Asian American PCPs with ≥25% Asian patients in their practice were eligible.Results:Of 430 (2.9%) survey respondents, 217 completed the survey. Greater than 50% followed ≥200 Asian patients. Although 95% of PCPs claimed to have screened patients for HBV, 41% estimated that ≤25% of their adult Asian patients had ever been screened, and 50% did not routinely screen all Asian patients. In a multivariable analysis, the proportion of Asian patients in the practice, provider geographic origin and the number of liver cancers diagnosed in the preceding 12 months were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of screening for HBV. Over 80% of respondents reported that ≤50% of their adult Asian patients had received the HBV vaccine.Conclusions:Screening and vaccination for HBV in Asian American patients is inadequate. Measures to improve HBV knowledge and care by primary-care physicians are critically needed.
