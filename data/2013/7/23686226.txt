Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) secreting cellular tumor vaccines contribute to the induction of potent antitumor immune responses in murine models and patients suffering from cancers. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent and malignant cancers in China. We describe, for the first time, a GM-CSF releasing vaccine strategy that represents a step toward combating this type of cancer. In this study, a bystander cell-based GM-CSF secreting vaccine against murine HCC, Hepa1-6/B78H1-GM-CSF, was co-administered with a low dose of cyclophosphamide (CY). After challenging with tumor and vaccination, immunological assays demonstrated that the cellular antitumor immune responses were efficiently activated and that tumor development was significantly retarded, which was dependent on synergy with CY. The promising outcome of the anti-HCC vaccine in the murine model demonstrates the feasibility of a future clinical application for this treatment in HCC patients.
