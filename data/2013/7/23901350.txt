Background and aims:We compared clinicopathologic data and long-term clinical outcomes among patients with non-B and non-C hepatocellular carcinoma (NBNC-HCC) who underwent curative resection (group A, n=129), those with hepatitis B virus-related HCC (group B, n=62) and those with hepatitis C virus-related HCC (group C, n=284).Methods:Clinicopathologic characteristics and cumulative overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) after curative resection were compared among the three groups.Results:The proportion of patients with non-liver cirrhosis (LC) or diabetes mellitus in group A was significantly higher than that in group B or group C. The mean maximum tumor size in group A was significantly larger than that of group B or group C. Cumulative 3-year OS rates after resection were 76% in group A, 79% in group B and 72% in group C (A vs. B, P=0.638; A vs. C, P=0.090; B vs. C, P=0.091; overall significance, P=0.088). The corresponding RFS rates after resection were 38% in group A, 36% in group B and 36% in group C (A vs. B, P=0.528; A vs. C, P=0.281; B vs. C, P=0.944; overall significance, P=0.557). In subgroup analyses in patients with LC, in those without LC and in those who satisfied the Milan criteria, similar results were obtained, i.e., the difference among the three groups did not reach significance in terms of OS and RFS.Conclusion:Long-term clinical outcomes in patients NBNC-HCC after curative resection were comparable to those in patients with hepatitis virus-related HCC after curative resection.
