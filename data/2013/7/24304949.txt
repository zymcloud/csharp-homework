Objective:To investigate the incidence and mortality of cancer registered in Zhejiang province in 2009.Methods:The statistics of incidence and mortality of cancer were collected from 6 population-based cancer registries in Zhejiang province, including 30 613 new incidence cases and 16 920 death cases reported in 2009. The 6 cancer registries covered population at 9 560 699 in all. The crude rate, age-standardized rate, cumulative rate (0-74 years old), cut rate (35-64 years old), age-specific rate of incidence/mortality as well as the constitution of top 10 common cancers were then calculated and analyzed. The age-standardized rate was calculated and adjusted by the Chinese standard population in 1982 as well as the Segi's world standard population.Results:The crude incidence of cancer was 320.20/100 000. Age-standardized incidence by Chinese standard population and by world standard population were separately 161.99/100 000 and 207.92/100 000, the cumulative rate was 23.83% and the cut rate was 346.87/100 000. Meanwhile, the crude mortality rate was 176.97/100 000, and the age-standardized mortality by Chinese standard population and by world standard population were 79.17/100 000, 107.02/100 000, respectively; and the cumulative mortality rate was 12.23% and cut rate was 139.75/100 000. Age-specific incidence among 0-34 years old population remained low; however, the incidence among 35-39 age group increased obviously (116.46/100 000, 954 cases). The incidence among 45-49 age group elevated even more sharply (272.97/100 000, 2388 cases) and finally reached the peak among 80-84 age group (1564.36/100 000, 2272 cases). Age-specific mortality arose among 40-44 age group (48.06/100 000, 424 cases) and reached its peak among 80-84 age group (1392.23/100 000, 2022 cases) as well. The most common types of cancer were lung cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, esophageal cancer, thyroid cancer, pancreatic cancer, cervical cancer and lymphoma, which accounted for 74.37% (22 763/30 613) of all new cancer cases.Lung cancer, liver cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, brain tumors and breast cancer accounted for 87.75% (14 848/16 920) of all cancer deaths.Conclusion:The incidence and mortality of cancer both increased in 2009 according to the statistics from cancer registry in Zhejiang province.Lung cancer, malignant tumor in digestive system and breast cancer were still the key challenges in cancer prevention and control. Meanwhile, the increased incidence of thyroid cancer should also be noticed.
