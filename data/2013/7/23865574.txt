Hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) have been recognized recently as a heterogeneous group, and are subclassified according to genotype as well as morphological characteristics. We report a case of a 35-year-old Japanese woman who exhibited hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1α-inactivated HCA in the background of the congenital absence of the portal vein (CAPV). On a dynamic contrast computed tomography (CT) scan, the hypovascular tumor enlarged from 1 cm to 3 cm and another tumor emerged in the course of 7 years. Because the possibility of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with multiple metastases was not excluded, partial hepatectomy was performed. On a cut section, two well-demarcated tumors were observed and one tumor had a central fibrous scar. The histological features of these tumors were similar to those of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) with a central scar and HCA; however, these tumors were diagnosed as HNF-1α-inactivated HCA by immunohistochemistry according to the criteria of the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification. In non-tumorous liver tissue, an abnormal architecture of the vessels and a vague nodular appearance of lobuli were observed, which were likely to be those of nodular regenerated hyperplasia (NRH). We discuss its pathogenesis and relationship with CAPV.
