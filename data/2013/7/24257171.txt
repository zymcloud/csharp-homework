Objective:To observe the mortality and its changes on liver cancer in the past 30 years as well as to describe the spatial distribution of liver cancer deaths between 2005 and 2010 in Lingbi, Anhui province.Methods:Using the mortality data from 1973-1975 and from 2005 to 2010 in Lingbi to compare with the relative national and historical data, to observe the trend of rapid increase on liver cancer mortality in Lingbi. Using the Poisson model, BYM model and hotspot detection method, standardized mortality ratio(SMR), relative risk(RR)value of liver cancer deaths of each village were calculated and the clustering of high liver cancer deaths was identified.Results:Through an increase of 223.7% on the SMR of liver cancer in the past 30 years, the standardized mortality of liver cancer in Lingbi had an increase of 74.1 percent than the national level in 2005-2010 but it was 22.7% lower than the country level in 1973-1975. The SMR and RR values and their P values were higher in the villages which were located along the Kuisui River. Data from the clustering analysis showed that there had been significantly positive autocorrelation at the altitude of 5300 meters, and a very obvious hot spot of liver cancer deaths existing along the Kuisui River, especially at the bifurcation of the old Sui River and new Sui River was observed.Conclusion:There was an alarming increase of liver cancer mortality in the past 30 years in Lingbi. The high mortality area mainly covered the villages along the Kuisui River, suggesting that there were common risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in the population at risk.
