Background:Five oral nucleos(t)ide analogues are available to treat chronic hepatitis B (CHB). With the availability of newer agents, their efficacy on incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well described.Aim:To determine the efficacy of oral anti-viral agents in reducing HCC risk in relationship with other known factors.Methods:Published studies of at least 20 CHB patients treated with an oral anti-viral agent and followed for >2 years were analysed for incidence of HCC per 100 person years follow-up.Results:Pooled homogeneous data from six studies showed lamivudine (LAM) treatment (n = 3306) to reduce HCC risk by 51% compared with no treatment (n = 3585) (3.3 vs. 9.7 per 100 person years, P 50 years and hepatitis B virus-DNA detectability at HCC diagnosis increased risk of HCC by twofold with a 10-fold higher risk among patients with cirrhosis compared with chronic hepatitis. Meta-regression showed patient age, study location (Eastern vs. Western) and type of study (randomised or not) contributed to heterogeneity.Conclusions:Lamivudine treatment significantly reduces the incidence of HCC compared with no treatment. However, HCC still develops at a rate of 1.3 per 100 patient years in CHB patients receiving an oral anti-viral agent. This finding highlights the need for continued HCC surveillance, particularly in CHB patients with inadequate viral suppression, older age and cirrhosis.
