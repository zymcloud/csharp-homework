PPPDE peptidase domain 1 (PPPDE1) is a recently identified gene; however, its expression regulation and biological function are unclear. Previous studies have indicated that PPPDE1 is involved in embryogenesis, apoptosis induction and cell cycle regulation. In the present study, we first used an anti-PPPDE1 antibody to determine that endogenous PPPDE1 is located in the Golgi apparatus. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of mouse embryos indicated that PPPDE1 was markedly distributed in liver, skin, intestinal villi, and muscles, whereas Western blot analysis of mouse mature organs revealed its ubiquitous expression, without an appreciable distinction in protein abundance. Surprisingly, another potential isoform of PPPDE1 with a molecular weight of 18 kD (rather than its predicted molecular weight of 21 kD) was detected in the mouse kidney, testis, and intestine. Moreover, microarrays that were derived from twelve tumor types revealed that PPPDE1 expression was significantly lower in pancreas, stomach, and skin tumors compared with normal tissue from these organs. We specifically and extensively analyzed PPPDE1 expression in clinical samples and observed strong associations between PPPDE1 expression and (i) differentiation grade in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and (ii) T stage in skin squamous cell carcinoma. Our data are the first to reveal the expression profile of PPPDE1 protein and its implications in cancer. These results will contribute to the understanding of the expression regulation and biological functions of PPPDE1 in development and carcinogenesis.
