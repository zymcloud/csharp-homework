Background:Little is known about the possible influence of demographic and histological risk factors on the survival of patients with esophageal and gastric cancer.Objectives:Based on the available registry and follow-up information, this study compares 1-5 year survival rate of gastric and esophageal cancer.Patients and methods:Through a concurrent (prospective) cohort study, all 366 patients with definite diagnosis of esophageal and gastric cancer who had been hospitalized at the Towhid Hospital, Sanandaj city, Kurdistan province, western Iran during a five-year period from 2006 onwards were recruited. The survival time of patients stratified by this grouping method were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression.Results:Amongst the 366 patients, 23 had esophageal adenocarcinoma, 94 esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma and 239 had gastric adenocarcinoma. Age at diagnosis (P = < 0.001), tumor grade (P = 0.008) and practice treatment (P = < 0.001) had significant associations with the variation of survival rates in patients with esophageal but not with gastric cancer. The five-year survival rates (by year) for esophageal cancer were 49%, 27%, 24%, 22% and 19%, respectively and for gastric cancer were 41%, 17%, 13%, 10% and 5.4%, respectively.Conclusions:Major differences between these cancers were seen in the survival rates of patients and their incidence classified by sex. Age at diagnosis and histological types were prognostic factors for survival of patients with esophageal cancer but this wasn't the case for gastric cancer.
