Objective:In our recent study, we developed a new radiopharmaceutical (Re-188 MN-16ET lipiodol) with encouraging results for the treatment of liver malignancy. In this study, we further evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of this radiopharmaceutical by measuring tumor response and survival times in rats with liver tumors after intra-hepatic arterial injection of Re-188 MN-16ET lipiodol.Methods:Twelve male rats bearing hepatic tumors were divided into three groups. Group 1 received an intra-hepatic arterial injection of 18.5 MBq Re-188 MN-16ET lipiodol; Group 2 received lipiodol and Group 3 received normal saline. Tumor size was measured by liver sonography before injection, at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after injection. Survival time and response rate were calculated.Results:All rats showed good response and survived over 60 days in Group 1 while all rats showed poor response in Group 2 and Group 3 with only 25 % of rats in Group 2 and none (0 %) in Group 3 survived over 60 days. The p value was 0.0067 between Group 1 and Group 3; 0.04 between Group 1 and Group 2; and 0.034 between Group 2 and Group 3.Conclusion:Re-188 MN-16ET lipiodol has good potential for the treatment of hepatoma.
