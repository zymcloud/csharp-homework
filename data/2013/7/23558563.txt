Background:Iron overload is associated with increased severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) including progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma.Aims:To identify potential role(s) of iron in NAFLD, we measured its effects on pathways of oxidative stress and insulin signaling in AML-12 mouse hepatocytes.Methods:Rapid iron overload was induced with 50 Î¼M ferric ammonium citrate and 8-hydroxyquinoline. Insulin response was measured by Western blot of phospho-protein kinase B. Lipid content was determined by staining with Oil Red O. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by flow cytometry using 5-(and 6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. Oxidative stress was measured by Western blots for phospho-jnk and phospho-p38.Results:Iron increased ROS (p Conclusions:An in vitro model of NAFLD progression is described in which iron-induced oxidative stress inhibits insulin signaling. Pathophysiological effects of iron were increased by saturated fat and decreased by curcumin.
