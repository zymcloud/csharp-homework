Goals:To compare hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stage, treatment modality, and survival between groups submitted to different surveillance interval.Background:It is not clear if surveillance interval affects patient survival with HCC.Study:Clinical data from 10,307 patients at risk for HCC were prospectively collected from 1990 to 2005. The characteristics of cancer and 5-year survival in patients diagnosed as HCC during follow-up were compared between surveillance interval of Results:A total of 400 patients were diagnosed with HCC, with a mean tumor size of 3.5 cm and an annual detection rate of 2.4%. The tumor sizes detected in patients with surveillance interval ≤ 6 months were significantly smaller than those detected in patients with interval of >6 months (n=219; 3.0 ± 1.7 cm vs. n=181; 4.0 ± 2.6 cm, P6 months even after considering lead time with assumed tumor doubling time of 60 days. The 5-year survival of HCC patients surveyed between 2000 and 2004 was significantly higher compared with those surveyed between 1990 and 1994 or between 1995 and 1999 (41% vs. 17% and 19%, respectively, PConclusions:Our data show that surveillance ≤ 6 months might be associated with early detection of HCC and improved survival in a hepatitis B endemic area.
