Background:Central bisectionectomy (resection of Couinaud segments IV, V and VIII) for malignant or benign disease poses a technical challenge to the surgeon but if feasible, has significant benefits in terms of conserving liver volume and options for future intervention. This study reviews a cohort of patients who underwent this procedure; outlines the indications, optimal operative technique as well as both short- and long-term outcomes.Methods:A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was performed. Pre-operative clinicopathological data, operative details and post-operative outcomes including overall and disease-free survival were analysed.Results:Between 1989 and 2009, 21 patients underwent a central bisectionectomy. All procedures were performed for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). All patients underwent a R0 resection with a median resection margin of 5 mm (1-15 mm). The 1-, 3- and 5-year disease-free survivals were 65%, 34.8% and 34.8%, and the corresponding overall survival rates were 90.5%, 66.8% and 66.8%, respectively.Conclusion:These data support the use of a central bisectionectomy in selected cases in the management of HCC. With the use of a meticulous operative technique and adherence to surgical oncological principles, satisfactory long-term outcomes were achievable.
