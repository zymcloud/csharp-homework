Data on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in interferon-treated patients with chronic hepatitis C participating in placebo-controlled trials of interferon have been published after 3 to 9 years of follow-up. Among patients with chronic hepatitis C and either fibrosis or cirrhosis, interferon greatly reduced the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma after 8 years or more, especially when viral load was below the limit of detection.
