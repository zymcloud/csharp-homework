Recurrence and metastasis are the main obstacles to improving the survival of patients with post-resective hepato-cellular carcinoma (HCC). Our previous study suggests a critical role of CXCR7 in the metastasis of HCC. In the present study, the effect of CXCR7 as a risk factor for metastasis of HCC was evaluated. Immunohistochemical assay was performed on tissue microarrays based on HCC with extrahepatic metastases after hepatectomy. Two categories based on staining scores were used to evaluate the risk effect of CXCR7, respectively. The effect of CXCR7 on osteopontin (OPN) was explored by RNA interference. Based on the results, in both categories, highly expressed CXCR7 was a dependent risk factor for extrahepatic metastasis because of the potential association with relatively good cell differentiation. Stratification analyses indicated that CXCR7 was a strong independent risk factor (OR, 3.40; 95% CI, 1.07-18.84; P=0.038 in category 1 and OR, 6.40; 95% CI, 1.64-24.92; P=0.007 in category 2, respectively) in patients with Edmondson grade 1/2. Furthermore, CXCR7 correlated well and positively with expression of OPN (P=0.019 and P
