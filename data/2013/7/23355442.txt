Two related sublines derived from murine ascites hepatoma cell lines Hca-F25, which were selected for their markedly different metastatic potential to lymph nodes, were found to be distinct in their ganglioside patterns. The low metastatic cell line (HcaP) contained a major ganglioside GM3, whereas the high metastatic cell line (HcaF) contained a major ganglioside GM2. Suppression of GM3 by P4 enhanced the mobility and migration of the low metastatic HcaP cells in vitro. Increase in GM3 content in high metastatic HcaF cells by addition of exogenous GM3 inhibited the mobility and migration. These results suggested that the differences in lymphatic metastasis potential between these two cell lines could be attributed to the differences in their ganglioside compositions, and GM3 could suppress the motility and migration of these cells. Further, we investigated the mechanism by which GM3 suppressed the cell mobility and migration. The results showed that suppression of GM3 synthesis by P4 in low metastatic HcaP cells promoted PKB/Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308, and phosphorylation of EGFR at the Tyr1173. In contrast, increase in GM3 content in high metastatic HcaF cells by addition of exogenous GM3 into the culture medium suppressed phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and EGFR at the same residues. Taken together, these results suggested that the mechanism of GM3-suppressed cell motility and migration may involve the inhibition of phosphorylation of EGFR and the activity of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
