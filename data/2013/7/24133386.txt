Background:Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a curative therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In RFA, ultrasonography (US) is most commonly used to guide tumor puncture, while its effects are assessed using dynamic computed tomography or magnetic resonance. The differences in modalities used for RFA and assessment of its effects complicate RFA. We developed a method for assessing the effects of RFA on HCC by combining contrast-enhanced (CE) US and real-time virtual sonography with three-dimensional US data.Patients and methods:Before RFA, we performed a sweep scan of the target HCC nodule and the surrounding hepatic parenchyma to generate three-dimensional US data. After RFA, we synchronized multi-planar reconstruction images derived from stored three-dimensional US data with real-time US images on the same US monitor and performed CEUS and real-time virtual sonography. Using a marking function, we drew a sphere marker along the target HCC nodule contour on pre-treatment US- multi-planar reconstruction images so that the automatically synchronized sphere marker represented the original HCC nodule contour on post-treatment real-time CEUS images. Ablation was considered sufficient when an avascular area with a margin of several millimeters in all directions surrounded the sphere marker on CEUS.Results:This method was feasible and useful for assessing therapeutic effects in 13 consecutive patients with HCC who underwent RFA. In 2 patients who underwent multiple sessions of RFA, HCC-nodule portions requiring additional RFA were easily identified on US images.Conclusions:This method using advanced US technologies will facilitate assessment of the effects of RFA on HCC.
