Background:Although the utility of laparoscopic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been recognized in recent years, the impact of the laparoscopic liver resection for HCC with complete liver cirrhosis (F4) is still unknown.Methods:Retrospective analysis of 56 patients who underwent partial hepatectomy for HCC (3 cm or smaller in a diameter) and had complete liver cirrhosis (F4) diagnosed histologically was performed. Of the 56 patients, partial hepatectomy was performed under laparotomy in 28 patients (laparotomy group) or under laparoscopy in 28 patients (laparoscopy group). Perioperative outcome was analyzed in the two groups.Results:There were no significant differences in the results of the preoperative liver function tests and the operation time between the two groups. The intraoperative blood loss was lower in the laparoscopy group than the laparotomy group (p = 0.0003). The incidence of the postoperative complications was significantly higher in the laparotomy group (20/36 patients) than in the laparoscopy group (3/28 patients, p Conclusions:The postoperative morbidity, such as surgical site infection and intractable ascites, decreased by the induction of laparoscopic liver resection in patients with liver cirrhosis. As the results, the necessity of invasive treatment for postoperative complications decreased and the duration of the postoperative stay was shortened.
