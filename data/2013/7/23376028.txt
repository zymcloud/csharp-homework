Background:Involvement of the IVC has traditionally been considered a relative contraindication to resection for advanced tumors of the liver. Combined resection of the liver and IVC for malignancy can be performed safely and results in long-term survival in select patients.Study design:Sixty patients undergoing hepatic and IVC resection by the primary author from 1996 to 2012 were reviewed. Median age was 52 years. Resections were carried out for cholangiocarcinoma (n = 26), hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 16), colorectal metastases (n = 13), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (n = 2), hepatoblastoma (n = 2), and squamous cell carcinoma (n = 1). Resections performed included 27 right and 5 left trisegmentectomies and 25 right and 3 left lobectomies, including the caudate lobe. Ex vivo procedures were performed in 6 patients using veno-venous bypass and the other 54 procedures were performed using varying degrees of vascular isolation. In situ cold perfusion of the liver was used in 8 patients. The IVC was reconstructed using a tube graft (n = 38) primarily (n = 8) or with patches (n = 14).Results:There were 5 perioperative deaths (8%). Three patients died of liver failure, 1 patient died of pulmonary hemorrhage, and 1 patient died of massive pulmonary embolism. Nine patients had evidence of postoperative liver failure that resolved with supportive management. Three patients required temporary dialysis. With a median follow-up of 31 months, 14 patients have died of recurrent malignancy between 22 and 44 months, and an additional 4 patients are alive with disease at 16 to 33 months. Actuarial 1- and 5-year survival rates were 89% and 35%, respectively.Conclusions:Inferior vena cava involvement by malignancy does not obviate liver resection. The procedure's increased risk is balanced by the possible benefits, given the lack of alternative curative approaches.
