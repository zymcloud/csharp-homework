Objective:The purpose of this study was to compare image quality and lesion detectability in the evaluation of hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on low-tube-voltage half-dose liver CT scans subjected to sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) with the quality and detectability on full-dose scans reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP).Materials and methods:A total of 126 patients with suspected HCC who underwent liver CT including arterial phase scanning at 80 kVp in the dual-source mode (300 mAs for each tube) were included in the study. The half-dose arterial scans were reconstructed with FBP, iterative reconstruction in image space (IRIS), and five SAFIRE strengths (S1-S5) and were compared with full-dose virtual scans (600 mA) reconstructed with FBP. We assessed image noise, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the liver and blood vessels, and lesionto-liver CNR. Two radiologists evaluated image quality and lesion detectability attained with the different imaging sets.Results:Image noise on SAFIRE images was significantly lower than that on the other images, and the CNRs on SAFIRE images were higher than those on half-dose FBP images (p 0.05).Conclusion:Performing half-dose 80-kVp liver CT with SAFIRE technique may increase image quality and afford comparable lesion detectability of hypervascular HCC at a reduced radiation dose compared with full-dose CT with FBP.
