PHA665752 (PHA), a selective small molecule c-Met Inhibitor, potently inhibited HGF-stimulated and constitutive c-Met phosphorylation, as well as HGF and c-Met-driven phenotypes of a variety of tumor cells including hepatocellular carcinoma cells. However, these effects were impaired in c-Met-deficient cancer cells. In the present study, we investigated the potential anti-human c-Met-deficient hepatocellular carcinoma effects of Celastrol, a novel triterpene, and its combination with PHA. Human hepatocellular carcinoma cells BEL-7402 (c-Met-positive) and Huh7 (c-Met-deficient) were treated with different dose of PHA with or without equal dose of Celastrol, and cell growth, cell cycle and apoptosis were evaluated, respectively, by MTT assay, flow cytometry and Caspase3/7 activity. Nude mice bearing Huh7 xenografts were used to assess the in vivo anti-tumor activity. Our results showed that Celastrol at high concentration (>1.0 Î¼M) induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis with the activation of Caspase3/7 in Huh7 cells whereas at low concentration (
