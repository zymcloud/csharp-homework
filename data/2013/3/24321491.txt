We have recently reported that astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) might be an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) associated biomarker in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and play an important role in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. To extend our study, we examined here the anti-invasive and metastatic effects of Huaier polysaccharide (HP) on human HCC cell line MHCC97-H and explored its possible mechanism of action. Treatment with HP dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation, adhesion, migration and invasion of MHCC97-H cells in vitro. This was achieved not only by reducing the expression of AEG-1 and N-cadherin, but also by enhancing E-cadherin expression. Therefore, these data suggested that HP can inhibit the growth and metastatic potential of MHCC97-H cells through modulation of the AEG-1/EMT pathway.
