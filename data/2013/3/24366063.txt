Guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein), alpha activating activity polypeptide O (GNAO1) encodes an alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (Gαo), which plays a significant role in the development of various types of cancer, including breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its role in gastric cancer (GC) has not yet been elucidated. In the current study, the expression of Gαo was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 70 patients with GC and its cellular role was examined by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated downregulation. The overexpression of GNAO1 (scores of 2 or 4) was observed in 44 of the 70 patients with GC (62.9%) and the expression of Gαo significantly correlated with the overall survival of the patients with GC after surgery. The median survival rate of patients with a negative or positive expression of Gαo was 61 or 27 months, respectively (P=0.033). The silencing of GNAO1 in GC cells by RNA interference markedly inhibited the proliferation of GC cells and promoted apoptosis by increasing the accumulation of the pro-apoptotic proteins, Puma and Bim, possibly mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). This further confirmed the clinical significance of GNAO1, which was overexpressed in GC tissues. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate that GNAO1 is overexpressed in GC and that its overexpression correlates with poor prognosis, as it promotes GC cell viability.
