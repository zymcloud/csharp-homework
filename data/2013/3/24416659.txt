I read the article "Complete spontaneous regression of Merkel cell carcinoma metastatic to the liver: Did lifestyle modifications and dietary supplements play a role?"(1) with great interest. Merkel cell carcinoma carries a significant rate of recurrence and mortality.(2) Though spontaneous regression of Merkel cell carcinoma has been well documented in the literature,(3) the potential that the pathway of spontaneous regression functions via increased natural killer cell activation, second to ingestion of assorted mushrooms in this case, is promising for future research efforts. The Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) status of this patient is, however, extremely important in progressing the findings of this case report.
