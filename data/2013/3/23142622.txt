Background & aims:Models of non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) reveal features of accelerated ageing, such as impaired regeneration, and an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. The relation between accelerated ageing, disease progression and clinical outcome has not been previously investigated and is the subject of the current study.Methods:Liver sections from 70 patients with NAFLD (105 biopsies) and 60 controls were studied for telomere length, nuclear area, DNA damage and cell cycle phase markers, using quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.Results:Hepatocyte telomeres were shorter in NAFLD than controls (p Conclusions:These findings are consistent with hepatocyte senescence and permanent cell cycle arrest in NAFLD. Hepatocyte senescence correlated closely with fibrosis stage, diabetes mellitus, and clinical outcome. Hepatocyte p21 expression could be used as a prognostic marker and for stratification in clinical studies.
