Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes a chronic infection in 350 million people worldwide and greatly increases the risk of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The majority of chronic HBV carriers live in Asia. HBV can be divided into eight genotypes with unique geographic distributions. Mutations accumulate during chronic infection or in response to external pressure. Because HBV is an RNA-DNA virus the emergence of drug resistance and vaccine escape mutants has become an important clinical and public health concern. Here, we provide an overview of the molecular biology of the HBV life cycle and an evaluation of the changing role of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) at different stages of infection. The impact of viral genotypes and mutations/deletions in the precore, core promoter, preS, and S gene on the establishment of chronic infection, development of fulminant hepatitis and liver cancer is discussed. Because HBV is prone to mutations, the biological properties of drug-resistant and vaccine escape mutants are also explored.
