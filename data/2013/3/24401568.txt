Deficiency in autophagy, a lysosome-dependent cell degradation pathway, has been associated with a variety of diseases especially cancer. Recently, the activation of autophagy by hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein, which is implicated in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), has been identified in hepatic cells. However, the underlying mechanism and the relevance of HBx-activated autophagy to the carcinogenesis caused by HBV remain elusive. Here, by transfection of HBV genomic DNA and HBx in hepatic and hepatoma cells, we showed that HBV- or HBx-induced autophagosome formation was accompanied by unchanged MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) activity and decreased degradation of LC3 and SQSTM1/p62, the typical autophagic cargo proteins. Further functional and morphological analysis indicated that HBx dramatically impaired lysosomal acidification leading to a drop in lysosomal degradative capacity and the accumulation of immature lysosomes possibly through interaction with V-ATPase affecting its lysosome targeting. Moreover, clinical specimen test showed increased SQSTM1 and immature lysosomal hydrolase CTSD (cathepsin D) in human liver tissues with chronic HBV infection and HBV-associated liver cancer. These data suggest that a repressive effect of HBx on lysosomal function is responsible for the inhibition of autophagic degradation, and this may be critical to the development of HBV-associated HCC.
