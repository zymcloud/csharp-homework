Penile carcinomas account for 10% of all the malignancies in men with a predominant regional lymph node involvement, but a distant metastasis of such a carcinoma via the haematogenous route is rare (2.3%), with the common sites being the kidneys, adrenal glands, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, lungs, brain and the dorsal spine. The pattern of the metastatic spread from carcinomas of the penis has been well described in the literature, with the inguinal and the iliac nodes being the commonest sites. The distant metastases are uncommon and delayed, even in advanced disease. Although metastases to the liver and lungs have been reported, the osseous metastases are exceptionally rare. We are presenting a case of carcinoma of the penis which metastasized to the tibia.
