Background:Epidemiological and experimental carcinogenesis studies provide evidence that components of garlic (Allium sativum) have anticancer activity. Hepatocellular carcinoma is highly malignant and metastatic. Currently, there is no effective chemotherapy for patients with advanced Hepatocellular carcinoma leading to an urgent need to seek for novel therapeutic options.Aim:To investigate the effect of cell growth, cell apoptosis of Garlic-Derived Compound S-Allylmercaptocysteine (SAMC) on Human Gastric Cancer Cells Line SGC 7901 cells.Materials and methods:The SGC 7901 cells were cultured with different concentration's SAMC. Cell viability was detected by AO/EB staining. JNK and P38 pathway were assayed by PCR (polymerase chain reaction).Results:The best concentration of SAMC (300 ÂµM) for induction SGC 7901 apoptosis was confirmed through cell viability. The PCR assay demonstrated that JNK and P38 pathway play important role in apoptosis of SGC 7901 cells.Conclusions:This study indicated that SAMC can inhibit cell proliferation and induct apoptosis of SGC 7901 cells via JNK and P38 pathway.
