Background:A significant number of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma present as locally advanced disease. Optimal treatment remains controversial. We sought to analyze the clinical course of locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (LAPC) in order to identify potential distinct clinical phenotypes.Methods:Patients (pts) diagnosed with LAPC who survived >2 months were identified from institutional databases. Clinical details were collected. Sequential re-staging scans were reviewed. Progression-free survival (PFS), time from progression to death (TTD), and overall survival (OS) were estimated with Kaplan-Meier method and compared with log-rank test.Results:Between 2005 and 2011, 40 pts were identified. Median age was 66 yrs (range, 43-74) and 60 % (n=24) were male. All pts received chemotherapy. Median OS was 11.3 months. Twenty patients (50 %) had local progression only (LP) and 16 (40 %) had metastatic progression (MP) at first documentation of progression, while four patients (10 %) had stable disease. PFS was 4.0 vs 5.6 months (hazard ratio (HR) 0.97; 95 % CI 0.49-1.93, p=0.94) for LP and MP, respectively. Three of the patients with LP (15 %) eventually developed metastatic disease after a median of 4.2 months (3.7-9.6). For MP patients, five had concurrent local progression. Sites of disease were lung (eight), peritoneum (five), liver (three), and bone (one). TTD for LP and MP was 5.6 vs 1.4 months (HR 0.62; 95 % CI 0.28-1.39, p=0.24) and OS was 13.2 vs 8.0 months (HR 0.59; 95 % CI 0.28-1.25, p=0.017), respectively.Conclusions:We identified two subgroups of LAPC with distinctive behavior, one local dominant progression with low predilection for metastases and another with rapid metastatic development and worse survival. Early recognition of these phenotypes might allow a more tailored treatment approach to improve outcome.
