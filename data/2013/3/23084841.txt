LIM and SH3 protein 1 (LASP-1) plays a significant role in the formation of several malignant tumours. However, the biological and clinical significances of LASP-1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely unknown. Using immunohistochemistry, we analysed LASP-1 expression in 144 clinicopathologically characterised HCC cases. Using gene and transfection and RNA interference, we investigated the effects of LASP-1 overexpression and depletion on tumour cellular behaviour in vitro. LASP-1 expression was detected in not only cytoplasm and but also nucleus of HCC and liver cells. The positive rates of both cytosolic and nuclear LASP-1 expression in HCC were higher than adjacent non-tumourous tissues. Statistical analysis showed that heterogeneous LASP-1 expression is associated with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level of HCC patients. A significant trend was identified between cytosolic LASP-1 overexpression in HCC and worsening clinical prognosis. Multivariate survival analysis showed that cytosolic LASP-1 expression was recognised as an independent prognostic factor of patient's survival. In vitro study showed LASP-1 promoted cell proliferation and migration, and resulted in aggressive phenotypes of cancer cells. LASP-1 is a valuable marker of HCC progression. High cytosolic LASP-1 expression is associated with poor overall survival in HCC patients.
