Background and aims:To compare the tumor control and safety of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for small, solitary, and hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with TACE alone.Methods:Three hundred and sixty-five HCC patients who had solitary, â‰¤ 3 cm, and hypervascular nodule were treated with TACE. Among them, 30 patients followed by SBRT (SBRT group) and 38 patients without additional therapy and previous HCC treatment (control group) were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. Local tumor progression, complication, and disease-free survival were compared between these groups.Results:There was no difference in clinical background between these groups. Complete response to therapy was noted in 29 (96.3%) patients of the SBRT group, and in only one (3.3%) patient of the TACE group (P Conclusion:The results indicated that SBRT combined with TACE is a safe and effective modality for locoregional treatment of small solitary primary HCC, and could be potentially a suitable option.
