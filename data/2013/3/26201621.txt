Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma is the third leading cause of cancer death. Single or multiple mutations in genes related to growth control, apoptosis, invasion and metastasis have been determined; so a better understanding of the molecular genetic basis of malignant transformation, tumor progression and host interaction has led to significant progress in the development of new therapeutic agents. The ability of adenovirus vectors to deliver and express genes at high yields in HCC treatment has been demonstrated and well documented over the last few years.Objective:To overview and provide an update of what has been accomplished in the field of adenoviral gene therapy and its application in hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.Methods:Original articles were searched using Pubmed and other medical databases to get the most representative and actual information to establish the current state of the investigation of Ad vectors in HCC.Results:Good results have been accomplished in preclinical models using new Ad vectors and especially AAV vectors, it is important to motivate further clinical trials to corroborate all the experience obtained.Conclusions:Ad and AAV must be considered as an opportunity to improve the quality of life and survival of HCC patients.
