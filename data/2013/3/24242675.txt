Background:Two-stage hepatectomy (TSH) has been adopted as a treatment modality for resection of advanced colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). This study analyzed the recurrence pattern, salvage rate, and survival after TSH combined with systemic and regional chemotherapy.Methods:A retrospective review of a prospective database identified patients who underwent a TSH for CRLM was performed and outcome data analyzed.Results:From September 2000 to May 2009, a total of 40 patients were eligible for TSH, and 88 % completed both resections. Of the 35 resected patients, the median number of tumors was 8, with 38 % having a tumor >5 cm and 35 % having a carcinoembryonic antigen value >200 ng/ml. All patients received systemic chemotherapy, and 86 % received regional therapy with hepatic artery infusion. Median follow-up for survivors was 40 months; median disease-specific survival was 52 months, and 5-year disease-specific survival was 49 %. The combined rate of major complication for all procedures was 45 % with no operative deaths. Median recurrence-free survival was 11 months with a 3-year probability of recurrence of 81 %. Disease recurrence occurred in 27 patients (77 %), with the liver (42 %) and lung (37 %) being the most common sites. Sixteen of these patients (60 %) underwent salvage therapy via either surgery and/or ablation, 7 (44 %) of whom were free of disease at a median follow-up of 54 months.Conclusions:TSH combined with systemic and hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy is an effective treatment strategy for selected patients with advanced CRLM. These patients are at considerable risk of local and distant recurrence; however, the majority can be salvaged, and long-term survival can be achieved.
