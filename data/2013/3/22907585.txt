To gain insight into the role of peptidylarginine deiminase type 4 (PADI4), we determined the relationship between PADI4 mRNA and global hypomethylation during HBV exposure in hepatocarcinogenesis. We analyzed Line-1 methylation by MSP, and CD133 mRNA by real-time PCR in 74 HCC. The HCC cancer lines (7721, Huh7, and Hep-G2) were treated with 5-Aza-CdR and TSA. PADI4 mRNA were lower in HCC tissues (Mean(-∆Ct) = 1.41) than that in Non-Hcc tissues (Mean(-∆Ct) = 3.10). Expression of PADI4 was elevated in only 20 (27 %) of the 74 HCC patients but decreased in 54 (73 %) of the patients. The declined PADI4 mRNA was significantly associated with Line-1 demethylation in HCC patients. PADI4 mRNA were lower in HCC patients with Line-1 ∆MI = -0.15 (Mean(-∆∆Ct) = -1.02). The results suggested that HCC showing hypomethylation of Line-1 is considered to be silencing PADI4 mRNA. And the lower PADI4 mRNA was also found in HCC patients with HBV >= 10(5) (copy/ml) than those with HBV
