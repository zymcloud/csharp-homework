Objective:To explore the expression of microRNA-155 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its contribution to recurrence and prognosis of HCC after liver transplantation (LT).Methods:The expression levels of microRNA-155 in 100 HCC samples were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional regression analyses were utilized to determine the association of microRNA-155 expression with patient survivals.Results:The expression levels of microRNA-155 were higher in primary HCC patients with post-LT recurrence (n = 45, mean relative level = 14.94) than those with non-recurrence (n = 55, mean relative level = 4.70) (P = 0.001) and correlated with micro-vascular invasion of HCC tissue samples (P = 0.001). The patients with a higher expression of microRNA-155 had significantly worse recurrence-free survival (RFS: (21.5 Â± 3.2) months, log rank P Conclusion:MicroRNA-155 is over-expressed in primary HCC with tumor recurrence and may serve as a novel biomarker for tumor recurrence and survival of HCC patients after LT. The detection of microRNA-155 is of clinical significance in HCC.
