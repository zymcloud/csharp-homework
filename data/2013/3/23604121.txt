Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5 (ACP5), which is essential for bone resorption and osteoclast differentiation, promotes cell motility through the modulation of focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation. However, whether ACP5 contributes to the metastasis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. In this paper, a complementary DNA microarray, serial deletion, site-directed mutagenesis and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that ACP5 is a direct transcriptional target of Forkhead box M1 (FoxM1). ACP5 expression was markedly higher in HCC tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues. ACP5 overexpression was correlated with microvascular invasion, poor differentiation and higher tumor-node-metastasis stage. HCC patients with positive ACP5 expression had poorer prognoses than those with negative ACP5 expression. A multivariate analysis revealed that ACP5 expression was an independent and significant risk factor for disease recurrence and reduced-patient survival following curative resection. Transwell assays and an orthotopic metastatic model showed that the upregulation of ACP5 promoted HCC invasion and lung metastasis, whereas ACP5 knockdown inhibited these processes. The knockdown of ACP5 significantly attenuated FoxM1-enhanced invasion and lung metastasis. Immunohistochemistry revealed that ACP5 expression was positively correlated with FoxM1 expression in human HCC tissues, and their coexpression was associated with poor prognoses. In summary, ACP5 is a direct transcriptional and functional target of FoxM1. This novel FoxM1/ACP5 signaling pathway promotes HCC metastasis and may be a candidate biomarker for prognosis and a target for new therapies.
