Purpose:To investigate the safety and efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization using doxorubicin drug-eluting beads (DEBs) in patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) C stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Consecutive patients with initial staging of BCLC C HCC who received DEB transarterial chemoembolization over the last 5 years were studied. The study included 121 patients (mean age, 61.2 years old). Adverse events (AEs) after DEB transarterial chemoembolization were studied in detail and were recorded as per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 criteria. Survivals were analyzed according to parameters from the time of first DEB transarterial chemoembolization. Kaplan-Meier method by log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard model were used for survival analysis.Results:AEs occurred in 30.2% of patients. No AEs were greater than Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade III. Grade I and II AEs included nausea and vomiting in 7.8% of patients and abdominal pain in 23.8% of patients. Grade III AEs were noted in 1.06% of patients. There were no gastrointestinal or hepatic complications. There were no deaths within 30 days after DEB transarterial chemoembolization. The overall median survival was 13.5 months. Among the Child-Pugh class A patients, those without PVT and metastasis (28.9%) had better survival when treated with DEB transarterial chemoembolization than those with PVT and metastases (9.9%) (18.8 mo versus 4.4 mo, P = .001). Ascites, performance status, Okuda stage HCC, serum alpha fetoprotein levels, and etiologic factor for chronic liver disease predicted survival.Conclusions:DEB transarterial chemoembolization appears to be a safe and effective treatment option for patients with BCLC C HCC. Patients with Child-Pugh class A without PVT and metastasis benefited most from DEB transarterial chemoembolization.
