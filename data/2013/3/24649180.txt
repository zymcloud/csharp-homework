Tryptase is a serin protease stored in mast cell granules that has recently been found to be involved in tumor angiogenesis. Data from experimental tumor models have suggested that prior to the onset of angiogenesis mast cells were accumulated near tumor cells and were required for the macroscopic expansion and metastatic spread of primary tumor cells. Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is a well-established, highly angiogenesis-dependent hypervascular tumor. The aim of this preliminary study was to assess tryptase serum levels in 30 HCC patients prior and subsequent to hepatic transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). In this study, patients with intermediate stage (B) HCC, according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging classification, were enrolled. Additional patient features were adequate liver functional reserve and A or B status, according to the Child-Pugh classification. Tryptase levels were measured using the UniCAP-Tryptase fluoroimmunoassay. TACE was performed by loading doxorubicin on microspheres. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) tryptase level pre-TACE was 7.74±3.62 μg/l, and post-TACE 4.67±2.79 μg/l. A statistically significant difference (P
