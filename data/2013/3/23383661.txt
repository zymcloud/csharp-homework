The effects of genomic changes in hepatitis B virus (HBV) on the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still unclear, especially in relation to the genotype of HBV. In this study, we examined the effects of genomic changes in HBV of genotype C2 on the development of HCC. A total of 318 patients with HBV-associated HCC and 234 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) were studied. All of HCC cases were diagnosed histologically and treated with surgical resection. The whole of the X, S, basal core promoter (BCP) and precore regions of the viral genome from sera or liver tissues were sequenced. All subjects had HBV of genotype C2. The prevalence of the T1653 mutation in the X region and the A1896 mutation in the precore region of HBV was significantly higher in the HCC group than in the control CHB group (22% vs 11%, P = 0.003; 50% vs 23%, P
