Vasohibin 1, an endothelium-derived negative feedback regulator of angiogenesis, is induced by fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). In this study, we retrospectively evaluated immunoreactivity of FGF-2 and VEGF-A as well as microvessel density (MVD) determined by expression of vasohibin 1 and CD34 (MVD-CD34) and correlated the findings with clinical outcomes of 181 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Double immunostaining of an endothelial marker CD34 and vasohibin 1 with Ki-67 was also performed to assess angiogenic activity of endothelial cells in HCC. The ratio of Ki-67-positive endothelial cells in vasohibin 1-positive vessels (22%) was significantly higher than that of CD34-positive vessels (9%, P 0.459) (survival, 48% versus 38% and 52% versus 35%; P
