Signaling events triggered by interferon alpha (IFN-α) and ribavirin are involved in anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) action. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway plays an important role in HCV pathogenesis. Effects of IFN-α and ribavirin on p38 MAPK signaling were investigated in human hepatoma cells. Type I IFN receptor 2 (IFNAR2) mediated IFN-α-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Also, p38 MAPK phosphorylation was enhanced by ribavirin. Treatment for 48 h with a combination of IFN-α and ribavirin increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation, whereas the treatment for 72 h reduced p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc) infection dramatically increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation and such phosphorylation was inhibited by IFN-α or ribavirin. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p38 MAPK resulted in enhancement of ribavirin-dependent HCV RNA replication. These results suggest that regulation of p38 MAPK signaling by IFN-α and ribavirin might contribute to anti-HCV action.
