Cooperation or interaction of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing molecule-3 (Tim-3) molecules is more relevant than either molecule alone to immune dysfunction in chronic viral infection and cancers. This study simultaneously investigated polymorphisms at PD1 +8669 and TIM3 -1516 loci in 845 hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronically infected patients [151 asymptomatic carriers, 202 chronic hepatitis, 221 cirrhosis and 271 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)], 141 HBV infection resolvers and 318 healthy controls. Multivariate analysis showed that, in addition to gender, age, ALT, albumin and HBV DNA, PD1 +8669 genotype AA was associated with cirrhosis compared with patients without cirrhosis (OR, 2.410; P=0.001). TIM3 -1516 genotypes GT+TT, together with gender, age, ALT, AST, direct bilirubin, albumin and HBeAg status, were associated with HCC compared with cirrhosis patients without HCC (OR, 2.142; P=0.011). The combined carriage of PD1 +8669 AA/TIM3 -1516 GT or TT was higher in cirrhosis and HCC pooled patients than in patients without cirrhosis (OR, 2.326; P=0.020) and in HCC patients than in cirrhosis patients (OR, 2.232; P=0.013). These data suggest that PD1 and TIM3 polymorphisms may differentially and interactively predispose cirrhosis and HCC in chronic HBV infection.
