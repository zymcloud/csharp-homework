Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for treatment of splenic tumors has rarely been reported. Here we describe our experiences of undergoing RFA in three patients with solitary metastatic (n=2) and benign (n=1) tumors of the spleen. Two patients also had underlying cirrhotic hypersplenism. A 53-year-old male with solitary splenic metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma underwent laparoscopical RFA of the splenic tumor. Another 61-year-old female with intraabdominal recurrence, focal splenic metastasis from colon cancer and cirrhotic hypersplenism underwent cytoreductive surgery and RFA of splenic tumors. On the third patient, a 32-year-old man with severe hypersplenism, splenic artery steal syndrome and a solitary splenic hemangioma, a laparoscopical RFA of the splenic tumor was performed. The three patients recovered uneventfully. The concurrent hypersplenism of the latter two patients improved significantly. The results indicate that RFA of splenic tumors is feasible and safe, and could be evaluated as an alternative to splenectomy in selected patients with solitary splenic tumors.
