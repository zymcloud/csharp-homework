Background:It remains unclear whether primary colorectal cancer and synchronous liver metastases (SLMs) should be resected simultaneously or with a staged procedure.Methods:We reviewed the short-term outcomes of 127 patients who underwent simultaneous resection of primary colorectal cancer and SLM at our institution from January 1993 to December 2011.Results:The proportion of simultaneous resections was 84.7% (127 of 150 patients). There was no postoperative mortality, and the postoperative complication rate was 61.4%. Major complications occurred in 23 (18.2%) patients, and anastomotic failure occurred in 2 (1.6%). The 3-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival rates were 74%, 64%, and 52%, respectively. The median recurrence-free survival period was 7.0 months (95% confidence interval, 4.5-9.5 months) and the 5-year recurrence-free survival rate was 17%.Conclusion:Simultaneous resection can be performed safely in patients with colorectal cancer and SLM.
