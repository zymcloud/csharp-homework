Background:Breast cancer (BC) is a major worldwide health care problem that mostly afflicts the elderly population in the more developed countries. It is not known how common is breast cancer among elderly Egyptian patients and whether this differs from the disease in younger patients.Aims:To study the clinico-pathological features of BC in elderly Egyptian patients (â©¾65years of age) among the population of an Egyptian Governorate, Gharbiah, and to compare these features with those of younger patients (<65years).Methods:This is a cross sectional study that compares elderly BC (EBC) and the non-elderly BC (NEBC) using the information from the Gharbiah Population-based Cancer registry (GPCR) during the years 1999-2007.Results:Out of 6078 BCs, 12% were EBCs and 88% were NEBCs. Between 1999 and 2007, the crude incidence rate (CIR, per 100,000 populations) of EBC increased from 47 to 71 and that of NEBC increased from 16 to 17. Compared to NEBC patients, EBC patients were more likely to have a positive family history and present with a distant disease and less likely to present with a localized disease. EBCs were more likely to have lung metastases and less likely to have liver metastases. Histology, grade, hormone and HER-2 receptor statuses were comparable in both groups. Apart from hormonal therapies, the elderly were less likely to receive surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy.Conclusion:EBC patients in Egypt present with advanced disease and are less likely to receive surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy compared to NEBC patients.
