In gadoxetic acidâ€“enhanced liver magnetic resonance imaging(MRI), it is known that the pseudoglandular type of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may demonstrate high signal intensity on 20-minutes delayed imaging unlike the microtrabecular counterpart. Herein we report a case of HCC which consisted of mixed components of hypo- and hyper-intensity in the hepatobiliary phase of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI, focusing on its imaging findings and pathologic features.
