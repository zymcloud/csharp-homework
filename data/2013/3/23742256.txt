Aim:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has no successful pharmacotherapeutic remedy. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether ginkgolide B (GB)-loaded polymeric nanocapsules can prevent diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC in rats.Materials & methods:GB was fabricated in two types of nanocapsules of which one was polyethylene glycol coated (N1GB) and the other was uncoated (N2GB). These nanocapsules were orally gavaged during DEN-induced HCC development in rats.Results:Nanocapsulation of GB enabled aqueous suspension and slow time-dependent release of the compound. Anticarcinogenic potential of N2GB was reflected by its ability in the management of DEN-induced reactive oxygen species generation, mitochondrial dysfunction, p53, NF-ÎºB, inducible nitric oxide synthase, COX-2 and VEGF expressions, and induction of apoptosis in cancer cells in the rat liver.Conclusion:Positive zeta-potential on N2GB surface might have offered higher hepatic accumulation of GB, especially at the electron-dense organelle mitochondria. Mitochondria protection against DEN-induced oxidative damage ensured HCC prevention.
