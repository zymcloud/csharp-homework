Objective:To investigate the regulatory effect of erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor (EphA2) on the expression of VEGF protein, a pro-angiogenic factor, via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) signaling pathway in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck(SCCHN) in vitro.Methods:SCCHN Tu686 cells were transfected with EphA2 overexpression vector pEGFP-N1-EphA2. Western blot was used to detect the expression of p38 MAPK and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied to assay of VEGF. SB203580 as a inhibitor of p38 MAPK signaling pathway was used.Results:The expression of VEGF protein was significantly up-regulated in Tu686 cells transfected with EphA2 overexpression vector (535.31 ± 45.71) pg/ml, when compared with Tu686 cells transfected with empty vector (400.99 ± 33.50) pg/ml and Tu686 cells with no transfection (385.30 ± 33.50) pg/ml (F = 17.091, P Conclusion:EphA2 can regulate the expression of VEGF protein and stimulate p38 MAPK signaling pathway.
