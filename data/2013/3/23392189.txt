Objective:To explore the potential of quantitative analysis of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in differentiating focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:34 cases of FNH and 66 cases of HCC (all lesions Results:The sensitivity and specificity of CEUS for diagnosis of FNH were 67.6% and 93.9%, respectively. For quantitative analysis, IMAX and RS in FNHs were significantly higher than those in HCCs (pConclusion:The quantitative features of CEUS in FNH and HCC were significantly different, and they could further differentiate FNH from HCC following conventional CEUS.Advances in knowledge:Our findings suggest that quantitative analysis of CEUS can improve the accuracy of differentiating FNH from HCC.
