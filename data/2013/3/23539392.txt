Background:Endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus neurolysis (EUS-CPN) represents an alternative approach to pain palliation in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.Aim:to evaluate the safety and initial efficacy of EUS-CPN in patients with painful unresectable pancreatic cancer.Methods:Patients with inoperable body-tail pancreatic adenocarcinoma without prior chemotherapy and pain requiring opioid analgesia were included prospectively in this cohort study in a tertiary medical center. Central EUS-CPN was performed and the brief pain inventory and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy measurement were applied before and 2 weeks after the procedure.Results:Thirty-two patients underwent the procedure in one session without complications. Follow-up revealed overall pain relief in 24 patients (75%) and significant improvement in pain scores. Ratings of pain interfering with general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others, and sleep improved significantly. Physical, functional, and emotional well-being improved significantly, except for acceptance of illness and enjoyment of life.Conclusion:Central EUS-CPN was an efficient and safe method for palliative pain management in our patients with inoperable pancreatic body-tail adenocarcinoma. The pain alleviation improved the patients' functional status, sleep, and quality of life, although other variables could also be involved, but acceptance of the illness and enjoyment of life did not change after treatment.
