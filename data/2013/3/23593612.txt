Background/aims:The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between serum CRP levels and the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:HCC patients who underwent the first session of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) between January 2005 and December 2009 (n=211) were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups: high C-reactive protein (CRP; ≥1 mg/dL, n=51) and low CRP (Results:There were significant differences between the two groups in regard to tumor type, tumor-progression-free survival, 10-month mortality, white blood cell (WBC) count, tumor size, and TNM stage. Multivariate analysis revealed that a high serum CRP level was independently associated with tumor size and tumor type. Subgroup analysis of CRP groups according to tumor size demonstrated that a high serum level of CRP was significantly associated with poorly defined (diffuse) tumor type in the tumor size Conclusions:A high serum CRP level is associated with large tumors and a poorly defined tumor type, and is significantly associated with 10-month mortality in patients with large HCC (size ≥5 cm) who undergo TACE.
