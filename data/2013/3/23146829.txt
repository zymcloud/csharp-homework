The aim of the present study was to identify basic amino acid in the core region in subtype 1b-infected, treatment-naive patients from Morocco and to search for their eventual association with liver cancer. The survey included 151 patients (86 patients with chronic hepatitis and 65 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC). We performed direct sequencing, and compared the data obtained with the consensus sequence of core protein. Several recurrent amino acid substitutions were observed. The Arg70 was changed for a Gln in 22 of 112 patients (19.6%) and Leu91 was changed to Met in 23 of 112 patients (20.5%). Besides, the threonine at position 75 (Thr75) was mutated for alanine or serine in 43 (38.4%) and 40 (35.7%) of the patients, respectively. Overall, there was no significant difference between patients with chronic hepatitis and those with HCC regarding amino acids substitution number (24% vs. 33%, respectively, P = 0.457). Our study provides the first inventory of predominant amino acid substitutions in the HCV core region genotype 1b. The impact of single or combined mutations on the resistance to treatment or on disease progression is still unknown and deserves more attention in the future.
