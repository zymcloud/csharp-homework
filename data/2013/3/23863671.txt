Objective:To explore the expression and pathological features of insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) in tissues and sera of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and the siRNA-mediated inhibition of IGF-II mRNA transcription in human HepG2 cells.Methods:From December 2009 to August 2010, the self-control HCC, paracancerous and distal cancerous tissues were collected to analyze the expression of IGF-II. The serum levels of IGF-II expression were detected for pathological features. IGF-II expression in HepG2 cells was intervened by siRNA. IGF-II mRNA or IGF-II level and analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time PCR or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). And the ratio of cell apoptosis was analyzed by EdU/Hoechst33342.Results:The levels of IGF-II expression in HCC tissues at mRNA (100%, 30/30) or protein (83.3%, 25/30) were significantly higher (P Conclusion:The expression of IGF-II is closely associated with the progression of HCC. And the intervening of its transcription may promote apoptosis and sensitize to adriamycin.
