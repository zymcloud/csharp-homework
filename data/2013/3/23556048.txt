Hepatic adenoma (HA) is a rare indication for liver transplantation (LTx). So far 20 cases of LTx for HA are reported in PubMed. In rare cases HA presents as multiple hepatic adenomas or recurrent adenoma after initial liver resection and in such cases LTx is the only potential cure and prevents the risk of bleeding or cancer transformation into hepatocellular carcinoma. We report the case of a 56 years old lady who underwent a left hepatectomy for giant adenoma in 2005 and resection of segment V-VI for recurrence of liver adenoma in 2007. She developed a second recurrence of HA with 3 new lesions in the right liver in 2008. The patient underwent LTx. After 3 years the patient is alive with no evidence of disease. LTx is indicated in patients with HA in which resection is not technically feasible.
