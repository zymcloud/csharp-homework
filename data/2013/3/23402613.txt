Background & aims:Aberration of miR-129-2 has been linked to a variety of human tumours. However, whether miR-129-2 is involved in hepatocarcinogenesis remains unknown. Here, we investigate the involvement of miR-129-2 in HBV infection-related HCC.Methods:A total of 75 paired tumour and their corresponding non-tumour liver tissues from HCC patients with serum HBsAg positive were collected. The methylation of miR-129-2 gene was quantitatively analysed by a DNA methylation-sensitive endonuclease digestion followed by quantitative PCR. The expression of mature miR-129-2 (miR-129-3p) was detected by Taqman RT-PCR. SOX4 expression was detected using quantitative realtime RT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemical staining. The function of miR-129-2 was investigated using cell proliferation and clonogenicity assays in vitro.Results:Compared with the adjacent non-tumour tissues, tumour tissues exhibited significantly increased miR-129-2 hypermethylation both in frequency (37.33% vs. 8%, P Conclusion:The current data indicated that methylation-mediated repression of miR-129-2 may enhance oncogenic SOX4 expression and involve in HCC tumorigenesis.
