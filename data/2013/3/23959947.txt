Previously, a pilot genome-wide association study has identified candidate single nucleotide polymorphism predictors for the therapeutic response of 5-fluorouracil, mitoxantrone and cisplatin (FMP) combination chemotherapy in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we conducted a prospective confirmatory study to examine the predictive value of rs9679162 (located on GALNT14 gene) for the therapeutic responses using a split-dose FMP protocol. One hundred and seven advanced HCC patients receiving split-dose FMP therapy were enrolled. All patients were in Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer Stage C with either main portal vein thrombosis and/or distant metastasis. Of them, 105 (98.1%) were Child-Pugh classification B. GALNT14 genotype was determined before therapy. Of the patients included, 28 were rs9679162 "TT" and 79 were "non-TT" ("GG" + "GT") genotype. The median overall survival, time-to-progression, response rate and disease control rate were ("TT" versus "non-TT") 6.8 versus 3.9 months (p
