RNA-binding factor 1 (AUF1) was found to be up-regulated in numerous tumors compared with untransformed tissues. Furthermore, it has been identified to regulate mRNAs en masse in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Metadherin (MTDH) as a novel oncogene also promotes tumor progression and metastasis in HCC. Our study aimed to investigate the correlation between AUF1 and MTDH expressions by immunochemistry in 146 HCC patients from Heilongjiang region. AUF1 expression in HCC tumors was higher than that in the matched normal liver tissues. Particularly, AUF1 overexpression was closely associated with tumor size (P
