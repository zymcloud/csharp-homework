Introduction:Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are among the few cancers amenable to successful treatment by targeted molecular therapy with KIT receptor inhibitors like imatinib mesylate. Increasing incidence of this tumor and its successful treatment has given rise to issues of fertility and child bearing in patients affected at young age. Although contraception advice and termination of early pregnancy have been the standard practice in patients on such therapy, an occasional patient who desires pregnancy can leave both obstetrician and oncologist perplexed.Clinical presentation:We report our experience in a rare patient of metastatic GIST who had a successful normal pregnancy while on imatinib therapy. We further attempt to evaluate similar evidence in literature.
