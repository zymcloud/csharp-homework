Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes acute, enterically transmitted hepatitis in human. It is associated with large epidemics in tropical and subtropical regions where it is endemic or with sporadic cases in non-endemic regions. Unlike other hepatitis viruses, HEV has several animal reservoirs. Phylogenetic studies on HEV human and animal sequences, and the identification of cases of direct transmission from animal to human strongly suggest that HEV is a zoonotic agent. The lack of efficient cell culture models limits studies on molecular and cellular aspects of HEV infection and species barrier crossing. The present study reports on the development of two new in vitro models of HEV replication using a human hepatoma-derived cell line, HepaRG, and a porcine embryonic stem cell-derived cell line, PICM-19. These two cell lines have morphological and functional properties similar to primary hepatocytes. These in vitro culture systems support HEV replication and release of encapsidated RNA. These new models represent a powerful tool for studying the viral replication cycle, species barrier crossing and virulence factors.
