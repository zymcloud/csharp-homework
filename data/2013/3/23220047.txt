Transmembrane 4 L six family member 5 (TM4SF5) enhances cell migration and invasion, although how TM4SF5 mechanistically mediates these effects remains unknown. In the study, during efforts to understand TM4SF5-mediated signal transduction, TM4SF5 was shown to bind c-Src and thus hepatoma cell lines expressing TM4SF5 were analyzed for the significance of the interaction in cell invasion. The C-terminus of TM4SF5 bound both inactive c-Src that might be sequestered to certain cellular areas and active c-Src that might form invasive protrusions. Wildtype (WT) TM4SF5 expression enhanced migration and invasive protrusion formation in a c-Src-dependent manner, compared with TM4SF5-null control hepatoma cell lines. However, tailless TM4SF5(ΔC) cells were more efficient than WT TM4SF5 cells, suggesting a negative regulatory role by the C-terminus. TM4SF5 WT- or TM4SF5(ΔC)-mediated formation of invasive protrusions was dependent or independent on serum or epidermal growth factor treatment, respectively, although they both were dependent on c-Src. The c-Src activity of TM4SF5 WT- or TM4SF5(ΔC)-expressing cells correlated with enhanced Tyr845 phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor. Y845F EGFR mutation abolished the TM4SF5-mediated invasive protrusions, but not c-Src phosphorylation. Our findings demonstrate that TM4SF5 modulates c-Src activity during TM4SF5-mediated invasion through a TM4SF5/c-Src/EGFR signaling pathway, differentially along the leading protrusive edges of an invasive cancer cell.
