Objective:This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of using radiofrequency ablation combined with transarterial chemoembolization to treat hepatocellular carcinoma in a subcapsular location, given the increased risk of complications when using radiofrequency ablation alone.Materials and methods:From January 2000 to December 2011, 1213 patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (up to three nodules) were screened. Of these, 132 patients with 132 subcapsular nodules (mean size, 3.0 cm; range, 1.2-5.0 cm) were enrolled in the study. After transarterial chemoembolization, percutaneous radiofrequency ablation was performed under ultrasound or C-arm cone-beam computed tomography guidance, on the same day or within 3 days. Local recurrence and survival curves were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:Technical success of treatment was achieved in 130 patients (98.5%). Major complications, including pleural effusion, secondary peritonitis, and liver abscess, occurred in 3 patients (2.3%); the incidence of complications was associated with the number of needle insertions (1-2 vs. 3-4, P=0.039, Fisher's exact test). No patients developed permanent sequelae, tumor seeding, or tumor bleeding. The 3-year local recurrence rate was 9.7%. Local recurrence was associated with the pretreatment serum des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin level (≤200 mAU/mL vs. >200 mAU/mL, P=0.019, log-rank test). The 3-, 5-, and 7-year overall survival rates in treatment-naïve cases (n=82) were 79.3%, 60.6%, and 50.9%, respectively.Conclusion:Combination therapy using radiofrequency ablation and transarterial chemoembolization was a safe and useful therapeutic option for patients with subcapsular hepatocellular carcinoma.
