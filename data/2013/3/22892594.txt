Background/purpose:The indications for hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with total bilirubin (T-Bil) equal to or higher than 1.2 mg/dl remain controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety of hepatic resection for HCC patients who showed high T-Bil (≥1.2 mg/dl) with low direct bilirubin (D-Bil ≤ 0.5 mg/dl).Methods:Thirty-four HCC patients showing high T-Bil with low D-Bil were treated with mono- to tri-segmentectomy between January 2000 and December 2010. The perioperative clinical parameters and prognosis of the high T-Bil/low D-Bil patients were compared with those of 253 HCC patients showing normal T-Bil. In addition, complication rates of the patients with high T-Bil/high D-Bil (n = 4) were analyzed.Results:The prothrombin time activity, indocyanine green clearance test, asialo-scintigraphy, and platelet count were similar in the two groups. The mean serum albumin in high T-Bil/low D-Bil patients was significantly higher than that of normal T-Bil patients (4.2 ± 0.5 vs. 4.0 ± 0.4 g/dl, P = 0.004). There were no significant differences in operation time, intraoperative bleeding, red cell concentrate transfusion rate, postoperative complication rate, and disease-free and overall survivals between the two groups. Postoperative hyperbilirubinemia (T-Bil >5 mg/dl) with ascites was observed in one of four high T-Bil/high D-Bil patients (25 %).Conclusions:Mono- to tri-segmentectomy can be performed in patients with low D-Bil (≤0.5 mg/dl) similarly to patients with low T-Bil (
