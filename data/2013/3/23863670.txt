Objective:To explore the clinical value of miRNA-29b expression and the combined detection of serum miRNA-29b and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the diagnosis of primary hepatic carcinoma(PHC).Methods:From January 2007 to May 2010, the serum levels of miRNA-29b and AFP from 96 healthy controls and 87 PHC patients were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) respectively. The relationship of miRNA-29b and various clinical parameters was analyzed.Results:Serum levels of miRNA-29b in PHC pre-operative group (0.250 (0.124 - 0.381)) significantly decreased versus the control group [0.860 (0.587 - 1.338)] and the post-operative group (0.890 (0.637 - 1.414)) (P Conclusion:The combined detection of miRNA-29b and AFP aids the diagnosis of PHC and the prediction of its prognosis.
