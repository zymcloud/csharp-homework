Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease that refers to the presence of hepatic steatosis without significant intake of alcohol. NAFLD is an asymptomatic disease that can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The most common cause of mortality in patients with NAFLD or NASH is cardiovascular disease (CVD). Currently, the treatment of NAFLD focuses on gradual weight loss and life style modifications. However, multifactorial treatment of NAFLD or NASH risk factors may be needed to reduce the likelihood of these patients developing CVD. This review discusses the mechanisms that link hyperlipidemia and NAFLD. In addition, the review focuses on the safety and efficacy of statins in patients with NAFLD or NASH, and their effect on the extent of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis based on human studies.
