Aim:To investigate the influence of percutaneous local therapy on gastric myoelectrical activity in patients with hepatocellular carcinomas.Methods:Forty-four patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [27 males and 17 females, ranging in age from 49 to 81 years old (69.7 ± 8.01 years)] who were admitted for percutaneous local therapy were enrolled in this study. We examined clinical abdominal symptoms using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) before and 3 d after percutaneous local therapy. We also measured cutaneous fasting and postprandial electrogastrography (EGG) recordings before and 3 d after percutaneous local therapy.Results:We found that the percentage of normogastria in the fasting period was lower in the Child B group than in the Child A group (66.8% ± 8.6% vs 84.0% ± 3.8%). After percutaneous local therapy for HCC, the percentages of normogastria in the fasting period were significantly decreased (81.6% ± 3.5% vs 75.2% ± 4.5%). None of the postprandial EGG parameters changed significantly after percutaneous local therapy for HCC. Percutaneous local therapy for HCC reduced the power ratio (PR). In particular, the PR of tachygastria was significantly decreased after therapy (P Conclusion:Gastric slow-wave dysrhythmias were induced by percutaneous local therapy in HCC patients, even though the GSRS scores obtained from the questionnaire did not change significantly.
