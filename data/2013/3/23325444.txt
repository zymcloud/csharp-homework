Although the role of Kr√ºppel-like factor 17 (KLF17) in regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been explored in breast cancer, its influence on primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the expression status of KLF17 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the correlation between KLF17 expression and metastatic potential of HCC. KLF17 expression in HCC and adjacent liver tissues was studied by real-time PCR and Western blot, and the relationship between KLF17 expression and the clinicopathological features of HCC was evaluated in 60 patients. By using RNA interference technique, the correlation of KLF17 expression and metastatic potential was investigated by down-regulating KLF17 expression in HepG2 cells, and the effects of KLF17 down-regulation on cell migration, and invasion were then analyzed. Furthermore, the correlation between KLF17 expression and the surgical outcomes of a cohort of HCC patients was analyzed. Reduced expression of KLF17 is associated with a short survival time in clinical patients (P = 0.034). Low KLF17 expression is related to tumor T stage (P = 0.045), tumor size (P = 0.027), lymph node stage (P = 0.030), M stage (P = 0.048), and portal vein tumor thrombosis significantly in HCC. Reduced expression of KLF17 promoted motility and invasion ability of HepG2 cells and changed the expression of E-cadherin, ZO-1, Snai1, and vimentin (genes are associated with EMT). Overall, these findings suggest a repressing role of KLF17 in tumor invasion and a new prognostic indicator in directing therapy. It deserves further exploration.
