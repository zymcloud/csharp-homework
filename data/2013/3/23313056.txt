Background:Metabolomics has been proposed to be a hallmark of cancer, yet a systematic characterization of a metabolite and metabolic pathways in human hepatocarcinoma (HCC) remains a challenge.Methods:Using ultra-performance liquid-chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight coupled with high-definition mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-HDMS) in conjunction with multivariate data analysis methods, we identified and measured the metabolite profile of glycocholic acid from urine samples obtained from patients with HCC diseases. Bioinformatic tools were used to construct the metabolite network that can identify a key role for glycocholic acid in HCC.Results:Biochemical analyses revealed that glycocholic acid expression was up-regulated in urine samples associated with HCC. Its pathway analysis suggested the modulation of multiple vital physiological pathways, including primary bile acid biosynthesis, secondary bile acid biosynthesis, metabolic pathways, and bile secretion. The network generation clearly enhances the interpretation and understanding of mechanisms for glycocholic acid.Conclusions:Metabolomics can contribute to evaluating the potential of metabolites in HCC patients and may provide new insight into pathophysiologic mechanisms.
