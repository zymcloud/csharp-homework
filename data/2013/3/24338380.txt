This study aimed to develop novel galactosylated cholesterol modified-glycol chitosan (Gal-CHGC) micelles for targeting delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) in live cancer cells. Three kinds of Gal-CHGC conjugates were synthesized and characterized. The mean particle size and critical aggregation concentration of these polymeric micelles increased with the increase of galactose substitution degree. The DOX-loaded micelles were prepared by an o/w method. The mean diameters of DOX-loaded galactosylated micelles were in the range of 387-497 nm. DOX released from drug-loaded micelles displayed a biphasic way. Cellular uptake studies demonstrated that DOX-loaded galactosylated micelles could enhance the uptake of DOX into HepG2 cells. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of DOX-loaded galactosylated micelles against HepG2 cells significantly improved in contrast with free DOX and DOX-loaded micelles without galactosylation. These results suggested that Gal-CHGC micelles could be a potential carrier for hepatoma-targeting drug delivery.
