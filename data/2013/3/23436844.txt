Objective:The purpose of this article is to assess whether unenhanced and gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI with dynamic and hepatobiliary phase may predict the diagnosis of dysplastic nodules in patients with liver cirrhosis.Materials and methods:We retrospectively analyzed 75 cirrhotic patients (47 men and 28 women; mean [± SD] age, 55 ± 12 years) with 82 hepatocellular nodules, including histology-proven dysplastic nodules (n = 25; diameter, 1-3 cm) and hepatocellular carcinomas (n = 57; diameter, 2-3 cm) scanned by MRI before and after gadobenate dimeglumine injection during hepatic arterial phase (HAP), portal venous phase (PVP), equilibrium phase, and hepatobiliary phase. Nodule T1 and T2 intensities before contrast agent injection and nodule HAP, PVP, equilibrium phase, and hepatobiliary phase intensities were compared with the adjacent liver. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess how the nodule could predict dysplastic nodule diagnosis.Results:Some imaging findings were independent predictors of dysplastic nodule diagnosis-namely, nodule T2 isohypointensity (odds ratio [OR], 12.28; 95% CI, 3.88-38.82), T1 isohyperintensity (OR, 26.74; 95% CI, 7.53-94.90), HAP isohypointensity (OR, 97.16; 95% CI, 20.06-470.49), PVP-equilibrium phase isohyperintensity (OR, 20.53; 95% CI, 5.36-78.62), and hepatobiliary phase isohyperintensity (OR, 119.6; 95% CI, 21.59-662.40). Nodule T2 and HAP isohypointensity (OR 31.47; 95% CI, 7.88-125.58), nodule T2 isohypointensity and hepatobiliary phase isohyperintensity (OR, 28.77; 95% CI, 7.79-106.19), nodule T1 isohyperintensity and HAP isohypointensity (OR, 17.22; 95% CI, 4.85-61.14), and nodule T1 and hepatobiliary phase isohyperintensity (OR, 19.39; 95% CI, 5.38-69.90) were also predictors of dysplastic nodule diagnosis.Conclusion:The combination of nodule appearance on T2-weighted MRI and nodule enhancement after gadobenate dimeglumine injection may predict dysplastic nodule diagnosis in patients with liver cirrhosis.
