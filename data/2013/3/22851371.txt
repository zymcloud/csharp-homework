Background:Retroperitoneal fibrosis is a rare and obvious condition in the abdominopelvic cavity. Signet ring cell carcinoma of the stomach with gross appearance of linitis plastica is another rare association.Case presentation:We present a rare case of a 49-year-old woman presenting with persistent nausea and vomiting for 20 days. Three months ago, she was admitted with severe flank pain and was referred to the urology service. She was placed with stents for strictures in both ureters. She underwent endoscopy for heartburn, melena, dyspepsia, and weight loss (7 kg/5 month), which revealed congestion of the mucosa of the fundus and body with fine linear erosion and decreased distensibility of the stomach suggesting linitis plastica. A biopsy indicated full-thickness infiltration by signet ring cell gastric cancer. A CT scan showed evidence of retroperitoneal fibrosis with large lymph nodes around the aorta.Conclusion:This paper shows that the gastric linitis plastica can present with many deceptive clinical presentations, raising the risk of postponed diagnosis.
