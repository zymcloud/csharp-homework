Objective:To assess the risk factors for spontaneous rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma (SRHC).Methods:A retrospective analysis of 34 consecutive patients with SRHC treated by emergency interventional embolization in our hospital from July 2003 to July 2011 was conducted. General condition, laboratory examination and imaging data were analyzed, and compared with the data of 34 patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma but without rupture, randomly selected from 215 concurrent patients. The patients with SRHC were selected for risk factor analysis, and the non-SRHC patients were taken as control group.Results:No significant difference between the SRHC group and control group was found in age, sex, Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) grade, Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) stage, HBsAg, HBsAb, HBeAg, HBeAb, HBcAb, prothrombin time (PT), thrombin time (TT), international normalized ratio (INR), glucose (GLU), cirrhosis, portal tumor thrombus, the maximum diameter of tumor, location, and cholecystitis or cholelithiasis. The univariate analysis showed that activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), lower or normal plasma fibrinogen (FIB) level, alpha fetoprotein (AFP), tumor protrusion > 1 cm above the liver surface were all associated with increased risk of SRHC (P 1 cm above the liver surface (P = 0.041) were significant independent risk factors for SRHC.Conclusion:Lower or normal level of FIB and tumor protrusion > 1 cm above the liver surface are significant independent risk factors for spontaneous rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma.
