Modern radiology offers countless opportunities both in the detection but also in the characterization of primary liver malignancies. Ultrasound remains usually the first exploratory overview study whereat using ultrasound contrast agent for a further characterization of liver lesions improves this technique considerably. Advanced cross-sectional imaging methods can, in most cases, already provide an exact diagnosis. Thus, the CT is already considered a standard technique for liver imaging and magnetic resonance imaging has gained in recent years due to liver-specific contrast agents and faster sequences a central role in liver imaging. The following article provides an overview of these various radiological procedures and describes the different primary liver malignancies and their imaging characteristics.
