In the present study, in order to investigate the anticancer effects of O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) on human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells, we first examined the antiproliferative effect of O-DMA. When Hep3B cells were treated with O-DMA at various concentrations (5-200 ÂµM) for 24, 48 or 72 h, cell proliferation decreased significantly in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, O-DMA exposure at the IC50 concentration for 72 h arrested cells at the G2/M phase, which was accompanied by a reduction in CDK1, and an increase in cyclin A and B. Under the same conditions, O-DMA significantly increased the number of sub-G1 phase cells. Additionally, an Annexin V assay revealed that exposure to O-DMA affected the rate of cell apoptosis. O-DMA caused the downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax, which led to cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and activation of caspase-3. Taken together, these data suggest that O-DMA exhibits anticancer activity by arresting the cell cycle at G2/M phase and causing mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis in Hep3B cells.
