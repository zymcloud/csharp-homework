Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide with high prevalence and lethality. However, the underlying mechanism for HCC has not been entirely elucidated. Recent studies have highlighted the roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in carcinogenesis, and it is suggested that they might play critical roles in HCC progression. Here, we will briefly introduce the biology of lncRNAs, emphasizing the mechanisms and emerging roles of HCC-related lncRNAs. To date, HCC-related lncRNAs are demonstrated to influence the life cycle of genes by various means including epigenetic silencing, splicing regulation, lncRNA-miRNA interaction, lncRNA-protein interaction and genetic variation. Moreover, they can participate in diverse biological processes involved in HCC progression through impacts upon cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and metastasis and angiogenesis. Since lncRNA can present in body fluid and have good specificity and accessibility, some HCC-related lncRNAs are suggested to be useful as novel potential biomarkers for HCC diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of response to therapy. Those HCC-related lncRNAs may provide potential novel therapeutic targets for HCC and other diseases.
