We used a database of 4139 Taiwanese HCC patients to take a new approach (Network Phenotyping Strategy) to HCC subset identification. Individual parameters for liver function tests, complete blood count, portal vein thrombosis, AFP levels and clinical demographics of age, gender, hepatitis or alcohol consumption, were considered within the whole context of complete relationships, being networked with all other parameter levels in the entire cohort. We identified 4 multi-parameter patterns for one tumor phenotype of patients and a separate 5 multi-parameter patterns to characterize another tumor phenotype of patterns. The 2 subgroups were quite different in their clinical profiles. The means of the tumor mass distributions in these phenotype subgroups were significantly different, one being associated with larger (L) and the other with smaller (S) tumor masses. These significant differences were seen systematically throughout the tumor mass distributions. Essential and common clinical components of L-phenotype patterns included simultaneously high blood levels of AFP and platelets plus presence of portal vein thrombosis. S included higher levels of liver inflammatory parameters. The 2 different parameter patterns of L and S subgroups suggest different mechanisms; L, possibly involving tumor-driven processes and S more associated with liver inflammatory processes.
