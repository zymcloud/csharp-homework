Background:Long-term outcomes of partial liver resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain satisfactory due to high incidences of recurrence. This study was intended to see whether preoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) reduces postoperative tumor recurrences and prolongs survival of patients with resectable HCC.Methods:A computerized literature search was performed to identify relevant articles. The quality of nonrandomized comparative studies (NRCTs) was assessed using the methodological index for nonrandomized studies (MINORS). Data synthesis was performed using Review Manager 5.0 software.Results:Twenty-one studies (4 randomized controlled trials and 17 NRCTs) with a total of 3,210 participants were suitable for analysis. There was no significant difference in disease-free and overall survival at 5-year (32.1% vs. 30.0% and 40.2% vs. 45.2%), and intra- and extra-hepatic recurrence (51.2% vs.53.6% and 12.9% vs.10.3%) between patients with and without preoperative TACE. Postoperative morbidity (28.9% vs. 26.8%) and in-hospital mortality (4.1% vs. 3.1%) were also similar between the two groups.Conclusions:Preoperative TACE does not seem to improve prognosis and therefore it is prudent to recommend it as a preoperative routine procedure for resectable HCC.
