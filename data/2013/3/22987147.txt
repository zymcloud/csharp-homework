Introduction:Radical resection to achieve R0 status remains the only potential curative option in patients with gall bladder cancer (GBC). This study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an extended criterion of radical resection to achieve R0 status in GBC.Methods:A triple-phase CT with 3D reconstruction was done in all patients. A standard resectability criterion was followed in all patients. A minimum of liver segment 4B + 5 resection and radical lymphadenectomy including the para-aortic areas were undertaken in all patients. Adjacent organectomy was added as required.Results:Between November 2008 and April 2011, 59 patients with GBC underwent operation and 40 (resectability, 68 %) underwent resection. The resectional procedures performed were segmentectomy 4B + 5 in 31 (78 %), median sectorectomy in 2 (5 %), extended right hepatectomy in 3 (8 %), and hepatopancreaticoduodenectomy in 4 (10 %) patients. Postoperative complications occurred in 24 (60 %) patients. Two patients died postoperatively. A total of 829 lymph nodes were harvested and the median lymph node count was 18 (4-77). Twenty-three (58 %) patients had lymph node metastases. Twenty-eight of 40 (70 %) had disease limited till N1 nodes. Metastases up to N2 lymph nodes were seen in 12 (30 %). American Joint Committee on Cancer seventh edition stages were I-2 (5 %) patients, II-5 (13 %), III-19 (48 %), and IV-14 (35 %). R0 resection was achieved in 33 (83 %) patients. Four patients had recurrence and one died of recurrence. All other patients are alive till the last follow-up.Conclusions:Assessment with triple-phase CT with 3D reconstruction can produce high resectability rate in GBC. Extended criterion of radical resection results in R0 status in more than 80 % of patients with GBC.
