The multidrug resistance 1 gene (MDR1) is an important candidate gene for influencing susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The objective of the present study was to evaluate the association of MDR1 polymorphisms with the risk of HCC in the Chinese Han population. A total of 353 HCC patients and 335 healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), created restriction site-PCR (CRS-PCR) and DNA sequencing methods were used to identify MDR1 gene polymorphisms. Two allelic variants (c.335T>C and c.3073A>C) were detected. The CC genotype of the c.335T>C polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of developing HCC compared to the TT genotype (OR = 2.161, 95%CI = 1.350-3.459, χ2 = 10.55, P = 0.0011). The risk of HCC was significantly higher for the CC genotype in the c.3073A>C polymorphism compared to the AA genotype in the studied populations (CC vs AA: OR = 2.575, 95%CI = 1.646-4.028, χ2 = 17.64, P C and c.3073A>C variants may contribute to the risk of HCC (C vs T of c.335T>C: OR = 1.512, 95%CI = 1.208-1.893, χ2 = 13.07, P = 0.0003, and C vs A of c.3073A>C: OR = 1.646, 95%CI = 1.322-2.049, χ2 = 20.03, P C and c.3073A>C polymorphisms of the MDR1 gene were associated with the risk of occurrence of HCC in the Chinese Han population. Further investigations are needed to confirm these results in larger different populations.
