Aim:The aim of this study is to explore the underlying molecular mechanism of curcumin-induced apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Huh7 cells.Main methods:Fas and FasL mRNA expression was analyzed by reverse transcription PCR. Western blot was applied to detect the protein expression of Bcl-2 family members, MAPK family members, c-Jun, c-Fos, ATF-2, caspase-3, PARP, TNF receptor family members and the respective ligands. Apoptotic cells were assayed with annexin V/PI double staining and flow cytometry.Key findings:Curcumin treatment resulted in a fast and significant increase of Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) along with activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP in Huh7 cells. Inhibition of caspase-3 activity by the specific inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK rescued Huh7 cells from curcumin-induced apoptosis. Neutralization of FasL significantly protected the cells from curcumin-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, p38 was rapidly activated in response to curcumin, and inactivation of p38 by pharmacologic inhibitor SB203580 dramatically suppressed curcumin-induced FasL expression and apoptosis.Significance:Our results demonstrated that curcumin induces apoptosis through p38-denpendent up-regulation of FasL in Huh7 cells.
