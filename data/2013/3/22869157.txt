Background:The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs738409 in patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) is associated with hepatic fat accumulation and disease progression in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease (ALD). This study was conducted to determine whether PNPLA3 rs738409 SNPs affect development and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with various liver diseases.Methods:We enrolled 638 consecutive Japanese patients newly diagnosed with HCC between 2001 and 2010: 72 patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV), 462 with hepatitis C virus (HCV), and 104 with non-B non-C (NBNC).Results:NBNC patients exhibited large tumors of advanced TNM stages at HCC diagnosis, and had significantly poorer prognosis than HBV or HCV patients (P Conclusions:The G/G genotype of PNPLA3 rs738409 SNP was more frequently distributed, and associated with BMI and fibrosis among NBNC-HCC patients but not among HBV or HCV patients. These genotypes might affect HCC prognosis in ALD patients, but not in HBV, HCV, or NAFLD patients.
