Background:Recurrence of hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative resection is the leading factor influencing the prognosis of the disease. Therefore, further improvement of long-term survival may depend on the prevention and treatment of the recurrent tumor. The aim of this research was to investigate the role of antiviral therapy and postoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in the prevention and treatment of hepatitis B-related HCC recurrence.Methods:One hundred and twenty patients who underwent curative resection of hepatitis B-related HCC between January 2005 and June 2008 at our hospital were enrolled. Patients were divided into four groups according to the post-operative adjuvant therapy they received, i.e., control, antiviral therapy group, TACE group, and combined group. The disease-free survival (DFS) and the 12-, 24-, 36-month cumulative recurrence rates were studied.Results:There was no significant difference between isolated postoperative antiviral therapy group and control in terms of disease-free survival (P = 0.283), while it was significantly higher in the TACE group compared to control (P = 0.019). In all patients, however, viral prophylactic therapy combined with/without TACE brought a favorable result compared to those only with/without TACE (P Conclusions:Post-operative TACE prevents early recurrence while antiviral therapy prevents late recurrence of HCC. Combination of antiviral therapy and TACE are suggested for prevention in HCC patients with high risk of recurrence.
