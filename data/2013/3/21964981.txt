Gallbladder cancer is an aggressive cancer with extremely poor prognosis. Over 90% of patients are diagnosed at an advanced, inoperable stage with metastasis and invasion to other organs. In this study, the expression of metadherin (MTDH) and erythropoietin-producing hepatoma-amplified sequence (Eph) receptor A7 (EphA7) in 96 benign and 108 malignant lesions of gallbladder was determined by immunohistochemistry, and their correlations with pathological features and prognosis were analyzed. Positive expression of EphA7 and MTDH was significantly higher in gallbladder adenocarcinoma than in benign lesions. In adenocarcinoma, the positive expression of EphA7 and MTDH was significantly associated with differentiation, tumor mass, lymphnode metastasis, invasion, and overall survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that positive expression of EphA7 and MTDH was an independent poor-prognostic predictor in gallbladder adenocarcinoma. The elevated expression of EphA7 and/or MTDH is closely related to carcinogenesis, progression, clinical biological behaviors, and prognosis of gallbladder adenocarcinoma.
