Background:To evaluate the surgical outcome of patients with huge solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, ≥10 cm in diameter) without major vascular invasion.Methods:We retrospectively studied 177 patients with huge HCC (≥10 cm in diameter) who underwent hepatectomy from 1990 to 2008. Surgical outcomes and clinicopathological characteristics were compared among 54 patients with solitary HCC without a major portal vein tumor thrombus (MPVT), 53 patients with multiple HCCs without MPVT, and 70 patients who have HCC with MPVT.Results:The mean tumor size and indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min showed no significant difference among patients groups. The overall 5-year survival rate was significantly higher in patients with solitary HCC (79%) than in patients with multiple HCCs (31%, P Conclusions:Patients with solitary HCC without MPVT show a favorable surgical outcome even for tumor size ≥10 cm in diameter.
