Aim:To examine the effect of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) therapy for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with sorafenib.Methods:Seventy-eight subjects with unresectable HCC with a serum level of albumin of 3.5 g/dL or less treated with sorafenib were evaluated. They were classified into two groups: those receiving BCAA granules (n = 34; BCAA group) or a regular diet (n = 44; control group). We compared overall survival and administration period of sorafenib, and analyzed absolute changes in serum levels of albumin during sorafenib therapy in 41 patients who continued sorafenib therapy for 1 month or more with a follow up of more than 3 months.Results:Median survival time (MST) in BCAA and control groups was 350 and 143 days (P = 0.007), respectively. Median administration period of sorafenib in the two groups was 59 and 41 days (P = 0.018). In the 41 patients described above, at 1 month, there was no significant change in the serum level of albumin between the two groups, but at 3 months, the difference in the absolute change in the serum level of albumin in the two groups reached significance (P = 0.023). In these subgroup analyses, the administration period of sorafenib as well as the MST in the BCAA group were significantly longer than those in the control group (P = 0.020 and = 0.004).Conclusion:BCAA treatment during sorafenib therapy in HCC patients is useful for maintaining hepatic functional reserve, which may help to avoid early discontinuance of sorafenib therapy and improve survival.
