Objective:To explore the efficacy and safety of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus sorafenib in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with different types of portal vein tumor thrombosis.Methods:A total of 32 patients of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with tumor thrombosis in portal vein were retrospectively analyzed. All of them took oral sorafenib after TACE. They were divided into 3 groups according to imaging examinations of tumor thrombosis in portal vein. Tumor thrombosis in main portal vein was group A, tumor thrombosis in right/left portal branch group B and tumor thrombosis in the second branch of portal vein group C. Tumor response rate, disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS) and time to tumor progression (TTP) was followed up. Liver functions were compared with the pre-treatment level. The occurrences of adverse events were recorded.Results:DCR was 20.0% (Group A), 70.0% (Group B) and 91.7 % (Group C) at 2 months post-treatment. DCR in groups B and C had significant differences with group A (P Conclusion:The combined use of TACE and sorafenib is both safe and efficacious in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with tumor thrombosis in portal vein. And it may prolong OS and TTP in hepatocellular carcinoma with tumor thrombosis in right/left portal vein and second branch of portal vein.
