Estimation of functional liver reserve in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is of paramount importance to properly select candidates for surgical resection. Together with the value of bilirubin, the presence/absence of ascites and esophageal varices, and the rate of residual liver volume, which are our current parameters to measure functional liver reserve, we sought to investigate the value of preoperative cholinesterases (CHE) in predicting postoperative outcome after hepatic resection for HCC. We reviewed the records of 279 consecutive patients who underwent hepatic resection for HCC in our Unit between 2001 and 2011. The value of preoperative CHE was analyzed against the occurrence of postoperative events. Receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis was used to identify cut-off values of CHE that predicted adverse outcomes. Univariate and multivariate analyses on clinically relevant variables, which included the MELD score among others, were performed. P
