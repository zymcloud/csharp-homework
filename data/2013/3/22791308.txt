Objective:The adverse effects of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are well recognized. Fuzheng-Yiliu granule (FYG) is capable of enhancing the immune function and suppressing tumor growth. In the present study, the authors evaluated if FYG could synergize with low-dose 5-FU in inhibiting tumor growth.Methods:Hepatoma 22 (H22) tumor-bearing mice were treated with FYG (18 g/kg, ig), 5-FU (10 mg/kg, ip), or 5-FU plus FYG for 5 days. The relative tumor proliferation rates, tumor weight and apoptosis of tumor tissue were measured. White blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte (LY) were counted. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a) in the serum were measured.Results:FYG alone had antitumor effect. Combination of 5-FU and FYG produced a more potent antitumor effect and caused more marked apoptosis in tumor tissue (compared with vehicle, P < 0.01; compared with 5-FU or FYG, P < 0.05). Mice treated with 5-FU plus FYG had higher thymus index (P < 0.05) compared with the vehicle group. The numbers of both WBC and LY were decreased by 5-FU (compared with vehicle, P < 0.01), which was significantly reversed after FYG was administered (5-FU + FYG vs 5-FU, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05). Mice receiving FYG alone or FYG plus 5-FU had higher serum levels of TNF-a (P <0.01) compared with the vehicle.Conclusions:Traditional Chinese medical herbs capable of strengthening the body's vital energy have great potential to be used as an adjuvant therapy for cancer patients who cannot tolerate the adverse effects of chemotherapy.
