This study was designed to explore the role of versican in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ectopic expression of the versican 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) was studied as a competitive endogenous RNA for regulating miRNA functions. We used this approach to modulate the expression of versican and its related proteins in 3'-UTR transgenic mice and in the liver cancer cell line HepG2, stably transfected with the 3'-UTR or a control vector. We demonstrated that transgenic mice expressing the versican 3'-UTR developed HCC and increased expression of versican isoforms V0 and V1. HepG2 cells transfected with versican 3'-UTR displayed increased proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, colony formation, and enhanced endothelial cell growth, but decreased apoptosis. We found that versican 3'-UTR could bind to miRNAs miR-133a, miR-199a*, miR-144, and miR-431 and also interacted with CD34 and fibronectin. As a consequence, expression of versican, CD34, and fibronectin was up-regulated by ectopic transfection of the versican 3'-UTR, which was confirmed in HepG2 cells and in transgenic mice as compared with wild-type controls. Transfection with siRNAs targeting the versican 3'-UTR abolished the effects of the 3'-UTR. Taken together, these results demonstrate that versican V0 and V1 isoforms play important roles in HCC development and that versican mRNAs compete with endogenous RNAs in regulating miRNA functions.
