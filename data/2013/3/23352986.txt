All-trans retinoic acid (atRA) is the active form of vitamin A, known to activate retinoid receptors, especially the heterodimer retinoid X receptor (RXR):retinoic acid receptor (RAR) that otherwise may play a role in regulation of some drug transporters. The present study was designed to characterize the nature of human hepatic transporters that may be targeted by atRA and the heterodimer RXR:RAR. Exposure of human hepatoma HepaRG cells and primary human hepatocytes to 5 μM atRA down-regulated mRNA levels of various sinusoidal solute carrier (SLC) influx transporters, including organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 2B1, OATP1B1, organic cation transporter (OCT) 1 and organic anion transporter (OAT) 2, and induced those of the canalicular breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). The retinoid concomitantly reduced protein expression of OATP2B1 and OATP1B1 and activity of OATPs and OCT1 and induced BCRP protein expression in HepaRG cells. Some transporters such as OATP1B3 and the bile salt export pump (BSEP) were however down-regulated by atRA in primary human hepatocytes, but induced in HepaRG cells, thus pointing out discrepancies between these two liver cell models in terms of detoxifying protein regulation. atRA-mediated repressions of OATP2B1, OATP1B1, OAT2 and OCT1 mRNA expression were finally shown to be counteracted by knocking-down expression of RARα and RXRα through siRNA transfection in HepaRG cells. atRA thus differentially regulated human hepatic drug transporters, mainly in a RXR:RAR-dependent manner, therefore establishing retinoids and retinoid receptors as modulators of liver drug transporter expression.
