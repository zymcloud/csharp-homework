Though two-dimensional systems have yielded some success in deriving morphological and functional markers of hepatocyte culture, they largely fail to capture the three-dimensional organization, long-term viability, and functionality of the hepatic tissue. We have engineered a system for inducing self-assembly of model H35 rat hepatoma spheroids using a copolymer comprised of biocompatible elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) chemically conjugated to positively charged polyethyleneimine (PEI). We have achieved a conjugation ratio of 30 mol %, though our studies analyzing spheroid organization kinetics indicate conjugate ratios of 5 mol % and greater to be optimal for cell culture based on least variability in spheroid sizes and minimum incidence of overgrown aggregates. Furthermore, our ELP-PEI system indicated the potential for influencing ultimate spheroid dimensions, with spheroid size inversely related to polyelectrolyte conjugation. Overall, this study provides a good starting point to investigate functional correlations between spheroid size and functional markers and their future use as an in vitro diagnostic or tissue engineering tool.
