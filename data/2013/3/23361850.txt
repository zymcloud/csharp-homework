Since the introduction of abdominal ultrasound liver lesions have been increasingly detected. Being usually diagnosed by chance these lesions create psychological stress among patients because a potential malignant disease has to be taken into consideration. The increasing use of oral contraceptives with high estrogen doses starting in the 1980s led to a rising incidence of adenomas, whose natural history differed from those described in surgical and autoptic studies. This fact brought about a change towards a modern pathophysiologic and prognostic differentiation. Current histologic and molecular biological techniques are able to distinguish benign adenomas from those with malignant potential.
