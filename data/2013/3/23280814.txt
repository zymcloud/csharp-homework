The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of complete tumor encapsulation as visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with a solitary large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) beyond the Milan criteria for liver transplantation (LT). Between December 2000 and March 2011, 57 patients who had a solitary HCC exceeding 5 cm in diameter at the time of initial MRI before any treatment were identified. MRI images of the patients were independently reviewed by 2 experienced readers for the presence of complete tumoral encapsulation. The medical records of the patients were reviewed for an outcome analysis. Thirty of the 57 patients had completely encapsulated HCC according to MRI. There was excellent interobserver agreement between the 2 readers for the assessment of complete encapsulation (Îº=0.86). Overall survival was significantly longer for patients with completely encapsulated HCC versus patients with incompletely or nonencapsulated tumors (P
