Purpose:The association of a single nucleotide polymorphism of interleukin (IL)-10RB codon 47 with the chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been reported in two ethnic populations with different results, but not in a Korean population. IL-10RB is a subunit of receptor complexes for interferon-lambda (IFN-λ) and IL-22, which have antiviral and hepatocyte-protective activity, respectively. This study examined the association of IL-10RB K47E with the outcomes of HBV infection in Korean subjects and the cellular response to these cytokines.Methods:Genotypes of IL-10RB and the outcomes of HBV infection were analyzed in 1,000 Korean patients. The effect of IFN-λ or IL-22 on HBV replication and cell viability was assessed in hepatoma cells expressing IL-10RB K47 or E47. The transcript level of IL-10RB was examined in Epstein Barr virus-transformed B cells and hepatoma cells.Results:IL-10RB K47E was associated with chronic HBV infection but not with hepatoma in the Korean population. IL-10RB K47E was associated with the transcript level of IL-10RB in transformed B cells but not with the responses in hepatoma cells to IFN-λ or IL-22. HBV replication or 5-fluorouracil-induced cell death was suppressed by treatment of IFN-λ or IL-22 in an IL-10RB K47E-independent manner.Conclusions:IL-10RB K47E is related to chronic HBV infection in a Korean population, but not to cellular responsiveness to IFN-λ and IL-22.
