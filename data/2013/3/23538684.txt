Aim:To assess effects of heme on messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) profiles of liver cells derived from humans.Methods:We exposed human hepatoma cell line Huh-7 cells to excess iron protoporphyrin (heme) (10 μmol/L) or induced heme deficiency by addition of 4, 6-dioxoheptanoic acid (500 μmol/L), a potent inhibitor of aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, for 6 h or 24 h. We harvested total RNA from the cells and performed both mRNA and miRNA array analyses, with use of Affymetrix chips, reagents, and instruments (human genome U133 plus 2.0 and miRNA 2.0 arrays). We assessed changes and their significance and interrelationships with Target Scan, Pathway Studios, and Ingenuity software.Results:Changes in mRNA levels were most numerous and striking at 6 h after heme treatment but were similar and still numerous at 24 h. After 6 h of heme exposure, the increase in heme oxygenase 1 gene expression was 60-fold by mRNA and 88-fold by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We found striking changes, especially up-regulation by heme of nuclear erythroid-2 related factor-mediated oxidative stress responses, protein ubiquitination, glucocorticoid signaling, P53 signaling, and changes in RNAs that regulate intermediary metabolism. Fewer mRNAs were down-regulated by heme, and the fold decreases were less exuberant than were the increases. Notable decreases after 24 h of heme exposure were patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (-6.5-fold), neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (-1.93-fold), and protoporphyrinogen oxidase (-1.7-fold).Conclusion:Heme excess exhibits several toxic effects on liver and kidney, which deserve study in humans and in animal models of the human porphyrias or other disorders.
