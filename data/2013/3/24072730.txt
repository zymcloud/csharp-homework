Purpose:To investigate p53 and hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) expression and their association with clinicopathological features of Ewing family tumour (EFT).Experimental design:A total of 108 cases of EFT were retrospectively analysed. p53 and HDGF expression were detected using immunohistochemistry, and the relationships between p53 expression and HDGF expression and clinicopathological features of EFT were analysed. Kaplan-Meier curves were applied to estimate overall survival, log-rank test was used to assess prognostic relevance of p53 expression with overall survival and Cox regression model was performed to evaluate HRs.Results:p53 expression and high HDGF expression was found in 17 (15.7%) and 55 (50.9%) patients, respectively. p53 expression was significantly associated with metastatic stage at initial diagnosis (p=0.007) and tumour venous/nerve invasion (p=0.023). A significant positive correlation was found between p53 expression and HDGF expression in EFT (p=0.022). p53 expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival of patients with EFT (p<0.001). Patients with p53-positive/high HDGF expression had a significantly shorter overall survival than those with p53-positive/low HDGF expression or p53-negative/high HDGF expression or p53-negative/low HDGF expression. We first constructed a novel molecular staging system by combining p53 expression and HDGF expression, which significantly improved prognostic stratification for patients with EFT.Conclusions:p53 expression was an independent prognostic factor for patients with EFT. Combining p53 expression and HDGF expression significantly improved prognostic stratification for patients with EFT.
