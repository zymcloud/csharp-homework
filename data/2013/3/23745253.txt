Objective:To study the effect of over expressed nicotinamide N-methytransferase (NNMT) on the malignant biological behaviors of hepatocellular carcinoma cell line SMMC7721.Methods:The cells transfected with SMMC/NNMT abbreviated as S/NNMT, parental cells including the negative control which transfected with SMMC/pcDNA3. 1 abbreviated as S/P and parental group which abbreviated S. MTT assay and Plate Clone Formation Assay, cell adhension assay and invasion assay were applied to evaluate the effect of NNMT overexpression on the malignant biological behaviors of hepatocellular carcinoma cell line SMMC7721.Results:Compared with the negative control and parental group, MTT assay and Plate Clone Formation Assay demonstrated that over expression of NNMT in SMMC7721 cells could not influence the proliferation clone formation of SMMC7721 cells (P > 0.05). Over expression of NNMT in SMMC7721 cells significantly enhanced the ability of invasion and adhension (P Conclusion:NNMT gene can partially influence the malignant behaviors of hepatocellular carcinoma cellline SMMC7721 and increased the ability of invasion and adhension.
