Background:Caudate hepatectomy remains a surgical challenge in spite of recent advances in laparoscopic technique. Hepatic tumor in the caudate lobe is usually deeply located in the center of the liver and close to the vena cava and hepatic hilum. Thus, lesion in this region was considered as a contraindication of laparoscopic hepatectomy. Only sporadic reports could be found in the literature. The aim of this study is to review the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic hepatectomy for lesions in the caudate lobe.Methods:Nine consecutive patients with caudate hepatic tumor received laparoscopic caudate hepatectomy in our institute from February 2006 to July 2010. One patient with hepatic adenoma was excluded from the analysis. Demographic data, intraoperative parameters, and postoperative outcomes of the remaining eight patients were assessed.Results:All procedure for these eight patients with caudate hepatic tumors (size 0.9-4.5 cm) were completed with totally laparoscopic technique except one in which additional left hepatectomy was also done. The average operative time was 254 min (range 210-345 min) and estimated blood loss was 202 ml (range 10-1,000 ml), and average length of postoperative hospital stay was 6.9 days (range 4-11 days). There was no perioperative complications and patient mortality in this series.Conclusions:Our experience demonstrated that laparoscopic hepatectomy is a safe and feasible procedure for caudate hepatic tumors in selected patients.
