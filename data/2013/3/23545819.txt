Objective:To explore the diagnostic value of the 3.0T magnetic resonance liver diffusion weighted imaging with background suppression (DWIBS) in liver foci of space occupying lesion.Methods:A total of 43 cases of liver bureau stove perch pathological change were included: 15 were hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with 24 lesions; 7 were liver metastatic tumor with 13 lesions; 10 were liver hemangioma with 12 lesions; and 11 liver cyst with 20 lesions. After taking the conventional T1WI and T2WI sequence, the magnetic resonance background suppression diffusion imaging technology (diffusion weighted imaging with background suppression, DWIBS) was applied, following the dynamic enhanced scan. With the MRI to DWIBS workstation for classifying positron emission computed tomography (PET) processing, the T2WI diagram and dynamic enhanced diagram were compared respectively for the 3 sequences of lesion detection rate, T2WI, and DWIBS, to enhance the delay time between the two joint and combined lesion detection rate. With the MRI workstation software scanning image generation ADC diagram, the ADC values were measured for liver cancer, liver metastatic tumor, liver hemangioma and liver cysts.Results:The 3 sequences of detection rates of the T2WI, DWIBS and enhanced delay period T1WI were 91.3%, 94.2%, and 95.6%. The detection rate of DWIBS plus T2WI was 92.7%; that of T2WI plus enhanced delay time was 94.9%, and that of DWIBS plus enhanced delay time was 96.3%, with the rate of DWIBS plus enhanced delay period obviously higher than that of the DWIBS plus T2WI (PConclusion:Combing the DWIBS technology, the PET-like images and the ADC value acquired, the combined enhanced sequences could further facilitate the demonstration of the liver foci of space occupying lesion, the accuracy of identification and diagnosis of the liver foci of space occupying lesion.
