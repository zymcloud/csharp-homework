Embolotherapy continues to play a growing role in the management of primary and secondary hepatic malignancies. In this review article, we examine the basis of therapy with a focus on neovascularization, which makes treatments via the hepatic artery possible. An overview of the three generations of embolic and therapeutic agents follows. The techniques, technologies, and complications of bland embolization, transarterial chemoembolization, drug-eluting beads, and selective internal radiotherapy are covered to give the reader an overview of this exciting field in interventional radiology.
