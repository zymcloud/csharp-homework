Right hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common major operation in liver surgery; therefore, liver surgeons should know the fundamental surgical concept and techniques of the Glissonean pedicle approach. A J-shaped or reversed T laparotomy is performed in the right subcostal area. The Glissonean pedicle approach is performed at the hepatic hilus. In this approach, the right anterior and posterior Glissonean pedicles are encircled and ligated without liver dissection. The right hepatic artery, right portal vein and right hepatic duct in the hepatoduodenal ligament should be divided if the Glissonean pedicles cannot be approached easily. After confirming the border between the right and left liver, the liver parenchyma is dissected from the anterior surface of the liver to the anterior surface of the inferior vena cava (IVC). The V5 and V8 middle hepatic veins are divided and liver dissection is performed along the main middle hepatic vein. Finally, the anterior surface of the IVC and the trunk of the right hepatic vein are identified in the liver. This approach is widely known as the anterior approach described by Lai and Fan (World J Surg 20:314-8, 1996). However, this procedure had already been reported by Takasaki et al. (Shoukakigeka 7:1545-51, 1984) but since they did not report this procedure in English, their pioneering work on the anterior approach has not been recognized. The liver hanging maneuver described by Belghiti et al. (J Am Coll Surg 193:109-111, 2001) is also useful in right hepatectomy. Among the techniques used in right hepatectomy, the Glissonean pedicle approach, the anterior approach and the liver hanging maneuver are considered to be the most important.
