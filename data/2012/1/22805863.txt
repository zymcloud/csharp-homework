Background:Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 and IRF-2 are transcriptional factors that mediate interferons functions; the loss of IRF-1 expression and gain of IRF-2 expression were associated with malignant phenotype in multiple cancers. However, their roles in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain poorly described.Methods:Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the nuclear expression of IRF-1/2 in a cohort of 332 HCC patients. The expression of IRF-1/2 in HCC cell lines with stepwise metastasis potential was determined by immunoblotting. Downregulation of IRF-1 or IRF-2 expression was mediated by shRNAs; a series of experiments were conducted to determine the changes of invasion ability and downstream molecular events.Results:High expression of IRF-1 was associated with good outcome (pConclusions:IRF-1 and IRF-2 expression were associated with prognosis of HCC patients with opposite predictive power. IRF-2/IRF-1 ratio was associated with tumor invasion, probably through modulation of MMP9 expression mediated by STAT3.
