Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy worldwide with an increasing incidence. The clinical outcome is influenced by the underlying liver cirrhosis, the size of the tumour at the time of diagnosis and the few therapeutic options currently available. In recent years there has been a lot of progress in the understanding of HCC immunobiology. This review summarizes our current knowledge of HCC biology, the role of chronic inflammation in carcinogenesis and the role of tumour-specific immune responses. Furthermore, we will present potentially new, immune-based therapies that might open up new avenues for the treatment of HCC.
