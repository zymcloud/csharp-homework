Background and purpose:Our previous studies demonstrated that a thiosemicarbazone iron chelator (di-2-pyridylketone-4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone; Dp44mT) possesses potent and selective anti-cancer activity but led to cardiotoxicity at non-optimal doses. In this study, we examined the in vivo anti-tumour efficacy and tolerability of a new-generation 2-benzoylpyridine thiosemicarbazone iron chelator (2-benzoylpyridine-4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone; Bp44mT) administered via the oral or i.v. routes.Experimental approach:BpT chelators were tested in vitro against human lung cancer cells (DMS-53) and in vivo in DMS-53 tumour xenografts in mice. The toxicity of Bp44mT in vivo and its effects on the expression of iron-regulated molecules involved in growth and cell cycle control were investigated.Key results:Administration of Bp44mT by either route resulted in marked dose-dependent inhibition of tumour growth. When administered at 50 mgÂ·kg(-1) via oral gavage three times per week for 23 days, the net xenograft growth was inhibited by 75%, compared with vehicle-treated mice. Toxicological examination showed reversible alterations including slight reduction of RBC count, with a decrease of liver and splenic iron levels, which confirmed iron chelation in vivo. Importantly, in contrast to Dp44mT, the chelator-treated mice did not show cardiac histological abnormalities. There was also no significant weight loss in mice, suggesting oral administration of Bp44mT was well tolerated.Conclusions and implications:This is the first study to show that Bp44mT can be given orally with potent anti-tumour efficacy. Oral administration of a novel and effective chemotherapeutic agent provides the benefits of convenience for chronic dosing regimens.
