The management of hepatocellular adenoma (HA) is dependent on several parameters, which are influencing the decision for further management. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical presentation, indications, and long-term outcome of surgical treatment in a single-institution analysis. Forty-nine patients underwent elective hepatectomy for HA between 1990 and 2007. Analysis parameters included demographic data, lesion number and size, diagnostic method, mode of surgery, and postoperative outcome. Mean follow-up was 108 months. Thirty-six patients underwent hormone therapy and four patients had a history of cancer before surgical treatment. The mean tumor diameter was 9.8 cm. Mild or moderate postoperative complications were recorded in 16 patients. There was no perioperative mortality. Symptoms were relieved in 95 per cent of the patients. Intratumoral hemorrhage was detected in 21 specimens (43%); malignant transformation was detected in zero specimens. Among patients with HA with clinical symptoms, tumor diameter greater than 5 cm and in male patients the indication for surgery should be given because of the high risk of tumor-related complications. Elective liver resection for HA is a safe procedure and results in a good long-term outcome.
