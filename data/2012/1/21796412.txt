Chromium (VI) is as an extremely toxic chemical substance, and is also an internationally recognized human carcinogen. The principal objective of this study was to determine whether or not Styrax japonica Siebold et al. Zuccarini (SJSZ) glycoprotein prevents hepatocarcinogenesis in chromium-treated BNL CL.2 cells and ICR mice. Firstly, it was evaluated that SJSZ glycoprotein has strong antioxidant character and scavenges radicals. In an effort to assess the chemopreventive effects of SJSZ glycoprotein on hepatocarcinogenesis, ICR mice were intraperitoneally injected with chromium (10 mg/kg, BW) for 8 weeks. After sacrifice, we evaluated indicators of liver tissue damage [the activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS)], antioxidative enzymes [activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and gluthathione peroxidase (GPx)], and initiating hepatocarcinogenic indicator [heat shock protein (HSP) 27 and 70] and protein kinase C (PKC), p38 MAPK and PCNA via biochemical methods and immunoblot analysis. The results obtained from this study demonstrated that the SJSZ glycoprotein (50 Î¼g/ml) inhibited the production of intracellular ROS in BNL CL.2 cells. In addition, the SJSZ glycoprotein (10 mg/kg, BW) attenuated the levels of LDH, ALT, and TBARS, whereas it increased antioxidative enzymes in mouse serum. SJSZ glycoprotein attenuated the activity of HSP27, HSP70, PKC, MAPKs, and PCNA in BNL CL.2 cells and liver tissue. Taken together, our results indicate that SJSZ glycoprotein might be have a potent preventive effect against hepatocarcinogenesis induced by oxidative stress.
