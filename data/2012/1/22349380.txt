Objective:To determine the value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in the diagnosis of benign and malignant hepatic tumors.Methods:A total of 83 patients with 123 focal liver lesions (FLLs) underwent contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) examination. The contrast enhanced characterization of FLLs were compared.Results:All the 103 lesions in hepatocallular carcinoma improved quickly in the arterial phase or portal phase. Altogether 98 lesions (95%) washed out during the late phase but the rest 5 lesions (5%) did not. Of the 69 lesions of hepatocellular carcinoma, 53(77%) enhanced global in the arterial phase or portal phase, and the rest 16 (23%) showed inhomogeneous enhancement but no enhancement in the central area during arterial phase or portal phase. A total of 66(96%) presented wash-out during the late phase, and 3(4%) had no wash-out. Of the 34 lesions of metastatic hepatic carcinoma, 24(71%)presented inhomogeneous enhancement in the arterial phase or portal phase, 10(29%) enhanced globally in the arterial phase or portal phase, 32 (94%) presented wash-out during the late phase, and 2(6%) had no wash-out in the late phase. Of the 20 lesions of benign hepatic tumor, 18(90%) presented inhomogeneous enhancement slowly in the arterial phase or portal phase, 14 (70%) slightly enhanced, and 20 (100%) presented no wash-out in the the late phase.Conclusion:CEUS can improve the accuracy of diagnosis of benign and malignant hepatic tumors.
