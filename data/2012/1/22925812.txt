Background & aims:Although the Milan criteria (MC) have been used to select liver transplantation candidates among patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), many patients exceeding the MC have shown good prognosis. Preoperative neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a predictor of patient prognosis, but its mechanism has never been clarified.Methods:We assessed outcomes in 158 patients who had undergone living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for HCC. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was determined in patients with high (â‰¥ 4) and low (Results:The 5-year RFS rate was significantly lower in patients with high (n=26) than with low (n=132) NLR (30.3% vs. 89.0%, pConclusions:NLR predicts outcomes after LDLT for HCC via the inflammatory tumor microenvironment. Combined with the MC, NLR may be a new criterion for LDLT candidates with HCC.
