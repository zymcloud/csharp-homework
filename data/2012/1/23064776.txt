Background:Protein tyrosine phosphatase type IVA member 3 (PTP4A3/PRL-3), a metastasis-associated phosphatase, plays multiple roles in cancer metastasis. We investigated PTP4A3/PRL-3 expression and its correlation with the clinicopathological features and prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Gene expression profiles of PTP4A3/PRL-3 were obtained in poorly differentiated HCC tissues. The results were validated independently by TaqMan gene expression assays and immunohistochemical analysis.Results:According to the microarray profiles, PTP4A3/PRL-3 was upregulated in patients with poorly differentiated disease compared to patients with well-differentiated disease with hepatic backgrounds associated with hepatitis B or C. Validation analysis showed that the PTP4A3/PRL-3 mRNA and protein levels were significantly associated with poor differentiation (PConclusions:PTP4A3/PRL-3 might be closely associated with HCC progression, invasion, and metastasis. Its high expression had a negative impact on the prognosis of HCC patients. This strongly suggests that PTP4A3/PRL-3 should be considered as a prognostic factor. Further analysis should be pursued to evaluate it as a novel prognostic target.
