Background and aim:Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication happens in patients who receive transarterial chemoembolization or systemic chemotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The incidence and risk factors of HBV reactivation during the perioperative period in HCC patients receiving hepatic resection is unknown.Methods:Between May 2009 and November 2010, 164 consecutive patients with HBV-related HCC who underwent hepatic resection were prospectively enrolled in the study. Among these, 126 patients received antiviral treatment before the operation (the antiviral group) and 38 patients did not receive any antiviral treatment (the non-antiviral group).Results:Ten patients (6.1%) developed HBV reactivation perioperatively (within 1 month after hepatectomy). The incidence of HBV reactivation in the antiviral group and non-antiviral group were 1.6% (2/126) and 21.1% (8/38), respectively (P Conclusion:Hepatectomy could reactivate HBV replication during the perioperative period, especially in patients who did not receive any antiviral therapy. A close monitoring of HBV DNA during the perioperative period was necessary irrespective of the preoperative HBV DNA level. Once HBV was reactivated, antiviral therapy should be given.
