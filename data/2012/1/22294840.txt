Aim:To investigate whether α-fetoprotein (AFP) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1 correlate with early recurrence of hepatoma/hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:From 2000 to 2005, 114 consecutive patients with HCC underwent primary curative hepatectomy. The mean age was 60.7 (8.7) years and 94 patients were male. The median follow-up period was 71.2 mo (range: 43-100 mo). Immediately prior to commencing laparotomy, 5 mL bone marrow was aspirated from the sternum and collected in citrate-coated test tubes. The initial 2 mL of bone marrow aspirate was discarded in each case. AFP mRNA and VEGFR-1 mRNA in the bone marrow and peripheral blood (BM- and PH-AFP mRNA and BM- and PH-VEGFR-1 mRNA, respectively) were measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. As normal controls, VEGFR-1 mRNA in the bone marrow and peripheral blood was also measured in 11 living liver donors. These data were evaluated for any correlation with early recurrence, comparing clinical and pathological outcomes.Results:The cut-off value of the BM-AFP mRNA and PH-AFP mRNA level in patients with HCC was set at 1.92 × 10(-7) and zero, respectively, based on data from the controls. A total of 34 (29.8%) and six (5.4%) patients were positive for BM-AFP mRNA and PH-AFP mRNA, respectively. The BM-VEGFR-1 mRNA levels in all HCC patients were higher than those in the normal controls, and this was the case also for PH-VEGFR-1mRNA. The 25-percentile values for the BM- and PH-VEGFR-1 mRNA in HCC patients were used as the cut-off values for assigning the patients into two groups based on these transcript levels. The High group for BM- VEGFR-1 mRNA contained 81 (71.1%) HCC cases and the Low group was assigned 33 (28.9%) patients. These numbers for PH-VEGFR-1mRNA were 78 (75.0%) and 26 (25.0%), respectively. HCC recurred in 80 patients; in the remnant liver in 48 cases, in the remnant liver and remote tissue in 20, and in the remote tissue alone in 12. BM-AFP mRNA-positive cases showed a significantly higher rate of early recurrence (within 1 year of surgical treatment) compared with BM-AFP mRNA-negative patients (P = 0.0091). Patients were classified into four groups according to the level/status of their BM-VEGFR-1 and BM-AFP mRNA as follows: group A (n = 23), BM-VEGFR-1/BM-AFP mRNA = low/negative; group B (n = 57) high/negative; group C (n = 10) low/positive; group D (n = 24), high/positive. This classification was found to correlate with a recurrence of this disease within 1 year (P = 0.0228). The disease-free survival curve of group A was significantly better than that of groups B, C or D (P = 0.0437, P = 0.0325, P = 0.0225). No other classification (i.e., PH-VEGF-R1/BM-AFP, BM-VEGF-R1/PH-AFP, and PH-VEGF-R1/PH-AFP mRNA) showed such a correlation.Conclusion:The evaluation of BM-AFP and BM-VEGFR-1 mRNA in patients with HCC may be a valuable predictor of disease recurrence following curative resection.
