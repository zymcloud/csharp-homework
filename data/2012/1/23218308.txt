Bioactive O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-d-glucopyranose (4'-galactosyl lactose) was site-selectively modified at a reducing end with thiosemicarbazide (TSC). As-synthesized 4'-galactosyl lactose-TSC was immobilized on a gold substrate with cellobiose-TSC as a spacer through spontaneous self-assembly chemisorption via SAu bonding. Quartz crystal microbalance analysis suggested the successful formation of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of 4'-galactosyl lactose-TSC and/or cellobiose-TSC. Galactose-binding lectin exhibited the highest affinity for hybrid SAMs with an equimolar ratio of the two oligosaccharide-TSCs, while glucose-binding lectin showed decreasing adsorption with a decrease in cellobiose-TSC ratios. Human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, which recognize galactose residues, efficiently adhered to the hybrid SAMs. Higher enzymatic deethoxylation of ethoxyresorufin via cytochrome P450 appeared on hybrid SAMs. These results suggested that clustering of the bioactive sugars was involved in the cellular responses, possibly via biological carbohydrate-protein interactions. This approach to designing carbohydrate-based scaffolds should provide a basis for the functional development of glyco-decorated biointerfaces for cell culture applications.
