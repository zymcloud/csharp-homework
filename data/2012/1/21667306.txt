PI3K/AKT constitutes an important pathway regulating the signaling of multiple biological processes and plays a critical role in carcinogenesis. PIK3CA gene missense mutations have been reported in many human cancer types. The mutation of it in hepatocellular carcinoma cases varies with different races and regions. In this study, we investigated PIK3CA mutation in Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma patients. A total 90 Chinese patients of hepatocellular carcinoma were recruited in this study. Exons 9 and 20 hotspots mutations of PIK3CA gene were detected by PCR-based DNA sequencing. Two point mutations (E542K and D549H) in exon 9 were found in only one patient (1/90; 1.11%), no mutation was found in exon 20 in any cases. 57 patients are associated with HBV infection (57/90; 63.3%), and 8 patients with HCV infection (8/90; 8.9%). The frequency of the PIK3CA mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma seems to be lower in Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma patients. These findings suggest that PI3K mutations may not play a major role in hepatic carcinogenesis in Chinese. HBV infection has close relationship with HCC in Chinese.
