Sorafenib is a relatively new cytostatic drug approved for the treatment of renal cell and hepatocellular carcinoma. In this report we describe the synthesis of sorafenib derivatives 4a-e which differ from sorafenib in their amide part. A 4-step synthetic pathway includes preparation of 4-chloropyridine-2-carbonyl chloride hydrochloride (1), 4-chloro-pyridine-2-carboxamides 2a-e, 4-(4-aminophenoxy)-pyridine-2-carboxamides 3a-e and the target compounds 4-[4-[[4-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]carbamoylamino]-phenoxy]-pyridine-2-carboxamides 4a-e. All compounds were fully chemically characterized and evaluated for their cytostatic activity against a panel of carcinoma, lymphoma and leukemia tumour cell lines. In addition, their antimetabolic potential was investigated as well. The most prominent antiproliferative activity was obtained for compounds 4a-e (IC(50) = 1-4.3 μmol·L-1). Their potency was comparable to the potency of sorafenib, or even better. The compounds inhibited DNA, RNA and protein synthesis to a similar extent and did not discriminate between tumour cell lines and primary fibroblasts in terms of their anti-proliferative activity.
