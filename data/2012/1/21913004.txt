We previously isolated a sulfated polysaccharide-protein complex from Gekko swinhonis Guenther, a traditional Chinese medicine, and have demonstrated its direct anti-cancer effect on human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line SMMC-7721. Here we investigated the effects of Gekko sulfated polysaccharide-protein complex (GSPP) on the defective biorheological characters of dendritic cells (DCs) under SMMC-7721 microenvironment. Our findings have shown that the biorheological properties of DCs were severely impaired by SMMC-7721 microenvironment, including decreased cell deformability, migration, and electrophoresis mobility, increased osmotic fragilities, and changed organizations of cytoskeletal proteins. We also found decreased secretion of interleukin (IL)-12 and increased secretion of IL-10 in DCs. However, supernatant collected from nonmalignant liver cells had no effect on these parameters. SMMC-7721 cells were treated with GSPP and the supernatant was used to culture DCs. We found that the defective biorheological parameters of DCs, except for osmotic fragility, were partially or completely improved. The secretion of IL-12 did not change as compared with that of DCs in SMMC-7721 microenvironment, but the secretion of IL-10 was resumed to the control level. Our results indicate that GSPP could partially restore the defective biorheological characteristics of DCs via modifying the tumor microenvironment and decreasing the secretion of IL-10 of DCs.
