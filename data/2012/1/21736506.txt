Introduction:Somatic mutations in plant homeodomain finger protein 6 (PHF6) gene have recently been reported in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), strongly suggesting its role in the pathogenesis of human cancers.Materials and methods:To see whether the PHF6 mutation occurs in other malignancies, we analyzed entire coding sequences of PHF6 in 231 hematologic malignancies [105 acute myelogenous leukemias (AML), 66 pre-B-ALL, 23 T-ALL, one undifferentiated acute leukemia and 36 multiple myelomas] by single-strand conformation polymorphism assay. Also, we analyzed the mutation in 236 solid cancers, including 41 lung, 39 hepatocellular (HCC), 36 breast, 40 colorectal, 40 gastric and 40 prostate carcinomas.Results:In the hematologic malignancies, there were 11 PHF6 mutations that were detected not only in T-ALL (34.7%) (five adult and three childhood T-ALL), but also in two AML (1.9%) (one acute monocytic leukemia and one AML minimally differentiated). In addition, there was a PHF6 mutation in the HCC (2.6%). The PHF6 mutations were detected in both male and female patients, and consisted of six frameshift, three nonsense and two intron mutations.Conclusion:Our data suggest that PHF6 mutation might play a role in tumorigenesis not only of T-ALL, but also of AML and HCC.
