Purpose:For radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), accurate positioning of the inserted needle in the index tumor seems to be an important factor affecting therapeutic effect. In a case-control study, we compared the therapeutic effect of RFA using 4D and 2D ultrasonography (US) to evaluate whether 4D US is more effective.Methods:Twenty subjects treated with percutaneous RFA using 4D US (4D group) and 20 subjects using conventional 2D US (2D group), who were matched for age, sex, and HCC diameter, were enrolled in this study. Aplio XG was used as the US system and PVT-375MV as the newly developed 4D US probe. The therapeutic effect of RFA was classified into four grades (A-D: "Grade A" is "absolutely curative").Results:In the 2D group, Grade A was achieved in 12 subjects (60 %). In contrast, Grade A was achieved in 19 subjects (95 %) in the 4D group. The proportion of cases in which Grade A was achieved was significantly higher in the 4D group (P Conclusions:By using a 4D US device for RFA, more accurate insertion could be achieved and more effective therapy could be performed.
