Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a potentially malignant disorder associated with an increased risk of oral cancer. In Japan, the association of OLP with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is well documented. In the present study, a case of oral verrucous carcinoma arising from OLP coexisting vulvo-vaginal-gingival syndrome and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in a patient with HCV-related liver cirrhosis is reported. A 71-year old, non-smoking Japanese woman presented with lesions of OLP affecting the bilateral buccal mucosa, tongue, gingival, palate, oral floor and lower lip. Ten years later, an exophytic mass developed in the mandibular alveolar mucosa, the right buccal mucosa and the right lower lip. Pathological diagnosis confirmed the presence of verrucous carcinoma. However, she developed esophageal rather than oral cancer. The oral cancer was resected surgically three times and the patients underwent radiotherapy. The esophageal cancer was removed by endoscopic submucosal dissection. The risk of carcinogenesis increased as hyperinsulinemia continued. The results suggested that it is necessary to monitor for malignant changes in patients with OLP lesions and HCV infection. In addition, treatment requires the cooperation of various medical specialists, as well as an oral surgeon.
