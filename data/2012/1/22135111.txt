Purpose:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a coaxial reservoir system with a non-braided spiral tip microcatheter and exclusive port for hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy.Materials and methods:In vitro evaluation included evaluation of pressure tolerance/flow rate of the coaxial reservoir system, and the strength of connection between the 2.7-F catheter and port. Due to the difficulty of implanting conventional reservoirs, coaxial reservoirs were implanted via the femoral artery of 80 patients. We implanted a non-braided 2.7-F microcatheter with a spiral shaped tip, 5-F catheter, and a port. Clinical assessment included evaluation of technical success and complications.Results:In vitro evaluation of the coaxial reservoir at its maximum pressure load showed that flow rates for 300 mg I/mL iopamidol contrast medium were 0.25 ± 0.04 mL/s (undiluted), 1.03 ± 0.01 mL/s (50% dilution), and 2.91 ± 0.01 mL/s (30% dilution). Connection strength between the 2.7-F catheter and port was 13.4 ± 0.57 N. Percutaneous port catheter placement was successful in all patients (100%, n = 80). Complications included hepatic arterial occlusion (10%, n = 8), catheter tip dislocation (1.3%, n = 1), and catheter occlusion (1.3%, n = 1).Conclusions:A coaxial reservoir system with a non-braided microcatheter and exclusive port is safe and effective for difficulty of implanting conventional reservoir.
