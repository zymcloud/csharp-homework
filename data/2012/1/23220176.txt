Ethnopharmacological relevance:Ginkgo biloba, which is one of the most frequently used herbal medicines, is commonly used in the management of several conditions, including memory impairment. Previously, it was reported to decrease the expression of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor and the biosynthesis of glucocorticoids, thereby regulating glucocorticoid levels. However, it is not known whether Ginkgo biloba extract regulates the function of the glucocorticoid receptor.Aim of the study:We determined whether Ginkgo biloba extract and several of its chemical constituents affect the activity of human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR).Materials and methods:A hGR-dependent reporter gene assay was conducted in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and hGR target gene expression assays were performed in primary cultures of human hepatocytes.Results:Multiple lots and concentrations of the extract and several of its chemical constituents (ginkgolide A, ginkgolide B, ginkgolide C, ginkgolide J, and bilobalide) did not increase hGR activity, as assessed by a cell-based luciferase reporter gene assay. The extract did not influence the expression of hGR target genes, including tyrosine aminotransferase (hTAT), constitutive androstane receptor (hCAR), or pregnane X receptor (hPXR), in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. Moreover, hGR antagonism by mifepristone (also known as RU486) did not attenuate the extent of induction of hCAR- and hPXR-regulated target genes CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 by Ginkgo biloba extract.Conclusion:Ginkgo biloba extract, ginkgolide A, ginkgolide B, ginkgolide C, ginkgolide J, and bilobalide are not activators of hGR. Furthermore, the extract does not influence the hGR-hCAR or the hGR-hPXR signaling pathway in primary cultures of human hepatocytes.
