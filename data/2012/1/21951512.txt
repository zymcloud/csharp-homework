Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is mainly caused by a persistent infection due to the hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus. The number of HCC cases is increasing in Asian and African countries, as well as in European and American countries. Interferon (IFN) therapy, used for type B chronic liver diseases, inhibits hepatic carcinogenesis in patients with compensated cirrhosis. However, there is insufficient evidence that IFN therapy inhibits hepatic carcinogenesis in patients with chronic hepatitis B. There are few cases of HCC due to chronic hepatitis B, and long-term follow-up periods verifying the inhibitory effect of IFN on hepatic carcinogenesis have not been obtained. To improve the prognosis of type B chronic liver diseases, it is important that hepatitis treatment follows guidelines in which a patient's age and the extent of hepatic fibrosis are taken into account. As for chronic hepatitis C, since a sustained virological response (SVR) in IFN therapy inhibits hepatic carcinogenesis and improves prognosis, treatment that aims for an SVR while taking into consideration host-sided and virus-sided factors is recommended for patients with type C chronic liver diseases. In areas with low incidence of HCC (e.g. USA), a large number of cases and a long-term follow-up period are needed before it can be accepted that IFN therapy inhibits hepatic carcinogenesis. After locally curative treatment of HCC, IFN therapy suppresses recurrence and improves survival rates.
