Objective:To explore the clinical value of Fuzheng Yiliu Recipe (FYR) combined with microwave ablation on hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Sixty patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were randomly assigned to the control group and the treatment group according to the random digit table, 30 in each group. Patients in the control group received microwave ablation therapy, while those in the treatment group received FYR three days after microwave ablation. The therapeutic course was 6 months. By the end of the treatment, the short-term objective therapeutic efficacy, the liver function, the hepatic fibrosis index, the cellular immune function were statistically analyzed between the two groups.Results:The indices of the liver function, the hepatic fibrosis, and the cellular immune function were more significantly improved in the treatment group than in the control group (P Conclusion:FYR combined with microwave ablation could elevate the therapeutic efficacy, enhance the patients' immunity, improve the liver function and the hepatic fibrosis degree.
