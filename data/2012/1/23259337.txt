HCC is frequent and difficult to treat, especially in patients with underlying chronic liver disease The risk of recurrence is very high. The best curative treatment for patients with limited tumors is liver transplantation (LT), an option restricted to rich countries and selected patients with a low risk of recurrence. Other curative treatments include partial liver resection in patients with excellent liver function, and radiofrequency ablation of tumors measuring less than 5 cm. Multiple tumors can be treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization or, more recently, 90Y radiotherapy. All these treatments may be combined in patients on the waiting list for LT Despite its potentially severe side effects, the new multikinase inhibitor sorafenib improves survival in the terminal phase.
