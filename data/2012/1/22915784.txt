We investigated the dosimetric differences among volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy (RapidArc, RA) plans designed for various target volumes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ten HCC patients underwent 3D-CT scanning at free breathing (FB), 3D-CT at end inspiration hold (EIH) assisted by an Active Breathing Coordinator (ABC), and 4D-CT scanning. Gross tumor volumes (GTVs) were manually contoured on CT images. The individualized internal gross target volume (IGTV(1)) was obtained from 10 GTVs from 4D-CT images. Tumor individual margins were measured from GTV(FB) to IGTV(1). The IGTV(2) was obtained from GTV(FB) by applying individual margins. Four planning target volumes (PTV(1-4)) were obtained from IGTV(1), IGTV(2), GTV(FB), and GTV(EIH), respectively. An RA plan was designed for each of the PTVs (RA(1-4)). One 358° arc was used for PTVs(1-3), while three 135° arcs were used for PTV(4). It was found that PTV(2) and PTV(3) were larger than PTV(1) and PTV(4). The mean values of PTV(3)/PTV(1) and PTV(3)/PTV(4) were 2.5 and 1.9, respectively. The individual margins in the X, Y and Z axial directions varied greatly among these patients. There were no significant differences in the conformal index or homogeneity index among the four RA plans. RA(1) and RA(4) significantly reduced the radiation dose of normal liver tissue compared with RA(2) and RA(3) (P
