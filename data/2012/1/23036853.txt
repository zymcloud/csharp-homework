Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is metabolically activated by cytochrome P450 enzymes, and forms DNA adduct leading to mutations. Cytochrome P450 1A1 plays a central role in this activation step, and this enzyme is strongly induced by chemical agents that bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which is also known as a dioxin receptor. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a potent AhR ligand has not been shown to form any DNA adduct, but has a possibility to aggravate the toxicity of precarcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons through the induction of metabolic enzymes. We treated human hepatoma cells (HepG2) with TCDD, and subsequently exposed them to BaP to elucidate the synergistic effects on mutations. Surprisingly, mutant frequency induced by BaP at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphribosyltransferase (HPRT) locus was decreased by pretreatment with TCDD. In correlation with decrease in the mutant frequencies, BaP-DNA adduct formation was also decreased by TCDD pretreatment. This suppressive effect of TCDD was more potent when the cells were exposed to (Â±)-anti-benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE), a reactive metabolic intermediate of BaP. Among the enzymes catalyzing BaP oxidation and conjugation, cytochrome P450 1A1, 1A2, 3A4 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 mRNAs were induced by the exposure to TCDD. In cytochrome P450 1A1-deficient murine cells and cytochrome P450 1A1-uninducible human cells, TCDD could not suppress BPDE-DNA adduct formation. Further experiments using "Tet-On" cytochrome P450 1A1-overexpressing cells and a recombinant cytochrome P450 1A1 enzyme demonstrated that this is the key enzyme involved in the biotransformation of BaP, that is, both production and inactivation of BPDE. We conclude that TCDD-induced cytochrome P450 catalyzes the metabolism of BPDE to as yet-unidentified products that are not apparently DNA-reactive, thereby reducing mutations in hepatoma cells.
