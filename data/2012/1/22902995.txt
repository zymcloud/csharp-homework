Dysregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway frequently instigates tumorigenesis leading to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We synthesized N-(5-(3-(3-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-6-yl)pyridin-3-yl)benzenesulfonamide (HS-104), a novel PI3K inhibitor, and investigated its in vitro anticancer effect and in vivo capacity in an animal xenograft model. The inhibition of cell growth by HS-104 revealed that it was effective against HCC cell lines. Also, the activation of the AKT/mTOR signal cascade was inhibited by HS-104 treatment in a dose dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis showed an accumulation of HCC cells in the G2/M phase with concomitant loss of cells in the S phase. The apoptotic effect of HS-104 was accompanied by increased evidence of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP, as well as DNA fragmentation. In angiogenesis studies, HS-104 inhibited the tube formation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and suppressed microvessel sprouting from a rat aortic ring, ex vivo, and blood vessel formation in the Matrigel plug assay in mice. HS-104 inhibited the expression of the downstream proteins of PI3K including p-AKT, p-mTOR and p-p70S6K in VEGF-induced HUVECs. In the xenograft animal model, HS-104 significantly delayed tumor growth in a dose dependent manner and suppressed the expression of PCNA, CD34 and cleaved caspase-3 in tumor tissue. These studies show that HS-104 inhibited the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway resulting in cell growth/angiogenesis inhibition and apoptosis induction. Therefore, HS-104 is considered as a novel drug candidate for the treatment of HCC.
