Diagnostic ultrasound (US) is safe. Short interference (si) RNA of Frizzled (Fz)-9 suppresses proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. siRNA was introduced into Hep3B cells, a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, with transfection or US upward to culture plates at mechanical index (MI) = 0.4 or 0.8. siRNA of Fz9 was introduced for western blot analysis and cell proliferation assay. siRNA of Fz9 suppressed cell proliferation to 32.8Â±13.6% at 200 nM (P
