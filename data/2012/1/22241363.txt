The patient was a 74-year-old man who suffered from epigastric abdominal pain. He visited our hospital in April 2008. An esophageal endocrine cell carcinoma was pointed out by gastrointestinal endoscopy, and he was diagnosed as esophageal endoscopic cell carcinoma with mediastinum lymph node by CT scan(Stage IVa: cT3N4M0). Concurrent chemoradiotherapy using CDDP+EP was started. After two courses, the primary tumor was markedly reduced, and endoscopy showed only a scar. We diagnosed the patient as being in complete remission. However, CT showed a liver metastasis relapse in June 2009, and we started AMR as second-line chemotherapy. His general condition went into a decline, however, He died on October 2, 2009.
