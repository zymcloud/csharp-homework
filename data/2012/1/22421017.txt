Background:The effect of parenteral nutrition (PN) support supplemented with ω-3 fatty acids was investigated in a randomized, controlled clinical trial at the Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University.Materials and methods:Ninety-eight patients with the diagnosis of end-stage liver disease or hepatic cellular carcinoma were admitted for orthotopic liver transplantation at the Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital. The patients were randomly divided into 3 groups: diet group (n = 32), PN group (n = 33), and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) group (n = 33). Patients in the PN and PUFA groups received isocaloric and isonitrogenous PN for 7 days after surgery. Venous heparin blood samples were obtained for assay on days 2 and 9 after surgery. A pathological test was performed after reperfusion of the donor liver and on day 9.Results:Alanine aminotransferase levels were improved significantly by PUFA treatment compared with traditional PN support (P Conclusion:Posttransplant PN support can greatly improve metabolism of protein and nutrition states of patients. ω-3 fatty acid-supplemented PN significantly reduces injury of the transplanted liver, decreases the incidence of infectious morbidities, and shortens posttransplant hospital stay.
