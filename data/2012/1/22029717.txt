Recent advances in robotic surgical technology have enabled application to complex surgical procedures. Following extensive institutional experience with major robotic liver resections, we determined that it was safe to apply this technology to right lobe donor hepatectomy (RLDH). The procedure was performed using the Da Vinci Robotic Surgical System, in an entirely minimally invasive fashion, during which the liver graft was safely extracted through a limited lower abdominal incision. Both donor and recipient recovered well, without acute complications. To our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the literature. The technical feasibility of this minimally invasive approach is demonstrated, exemplifying the novel exciting opportunities offered by robotic technology.
