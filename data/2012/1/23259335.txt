A variety of exogenous and endogenous agents, including toxic compounds, alcohol, drugs and viruses, can cause acute and chronic liver injuries which may lead to inflammation and fibrogenesis. Most hepatocellular carcinomas arise on a fibrotic or cirrhotic liver, and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with continuous changes in the cellular microenvironment. Extracellular matrix remodelling is a complex process involving synthesis and degradation of matrix components that modulate the fate of cancer cells. Proteases, including matrix metalloproteinases, cleave matrix components and release polypeptide modules with specific biological activities. Knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in extracellular matrix remodelling will open the path to biomarker identification and tailored treatments targeting the liver tumor microenvironment.
