Aim:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) in patients with larger hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumours.Materials and methods:Eighty HCC patients with the maximum tumour measuring between 3 and 8 cm were treated using MWA. Of these patients, 57 had initial HCC, while 23 had recurrent HCC. Fifty-two patients had a main tumour measuring 3-5 cm, and 28 had a main tumour measuring 5-8 cm. Local tumour control, complications, long-term survival, and prognostic factors were analysed.Results:Complete ablation after the initial treatment was achieved in 70 of 80 (87.5%) patients. Sixteen of the 72 (22.2%) successfully treated patients developed local recurrence. Major complications occurred in 7.5% patients. No procedure-related mortality was observed. The 1, 2, 3, and 5 year overall survival rates after the initial ablation were 81.1, 68.2, 56.5, and 34.6%, with a median survival of 56 months. Univariate analysis revealed that small tumour size (p = 0.003) and pre-ablation α-foetoprotein (AFP) level ≤400 ng/ml (p = 0.042) were favourable prognostic factors of overall survival. Multivariate analysis identified only tumour size as the independent prognosis factor (p = 0.008).Conclusion:Percutaneous MWA is effective and safe for treating larger HCC tumours. The local tumour control and long-term survival are acceptable.
