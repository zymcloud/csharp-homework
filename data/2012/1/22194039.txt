Purpose:We report our initial experience with the transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using cisplatin-conjugated gelatin microspheres (Cis-GMS).Methods and material:Nineteen patients with 25 HCC nodules (mean diameter 23.0 mm) were treated by selective TACE using 50- to 100-Î¼m Cis-GMS. Tumor necrosis and postembolization syndrome were assessed during the follow-up. The tumor response was evaluated on contrast-enhanced computed tomography images at 1 and 3 months after TACE using Cis-GMS.Results:All procedures were technically successful in all patients; following the TACE using Cis-GMS, there were no major complications, and postembolization syndrome was minimal. At the 1-month follow-up, the response rate was 12 of the 25 (48%) and 21 of the 25 (84%) HCC nodules based on RECIST 1.1 and EASL criteria, respectively; at the 3-month follow-up, it was 10 of the 25 (40%) and 14 of the 25 (56%) HCC nodules, respectively.Conclusion:Our initial experience with using Cis-GMS for TACE suggests that these drugs may represent an optimal treatment option for the treatment of advanced HCC and that the use of gelatin microspheres loaded with chemotherapeutic agents warrants further study.
