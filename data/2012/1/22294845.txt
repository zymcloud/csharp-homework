Aim:To investigate the association between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) susceptibility and a 12-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism (rs6147150) in the 3'UTR of ErbB4.Methods:Using a case-control design, the rs6147150 genotypes in 270 patients with HCC and 270 healthy controls were determined by direct polymerase chain reaction and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association between the polymorphism and cancer risk.Results:Computational modeling suggested that rs6147150 was located in the seed region of hsa-let-7c, a potential target sequence in ErbB4 3'UTR. Logistic regression analysis showed that, compared with individuals homozygous for wild-type, heterozygotes [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-2.17, P = 0.034] and individuals homozygous for 12-bp del/del (OR = 2.50, 95% CI = 1.37-4.56, P = 0.001) were at significantly higher risk of HCC. Carriers of the "del" allele of rs6147150 had a 1.59-fold increased risk for HCC (95% CI = 1.22-2.07, P = 0.003).Conclusion:rs6147150 may be associated with HCC risk, in part through let-7c-mediated regulation, and may be involved in the pathogenesis of HCC in Chinese populations.
