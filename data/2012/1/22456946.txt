Background:Tyrosinaemia type 1 (HT1) is a rare disorder leading to accumulation of toxic metabolites such as succinylacetone (SA) and a high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Children with HT1 traditionally required liver transplantation (OLT) and while the need for this has been reduced by the introduction of nitisinone some still require OLT. SA inhibits the enzyme porphobilinogen (PBG) synthase and its activity can be used as a marker of active SA. Elevated urinary SA post OLT has been reported previously. This study describes a novel finding of elevated plasma SA following OLT for HT1.Methods:A retrospective analysis was performed of patients treated for HT1 at our institution from 1989-2010.Results:Thirteen patients had an OLT for HT1. In patients who received nitisinone prior to OLT, mean urinary and plasma SA were elevated prior to treatment but normalised by the time of OLT (p â‰¤ 0.01). Mean PBG synthase activity increased from 0.032 to 0.99 nkat/gHb (ref range 0.58-1.25) at the time of OLT (p Conclusion:Urinary and plasma SA levels are elevated following OLT for HT1. Low-normal PBG synthase activity suggests the plasma SA may be active. The clinical significance of this is unclear.
