If a new generation of iron chelators specifically devoted for cancer chemotherapy emerged these last years, any of them has not yet been approved at this time. Accordingly, there is a need to optimize new chelating molecules for iron chelation therapy and cancer treatment. So, the objective of the present investigation was to characterize the antiproliferative activity and the iron chelating capacity of the iron chelator S1 [bis-N-(8-hydroxyquinoline-5-ylmethyl)benzylamine]. Its effects were compared to O-trensox which binds ferric iron with a very high affinity (pFe(3+)=29.5). For this purpose, primary rat hepatocyte stimulated by EGF and human hepatoma HepaRG cell cultures were used. In these models, the anti-proliferative effect, the inhibition of DNA synthesis and the iron-chelating efficiency of increasing concentrations of S1 and O-trensox (0 up to 200 μM) were investigated. In the two cell culture models, we observed that S1 was about 100 times more efficient than O-trensox and the antiproliferative effect of S1 in HepaRG cells appeared at concentrations as low as 0.1 μM without cytotoxicity. Moreover, the stoichiometry of S1 for iron seemed to be in the range S1/Fe(3+)=1. Using the calcein fluorescence assay, we demonstrated that the affinity of S1 for iron was better than that of O-trensox since it was at least two times more effective to restore the fluorescence of calcein previously quenched by iron. So, the iron chelating efficiency of S1 could explain at least partially its higher anti-proliferative effect compared to O-trensox. Finally, these results suggest that molecules such as S1 may constitute a promising starting point to improve cancer treatment.
