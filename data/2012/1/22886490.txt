Background:Dendritic cells (DCs) could be used as potential cellular adjuvant for the production of specific tumor vaccines.Objectives:Our study was aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous pulsed DC vaccine in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in comparison with supportive treatment.Methods:Thirty patients with advanced HCC not suitable for radical or loco-regional therapies were enrolled. Patients were divided into 2 groups, group I consisted of 15 patients received I.D vaccination with mature autologous DCs pulsed ex vivo with a liver tumor cell line lysate. Group II (control group, no. 15) received supportive treatment. One hundred and 4 ml of venous blood were obtained from each patient to generate DCs. DCs were identified by CD80, CD83, CD86 and HLA-DR expressions using flow cytometry. Follow up at 3, and 6 months post injection by clinical, radiological and laboratory assessment was done.Results:Improvement in overall survival was observed. Partial radiological response was obtained in 2 patients (13.3 %), stable course in 9 patients (60 %) and 4 patients (26.7 %) showed progressive disease (died at 4 months post-injection). Both CD8(+) T cells and serum interferon gamma were elevated after DCs injection.Conclusion:Autologous DC vaccination in advanced HCC patients is safe and well tolerated.
