Objective:To investigate whether the use of statins is associated with common cancer risk.Methods:A population-based case-control study was conducted in Taiwan. Cases were defined as all patients who were aged 18 years and older and had received at least two statin prescriptions for use continuously for at least 6 months before a first-time diagnosis of studied cancers between the period of 2000 and 2008. The controls were matched to cases by age, sex, and index date. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by using the Cox proportional hazards model.Results:A total of 6841 cases and 27,364 matched controls were analyzed. The adjusted hazard ratio for any statin use and cancer at any site were 0.76 (95% 0.654, 0.891). There were a significant reduced risk of gastric cancer (HR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.107, 0.588), liver cancer (HR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.279, 0.723) and uterine cancer (HR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.279, 0.723) associated with any statins.Conclusion:Overall, the statins suggested a significant reduced risk of the most common cancers in a large Chinese population, particularly in gastric, liver, and uterine cancers.
