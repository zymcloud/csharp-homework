Hepatocellular carcinoma is responsible for around 6 000 deaths each year in France. About 90% of patients have underlying liver cirrhosis. The annual incidence rate in such patients is estimated at between 2% and 4%, but it is largely dependent on the cause and severity of the underlying liver disease, as well as on epidemiological factors such as age, sex, and the body mass index. Multiple genetic polymorphisms are also involved. Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma is indicated for patients with cirrhosis, based on ultrasonographic examination every six months. It allows early diagnosis and curative treatment in most cases but is still under-used.
