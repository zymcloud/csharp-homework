Objective:To investigate the correlation between FoxP3+ regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and peritumoral tissues with CD34 expression and patient prognosis.Methods:Fifty-five sets of patient-matched tumors and peritumoral tissues were obtained during curative resection for HCC. In situ immunohistochemistry was used to assess and comparatively analyze Treg presence and CD34 expression in each specimen set. The relation between quantified Tregs values and various clinicopathologic factors were evaluated by the Spearman Rank Correlation test. Univariate (Log Rank test) and multivariate (Cox Regression model) analyses were used to determine the potential prognostic value of each factor.Results:The average number of intratumoral Tregs was significantly higher than that in corresponding peritumoral tissues (10.8 (range: 4.4 to 19.4) vs. 1.4 (0.6 to 3.2), respectively; P less than 0.01). The presence of intratumoral Tregs correlated with up-regulated CD34 expression (r = 0.279, P less than 0.05). Increased number of intratumoral Tregs were significantly associated with decreased rates of overall survival (OS, P less than 0.05) and disease-free survival (DFS, P less than 0.05), and was identified as an independent prognostic factor (OS, hazard ratio (HR) = 3.310, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.368-8.007, P less than 0.01; DFS, HR = 2.666, 95% CI: 1.321 to 6.394, P less than 0.01).Conclusion:Intratumoral infiltration by Tregs is a marker of poor prognosis in HCC patients.
