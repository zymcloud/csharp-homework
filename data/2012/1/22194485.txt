Objective:We evaluated the efficacy of fusion imaging that fuses conventional sonography images with hepatobiliary phase contrast-enhanced MR images obtained with gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) as the reference image for the detection of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).Subjects and methods:Eighty-seven HCCs with a maximum diameter of between 1 and 3 cm at the time of diagnosis were enrolled in this prospective study. We compared the detection rates of HCCs using three sonography modalities: conventional sonography, late phase of contrast-enhanced sonography with Sonazoid, and fusion imaging combining conventional sonography and the hepatobiliary phase of contrast-enhanced MRI with Gd-EOB-DTPA as the reference image. The comparisons were made using the McNemar test.Results:The detection rate of HCCs using fusion imaging (98%, 85/87) was significantly higher than the detection rates using conventional sonography (76%, 66/87) and contrast-enhanced sonography (83%, 72/87) (pConclusion:Fusion imaging combining conventional sonography and the hepatobiliary phase of contrast-enhanced MRI with Gd-EOB-DTPA is more sensitive than conventional sonography or contrast-enhanced sonography for detecting HCCs, especially small or atypical HCCs.
