Objective:To retrospectively explore the clinical efficacies and applicability of anatomical vascular occlusion (AVO) in hepatectomy for grand primary hepatocarcinoma at different locations.Methods:A total of 212 grand primary hepatocarcinoma cases undergoing hepatectomy were divided into 2 groups by vascular occlusion in the process of resection: AVO group (n = 97) and Pringle group (Pringle maneuver, n = 115). According to whether or not tumor was adjacent to main vessels, the cases were divided into 2 types: centrally (n = 98) and peripherally (n = 114) located lesions. And the perioperative outcomes were compared between 2 groups totally and by types respectively.Results:No significance existed between the AVO and Pringle groups in the demographic characteristics and tumor background (P > 0.05). For total cases, there were no significant differences between 2 groups regarding the intraoperative blood loss volume ((632 ± 437) ml vs (546 ± 549) ml, P = 0.217) and the blood transfusion requirement (44.3% vs 33.0%, P = 0.092). The AVO group showed significantly better postoperative liver functions in terms of serum levels of total bilirubin and aminotransferase (P > 0.05). But no significant difference was found between 2 groups in the postoperative complication rate (18.6% vs 22.6%, P = 0.469) and hospital stay duration ((10.5 ± 4.8) vs (11.8 ± 5.6) days, P = 0.087). In centrally located lesions: the AVO group showed a significantly smaller intraoperative blood loss volume ((722 ± 492) ml vs (1032 ± 618) ml, P = 0.007) and blood transfusion requirement (45.6% vs 68.3%, P = 0.026). Also the AVO group showed significantly better postoperative liver functions in terms of serum levels of total bilirubin and aminotransferase (P 0.05), postoperative complication rate (17.5% vs 13.5%, P = 0.808) and hospital stay duration ((10.3 ± 4.6) days vs (11.1 ± 5.1) days, P = 0.429) showed no significant differences between 2 groups.Conclusion:The technique of AVO is unsuitable for all types of grand hepatocarcinoma. Whether or not the tumor is adjacent to main vessels is an important consideration of choosing the vascular control technique. Considering the risk of vascular damage in the process of hepatectomy, the AVO technique is indicated for the resection of central lesions but not for peripheral lesions.
