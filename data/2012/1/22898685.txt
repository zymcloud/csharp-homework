The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of arterial-dominant phase images of gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (EOB)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for evaluation of arterial blood supply in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in comparison with that of multiphasic dynamic computed tomography (CT). This study comprised 30 patients (22 men and 8 women, mean age: 68.0 years) with 40 pathologically proven HCCs (well differentiated: 3, moderately differentiated: 30, poorly differentiated: 7, mean diameter: 45.1 mm), all of whom underwent EOB-enhanced MRI and dynamic CT preoperative assessment. Regions of interest were placed over HCCs and the adjacent normal liver, and signal intensities or CT values were measured by two experienced abdominal radiologists on the arterial-dominant phase images of EOB-enhanced MRI and dynamic CT images. HCC-to-liver contrasts [Michelson's contrast: C(M)=(S(HCC)-S(Liver))/(S(HCC)+S(Liver))] were calculated and compared among the modalities. HCC-to-liver contrasts were also visually scored on a 5-point scale and compared. The mean C(M) and visual score for dynamic CT were significantly higher than those for EOB-enhanced MRI. Good agreements were obtained among the two observers. Dynamic CT is a more suitable modality than EOB-enhanced MRI for evaluation of arterial blood supply in HCC. This should be taken into account for diagnosis and management of HCC.
