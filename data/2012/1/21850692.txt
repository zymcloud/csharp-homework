There is increasing evidence that a relevant number of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) exceeding the Milan criteria may benefit from liver transplantation (LT). We retrospectively analyzed the prognostic significance of [(18) F]fludeoxyglucose ([(18) F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) for identifying appropriate LT candidates with advanced HCC on clinical staging. Between 1995 and 2008, 111 patients with HCC were listed for LT. All underwent a pretransplant PET evaluation. LT was performed for 91 of these patients. The tumor recurrence rate after LT was 3.6% for patients with non-[(18) F]FDG-avid (PET(-) ) tumors, but it was 54.3% for patients with [(18) F]FDG-avid (PET(+) ) tumors (P
