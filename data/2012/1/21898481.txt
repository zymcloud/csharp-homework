We recently showed that the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 mediates hepatic clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in mice based on systemic deletion of syndecan-1 and hepatocyte-specific inactivation of sulfotransferases involved in heparan sulfate biosynthesis. Here, we show that syndecan-1 expressed on primary human hepatocytes and Hep3B human hepatoma cells can mediate binding and uptake of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Syndecan-1 also undergoes spontaneous shedding from primary human and murine hepatocytes and Hep3B cells. In human cells, phorbol myristic acid induces syndecan-1 shedding, resulting in accumulation of syndecan-1 ectodomains in the medium. Shedding occurs through a protein kinase C-dependent activation of ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17). Phorbol myristic acid stimulation significantly decreases DiD (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate)-VLDL binding to cells, and shed syndecan-1 ectodomains bind to VLDL. Although mouse hepatocytes appear resistant to induced shedding in vitro, injection of lipopolysaccharide into mice results in loss of hepatic syndecan-1, accumulation of ectodomains in the plasma, impaired VLDL catabolism, and hypertriglyceridemia.Conclusion:These findings suggest that syndecan-1 mediates hepatic VLDL turnover in humans as well as in mice and that shedding might contribute to hypertriglyceridemia in patients with sepsis.
