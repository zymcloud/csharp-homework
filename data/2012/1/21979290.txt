We wished to study the efficacy and safety of the retrograde ligation of short hepatic veins (SHVs) and the right hepatic vein (HV) through the retrohepatic tunnel in patients who underwent hemihepatectomy due to large hepatic carcinoma in the right lobe of the liver. Right hemihepatectomy was performed in 23 patients with tumors larger than 8 cm in diameter. The liver was separated at the secondary porta, and the interspace between right HVs and middle HVs was expanded. The right hepatic portal vein and hepatic artery were freed and ligated, followed by the retrograde dissection of SHVs and the right HV along the right retrohepatic space anterior to the inferior vena cava. A blocking belt was set at the left side of the midline, after which the right liver was cut off. The procedure was successfully completed in all patients. The average amount of intraoperative blood loss was 640 ml. The change in hepatic function was observed on the third postoperative day. Twenty-two patients exhibited satisfactory results; one patient died from postoperative hepatic failure. In conclusion, this procedure can be safely performed in most hemihepatectomy patients with liver tumors.
