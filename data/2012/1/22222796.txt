Heme oxygenases (HO) are essential enzymes which degrade heme into carbon monoxide (CO), biliverdin and free iron. Due to its anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and, as recently described, anti-viral properties the inducible HO isoform HO-1 is an important molecule which could find its way into therapy of gastrointestinal diseases. Acute and chronic liver injuries including acute liver failure, alcoholic or viral hepatitis, chronic inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma are life threatening diseases and as a consequence might result in the necessity of liver transplantation. HO-1 as well as its reaction products of heme degradation has been linked to cytoprotection. HO-1 induction in rodent models of acute and chronic hepatic inflammation resulted in improvement of liver damage and down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Furthermore HO-1 induction interfered with fibrosis progression in mice and partially resolved existing fibrosis. Likewise, HO-1 induction interfered with replication of hepatitis viruses B and C, which frequently are the reason for chronic hepatitis and subsequent tumor growth. Liver transplantation is limited by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, which is characterized by hypoxia and nutrient deficiency resulting in oxidative stress, apoptosis and immune activation. Induction of HO-1 and application predominantly of CO have been shown to interfere with I/R liver injury and to improve recipient and graft survival. On the other hand HO-1 has been shown to be over-expressed in various tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Due to its anti-apoptotic properties this bears the risk to promote tumor growth. Anti-apoptotic effects are predominantly mediated by CO. This review aims to summarize beneficial as well as detrimental effects of HO-1 and its products within the liver.
