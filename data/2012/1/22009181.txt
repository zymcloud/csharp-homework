Purpose:Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) greatly contributes to the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is reported that a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor inhibits cellular proliferation and may attenuate VEGF expression in HCC. We propose that different cascades in the VEGF pathway respond to COX-2 inhibition, depending on the cell types.Methods:The six human HCC cell lines--Hep3B, SNU387, SNU182, SNU423, SNU449, and PLC/PRF5--were cultured under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Cells were treated with a selective COX-2 inhibitor (NS-398) and discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) siRNA, and microarray analysis was performed.Results:NS-398 inhibited HCC proliferation and decreased the expression level of VEGF in HCC cells only under normoxia conditions. In hypoxia conditions, VEGF expression level in Hep3B cell was suppressed, while that in SNU387 cell was increased by NS-398 (P Conclusion:These findings disclose a novel cell-dependent regulatory mechanism of VEGF involving DDR2 gene in HCC cells.
