Background & aims:The current standard treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is sorafenib. This drug is effective but generally does not induce tumor shrinkage and other treatment options are still needed.Methods:This retrospective multicenter study included all consecutive patients with advanced HCC treated with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOX) between 2001 and 2010. Survival curves were drawn with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate prognostic factors.Results:Two hundred four consecutive patients were treated with GEMOX (median age, 60 years; men, 86%; underlying cirrhosis, 76%). Grade 3-4 toxicity was observed in 44% of the patients (thrombocytopenia 24%, neutropenia 18%, diarrhea 14%, neurotoxicity 12%) leading to treatment discontinuation in 16% of the cases. The overall response and disease control rates were 22% (95% CI, 16-27) and 66% (95% CI, 59-72), respectively. No clinical or biological factors were associated with the treatment response, and 8.5% of the patients were subsequently eligible for curative-intent therapies after downstaging. Median PFS, TTP, and OS were 4.5 (95% CI, 4-6), 8 (95% CI, 6-11), and 11 months (95% CI, 9-14), respectively. In multivariate analysis, gender (p=0.03), underlying cirrhosis (p=0.01), CLIP score (p=0.03), and response to GEMOX (pConclusions:This large study confirms that GEMOX is effective with manageable toxicity in patients with advanced HCC. Tumor responses permitted potentially curative treatment that was not initially feasible in a significant proportion of patients.
