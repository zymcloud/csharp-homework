The prognosis including (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET/CT) for the early recurrence for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) was not well established. Consecutive patients who underwent (18)F-FDG-PET/CT and subsequent LDLT for HCC from March 2005 to June 2011 were enrolled. The 191 patients with a median follow-up of 26.1 months were evaluated. There were 20 patients (10.5%) with early recurrence (â‰¤6 months), 18 patients (9.4%) with late recurrence (>6 months), and 153 patients (80.1%) with no recurrence. Fifty-five patients (28.8%) displayed increased PET/CT tumor uptake. Three-year overall and disease-free survival for PET/CT-positive patients were 65.5% and 57.1%, respectively, while PET/CT-negative patients showed respective values of 89.8% and 86.8% (P = 0.001 vs. P
