This study investigated the antioxidant and cytotoxic activity of the phenolics isolated from the fruits of Livistona chinensis. Four new compounds, 1-{ω-isoferul[6- (4-hydroxybutyl)pentadecanoic acid]}-glycerol (1), E-[6'-(5″-hydroxypentyl)tricosyl]-4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamate (2), 2-(3'-hydroxy-5'-methoxyphenyl)-3-hydroxylmethyl-7-methoxy-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-5- carboxylic acid (3), 7-hydroxy-5,4'-dimethoxy-2-arylbenzofuran (4), together with eleven known phenolics (5-15), were isolated and identified. Among these compounds, 1-4, 5-O-caffeoylshikimic acid (5), caffeic acid (7), and 3-O-caffeoylshikimic acid (8) showed potent antioxidant activity. 1-5, and 8 showed potent antiproliferative activities with IC(50) values among 5-150 μM against HepG2 human liver cancer, HL-60 human myeloid leukemia, K562 human myeloid leukemia, and CNE-1 human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines. On the basis of these findings, it could be proposed that the fruits of L. chinensis may serve as attractive mines of powerful anticancer and antioxidant agents for various purposes.
