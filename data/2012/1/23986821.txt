Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rarely metastasizes to the extra ocular muscles (EOMs). We present a case of bilateral metastasis of HCC to the EOMs and focus on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features. Orbital MRI revealed nodular enlargement of bilateral multiple EOMs, with isointensity on T1-weighted images and heterogeneous, intermediate-to-high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and showed mild-to-significant heterogeneous contrast enhancement with gadolinium. Physicians should be aware of this rare cause of EOM enlargement, understand the radiologic characteristics of EOM metastasis, and thus make appropriate treatment strategy.
