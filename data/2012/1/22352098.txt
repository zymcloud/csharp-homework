Objective:To determine the correlation of elevated serum Alpha feto-protein with tumour size in hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:A cross-sectional analytical study was done at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, Medical Unit-III, Ward-7 from January 2009 to June 2010. Patients enrolled in study were known cases of chronic liver disease and were complicated by development of hepatocellular carcinoma; those having metastasis in liver from any where were excluded. Demographic data such as age, gender, residence, were recorded. Detailed clinical history and examination were carried out and recorded in a preformed Performa. Complete blood count, liver function test, total protein, Albumin/Globulin (A/G) ratio, serum Albumin, HBsAg, anti HCV, alpha fetoprotein, ultrasound guided liver biopsy, ultrasound whole abdomen and/or CTscan Abdomen for size and number of tumour were also done. On the basis of alfa fetoprotein level patients were divided in to 3 groups; Group I with normal AFP ( or =400 iu/ml). On the basis of tumour size patients were also divided in to 3 groups; group A 5 cm. Correlation of serum AFP levels with tumor size was analyzed by applying Spearman's rank correlation with r-values of 0.01 being considered significant.Results:Review of the clinical data of 98 patients male 69 (70.4%) and female were 29 (29.6%) with mean age of 53.89 +/- 12.511 ranging from 32 to 82 years was done. Of these there were 22 (22.4%), 25 (25.5%), 51(52%) cases in group 1, 2, 3 respectively. While in tumour size groups, 17 (17.3%) were in group A, 35 (35.7%) in group B and 46 (46.9%) in group C. There was a significant correlation of serum AFP level with tumour size in hepatocellular carcinoma. (r=0.472, 0.0001).Conclusion:Our study suggests that serum AFP has significant correlation with the size of tumour. AFP level may serve as a useful marker for detection of Hepatocellular carcinoma and to differentiate between early and advance stage. On the basis of this proper treatment strategy can be planned.
