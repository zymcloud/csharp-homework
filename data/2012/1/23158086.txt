Although most laparoscopic hepatic procedures are performed for benign disease, an increasing fraction is for malignant disease, including primary and metastatic liver tumors. Data suggest that minor and major hepatic resections are feasible and can be performed safely. The limited data currently available suggest that survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal metastatic disease may be comparable to that achieved with open hepatectomy. The benefits of the laparoscopic approach seem to be shorter hospitalization, smaller incisions, and less blood loss. Despite the progress to date, concern continues about the potential for significant intraoperative hemorrhagic complications and oncologic outcomes.
