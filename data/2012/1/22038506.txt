Background:Increased expression of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) has been observed in many tumor types, but the role of HMGB1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unknown.Aims:To examine the effects of RNA interference HMGB1 on the bioactivity of HCC cell line HCCLM3.Methods:We synthesized three specific small interfering RNAs of HMGB1 (HMGB1-siRNAs) and transfected these into HCCLM3 cells by use of Lipofectamine 2000. RT-PCR and Western blot were performed to determine the effects of HMGB1-siRNAs on HMGB1 expression and to detect NF-ÎºB/p65 and VEGF-C expression after transfection of HMGB1-siRNAs into HCCLM3. In vitro proliferation was assessed by MTT assay. Migration and invasive ability were determined by use of the Transwell assay. Apoptosis was demonstrated by flow cytometry.Results:RT-PCR and Western blotting showed that all three specific HMGB1-siRNAs significantly inhibited HMGB1 expression, with inhibition by HMGB1-siRNA-1 being highest (70-80%). MTT assay demonstrated that the growth of cells transfected with HMGB1-siRNA-1 was significantly lower than that of control cells (P Conclusion:Downregulation of HMGB1 could obviously inhibit the growth of HCCLM3 cells, and their migration and invasion ability. HMGB1 may serve as a potential target for treatment of HCC.
