Viral hepatitides are important public health problems in humans. The etiologic agents were not identified until 1965, when Baruch S. Blumberg found the relationship of Australia antigen to serum hepatitis. The antigen was found to be the surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). This observation launched a new era in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of hepatitis B. Over 15-20 years, the natural history of HBV infection was elucidated, and more importantly, an effective vaccine became available. The routes of transmission were also made clear, rendering effective interruption of the transmission possible. The vaccine together with effective interruption of the transmission contributed greatly to the control of HBV infection. However, these measures do very little for those who have already been chronically infected. Fortunately, specific therapies against chronic hepatitis B started to appear about 10-15 years before, and the treatments have improved substantially in the last few years. Although far from perfect, effective means to treat those who are chronically infected now exist. In Taiwan, acute and chronic liver diseases were rampant as early as the beginning of the last century. Studies around 1975, showed an extremely high prevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection in the general population (15-20%), and 80-90% of the chronic liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma were caused by chronic infection with the HBV. This important health problem caught the attention of the government in the late 1970s, and a government-sponsored control program was finalized in 1981. Accordingly, a mass vaccination program against hepatitis B, primarily aiming at immunizing newborn infants, was launched on July 1, 1984. Twenty years after implementation of the program, the hepatitis B carrier rate in children covered by the program decreased by 85%, from âˆ¼ 15% to
