The role of microRNA-195 in developing acquired drug resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma cells was investigated. Expression proÔ¨Åling of miRNAs revealed a limited set of miRNAs with altered expression in drug resistant hepatocellular carcinoma cell line BEL-7402/5-FU compared to its parental BEL-7402 cell line. Real-time PCR confirmed down-regulation of miRNA-195 in BEL-7402/5-FU cells. Overexpression of miRNA-195 sensitized BEL-7402/5-FU cells to anticancer drugs. Consistent with these findings, miR-195 antisense oligonucleotide induced drug resistance in BEL-7402/5-FU cells. Also, the basal levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-w were high in BEL-7402/5-FU cells and miR-195 overexpression repressed Bcl-w protein level and inhibited the luciferase activity of a Bcl-w 3' untranslated region-based reporter construct in both BEL-7402/5-FU and BEL-7402 cells. These results indicate that miR-195 could improve the drug sensitivity at least in part by targeting Bcl-w to increase cell apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
