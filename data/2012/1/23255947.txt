A previous study reported that combinatorial human endostatin and soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL) gene transfer suppresses human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth and angiogenesis using the pVAX1 plasmid vector. The current study investigated the antitumor efficacy in HCC through adenovirus-mediated combination gene therapy. Human endostatin and sTRAIL (114 to 281 AA) genes were amplified and cloned into the Adeno-X expression vector. The recombinant adenoviruses (Ad-E and Ad-T) were packaged, amplified in the HEK 293 cells and used to infect human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and HepG2 cells, respectively. The results revealed that a significant cell growth inhibition was observed in the two types of cells using a cell viability assay. Intratumoral administration with Ad-E and Ad-T revealed a significant enhanced regression of the tumors compared with treatment with either recombinant adenovirus alone. Histology and immunohistochemistry examination further indicated that the inhibition of tumor growth appeared to result from increased apoptosis and reduced angiogenesis in tumor xenografts. In conclusion, these data further confirm the enhancement of antitumor efficacy through combined endostatin and TRAIL gene therapy and provide a promising application prospect by virtue of adenovirus-mediated anti-angiogenic and pro-apoptotic cancer gene therapy.
