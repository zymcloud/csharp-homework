Antioxidants are one of the key players in tumorigenesis, several natural and synthetic antioxidants were shown to have anticancer effects. The aim of the present study is to divulge the chemopreventive nature of carvacrol during diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced liver cancer in male wistar albino rats. Administration of DEN to rats resulted in increased relative liver weight and serum marker enzymes aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (Î³GT). The levels of lipid peroxides elevated (in both serum and tissue) with subsequent decrease in the final body weight and tissue antioxidants like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR). Carvacrol supplementation (15 mg/kg body weight) significantly attenuated these alterations, thereby showing potent anticancer effect in liver cancer. Histological observations and transmission electron microscopy studies were also carried out, which added supports to the chemopreventive action of the carvacrol against DEN-induction during liver cancer progression. These findings suggest that carvacrol prevents lipid peroxidation, hepatic cell damage, and protects the antioxidant system in DEN-induced hepatocellular carcinogenesis.
