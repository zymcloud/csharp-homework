γ-glutamyl transferase isoenzyme II (GGT-II) is a sensitive biomarker of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, numerous disadvantages of the traditional manual method affected its application. The commercial kit provided a convenient and fast method for the determination of GGT-II levels. The purposes of the present study were to compare the reproducibility and sensitivity between the manual and commercial kit methods and to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency for HCC with the combined analysis of GGT-II, α-L-fucosidase (AFU) and α-fetoprotein (AFP). In patients with various liver diseases (HCC, liver cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis) and normal subjects, GGT-II was detected by manual and commercial polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The levels of AFU and AFP were assayed by colorimetry and a chemiluminescence immunoassay, respectively. The commercial PAGE had equal diagnostic efficiency with traditional manual PAGE and no significant differences were observed in intra- and average-gel reproducibility and GGT-II sensitivities between the manual and commercial PAGE (P>0.05). The incidence of GGT-II detected by commercial PAGE in HCC patients was 84.1% and 636.5 μmol/l h and AFP >44.0 μg/l, respectively. There were no significant correlations between GGT-II and AFU or AFP. Combined detection of GGT-II with AFU or AFP increased the diagnostic sensitivity to 92.9 and 93.8%, respectively. These results suggest that commercial PAGE provides a simple and reproducible method for GGT-II detection. Combined determination of GGT-II with AFU or AFP exhibited superior sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of HCC.
