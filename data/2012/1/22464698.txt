Objective:To analyze the prognosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence after liver transplantation.Methods:Thirty-eight patients (37 males; 1 female) with HBV-related end-stage liver disease underwent liver transplantation at our institute between December 1998 and November 2009 and experienced HBV recurrence. Clinical data from pre-transplant and follow-up examinations were retrospectively retrieved from medical records, and included serologic indices of HBV (HBV DNA, markers of liver function) and histological findings from liver biopsy.Results:The median follow-up time was 45.1 months. The median time to HBV recurrence after transplantation was 31.8 months (range: 0.3 to 72.8 months) for histologically benign cases and 13.7 months (range: 0.3 to 66.6 months) for malignant cases. HBV DNA gene mutations were detected in 21% (8/38) of cases. Eighteen patients were treated with entecavir or adefovir, with respect to gene mutations, and HBV DNA fell below 103 copies/ml and liver function became normal. Twenty-two patients died, and causes of death included hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, n=18), organ failure (n=2), or infection (n=1).Conclusion:HBV gene mutations and HCC recurrence were important risk factors for HBV recurrence in our study population. In addition, patients with benign liver diseases who received salvage therapy with adefovir or entecavir achieved a satisfactory prognosis.
