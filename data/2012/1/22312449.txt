The prevalence of obesity and obesity related comorbidities including diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been rising globally. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is emerging as a common liver disease among adults which can lead to the eventual development of complications including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. With the rise of obesity in children, the development of detection methods for the presence of NAFLD is becoming imperative. Although the gold standard for diagnosis is liver biopsy, practical issues limit pediatric use and warrant development of noninvasive or minimally invasive screening tools for the detection and staging of NAFLD. A variety of diagnostic methods have been studied including use aminotransferases, imaging studies and serologic markers which have some population-based limitations. Additional factors such as gender and ethnicity may also play a role in the screening of NAFLD in pediatric population studies.
