Purpose:We describe a new technique of ultrasound (US)-guided microwave coagulation (MC) of the Glissonean pedicle, performed before transection to control the inflow and select the resection area. This report introduces our procedure and evaluates the outcomes of patients treated using this technique.Methods:The Glissonean pedicles feeding the segment or cone unit were coagulated by US-guided MC, after which transection was performed. We used this US-guided MC technique to perform anatomical resections in 12 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (MC group). We compared the outcomes of this group with those of a historical group of 10 patients who underwent conventional hepatectomy (control group). The two groups were well matched for age, tumor size, location, and type of hepatectomy.Results:The mean operative times were similar, but the mean blood loss was significantly lower the in MC group than in the control group. Recurrence developed in four patients from the MC group, but local recurrence was not observed. Bile leakage occurred in one patient from the MC group, but the incidences of postoperative complications did not differ between the groups.Conclusions:Our procedure allows anatomical resection to be performed safely and easily, and helps prevent intrahepatic metastasis via portal flow during the transection.
