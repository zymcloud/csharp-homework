Occult HBV infection (OBI) is a threat for the safety of blood-supply, and has been associated with the onset of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma and lymphomagenesis. Nevertheless, genetic markers in HBsAg (particularly in D-genotype, the most common in Europe) significantly associated with OBI in vivo are missing. Thus, the goal of this study is to define: (i) prevalence and clinical profile of OBI among blood-donors; (ii) HBsAg-mutations associated with OBI; (iii) their impact on HBsAg-detection. OBI was searched among 422,278 blood-donors screened by Nucleic-Acid-Testing. Following Taormina-OBI-definition, 26 (0.006%) OBI-patients were identified. Despite viremia
