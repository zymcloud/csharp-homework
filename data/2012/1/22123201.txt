Ethnopharmacological relevance:Macrothelypteris viridifrons is widely distributed in south of China and has been used as folk medicine to treat cancer, hydropsy, and traumatic bleeding.Aim of the study:To investigate the chemical constituents and the anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effects of Macrothelypteris viridifrons.Materials and methods:An HPLC-DAD/MS technique was used to determine the flavonoid profile of Macrothelypteris viridifrons. The anti-tumor effect of Macrothelypteris viridifrons was evaluated by in vivo mice bearing H22 hepatoma cells transplantation tumor model. And the anti-angiogenic activity was investigated by measuring the effects on the in vitro proliferation, migration, and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, the in vivo zebrafish model was applied to evaluate the anti-angiogenic effect of Macrothelypteris viridifrons.Results:18 flavonoids were identified from Macrothelypteris viridifrons. Administration of Macrothelypteris viridifrons significantly inhibited the tumor growth and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and CD34. Meanwhile, Macrothelypteris viridifrons showed significant inhibition on proliferation, migration and tube formation of HUVECs in vitro and the intersegmental vessels formation in zebrafish model.Conclusions:Macrothelypteris viridifrons showed significant anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effects and might be developed as a novel anti-tumor drug.
