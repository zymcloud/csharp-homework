Objectives:The purpose of this review was to compare the mortality rates for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-seropositive renal transplant (RT) patients versus HBsAg-seropositive persons of the general population.Methods:A comprehensive search was performed to identify cohort studies of HBsAg-seropositive RT patients with at least 4 years of follow-up. Data were analyzed as outlined below. HCC was a rare event in regions of low and intermediate seroprevalence of HBsAg. Subsequently, studies from low and intermediate seroprevalence areas were analyzed separately from those of high seroprevalence areas.Results:Thirty-one retrospective studies that followed 1277 seropositive RT patients were identified for inclusion. The studies were pooled and compared to four different general population studies that included 12558 seropositive persons using Poisson methods. The mortality rate of HCC was increased in low and intermediate seroprevalence areas (RR 7.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.93-15.0; RR 9.92, 95% CI 5.38-18.3). In high seroprevalence areas, the mortality rate of HCC was increased compared to one population study, but not another (RR 2.76, 95% CI 1.64-4.63; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.61-1.69).Conclusions:Mortality due to HCC was increased in low and intermediate seroprevalence areas, but the evidence was inconclusive for high seroprevalence areas.
