Clinical/methodical issue:Minimally invasive treatment procedures, such as image-guided local tumour ablation have gained increasing relevance in oncologic concepts. Limitations of thermal ablation procedures have led to the development of percutaneous, computed tomography (CT) guided brachytherapy.Standard radiological methods:Thermal ablation procedures, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and laser-induced thermotherapy (LITT) show limitations regarding maximum tumour size (Methodical innovations:The image-guided interstitial brachytherapy allows the single application of high-dose rate (HDR) irradiation with an extensive protracted cytotoxic effect. Adjacent risk structures play a minor role due to the steep dose gradient outside the clinical target volume.Performance:Studies using CT-guided brachytherapy resulted in a local tumour control rate of approximately 90% after 12 months in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 70-90% in the treatment of colorectal metastases or cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC). Similar response rates were also seen in the treatment of metastases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or neuroendocrine tumours. In colorectal liver metastases and HCC the method has proven to have a positive impact on prognosis.Achievements:In contrast to thermal ablation the method can be used without restriction with respect to tumour location. Cooling effects do not play a role. It has already been applied in more than 5,000 cases and it is used in clinical routine.Practical recommendations:Image-guided brachytherapy is safe and effective and has found its way into the clinical routine.
