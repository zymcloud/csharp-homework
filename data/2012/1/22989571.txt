Co-existence of multiple causes of liver injury increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. HCC usually develops in patients with cirrhosis although it may also occur in individuals with no or mild liver disease, in particular in cases with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Here we report the case of a 43year-old man with HFE-haemochromatosis, seronegative for hepatitis B and C infections, who developed HCC in the absence of severe liver damage. Both tumoural and non-tumoural liver DNA extracts were tested by nested-PCR and primers specific for four different HBV genomic regions in order to evaluate the presence of occult HBV infection. Only X gene sequences were detected in tumour (but not in non-tumour) DNA extracts. HBV-Alu PCR showed a HBV integration involving a 5'-deleted X gene with an intact enhancer-II/basal-core promoter region. The viral-host junction sequencing revealed that this integrant was located upstream of the partitioning-defective-6-homolog-gamma gene (PARD6G) and real time-PCR quantification demonstrated that PARD6G was overexpressed in tumour compared to non-tumour liver tissues. In conclusion, the combination of HFE-haemochromatosis and occult HBV infection in this patient might have led to a sequel of cellular events that determined the development of HCC even in the absence of cirrhosis.
