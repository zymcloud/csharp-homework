Background:Posterosuperior liver segments are the most difficult locations for laparoscopy to access. This location is considered by most surgeons to be a poor indication for a laparoscopic liver resection due to the limited visualization and the difficulty of controlling bleeding. The liver-hanging maneuver (LHM) is a technique taking aim at reducing intraoperative blood loss through an open approach.Methods:We report our early experience on adopting a modified liver-hanging technique to perform a totally laparoscopic right posterior sectionectomy to remove a 5-cm hepatocellular carcinoma located in Couinaud's segments 6 and 7.Results:The procedure was completed laparoscopically with acceptable time of surgery and blood loss. A 3.5-cm tumor-free resection margin was achieved. The patient was discharged on postoperative Day 10 without complications. No evidence of recurrence was seen at the 12-month follow-up.Conclusions:Total laparoscopic posterior sectionectomy using a modified LHM is a possible operative procedure greatly facilitating surgical manipulation. This maneuver was successfully used to mobilize the liver, to guide the hepatic transection, and to prevent bleeding. The potential advantages of this procedure should be evaluated in a comparative study on a large number of patients.
