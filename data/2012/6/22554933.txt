Drosha regulates the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) and plays an essential role in the regulation of gene expression. Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. It is also a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. Emerging evidence suggests that HBV alters miRNA expression profiles, but the mechanisms underlying this process have not yet been fully elucidated. We therefore examined how HBV affected the production of miRNAs. We found that Drosha mRNA and protein expression were downregulated in cells expressing the HBV genome. This was associated with a reduction in the activity of the Drosha gene promoter. Gene silencing of HBx by RNA interference significantly restored the expression of Drosha. In conclusion, our data show that HBV could downregulate Drosha expression by inhibiting promoter activity, and the transcription factors SP1 and AP-2Î± may be involved in this process. This provides a new understanding of the mechanism of HBV-induced miRNAs dysregulation.
