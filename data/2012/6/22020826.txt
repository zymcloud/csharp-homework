Background and aims:This study was part of an on-going randomized controlled trial to investigate the utility of computed tomography (CT) during hepatic arteriography and arterial portography (CTHA/CTAP) as a pre-treatment examination for patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 137 patients with HCC who were diagnosed by dynamic CT showing hyperattenuation in the arterial phase and hypoattenuation in the equilibrium phase, were Child-Pugh class A, and had three or less tumors with diameters â‰¤ 3.0 cm were randomly assigned to undergo CTHA/CTAP. We compared the diagnostic utilities of CTHA/CTAP and dynamic CT. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses with stepwise variable selection were performed to identify factors related to the detection of additional nodules.Results:The total number of HCCs at the time of diagnosis with contrast-enhanced dynamic CT was 197. 75 nodules with a mean diameter of 8.7 mm (range 2-20) in 45 patients (32.8%) were additionally diagnosed as definite HCC on CTHA/CTAP compared with dynamic CT. A retrospective review revealed that 54 nodules could have been identified on arterial or equilibrium phase of the previous dynamic CT, whereas 21 were indiscernible. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that multinodularity on dynamic CT [odds ratio (OR) = 5.35, P = 0.002], recurrent case as opposed to initial case (OR = 2.16, P = 0.06), and seronegativity for hepatitis B surface antigen (OR = 10.0, P = 0.03) were associated with the detection of additional nodules.Conclusion:CTHA/CTAP may be useful for detecting additional nodules prior to percutaneous ablation in patients with multinodular HCC on dynamic CT, in recurrent cases, and in hepatitis B surface antigen-negative cases.
