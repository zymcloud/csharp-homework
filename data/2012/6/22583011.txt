Objectives:miRNAs are frequently deregulated in cancer and have shown promise as tissue-based markers for cancer classification and prognostication. Emerging evidence indicates that miR-17-5p plays an important role in carcinogenesis. However, the expression of miR-17-5p in HCC tissues and its clinical relevance has not been systematically studied yet, and whether miR-17-5p expression has influence on prognosis of HCC is still unknown. In this study, we investigate the expression and clinical significance of miR-17-5p in human HCC.Methods:The expression levels of miR-17-5p were measured in 120 paired hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and paracarcinomatous liver tissues (PCLTs) derived from patients who underwent hepatic resection by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, the correlation of miR-17-5p levels with clinicopathologic variables and prognosis was analyzed.Results:miR-17-5p was significantly upregulated in HCCs (p Conclusion:miR-17-5p is highly elevated in HCC, especially in HCC with metastasis. miR-17-5p can serve as a novel prognostic marker for HCC.
