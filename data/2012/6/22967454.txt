Objective:To compare the results of application of Qu single abdominal aorta clamping for bloodless hepatectomy and Pringle hepatectomy in 118 cases of liver tumors.Methods:The clinical data of 118 patients, including 59 patients undergoing Qu single abdominal aorta clamping for bloodless hepatectomy (Group QG) and 59 patients undergone Pringle first hepatic portal clamping hepatectomy (Group PG) since March 2009 in the Ningbo Tumor Hospital and Jiangxi Provincial Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. The changes of blood pressure, oxygen saturation, urine volume, intravenous fluid volume, amount of bleeding, time of abdominal aorta (or first hepatic portal) clamping, duration of operation and anesthesia, and other intraoperative indexes of the two groups were compared, and the changes of peritoneal drainage, blood tests, liver functions, etc. before operation and 1, 3, 7, 14 days after the hepatectomy in the two groups were also analyzed.Results:After taking appropriate measures for intraoperative blood pressure control, only small fluctuations of blood pressure, which could be safely adjusted and controlled with stable vital signs, was observed in the group QG. The amount of intraoperative bleeding in the group QG was (96.25 ± 18.45) ml, significantly less than (536.25 ± 35.65) ml in the group PG (P Conclusions:For liver tumor patients, Qu single abdominal aorta clamping for bloodless hepatectomy can basically achieve the goal of bloodless hepatectomy. This surgical operation is simple and safe, worthy of recommendation to skillful liver surgeons in hospitals there are some difficulties of blood supply.
