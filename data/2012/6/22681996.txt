Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is a rare disease defined by congestive hepatopathy with obstruction of the hepatic venous outflow tract. Classical symptoms and signs include ascites, hepatomegaly, abdominal pain and various degrees of liver dysfunction. BCS is predominantly caused by thrombosis, malformations and venous compression. We present a case, in which BCS was the cause of liver cirrhosis complicated with refractory ascites and which can be misinterpreted as hepatocellular carcinoma nodules. The diagnosis was confirmed during the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure with successful vascular stenting resolving the ascites formation.
