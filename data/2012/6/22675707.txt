Aims:To evaluate the sonographic changes observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) post antiangiogenic treatment with sorafenib.Patients and methods:Twenty one intermediate or advanced HCC patients (19 men, 2 women; mean age: 66.8 years; 32 target tumors-TTs) received sorafenib as monotherapy and were studied with unenhanced ultrasonography (US) and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) with a second generation echo-enhancer (SonoVue) at bimonthly intervals. Changes in lesional size, echotexture and enhancement were evaluated. Response was classified according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) and modified (m) RECIST.Results:Cystic changes were detected on US in 4 patients (7 lesions); CEUS showed a significant (51-100%) decrease of viable, enhancing TTs in the aforementioned patients. Four additional patients (5 lesions) showed a 73-87% decrease of their viable TTs on CEUS, but no changes on US. 13/21 patients showed less than 30% decrease, no change, or increase of their viable TTs. Based on the last sonographic evaluation, response was as follows: RECIST- Complete Response, CR (n=0), Partial Response, PR (n=1), Stable Disease, SD (n=16), Progressive Disease, PD (n=4); mRECIST- CR (n=2), PR (n=6), SD (n=11), PD (n=2). The 8 responders (CR+PR) according to mRECIST had significantly longer mean overall survival (OS) compared to the 13 non-responders (21.5 vs 12.2 months, p=0.018, Kaplan-Meier method). However, statistical significance was reduced (p=0.065) after adjustment for BCLC and Child's class.Conclusion:US may occasionally detect changes indicative of the effect of sorafenib on HCC, but CEUS is required to evaluate and grade post-therapeutic reduction of tumoral enhancement. The latter is likely to correlate with OS.
