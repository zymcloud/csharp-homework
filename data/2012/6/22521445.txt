Primary liver cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent tumors representing the fifth commonest malignancy worldwide and the third cause of mortality from cancer. Currently, the treatments for HCC are not so effective and new strategies are needed for its fight. Chemoprevention, the use of natural or synthetic chemical agents to reverse, suppress or prevent carcinogenesis is considered an important way for confronting HCC. Many of the chemopreventive agents are phytochemicals, namely non-nutritive plant chemicals with protective or disease preventive properties. In this review, we focus on plant polyphenols, one of the most important classes of phytochemicals, their chemopreventive properties against HCC and discuss the molecular mechanisms accounting for this activity.
