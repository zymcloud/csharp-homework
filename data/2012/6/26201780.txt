Purpose:We investigated whether the combined presence and evolution of hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutant strains in the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive status can predict clinical outcomes after HBeAg seroconversion.Methods:One hundred and eighty-six patients with spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion were enrolled into this longitudinal study. The sequences of pre-S, core promoter, and precore regions were determined at study entry and at the visit immediately before HBeAg seroconversion.Results:Age â‰¥40 years at HBeAg seroconversion, male sex, and higher HBV DNA levels at entry were independent predictors for HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Patients with combined mutations of pre-S deletions and T1762/A1764 had a significantly increased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to patients with the wild type at both genomic regions. Combinations of pre-S deletions and T1762/A1764 were found on the same HBV genome by cloning analysis of full-length HBV genomes. Patients with a persistent presence of pre-S deletions and T1762/A1764 mutations, and new development of pre-S deletions in the HBeAg-positive status were significantly at an increased risk of HBeAg-negative CHB, cirrhosis, and HCC after HBeAg seroconversion than those with a persistent presence of the wild type at both genomic regions. After adjusting the other risk factors, the evolution of pre-S deletions was an independent predictor for cirrhosis [hazard ratio (HR): 1.52, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.02-2.25] and HCC (HR: 4.0, 95 % CI 1.6-10.1).Conclusions:The combined presence and evolution of pre-S deletions and T1762/A1764 in the HBeAg-positive status was a useful factor significantly predictive of clinical outcomes in patients with spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion.
