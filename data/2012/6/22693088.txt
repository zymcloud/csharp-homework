Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent primitive hepatic tumor, the fifth most common cancer in the world,and the third highest cause of cancer-related mortality. The presence of cirrhosis is the main risk factor.Aim:To describe the epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic features of HCC.Methods:Retrospective study including all the patients with HCC occurring in cirrhotic liver followed in the gastroenterological department of Charles Nicolle hospital between 1997 and 2009.Results:A hundred and one patient were enrolled; 64 men and 37 women with a median age of 65.4 years (31-88 years). Cirrhosis was due to viral hepatitis B or C in 25.7% and 62.2% of cases respectively and was classified Child Pugh A, B and C in 30.7%,50.5% and 18.8% of patients respectively. HCC was inaugural in most cases (68.3 %) and it was revealed by a tumoral syndrome in 38.6% of cases, by decompensation in 22.7% and was discovered during systematic screening when cirrhosis was already known in 19.8% of cases. Diagnosis of HCC was non invasive, relying on imaging and alphafetoprotein in most cases (95%). 84 patients(83.2%) had an advanced HCC, with vascular or extra hepatic spread in 58 (57.5%) of them. Treatment was curative in 14 cases, based on surgical resection in one case and percutaneous ablation in 13 cases.Six patients received transarterial chemoembolization as a palliative treatment. In 71 patients, only symptomatic treatment was given. The median survival time was 11 months.Conclusion:In the majority of the cases, HCC was diagnosed at an advanced stage and treatment was only symptomatic.
