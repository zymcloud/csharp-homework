Background & aims:We aimed at improving prediction of short-term mortality in cirrhotic inpatients by evaluating C-reactive protein (CRP) as a surrogate marker of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).Methods:One-hundred and forty-eight consecutive cirrhotic patients with Child-Pugh score ≥ B8 and without hepatocellular carcinoma were prospectively included and followed for 182 days. The primary end point was 6-month survival.Results:Main baseline characteristics were as follows: alcoholic liver disease in 88.5%; bacterial infection in 37%; hepatorenal syndrome in 7% of cases. CRP range was 1-240 mg/L (median 26 mg/L); 42 patients (28.4%) had SIRS as defined by ACCP/SCCM-criteria. CRP levels were higher in patients with SIRS (50 vs. 21 mg/L; pConclusions:In Child-Pugh score ≥ B8 cirrhotic patients, persistent CRP levels ≥ 29 mg/L predicted short-term mortality independently of age, MELD, and co-morbidities, and better than infection or clinically-assessed SIRS.
