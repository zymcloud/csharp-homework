Objective:Although hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) demonstrates characteristic hypervascularity, some HCCs have a hypovascular pattern on computed tomography (CT). Cytokeratin 19 (CK19) is a marker for the biliary phenotype reflecting a poor prognosis. We assessed the prognostic implications of tumor vascularity and its association with CK19 expression in HCC.Methods:Patients that underwent surgical resection for HCC were included. Tumor vascularity was evaluated according to the arterial enhancement patterns on CT scans and CK19 expression was evaluated by using tissue microarray methods.Results:One hundred and forty patients were included. Their median follow-up duration was 55.0 months, and 92 (65.7%) patients had tumor recurrence. Forty-five patients (30.6%) had hypovascular HCC at the time of diagnosis, and they showed a significantly higher CK19 expression rate (32.5% vs. 8.2%, P = 0.001) and earlier recurrence rate within 6 months (hazard ratio (HR), 2.301; P = 0.025) compared to the patients with hypervascular HCCs. Hypovascularity (HR, 1.694; P = 0.045) was an independent risk factor for short overall survival.Conclusions:Hypovascular HCCs were associated with early recurrence and short overall survival, and CK19 was more frequently expressed in hypovascular HCC than in hypervascular tumors. Therefore, tumor vascularity on CT images might be utilized in determining the prognosis of patients with HCCs.
