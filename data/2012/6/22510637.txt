Hepatitis B remains a significant health issue and a leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Transmission of the hepatitis B virus, despite the availability of the vaccine, still occurs, particularly in the perinatal setting. Studies have shown that mothers with active viremia especially those with very high viral levels (>10⁸ copies/mL or >10⁷ IU/mL) are at increased risk of hepatitis B virus transmission, even with appropriate immunoprophylaxis at birth. With the development of new and relatively safe oral antiviral therapies, assessment with the mother about the risks and benefits of antiviral therapy should be discussed in those with highest transmission risk.
