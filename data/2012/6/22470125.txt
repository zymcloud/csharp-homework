Metadherin (MTDH), which is an HIV-1 or TNF-Î±-inducible transcript, has a crucial role in several types of cancer by regulating multiple cellular signaling processes. However, to date, the role of MTDH in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unclear. In the present study, we detected MTDH expression in normal liver, chronic hepatitis B and HBV-related HCC tissues. The data showed that MTDH expression levels were elevated in the hepatitis B tissues and especially in the HBV-related HCC tissues compared to normal liver tissues. There was a trend for gradually increased MTDH expression from normal liver tissue to hepatitis B and HBV-related HCC tissues. Furthermore, a statistical analysis revealed that MTDH expression significantly correlated with the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC, 7th edition) stage (P=0.020), T classification (P=0.007), N classification (P=0.044), vascular invasion (P=0.006) and histological differentiation (P=0.020) in the HBV-related HCC patients. In addition, patients with high MTDH levels had shorter survival times compared to those with low MTDH expression (P=0.001). Taken together, these results suggest that MTDH could be a potential prognostic marker for overall survival and tumor progression and a chemotherapeutic target in HBV-related HCC patients.
