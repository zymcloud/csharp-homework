Two new daphnane diterpenoids (1 and 2), together with four known analogues (3-6) were isolated from Trigonostemon xyphophylloides. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis. Compounds 1 and 2 were evaluated for in vitro cytotoxic activities against the SPCA-1 (human lung cancer) and BEL-7402 (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cancer cell lines. Trigoxyphin I (2) showed modest cytotoxicity against two tumor cell lines.
