Background/aims:The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of HBV-induced Mig and role of autophagy in the process.Methodology:Adxsi-1.3 x HBV plasmid was constructed and identified. The three cell lines (L02, HepG2, SMMC-7721) were infected with adenovirus-HBV. HBsAg and HBeAg were assessed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. HBV DNA, HBx, Beclin 1 and Mig expression were detected by quantitative real-Time PCR, western blotting and ELISA. The level of autophagy was evaluated by transmission electron microscope.Results:Human fetal liver cells and hepatocellular carcinoma cells were successfully transfected with overlength HBV genome using an adenovirus vector (Ad-HBV). Ad-HBV induced Mig production and cell autophagy through up-regulation of Beclin 1 expression. We further demonstrated that the increased autophagy extent was in association with HBV-induced Mig expression.Conclusions:Autophagy may be a crucial intracellular mechanism of Mig induction in response to HBV infection. The results provide new insights into the pathogenesis of HBV.
