High expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with breast cancer has been associated with a poor prognosis, indicating that VEGF could be linked to the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. It has also been suggested that radiation resistance is partly due to tumour cell production of angiogenic cytokines, particularly VEGF receptor (VEGFR). This evidence indicates that inhibition of VEGFR might enhance the radiation response. Sorafenib tosylate (Bay 54-9085) is an oral, small-molecule multikinase inhibitor of several targets including RAF/MEK/ERK MAP kinase signalling, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta. Sorafenib has shown clinical efficacy in treating solid tumours such as renal cell and hepatocellular carcinomas. However, strategies are yet to be identified to prolong and maximize the anticancer effect of this multikinase inhibitor. The objective of this study was to determine whether a combination of Sorafenib and radiation will enhance the treatment response in vitro and in vivo. Radio-modulating effect of Sorafenib was assessed by performing clonogenic assays. In addition, cell cycle analyses as well as annexin-V apoptosis assays were performed 24 and 48 h after treatment, respectively. To confirm our in-vitro results, tumour growth delay assays were performed. Our results showed a strong and supra-additive antitumour effect of radiation combined with Sorafenib in vitro (dose enhancement factor of 1.76). The combined therapy demonstrated a strong and significant G2/M cell cycle arrest (combined treatment vs. irradiated alone: P
