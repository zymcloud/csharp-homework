A biopsy-proven fat-containing metastasis to the adrenal gland in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma demonstrated low density on nonenhanced CT, heterogeneity on contrast-enhanced CT, and marked signal loss on opposed-phase gradient-echo MRI, mimicking an adrenal adenoma. However, the mass was not present on older studies and showed increased FDG uptake on PET. The possibility of a fat-containing metastasis should be considered for an apparent adrenal adenoma in a patient with a primary hepatocellular carcinoma.
