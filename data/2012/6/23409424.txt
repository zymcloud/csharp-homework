A 26-year-old female presented with abdominal pain and distension in 2003. Clinical evaluation and imaging were suggestive of bilateral benign renal solid masses. Fine needle aspiration showed tubular cells only. Patient was kept under periodic follow up. She reported 4 years later with increase in pain and size of masses, and underwent bilateral staged nephron sparing surgery. The histopathology was reported as bilateral oncocytoma. Two years after surgery, she developed epidural spinal cord compression and liver metastasis. A decompression laminectomy and biopsy revealed conventional renal cell carcinoma (RCC). To our knowledge this is the first case report of sporadic bilateral synchronous hybrid RCC and oncocytoma in a young woman, with spinal epidural metastasis.
