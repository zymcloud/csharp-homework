To identify the integration sites in the host genome for the hepatitis B virus (HBV)-encoded X protein (HBx) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) biopsies that are positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). HCC biopsies were obtained from six patients that were HBV carriers, as demonstrated by the presence of HBsAg in their serum and sero-negativity for antibody to HBsAg. DNA was extracted from the tissue, fractionated, and circularized. Primers were designed according to the HBx sequence and used to amplify the circularized DNA templates by inverse polymerase chain reaction (IPCR). The amplified DNA fragments were checked by electrophoresis, cloned into the PMD18-T expression vector, and sequenced. Sequence alignment was performed by the Blast algorithms. Seven electrophoresis bands yielded 22 sequencing results, which represented a total of three HBx integration sites in the host genome: 19q12, 2q32.2, 22q12. The 19q12 integration site encompasses the CCNE1 gene, which encodes a G1/S-specific cyclin-E1. HBx-related integration sites exist in HBsAg-positive HCC biopsies. The CCNE1 gene may play a role in the development of HBx-related HCC.
