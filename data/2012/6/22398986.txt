Developmental exposure to inorganic arsenic is carcinogenic in humans and mice, and adult offspring of mice exposed to inorganic arsenic can develop tumors of the lung, liver, adrenal, uterus, and ovary. It has been suggested that methylarsonous acid (MMA3+), a product of the biological methylation of inorganic arsenic, could be a key carcinogenic species. Thus, pregnant CD1 mice were provided drinking water containing MMA3+ at 0 (control), 12.5, or 25 parts per million (ppm) from gestational days 8 to 18. Tumors were assessed in groups of male or female (initial n = 25) offspring up to 2 years of age. In utero treatment had no effect on survival or body weights. Female offspring exhibited increases in total epithelial uterine tumors (control 0%; 12.5 ppm 26%; 25 ppm 30%), oviduct hyperplasia (control 4%; 12.5 ppm 35%; 25 ppm 43%), adrenal cortical adenoma at 25 ppm (control 0%; 12.5 ppm 9%; 25 ppm 26%), and total epithelial ovarian tumors (control 0%; 12.5 ppm 39%; 25 ppm 26%). Male offspring showed dose-related increases in hepatocellular carcinoma (control 0%; 12.5 ppm 12%; 25 ppm 22%), adrenal adenoma (control 0%; 12.5 ppm 28%; 25 ppm 17%), and lung adenocarcinoma (control 17%; 12.5 ppm 44%). Male offspring had unusual testicular lesions, including two rete testis carcinomas, two adenomas, and three interstitial cell tumors. Overall, maternal consumption of MMA3+ during pregnancy in CD1 mice produced some similar proliferative lesions as gestationally applied inorganic arsenic in the offspring during adulthood.
