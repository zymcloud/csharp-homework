Background and study aims:The aim of this study is to present the mortality trends of oesophageal cancer (EC) in the Iranian population, to provide updated information regarding time trends for this cancer.Patients and methods:We analysed the national death statistics reported by the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education from 1995 to 2004. EC [International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9); C15] were expressed as the annual mortality rates/100000, overall, by sex and by age group (<15, 15-49 and â‰¥ 50 years of age) and age standardised rate (ASR).Results:The age standardised mortality rate of EC increased dramatically during the study period. EC mortality was higher for males and the mortality rate also increased with age.Conclusion:This study provides a comprehensive projection for the burden of death due to EC, indicating that the trend of EC mortality dramatically increased in the recent decade.
