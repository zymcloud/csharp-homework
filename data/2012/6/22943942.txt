Objective:To evaluate the role of anatomic hepatectomy of hepatocellular carcinoma with bile duct tumor thrombi by application of persistent methylene blue dyeing method.Methods:From January 2009 to February 2011, 11 hepatocellular carcinoma patients with bile duct tumor thrombi underwent anatomic hepatectomy with removal of the biliary tumor thrombus. There were 10 male and 1 female patients. The average age was 49 years (ranging from 31 to 67 years). The initial symptom of 9 out of the 11 patients was jaundice. After anatomy and ligation of Glissonean pedicle of pre-resection segment, methylene blue was injected into its far-end portal vein in order to dye the segment.Results:Persistent methylene blue dyeing method was successful in all patients. Primary foci were found in all patients. Hepatectomy were performed, including 4 patients of segmentectomy, 3 patients of subsegmentectomy, 2 patients of hemihepatectomy, and 2 patients of hepatic sectionectomy. The mean operation time and blood loss was 137 minutes and 246 ml respectively. Severe complications such as liver function failure and sub-diaphragm abscess was avoided in all patients. No perioperative death. Post-operation radiotherapy was performed on 2 patients . Over a mean follow-up time of 14.6 months, liver cancer recurrence occurred in 2 patients, abdomen seeding metastasis in 1 patient, bile duct tumor thrombi recurrence in 1 case, and 2 patients died.Conclusions:Anatomic hepatectomy of hepatocellular carcinoma with bile duct tumor thrombi by application of persistent methylene blue dyeing method can make resection more precise and improve curative effect.
