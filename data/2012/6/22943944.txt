Objective:To investigate the clinic predictors of efficacy and adverse events of sorafenib in treating with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:From December 2008 to October 2011, 54 patients received sorafenib for unresectable or metastatic HCC. There were 46 male and 8 female patients. The mean age was 48.7 years (ranging from 21 to 77 years). Patients received sorafenib orally 400 mg twice daily on a continuous dosing schedule with 6 weeks counting as a single cycle. Tumor response was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor and toxicity grading was performed using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0. The relationship between different clinic variable factors and curative effects of sorafenib was analyzed by using Cox proportion hazard regression analysis.Results:HCC was etiological related to HBV in 52 patients (96.3%). Following sorafenib therapy, 2 patients (3.7%) achieved a partial response and 24 patients (44.4%) achieved stable disease, with a disease control rate of 48.1%. The median time to progression (TTP) was 3.8 months. Multivariate analysis showed that greater Child and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) grade were independent predictors of shorter TTP (HR = 1.361, 95%CI: 1.081 - 12.665, P = 0.041; HR = 1.449, 95%CI: 1.151 - 12.305, P = 0.032). The common adverse events were hand-foot syndrome (64.8%), alopecia (46.3%), and diarrhea (44.4%).Conclusions:Single-agent sorafenib demonstrates good efficacy and acceptable tolerability in treating advanced HCC. The presents of Child class A and ECOG performance grade 0 predict better response to sorafenib in advanced HCC patients.
