Aim:To evaluate whether total splenic artery embolization (TSAE) for patients with hypersplenism delivers better long-term outcomes than partial splenic embolization (PSE).Methods:Sixty-one patients with hypersplenism eligible for TSAE (n = 27, group A) or PSE (n = 34, group B) were enrolled into the trial, which included clinical and computed tomography follow-up. Data on technical success, length of hospital stay, white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PLT) counts, splenic volume and complications were collected at 2 wk, 6 mo, and 1, 2, 3, 4 years postoperatively.Results:Both TSAE and PSE were technically successful in all patients. Complications were significantly fewer (P = 0.001), and hospital stay significantly shorter (P = 0.007), in group A than in group B. Post-procedure WBC and PLT counts in group A were significantly higher than those in group B from 6 mo to 4 years (P = 0.001), and post-procedure residual splenic volume in group A was significantly less than that observed in group B at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years post-procedure (P = 0.001). No significant differences were observed in red blood cell counts and liver function parameters between the two groups following the procedure.Conclusion:Our results indicate that TSAE for patients with hypersplenism not only delivers a better long-term outcome, but is also associated with lower complication rates and a shorter hospital stay than PSE.
