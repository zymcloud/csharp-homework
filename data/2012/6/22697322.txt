Introduction:The purpose of this study is to determine the usefulness of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for evaluating the histological grade of differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared with T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and tumour haemodynamics.Methods:We retrospectively evaluated 32 patients with 42 pathologically confirmed HCC nodules. These patients underwent MRI, CT during arterial portography and CT hepatic arteriography. We evaluated the relationship between the histological grade of differentiation and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, conspicuity of tumour on DWI, DWI and T2WI contrast-to-noise (C/N) ratios and tumour haemodynamics.Results:There was no correlation between the histological grade of differentiation and the ADC values. The DWI C/N ratio was significantly different among all histological grades, but the T2WI C/N ratio was not. Tumour conspicuity on DWI correlated well with the histological grade of differentiation, but tumour haemodynamics only partially correlated with the histological grade of differentiation.Conclusion:DWI was useful for evaluating the histological grade of differentiation of HCC.
