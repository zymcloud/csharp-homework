Introduction and objectives:presently, the reference staging system to evaluate the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is "The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer" (BCLC) system. The value of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) has not been properly defined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the BCLC classification in our clinical practice and to know what the prognostic value of AFP is.Material and methods:136 consecutive HCC patients were prospectively included in this study. The diagnosis of HCC was based on the recommendation of international guidelines. The patients were studied and managed according to usual clinical practice. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and predictors of survival were identified using the Cox model.Results:110 patients (80.9%) were male. The mean age of the patients was 66.62 + or - 11.68 years. Liver cirrhosis was present in 91.2%. The most frequent cause of liver disease was hepatitis C infection (38.97%). Serum AFP was - or = 20 ng/mL in the 57%, > 20-200 ng/mL in the 20%, and > 200 ng/mL in 23%. According to the BCLC staging system, 79 patients were classified as stage A (58.09%), 29 (21.32%) stage B, 17 (12.50%) stage C and 11 patients (8.09%) as stage D. The overall median survival time was 26.52 months (95% CI 16.7-36.3). The median survival according to BCLC system was: BCLC A 62.27, BCLC B 12.72, BCLC C 4.83, and BCLC D 0.62 months (p 20-200: 22.08 months, and > 200 ng/mL: 5.39 months (p Conclusions:our results confirm that the BCLC is a good prognostic system. The AFP has prognosis value in HCC patients. The addition of AFP could improve the BCLC system. Future studies are needed to confirm our results and also the best way to combine BCLC and AFP properly.
