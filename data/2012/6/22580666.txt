Background/aims:It is very important to achieve a sufficient field and space in laparoscopic assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) for a less-experienced surgeon. In this study, the usefulness of a novel surgical technique to lift the liver was evaluated in LADG.Methodology:Fifty-four patients who underwent standardized LADG for gastric cancer using the novel technique of lifting the liver were retrospectively evaluated based on video records. Patient characteristics, the time required to lift the liver and for gastrectomy, total operation time, blood loss and complications were analyzed.Results:The mean time necessary to lift the liver using this novel technique was 240.1±86.1 seconds and that for gastrectomy was 167.6±50.4 minutes. Blood loss was 72.5±59.6mL. The morbidity rate was 4/54 (7.4%).Conclusions:Standardized LADG using this novel technique is feasible and possible in a period of time.
