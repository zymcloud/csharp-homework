A 68-year-old woman developed acute pulmonary embolism after hepatic arterial infusion therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Because the platelet count was significantly reduced, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) due to heparin usage in hepatic arterial infusion therapy was clinically suspected. Subsequently, the patient tested positively for HIT antibodies, and a definitive diagnosis was obtained. Antithrombotic therapy with heparin was discontinued and treatment with argatroban was started. After the heparinized hydrophilic catheter was removed, the platelet count improved immediately. HIT should be considered when a decrease in platelet count and thrombosis are involved with the usage of heparin.
