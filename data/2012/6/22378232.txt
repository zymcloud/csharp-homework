We constructed a vector carrying a shRNA sequence against cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) that was subsequently transfected into the human hepatocarcinoma cell line SMMCâ€‘7721. Furthermore, we established a COX-2-deficient stable cell line and a model of tumor-shRNA transplantation in nude mice. Negative shRNA was used as the control. The tumor volume in the experimental group was smaller compared to that in the control group. Hematoxylin and eosin staining indicated that the cells in the experimental group differentiated better than those in the control group. The COX-2 mRNA level in the tumor tissues injected with SMMC-7721/COX-2i was markedly downregulated compared to that in the tumor tissues injected with SMMC-7721/negative shRNA. The inhibition rate reached 68.6%. Immunohistological study showed a significantly strong COX-2 expression in the control group tumor cells, whereas the experimental group exhibited moderate expression, indicating the inhibition of COX-2 expression after transfection of cells with shRNA against COX-2. Western blot analysis further proved the inhibition of COX-2 expression. In conclusion, RNAi-mediated regulation of COX-2 expression could efficiently inhibit liver-transplanted tumor growth in BALB/c nude mice.
