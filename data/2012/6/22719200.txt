We report a case of duodenal varix bleeding as a long term complication of balloon occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO), which was successfully treated with a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). A 57-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room suffering from melena. He had undergone BRTO to treat gastric varix bleeding 5 mo before admission. Endoscopy and a computed tomography (CT) scan showed complete obliteration of the gastric varix, but the nodular varices in the second portion of the duodenum expanded after BRTO, and spurting blood was seen. TIPS was performed for treatment of duodenal variceal bleeding, because attempts at endoscopic varix ligation were unsuccessful. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged without complications. A follow up CT scan obtained 21 mo after TIPS revealed a patent TIPS tract and complete obliteration of duodenal varices, but multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma had developed. He died of hepatic failure 28 mo after TIPS.
