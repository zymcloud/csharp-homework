Patients suffering from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have poor prognosis mainly because no standard treatment is currently available. Our objectives were to explore the prognostic factors for first relapse of patients with TNBC. A cohort of 687 patients with TNBC, diagnosed and treated between January 1995 and December 2008 at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, were retrospectively analyzed. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to explore factors that predict relapse development. Survival rate was computed using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. The median age of the 687 patients was 46 (range 16-76 years), and 64.8% of the patients were pre-menopausal. The median follow-up time was 56 months (range 14-156 months), in which 194 patients had recurrence, and 115 died. The median recurrence-free time was 25 months (range 4-143 months), with 118 (60.8%) of the cases first relapsing at a single site. The three- and five-year disease-free survival rates were 79.7 and 72.6%, respectively. Primary tumor size at diagnosis, lymph node status, and type of regimen used in the (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy were considered independent predictors of first relapse. CMF-containing adjuvant chemotherapy significantly decreased recurrence compared with the anthracycline- or taxane-based regimens (RR = 0.66, 95%; CI 0.45-0.96; P = 0.030). The median time from first relapse to death was 26 months (range 2-121 months). The two- and five-year survival rates were 60.6 and 36.6%, respectively. Liver metastasis at first recurrence and progression-free survival over 12 months after first-line therapy were two important factors that affected survival rate after recurrence. The median relapse time of TNBC was about 2 years after diagnosis. CMF regimens for TNBC patients may be more effective than anthracycline- or taxane-based regimens. Liver metastasis at first recurrence signifies unfavorable prognosis.
