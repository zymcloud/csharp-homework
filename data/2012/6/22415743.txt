Background:Guidelines for breast cancer patient follow-up have not been widely adopted in Japan. To assess our intensive follow-up program, we evaluated first relapse and its indicators in patients with breast cancer.Patients:Of 964 patients, 126 relapsed and 43 died in the median follow-up term of 45 months. Follow-ups were scheduled every 6-12 months for imaging and tumor marker (TM) evaluation.Results:Of 126 relapsed patients, 30 (23.8%) had symptoms of relapse. First indicators of relapse in 96 asymptomatic patients were physical examination in 24 patients (19%); imaging, 57 patients (45.3%); and TMs, 15 patients (11.9%). The most sensitive indicators were physical examination for local relapse, ultrasonography for regional lymph nodes, scintigraphy for bone, computed tomography for lung, and TMs for liver metastasis. During intensive follow-up, 43% of relapsed patients were identified by symptoms or physical examination. These patients had poor prognosis compare to patients identified by imaging or TMs in overall survival and post-relapse survival (p = 0.009 and 0.019, respectively). In all 964 patients, the relapse rates for stage I, IIA, IIB, and III tumors were 7.4, 7.9, 19.9, and 43.5%, respectively. The percentage of first relapse detected by imaging or TMs for stage I, IIA, IIB, and III were 4.7, 5.1, 11.8, and 19.8%, respectively. The cost of our follow-up program for 10 years was approximately 290,000 yen per patient.Conclusion:A routine intensive follow-up program involving imaging and evaluation of TMs in all patients has low efficacy and high expenditure.
