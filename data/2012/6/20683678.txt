Introduction:Treatment options for advanced hepatocellular cancer (HCC) are limited. Sorafenib, an orally active multi-kinase inhibitor, is the only systemic agent with a survival benefit in randomized studies. However, the gain in survival is modest and new treatment strategies are needed.Clinical cases:We report two cases of advanced HCC treated with a combination of sorafenib and radiation therapy. Impressive and sustained clinical and radiological responses were seen. Treatment was well-tolerated in both cases with no unexpected toxicities reported.Discussion:There is sound rationale for the combination of sorafenib and radiation therapy for treatment of HCC. These two cases suggest both feasibility and efficacy of this combination, in selected patients. Prospective studies addressing this combination are ongoing.
