Objective:To prepare and characterize the compound Epirubicin hydrochloride and Gadopentetate meglumine (Gd-DTPA) nanoparticles, and evaluate its properties from rabbits in vivo and in vitro.Methods:The compound Epirubicin hydrochloride and Gd-DTPA nanoparticles were prepared by double emulsion-solvent evaporation method. The main effective factors were orthogonal designed. The characteristics such as drug entrapment efficiency, drug loading, and drug utilization were assayed in vitro. MR imaging effect of the VX2 rabbit hepatoma model were observed after injecting the drug-loaded nanoparticles through the hepatic artery intubation in vivo.Results:The drug encapsulation efficiency of the nanoparticles, drug loading and drug utilization were 33.8% ± 3.4%, 0.225% ± 0.052%, and 69.6% ± 4.3% under the optimized prescription, respectively. The mean size of the nanoparticles was 180.6 nm, the drug release continued in 48 h with good MR imaging effect.Conclusions:Compound Epirubicin hydrochloride and Gd-DTPA Nanoparticles were in simply preparation and showed sustained drug release properties. These novel nanoparticles with detecting function could develop of epirubicin hydrochloride targeted therapy of liver cancer.
