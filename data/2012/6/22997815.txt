Objective:To study the Ri plasmid transformation and metabolism of ginseng products on HepG2 cells.Method:The inhibitory effect of ginseng saponin on hepatoma HepG2 cells was studied. The hairy root-induced conditions were screened by orthogonal experimental design. The culture conditions were determined through hairy root biomass accumulation and saponin content. The effect of ginsenoside on HepG2 cells was determined by MTT assay.Result and conclusion:The optimal ginseng hairy root inducing conditions: A = 0.6, infection time of 10 min, pre-incubation time for the 3 d. The best culture conditions: MS medium, pH 6.1, 24 degrees C. At those conditions the hairy root bio-accumulation and saponin content were higher. The results of ginseng saponins on the inhibitory effect of HepG2 cells showed that inhibition of ginseng saponins on HepG2 was the concentration positively related.
