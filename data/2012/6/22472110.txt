Ethnopharmacological relevance:Alocasia macrorrhiza has been used as a folk medicine for cancer treatment in the Southwest of China.Aim of the study:The purpose of this study is to confirm the anticancer activity of aqueous extract of alocasia macrorrhiza against hepatic cancer and to elucidate its mechanism of action.Materials and methods:Human normal liver cells and hepatocellular carcinoma cells were tested in vitro for cytotoxicity, colony formation inhibition, EdU incorporation, AO/EB staining apoptotic cells, apoptotic DNA fragmentation, and cell cycle distribution in response to alocasia macrorrhiza extract. The mRNA and protein expressions of PPARγ, Cyclin D1, Rb, P21, Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 were detected through RT-PCR and Western blotting; the tumor growth inhibition in vivo was tested by oral administration of the extract.Results:Alocasia macrorrhiza aqueous extract exhibited proliferation inhibition and apoptosis effects on human hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro, inhibited hepatoma growth in vivo.Conclusion:Alocasia macrorrhiza extract has potential cytotoxic and apoptotic effect on human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and inhibits hepatoma growth in vivo, its mechanism of action might be associated with the inhibition of DNA synthesis, cell cycle (G(0)/G(1)) arrest, apoptosis induction through up-regulation the mRNA and protein expressions of PPARγ, Rb, Bax and capase-3genes and down-regulation of the expressions of Cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 genes.
