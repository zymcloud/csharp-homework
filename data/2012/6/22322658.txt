Background:Transcatheter arterial infusion chemotherapy (TAI) using a combination of iodized oil (lipiodol) and degradable starch microspheres (DSMs) has been reported to be superior to TAI with either lipiodol or DSMs separately for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), based on the results of a prospective randomized study. In the study reported here, we investigated the predictors influencing response and survival in HCC patients receiving TAI using lipiodol and DSMs.Methods:A total of 50 HCC patients [Child-Pugh A/B, 34/16 patients; maximum tumor size 2.9 cm (mean); tumor number Results:According to the criteria of the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan, the response [complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)] rate and CR rate were 72 and 38%, respectively [CR, 19 patients; PR, 17; stable disease, 9; progressive disease, 5]. The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year cumulative survival rates were 85, 67, 41, and 35%, respectively, and the median survival time was 32.6 months. Multivariate analysis identified tumor number Conclusion:Transcatheter arterial infusion chemotherapy using lipiodol and DSMs might be considered as a potential intervention in HCC patients, especially those with tumors of
