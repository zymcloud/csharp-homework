Objectives:The aim of this study was to evaluate the hepatoprotective potential of a methanolic extract and of marmesin isolated from the root bark of Feronia limonia.Methods:Activity levels of aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransaminase (ALT), cell viability and cell death were evaluated in HepG2 cells (human liver hepatoma cells) treated with CCl₄ in the presence or absence of F. limonia extract or marmesin. Plasma activity levels of AST, ALT, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, protein, hepatic antioxidants, lipid peroxidation and histopathological evaluations were carried out in rats treated with CCl₄ alone or co-supplemented with F. limonia extract or marmesin in a dose-dependent manner.Key findings:In-vitro co-supplementation of F. limonia methanolic extract or marmesin significantly minimized alteration in levels of AST and ALT and improved cell viability. Oral administration of F. limonia methanolic extract or marmesin significantly prevented CCl₄-induced elevation in the plasma markers of hepatic damage and hepatic lipid peroxidation and a decrease in hepatic antioxidants. In-vivo hepatoprotective potential of F. limonia methanolic extract and marmesin was evident from the minimal alterations in the histoarchitecture of liver.Conclusions:This has been the first scientific report on the hepatoprotective potential of F. limonia root bark methanolic extract and marmesin.
