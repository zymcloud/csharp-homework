The role of hepatic resection, taking into consideration the functional status of the liver, for localized hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an established curative treatment. In advance disease, a variety of interventional-based liver-directed therapies and more recently systemic therapy with sorafenib are available to treat unresectable tumors. Extrahepatic Metastasis (EHM) of HCC may occur at initial diagnosis or during recurrence following treatment. This may occur with or without concurrent intrahepatic disease. We reviewed the published works on surgical metastasectomy for common sites of EHM of HCC metastases. It appears from the studies reported in the literature that from selected cases reported, long-term survival may be achieved from resecting metastasis at sites of the abdominal lymph node, adrenal gland, lung, and peritoneum. The encouraging results presented demonstrate that highly selected fit patients may be suitable candidates for these radical curative pursuits. It is likely that indications for resection of EHM HCC may benefit patients with limited isolated metastasis, who have a preserved liver function, and whose primary tumor has been adequately controlled. A registry study to pull the results of case reports and institutional experiences may be useful in cumulating evidence of this practice.
