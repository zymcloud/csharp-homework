Introduction:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Poland affects approximately 750 thousand persons. The prevention of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, of which approximately 20% of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus are at risk, aims at eradication of the virus by applying antiviral treatment with pegylated interferon alpha with ribavirin.Material/methods:In this paper the results of the standard treatment of chronic hepatitis C in a population of 169 adult patients in whom it was started in the period of 01.01.2007-30.06.2008 are analyzed. Moreover, the influence of various clinical, biochemical and viral factors on achieving therapeutic success in the form of the sustained virological response (SVR) was studied.Results:In the group of 128 patients who received the full course of antiviral treatment, the SVR was achieved by 67.2% of patients (86 persons), whereas regarding all 169 patients who started the therapy, the sustained disappearance of viremia was found in 53.2% of patients (90 persons). Regarding 155 persons in whom the treatment was not interrupted for reasons others than virology, this value was 55.5%. For the sustained disappearance of viremia the following was favorable: genotype 3 virus, age under 40 years, body mass up to 75 kg, correct value of body mass index (BMI), low gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) activity before the treatment, minimum advancement of liver fibrosis in a liver biopsy (S1), complete early biochemical response (cEBR), and moreover, the achievement of negation of viremia after 12 weeks of the treatment in a group of patients infected with genotype 1 (complete early virological response, cEVR). These factors were strongly correlated with each other and that is why an analysis by the method of logistic multiple regression was impossible. Adverse reactions to the treatment and other health problems were the reasons for earlier discontinuation of the standard therapeutic scheme in 14 patients, whereby the lack of an SVR occurred in 10 of them (71.5% which is 5.9% of the studied population).
