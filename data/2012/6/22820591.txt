Objective:To study the expression of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-2 (C-IAP2) mRNA and protein in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its relationship with the clinical outcomes.Methods:Quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical staining were used to detect the expression of C-IAP2 mRNA and protein in the tumor tissues and corresponding adjacent non-cancerous tissues from HCC patients.Results:The expression of C-IAP2 mRNA in HCC tissues was 2.70 folds higher than that in the non-cancerous tissues (P0.05).Conclusion:The expression of C-IAP2 in HCC is associated with tumor recurrence and metastasis, and can be a biological marker for prognostic evaluation of HCC.
