The Cytochrome P-450 1A1 (CYP1A1) gene has been implicated in the etiology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the results have been inconsistent. In this study, a meta-analysis was performed to clarify the associations of polymorphisms in CYP1A1 gene with HCC risk. Published literature from PubMed, Embase, CNKI and Wanfang Data were retrieved. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using fixed- or random-effects model. Eight studies (1,752 cases and 2,279 controls) for Ile-Val polymorphism and eight studies (933 cases and 1,449 controls) for MspI polymorphism were identified. The results showed that there was no statistically significant association between the Ile-Val polymorphism and HCC risk under all genetic models (co-dominant model: Val/Val vs. Ile/Ile: OR = 1.62, 95% CI 0.96-2.72 and Ile/Val vs. Ile/Ile: OR = 1.15, 95% CI 0.87-1.52; dominant model: OR = 1.25, 95% CI 0.92-1.70; recessive model: OR = 1.48, 95% CI 0.99-2.21). The MspI polymorphism was also not associated with HCC risk (co-dominant model: m2m2 vs. m1m1: OR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.83-1.42 and m1m2 vs. m1m1: OR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.61; dominant model: OR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.99–1.45; recessive model: OR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.74-1.18). However, the significant associations were found between both the Ile–Val and MspI polymorphisms and HCC risk among the cigarette smoking subjects (Ile-Val: OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.06-1.85; MspI: OR = 2.65, 95% CI 1.47-4.77). The present meta-analysis indicated that the MspI and Ile-Val polymorphisms of CYP1A1 may play important roles in increasing susceptibility to smoking-related HCC.
