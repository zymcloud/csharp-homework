Background:Thalidomide has shown modest activity in advanced hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Single-agent capecitabine has also been used in patients with HCC, with objective responses being reported. In our study, we review the use of thalidomide and capecitabine combination in advanced HCC.Methods:From November 2003 and September 2008, 42 patients with advanced HCC who were not eligible for clinical trial or conventional chemotherapy were treated with oral capecitabine (2000 mg/m/d) for 14 days every 3 weeks and oral thalidomide at the doses of 50 to 200 mg/d.Results:Almost 50% of patients had Child-Pugh B or C liver cirrhosis and a history of regional or systemic therapy. Three patients achieved complete responses lasting more than 52 weeks, including 1 patient who achieved pathological complete response and underwent curative resection. There were 3 patients with partial responses and 13 with stable disease. Median overall survival of all 42 patients was 9.9 months. The median progression-free survival was 5.1 months. The presence of ascites, portal vein thrombosis, and poorer Child-Pugh liver cirrhosis status also resulted in significantly poorer survival outcome. Treatment was well tolerated. Fatigue was the most common side effect occurring in 16 (38%) patients, but only 1 patient had grade 3 toxicity and had to stop treatment. Two other patients developed grade 3 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia from capecitabine.Conclusions:The combination of thalidomide and capecitabine has activity in advanced HCC and can result in complete pathological response. Treatment is well tolerated even in less-fit patients who have been pretreated and deserve further study.
