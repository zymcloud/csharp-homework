This study investigates whether the anti-metastasis effect of microRNA-139 (miR-139) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is mediated through regulating c-fos expression. The expression levels of miR-139 and c-fos in human HCC cell sublines with high (MHCC97H) and low (MHCC97L) spontaneous metastatic potentials were quantified using QPCR or Western blot. miR-139 mimics was transfected into MHCC97H cells to overexpress miR-139, and miR-139 inhibitor was transfected into MHCC97L cells to down-express miR-139. The effect of overexpression or down-expression of miR-139 on c-fos expression of MHCC97H and MHCC97L cells was evaluated using QPCR and Western blot. The 3' untranslated region segments of FOS containing the miR-139 binding sites were amplified by PCR, and the luciferase activity in the transfected cells was assayed. In comparison with the expression level of miR-139 in MHCC97L cells, the expression level in MHCC97H cells was significantly decreased, whereas c-Fos was significantly up-regulated in MHCC97H. The overexpression of miR-139 significantly inhibited the expression of c-fos in MHCC97H cells, and the down-expression of miR-139 significantly promoted the expression of c-fos in MHCC97L cells. miR-139 suppressed the luciferase activity of the pGL-FOS by approximately 40% compared with the negative control. In vitro cell migration analysis demonstrated that depletion of c-fos or overexpression of miR-139 in MHCC97H cells reduced cell migration, whereas overexpression of c-fos or depletion of miR-139 in MHCC97L cells increased cell migration. Thus, we got the conclusion that miR-139 expression is down-regulated in human HCC cell sublines with high spontaneous metastatic potentials (MHCC97H). Derepression of c-Fos caused by miR-139 down-regulation contributes to the metastasis of HCC.
