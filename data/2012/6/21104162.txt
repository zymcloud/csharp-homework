Purpose:Hepatitis C (HCV) is the most common liver disease in patients transplanted with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the West. We examined predictors of HCC recurrence in liver transplant recipients with HCV.Methods:From 1997 to 2006, 53 patients with HCC and HCV underwent liver transplantation. Pre-and post-operative data (including liver biopsies 4 months post-transplant) were collected. Differences between HCC recurrence and non-recurrence groups were detected by Student's t test or chi-square test. Data were analyzed as predictors of HCC recurrence by logistic regression multivariate analysis. Cumulative survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves and compared by the log-rank test.Results:Eleven of 53 patients (20.8%) developed HCC recurrence at a median interval of 15 months (2 to 55 months). Median Histology Activity Index (HAI) of liver biopsies, AST, and ALT at 4 months were significantly greater in patients with HCC recurrence. Independent predictors of HCC recurrence were HAI ≥ 4 at 4 months, ALT ≥ 100 at 4 months, and vascular invasion. Patients with HCC recurrence had significantly decreased survival.Conclusions:In this preliminary study, Histology Activity Index and ALT at 4 months, as well as vascular invasion, predicted HCC recurrence in liver transplant recipients with HCV.
