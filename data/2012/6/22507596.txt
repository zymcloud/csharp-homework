Purpose:To investigate inherent differences in vasculature of tumors versus normal parenchyma and efficacy of radiofrequency (RF) ablation with glucagon, adenosine, and a combination of the two compared with normal saline solution (NS) controls in an N1-S1 tumor model implanted in Sprague-Dawley rat livers.Materials and methods:A total of 17 tumors were established in the left lobes of rats. Tumor perfusion relative to surrounding liver parenchyma was evaluated with contrast-enhanced ultrasound with intermittent-bolus technique before and after administration of glucagon, adenosine, a combination of the two, or NS. Tumors were ablated with a 22-gauge RF probe with 1 cm of exposed tip at 80 °C for 2 min. Tumor size, zone of necrosis, and viable tumor were measured in tumors after 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Results were compared with degree of tumor perfusion.Results:The normalized tumor perfusion ratio did not significantly change with administration of NS (1.38% ± 3.93). Vasomodulation resulted in significant decreases in normalized tumor perfusion ratio: 66.22% ± 24.57 (P Conclusions:Tumor blood flow may be significantly altered by using systemic injection of appropriate medications. This tumor- and organ-specific approach to tumor vasomodulation may be used to enhance current therapeutic options.
