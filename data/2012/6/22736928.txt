Aim:To investigate the effects of the WWOX gene on the human hepatic carcinoma cell line SMMC-7721.Methods:Full-length WWOX cDNA was amplified from normal human liver tissues. Full-length cDNA was subcloned into pEGFP-N1, a eukaryotic expression vector. After introduction of the WWOX gene into cancer cells using liposomes, the WWOX protein level in the cells was detected through Western blotting. Cell growth rates were assessed by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) and colony formation assays. Cell cycle progression and cell apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry. The phosphorylated protein kinase B (AKT) and activated fragments of caspase-9 and caspase-3 were examined by Western blotting analysis.Results:WWOX significantly inhibited cell proliferation, as evaluated by the MTT and colony formation assays. Cells transfected with WWOX showed significantly higher apoptosis ratios when compared with cells transfected with a mock plasmid, and overexpression of WWOX delayed cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase, as measured by flow cytometry. An increase in apoptosis was also indicated by a remarkable activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and a dephosphorylation of AKT (Thr308 and Ser473) measured with Western blotting analysis.Conclusion:Overexpression of WWOX induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation of the human hepatic carcinoma cell line SMMC-7721.
