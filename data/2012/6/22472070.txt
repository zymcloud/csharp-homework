Objectives:To report the outcome of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in non-cirrhotic liver depending on the mode of primary treatment and to define clinicopathological factors influencing patients' prognosis.Methods:A retrospective analysis of an unselected cohort of 105 patients was performed. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and potentially prognostic factors were analyzed in Cox regression models.Results:OS of the whole cohort at 1, 3, and 5 years was 66%, 47%, and 29%, respectively. Tobacco consumption, ECOG >0, macroscopic vascular invasion, continuous tumor diameter, and treatment other than resection were predictors of decreased OS in the whole cohort. Resection was performed in 64% of patients with 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates of 84%, 69%, and 42%, respectively. Siderosis and BCLC stage were associated with decreased OS after resection. Recurrence occurred in 57% of patients with 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates of 63%, 39%, and 31%, respectively. Viral hepatitis and macroscopic vascular invasion were associated with decreased DFS. One-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates in patients with non-surgical approaches (transarterial chemoembolization, systemic therapy, best supportive care) were 38%, 11%, and 7%, respectively. Tobacco consumption and Okuda stage were associated with decreased OS in these patients.Conclusions:OS and DFS of patients with HCC in non-cirrhotic liver depend most notably on tumor-related, demographic, and etiological factors. Features of the non-neoplastic liver tissue play only a minor role. Liver resection leads to a significantly better prognosis than non-surgical treatment approaches.
