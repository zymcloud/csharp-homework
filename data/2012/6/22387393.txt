Background & aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is believed to arise from tumor-initiating cells (T-ICs), although little is known about their stem cell-like properties.Methods:We quantified levels of p28(GANK) (Gankyrin), OV6, and Oct4 in 130 human HCC samples using immunohistochemistry. Magnetic-activated cell sorting was used to isolate OV6+ HCC cells. T-IC properties were evaluated by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and spheroid formation. We used a coimmunoprecipitation assay to study interactions among p28(GANK), Oct4, and WWP2. Tumorigenicity and pulmonary metastasis were examined in nonobese diabetic and severe combined immunodeficient mice.Results:In HCC samples, high levels of p28(GANK) correlated with expansion of OV6+ tumor cells; the combination of high levels of p28(GANK) and OV6 was associated with progression of HCC. p28(GANK) was predominantly expressed in liver T-ICs, isolated by magnetic sorting, and undifferentiated primary HCC spheroids. Increased levels of p28(GANK) in T-ICs increased their percentages in HCC samples, expression of stem cell genes, self-renewal potential, chemoresistance in vitro, and tumorigenicity and ability to develop into pulmonary metastases in mice. Conversely, knockdown of p28(GANK) reduced their T-IC properties. p28(GANK) likely activates liver T-ICs by impeding ubiquitination and degradation of the transcription factor Oct4 by WWP2. In support of this concept, levels of p28(GANK) correlated with those of Oct4 in HCC samples.Conclusions:p28(GANK) activates and maintains liver T-ICs in HCCs by preventing degradation of Oct4. Inhibitors of p28(GANK) might therefore be developed to inactivate T-ICs and slow tumor progression.
