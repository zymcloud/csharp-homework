Purpose:The feasibility of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) using left lobe (LL) grafts has been demonstrated. However, the long-term outcome of the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with LL grafts has not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to analyze the long-term outcomes after LDLT for HCC according to the graft type.Methods:A retrospective analysis was performed evaluating the outcomes of LL graft recipients (n = 82) versus recipients of RL grafts (n = 46). The analysis endpoints were the overall and recurrence-free survival after LDLT. The demographics of both recipients and donors, and the tumor characteristics associated with the graft type were also analyzed.Results:The graft volume (436 ± 74 g), as well as the graft volume-standard liver volume rate (38.3 ± 6.2%) of the LL graft group were significantly decreased as compared to those of the RL graft group (569 ± 82 g, 46.3 ± 6.7%; p Conclusions:The long-term outcomes in the HCC patients with LL grafts were similar to those of patients receiving RL grafts, and the outcomes of the donors of LL grafts were more favorable. Therefore, LL grafts should be considered when selecting LDLT for HCC to ensure donor safety.
