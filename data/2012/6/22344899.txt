Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is one of the standard therapies for bridging patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to transplantation. This study was designed to determine which features on pre- and post-TACE imaging are associated with tumor necrosis in pathological specimens. Records of 105 patients with 132 HCC lesions who underwent liver transplantation after TACE were retrospectively reviewed. In 70% of the nodules, >90% necrosis was achieved. The development of >90% lesion necrosis upon pathological analysis was associated with avid lesion enhancement (P = 0.03) and the presence of a feeding vessel larger than 0.9 mm in diameter on the pre-TACE visceral angiogram (P = 0.01). Near-complete lesion necrosis was also associated with an extensive accumulation of ethiodized oil within a lesion during TACE administration (P = 0.04). On post-TACE computed tomography imaging, a lack of residual contrast enhancement (P
