Aims:ZBP-89 plays a role in cell growth and death. Its expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well documented. This study aimed to analyse ZBP-89 expression in HCC.Methods and results:We examined ZBP-89 expression in five HCC cell lines and 182 HCC tissue samples by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining. Our results showed that the expression of ZBP-89 was higher in HCC than adjacent non-tumour liver, at both mRNA and protein levels. ZBP-89 was localized in the nucleus in most HCC tissue samples, but was found in the cytoplasm in 11.5% of cases. Patient survival in those tumours showing high ZBP-89 expression was better than in those with low expression. High ZBP-89 expression tended to be more common in World Health Organization (WHO) grade I than grades II-IV HCC. There was a significant association between HBV positivity and high ZBP-89 expression. Colony formation was reduced dramatically in those HCC cell lines in which ZBP-89 overexpression was demonstrated; this appeared to correlate with increased apoptosis, inferred by finding elevated levels of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)polymerases (PARP), the probable mechanisms for which may involve increased p53 or p21 expression.Conclusions:ZBP-89 has anti-tumour properties and is a potential biomarker for prognosis of HCC.
