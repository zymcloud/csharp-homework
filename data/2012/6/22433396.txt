Bioassay-guided fractionation of the n-BuOH extract of the roots of Clematis argentilucida led to the isolation of two new triterpenoid saponins along with a known one, cussonside B (3). By extensive spectral analysis and chemical evidences, the structures of the two new saponins were determined to be 3β-O-[β-D-ribopyranosyl-(1→3)-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-α-L-arabinopyranosyl] hederagenin-11,13-dien-28-oic acid (1) and 3β-O-{β-D-ribopyranosyl-(1→3)-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-[β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)]-β-D-xylopyranosyl} oleanolic acid (2), respectively. Saponin 1 is the first example of triterpenoid saponins with two double bonds located at C-11 and C-13 in the aglycone from the genus Clematis. The two new saponins exhibited significant cytotoxicity against human leukemia HL-60 cell lines, human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep-G2 cell lines and human glioblastoma U251MG cell lines with a range of IC(50) values from 2.74 to 25.40μM, while 3 showed inactivity against all of the three cancer cell lines.
