Interleukin-8 (IL-8) belongs to the superfamily of CXC chemokines, contributing to human cancer progression through potential mitogenic, angiogenic, and motogenic functions. We hypothesize that the functional polymorphism of IL-8 may influence the inflammatory process during pathological stage from hepatitis to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Two polymorphisms in the IL-8 gene (-251A/T and +781C/T) were examined in 160 cases of chronic hepatitis B, 80 cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver cirrhosis (LC), 150 cases of HBV-related HCC, and 150 healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method and DNA sequencing. In the LC group, the AA genotypes were associated with a significantly decreased risk of LC compared with the TT genotype (OR=0.14, 95% CI 0.02-0.87, p=0.035). The data also revealed that subjects with the A allele appeared to have lower susceptibility to LC than those with the T allele (OR=0.48, 95% CI 0.25-0.92, p=0.027). The +781C/T polymorphism of IL-8 was not found relevant to the liver diseases. This study indicated that the IL-8 gene -251 AA genotype might be a protect factor for LC.
