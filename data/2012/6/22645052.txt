Purpose:The vascular disrupting agent (VDA) combretastatin A4 phosphate (CA4P) induces significant tumor necrosis as a single agent. Preclinical models have shown that the addition of an anti-VEGF antibody to a VDA attenuates the revascularization of the surviving tumor rim and thus significantly increases antitumor activity.Experimental design:Patients with advanced solid malignancies received CA4P at 45, 54, or 63 mg/m(2) on day 1, day 8, and then every 14 days. Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg was given on day 8 and at subsequent cycles four hours after CA4P. Functional imaging with dynamic contrast enhanced-MRI (DCE-MRI) was conducted at baseline, after CA4P alone, and after cycle 1 CA4P + bevacizumab.Results:A total of 63 mg/m(2) CA4P + 10 mg/kg bevacizumab q14 is the recommended phase II dose. A total of 15 patients were enrolled. Dose-limiting toxicities were grade III asymptomatic atrial fibrillation and grade IV liver hemorrhage in a patient with a history of hemorrhage. Most common toxicities were hypertension, headache, lymphopenia, pruritus, and pyrexia. Asymptomatic electrocardiographic changes were seen in five patients. Nine of 14 patients experienced disease stabilization. A patient with ovarian cancer had a CA125 response lasting for more than a year. DCE-MRI showed statistically significant reductions in tumor perfusion/vascular permeability, which reversed after CA4P alone but which were sustained following bevacizumab. Circulating CD34(+) and CD133(+) bone marrow progenitors increased following CA4P as did VEGF and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor levels.Conclusions:CA4P in combination with bevacizumab appears safe and well tolerated in this dosing schedule. CA4P induced profound vascular changes, which were maintained by the presence of bevacizumab.
