Background:Sorafenib is the only approved agent recommended by the American Association Study of Liver Disease guidelines for hepatocellular carcinoma patients in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C.Aims:To calculate and compare overall survival rates in hepatocellular carcinoma patients in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C treated with various therapies or supportive care alone.Methods:This was a retrospective study, in which medical data from 411 newly diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma patients in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C and Child-Pugh class A were analyzed and compared.Results:Eighty-eight patients were treated with supportive care and 323 were treated with surgical resection (68/323, 21.1%), local ablation therapy (8/323, 2.5%), transarterial embolization (140/323, 43.3%), systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy (96/323, 29.7%), and sorafenib (11/323, 3.4%). Median survival was 11 months (95% confidence interval, 9.0-13.1) in treated patients compared with 3.9 months in the supportive care group (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.59; pConclusions:Surgical resection resulted in excellent outcomes. Although sorafenib is currently recommended, oncologists should endeavour to select optimal candidates for surgical resection to gain more survival benefit.
