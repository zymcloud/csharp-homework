Background:Forkhead Box P1 (FOXP1) has been described as both a tumour suppressor candidate and a potential oncogene. The aim of this study is to identify new prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic target structures for the diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The expression of FOXP1 mRNA in HCC was characterised using real-time PCR and 20 pairs of fresh frozen HCC tissues and corresponding non-cancerous tissues. FOXP1 protein expression in HCC was confirmed using immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray chip. Finally, FOXP1 expression was correlated with conventional clinicopathological features of HCC and patient outcome.Results:The expression of FOXP1 mRNA and protein in HCC cells was much higher than in normal hepatic cells (Z=2.315, p=0.021 and Ï‡(2)=28.071, 95% CI 0.233 to 0.480, pConclusions:From this investigation the authors elucidated for the first time that the correlation of high FOXP1 expression correlates with an aggressive malignant phenotype and may constitute a novel prognostic factor for HCC. These results also support a role for FOXP1 as an oncogene in HCC.
