Objective:The aim of this study was to examine the features and outcomes of noncirrhotic patients undergoing resection for hepatocellular carcinoma.Background:Ten percent to 40% of hepatocellular carcinoma cases arise within a noncirrhotic liver parenchyma. Resection is the standard therapy, yet the published resection series from the West are small.Methods:From January 1987 to December 2009, our center performed 206 partial liver resections for nonfibrotic or minimally fibrotic (Scheuer stage 0-2) hepatocellular carcinoma. We retrospectively reviewed these cases and performed univariate and multivariate analyses for predictors of long-term outcomes.Results:Eighty-one patients (39.3%) had chronic hepatitis B infection and 23 patients (11.2%) had chronic hepatitis C. The remaining 83 (39.8%) had no underlying liver disease. Average age was 60.2 years, and 68.4% of the patients were male. Average tumor size was 8.2 cm. Overall survival at 5 years was 46.3%. Recurrence at 5 years was 50.0%. Independent predictors for decreased survival were tumor size larger than 7.0 cm, creatinine more than 1.0 mg/dL, satellite nodules, albumin less than 3.5 gm/dL, alpha-fetoprotein more than 100 ng/mL, and any vascular invasion. Chronic hepatitis B virus infection predicted longer survival. Independent predictors for decreased time to recurrence were albumin less than 3.5 gm/dL, any vascular invasion, age more than 60 years, tumor size larger than 7.0 cm, and alpha-fetoprotein more than 100 ng/mL. Treatment of recurrence with either repeat resection or ablation was associated with a median survival of 50.4 months from time of recurrence.Conclusions:Hepatocellular carcinoma can develop in a minimally fibrotic hepatitis C patient. Tumor-related factors such as vascular invasion primarily determine long-term outcomes. Hepatitis B virus-associated tumors seem to have a better prognosis in the nonfibrotic or minimally fibrotic population. Aggressive treatment of recurrence is warranted.
