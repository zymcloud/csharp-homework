Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a typical inflammation-related malignancy characterized by high postoperative recurrence and metastasis. Although several inflammatory cells and inflammatory signatures have been linked to poor prognosis, the inflammation-associated molecular mechanisms of HCC development and progression are largely unknown. Here we show that triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells (TREM)-1, a transmembrane receptor expressing in myeloid cells, was also expressed in tumor-activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and associated with the aggressive behavior of HCC cells. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the expression levels of soluble TREM-1 (sTREM-1) in activated hepatic stellate cells supernatant and 92 preoperative and postoperative plasmas of patients with malignancy and/or benign liver tumor/disease, respectively. Expression levels of TREM-1 were assessed by immunohistochemistry in tissue microarray from 240 patients with HCC. As a result, increased secretion of sTREM-1 from activated HSCs was observed after co-culture with HCC cell lines (P
