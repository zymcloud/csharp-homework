Purpose:To investigate the outcomes and risk factors of patients treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) delivered by image-guided helical tomotherapy (HT) for extracranial oligometastases.Methods:From August 2006 through July 2011, 42 consecutive patients (median age 69 years [range 16-87]) with oligometastases (≤3) received HT to all known cancer sites (lung, n = 28; liver, n = 12; adrenal, n = 2). Prognostic factors were assessed by Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis.Results:A total of 60 lesions were treated with hypofractionated HT (median dose 39 Gy [range 36-72.5]; median dose per fraction 12 Gy [range 5-20]). Complete or partial response was observed in 40 (54 %) patients. With a median follow-up period of 15 months, 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) was 84 and 63 %, respectively; and 1- and 2-year local control (LC) was 92 and 86 %, respectively. Four patients had pneumonitis Grade ≥2 and two patients had lower gastrointestinal toxicity Grade ≥2. Only the lack of complete/partial response was associated with higher risk of mortality on univariate (HR = 3.8, P = 0.04) and multivariate (HR = 6.6, P = 0.01) analyses.Conclusions:SABR delivered by image-guided HT is well tolerated and offers adequate LC with low acute morbidity in patients with extracranial oligometastatic disease. We found that the response to HT was the only predictor for OS.
