Background:The hepatitis B virus is a significant pathogen that causes cirrhosis, and hepatocellular cancer as a result of the damage it causes to liver cells. Its infection affects more than 400 million people globally. Although there is an effective vaccine and treatment methods, almost 1, 000, 000 people die every year.Objective:To investigate paraoxonase and arylesterase activities along with oxidative status parameters and serum lipid levels, and to find out if there is any increased susceptibility to atherogenesis.Methods:Thirty-four subjects with chronic hepatitis B and 39 healthy subjects as control were enrolled in the study. Age, body mass index and gender, Serum Triglycerides (TG), High-density Lipoprotein (HDL) and Low-Density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, serum paraoxonase-1 and arylesterase activities were determined. Oxidative and antioxidative statuses were evaluated by measuring serum-free sulfhydryl groups, lipid hydroperoxide levels, total antioxidant capacity, total oxidant status, and oxidative stress index.Results:Serum TG and LDL levels were higher while serum HDL levels were lower in patients with chronic hepatitis B than in controls but the differences did not reach statistical significance. Serum paraoxonase-1 and arylesterase activities, plasma free sulfhydryl groups, and total antioxidant capacity were significantly lower in patients than in controls (p=0.018, p=0.005, p<0.001, p=0.037 respectively), while lipid hydroperoxide, total oxidant status, and oxidative stress index were significantly higher (for all p<0.001).Conclusion:The diminution in the paraoxonase-1 and arylesterase activities could contribute to the accelerated development of atherosclerosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
