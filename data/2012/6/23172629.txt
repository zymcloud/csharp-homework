Purpose:To define the histological characteristics of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) showing atypical dynamic enhancement patterns on gadoxetic acid-enhanced dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI).Materials and methods:We evaluated a total of 130 small (â‰¤ 3 cm) HCCs from 114 patients that were surgically removed after EOB-MRI. Two radiologists blinded to the histological findings retrospectively classified the HCCs into typical or atypical lesions. Gross morphology, nuclear histological grade, presence of vascular invasion, and capsule formation and infiltration were compared between the two groups using Chi-square or Fisher tests.Results:Atypical dynamic enhancement patterns were seen in 23 HCCs (17.7%). None of the atypical HCC showed vascular invasion (P Conclusion:Atypical HCCs on EOB-MRI may be characterized by the absence of vascular invasion, smaller (
