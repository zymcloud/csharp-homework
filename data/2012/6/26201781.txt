Purpose:The aim was to investigate whether the quantitation of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels can predict HBV reactivation and advanced liver disease after spontaneous hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion.Methods:A total of 121 patients who experienced spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion were included in this longitudinal study. Serial HBsAg and HBV DNA levels were measured before and after HBeAg seroconversion.Results:Of the 121 patients, 32 experienced HBV reactivation and six achieved an HBsAg loss after HBeAg seroconversion during the follow-up period. The decline in the HBsAg level was considerably more pronounced in patients without HBV reactivation when compared to those with HBV reactivation (p = 0.016). Multivariate analysis revealed that the age of >40 years at HBeAg seroconversion, male sex, and HBsAg decline, and HBV DNA levels at month 12 after HBeAg seroconversion were independent factors for the development of HBeAg-negative hepatitis. All the six patients who achieved HBsAg loss had HBsAg level of 10(4) copies/mL at month 12 after HBeAg seroconversion.Conclusions:Combining HBsAg reduction and HBV DNA levels at month 12 after HBeAg seroconversion was a useful marker to predict clinical outcomes in spontaneous HBeAg seroconverters.
