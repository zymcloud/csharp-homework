This report presents the case of a 66-year-old male with appendicular metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma. He had a clinical history of right lobectomy of the liver after the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma 3 years prior, and was admitted because of an asymptomatic appendiceal tumor detected by computed tomography. The appendiceal tumor was preoperatively suspected to be a recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma, because of the patient's elevated level of serum Î±-fetoprotein and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II, and based on the magnetic resonance imaging findings. An appendectomy was thus performed, and the histopathological findings confirmed the diagnosis of a metastatic tumor from hepatocellular carcinoma. Appendicular metastasis is extremely rare. This is only the second case of a metastatic appendiceal tumor from hepatocellular carcinoma reported in the English literature.
