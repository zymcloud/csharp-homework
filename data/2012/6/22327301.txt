Purpose:Dendritic cell (DC)-based cancer vaccines have become an attractive antitumour therapeutic approach. However, clinical application of current DC-based cancer vaccines has been limited by their ineffectiveness. Heat shock protein 70 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TBhsp70) is known to have a potent adjuvant capability to induce maturation of DCs and thus acts as an alternative ligand to the CD40 ligand (CD40L) on T cells to induce a T-cell response. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the combination of TBhsp70-H22 tumour-peptide complexes and CD40L might improve the antitumour efficacy for development of therapeutic DC-based vaccines against hepatoma.Methods:The CD40, CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR expression on DCs pulsed with TBhsp70-H22 tumour-peptide complexes and soluble CD40L was studied by flow cytometric analysis, and T-helper type 1 cytokine secretion, such as IL-12p70 secretion, was tested by ELISA. The H22-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) were detected by a (51)Cr-release assay, and the in vivo antitumour immunity against hepatoma was measured by utilising H22-tumour-bearing mice after therapeutic administration.Results:Up-regulation of CD40, CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR expression on DCs pulsed with TBhsp70-H22 tumour-peptide complexes and CD40L was found, which stimulated a high level of T-helper type 1 cytokine secretion, such as IL-12p70, and resulted in the induction of H22-specific CTLs. The therapeutic administration of DCs pulsed in vitro with TBhsp70-H22 tumour-peptide complexes and CD40L significantly reduced the progression of H22 tumours in mice compared with DC-Hsp70-H22 peptide complexes or DC-CD40L alone.Conclusions:Our findings demonstrate that DCs pulsed with Hsp70-H22-peptide complexes and CD40L enhance the antitumour immunity against hepatoma, which provides a novel immunotherapeutic approach against cancer.
