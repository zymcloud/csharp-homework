Purpose:To evaluate hyperintense Gd-DTPA- compared with hyper- and hypointense Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced magnet resonance imaging (MRI) in c-myc/TGFα transgenic mice for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Twenty HCC-bearing transgenic mice with overexpression of the protooncogene c-myc and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α) were analyzed. MRI was performed using a 3-T MRI scanner and an MRI coil. The imaging protocol included Gd-DTPA- and Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced T1-weighted images. The statistically evaluated parameters are signal intensity (SI), signal intensity ratio (SIR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), percentage enhancement (PE), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).Results:On Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI compared with Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI, the SI of liver was 265.02 to 573.02 and of HCC 350.84 to either hyperintense with 757.1 or hypointense with 372.55 enhancement. Evaluated parameters were SNR of HCC 50.1 to 56.5/111.5 and SNR of liver parenchyma 37.8 to 85.8, SIR 1.32 to 1.31/0.64, CNR 12.2 to 26.1/-30.08 and PE 42.08% to 80.5/-98.2%, (P Conclusion:Gd-EOB-DTPA is superior to Gd-DTPA for detecting HCC in contrast agent-enhanced MRI in the c-myc/TGFα transgenic mouse model and there was no difference between the hyperintense or hypointense appearance of HCC. Either way, HCCs can easily be distinguished from liver parenchyma in mice.
