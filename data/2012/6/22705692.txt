A 37-year-old male presented with hepatic metastases from uveal melanoma after the enucleation of an affected eye. Hepatic metastases were thought to be the critical factors determining prognosis, so transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) was performed for local control of the hepatic metastases. The first TACE with cisplatin (CDDP) and gelatin sponge (GS) did not have much success because fine feeding arteries to the main hepatic tumor on the caudate lobe branched out from the hepatic artery, and GS particles were not distributed in the tumor vessels. We used degradable starch microspheres (DSM) as finer obstructing material for the next treatment, and hepatic metastases were treated effectively with repeated CDDP/DSM-TACE.
