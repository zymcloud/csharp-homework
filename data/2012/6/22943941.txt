Objective:To investigate the results of surgical treatment for primary liver cancer of segment VII or VIII.Methods:The clinical data of 149 patients with primary liver cancer who underwent hepatectomy between January 2005 and December 2010 was retrospectively analyzed. There were 120 male and 29 female patients, aging from 19 to 75 years with a mean of 53.1 years. Among 149 patients, tumors were located at segment VII, VIII or several segments containing VII or VIII (VII/VIII group) in 53 patients, located at other segments (non-VII/VIII group) in 96 patients. The results of surgical treatment for VII/VIII group and non-VII/VIII group were compared by using t test, χ(2) test, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportion hazard regression analysis.Results:Right liver lobe was turned over completely in VII/VIII group, hepatic lobe which tumor was located at was not or partly turned over in non-VII/VIII group. Compared with non-VII/VIII group, VII/VIII group had longer operative time ((215 ± 68) min vs. (123 ± 36) min, t = 2.860, P = 0.01). No significant difference was found for tumor size, tumor number, tumor encapsulation, microvascular invasion, Edmondson grade, pTNM stage, intraoperative blood loss, blood transfusion rate, R0 resection rate and postoperative complication rate between two groups. The cumulative 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 74.6%, 42.3%, 15.4% respectively, in VII/VIII group, and 89.3%, 63.0%, 40.4% respectively, in non-VII/VIII group (χ(2) = 13.501, P = 0.000). Univariate and multivariate analysis of prognostic factors indicated that tumor location (tumor was located at segment VII or VIII) had unfavorable prognostic influence on overall survival (χ(2) = 10.329, P = 0.001; HR = 1.693, 95%CI: 1.232 - 2.694, P = 0.013).Conclusion:The results of surgical treatment for primary liver cancer located at segment VII or VIII are worse than that located at other segments.
