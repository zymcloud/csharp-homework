Introduction:Uterine leiomyosarcoma is an aggressive malignant tumor that often leads to metastatic dissemination, generally in the lungs, liver, brain, and bones. Despite the fact that pancreatic neoplasms spread easily, the pancreas is not a usual target organ from other neoplasms.Case report:We present a rare case of metastasis to the pancreas from uterine leiomyosarcoma treated with segmental resection with no recurrence at this stage. A review of the literature is later presented showing no similar case to what has been reported.Discussion:Surgical resection of unique pancreatic metastases is a safe practice. An increase in the survival rate has been demonstrated after resection of metastases from renal cell carcinoma, although it has not been proved with metastases from other locations. Further trials are needed.
