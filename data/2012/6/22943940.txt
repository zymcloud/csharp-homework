Objective:To investigate the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency-assisted anterior approach right hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The clinic data of 12 HCC patients who underwent radiofrequency-assisted anterior approach right hepatectomy from January 2010 to July 2011 was analyzed retrospectively. Surgical techniques and treatment response were retrospectively reviewed. All the 12 patients were male, aging from 38 to 57 years with a mean of (48 ± 6) years. Ten of the 12 patients were infected with hepatitis B virus. A retrohepatic tunnel anterior to the surface of the inferior vena cava (IVC) was developed. The liver was hanged away from the IVC and radiofrequency was carried out along the Cantline's line. Scalpel was used to cut off the liver parenchyma along the middle of the ablated area until the parenchyma was fully resected. After short hepatic veins and the right hepatic vein were ligated, ligaments of right liver were fully isolated and right liver was resected. The t test was performed between 2 groups.Results:The surgical time was 165 to 295 minutes, with a mean of (230 ± 55) minutes. The bleeding was 150 to 1500 ml, with a mean of (516 ± 378) ml, which was better than those of anterior approach right hepatectomy ((1291 ± 1159) ml) and classical right hepatectomy ((2129 ± 2012) ml; t = 1.236, 3.265; P Conclusions:Radiofrequency-assisted anterior approach right hepatectomy for HCC is safe and effective and could effectively decrease intra-operative bleeding and shorten surgical time.
