The infection by hepatitis B virus often promotes chronic liver inflammation which progresses to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in a high percentage of patients. The persistent activation of the immune system causes an incessant liver damage, which fosters a disorganized stimulation of tissue repair and remodelling phenomena. In turn, the viral protein X (HBx) is essential for virus replication and therefore for the maintenance of chronic infection. However, the important oncogenic potential of HBx seems to reside, on one hand, in its ability to integrate into cellular DNA and, additionally, in the transactivation of different cellular signaling pathways involved in cell growth regulation, apoptosis and DNA repair. HBx also interacts with proteasome subunits and notably affects mitochondrial electric potential, thus altering cellular calcium homeostasis. Finally, this review discusses the pathogenic role of HBx in the progression of chronic hepatitis B through its effects on angiogenic, fibrogenic and oncogenic processes.
