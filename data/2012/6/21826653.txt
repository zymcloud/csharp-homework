Liver is an important target for thyroid hormone actions. T(3) exerts its effects by two mechanisms: (i) Genomic actions consisting of T(3) link to nuclear receptors that bind responsive elements in the promoter of target genes, (ii) non-genomic actions including integrin αvb3 receptor-mediated MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR-C1 activation. SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c, and SREBP-2 are transcription factors involved in the regulation of lipogenic genes. We show in Hep G2 cells that T(3) determined a dose- and time-dependent increase in the level of the precursor form of SREBP-1 without affecting SREBP-1 mRNA abundance. T(3) also induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt and of mTOR-C1 target S6K-P70, and the cytosol-to-membrane translocation of PKC-α. Modulation of SREBP-1 protein level by T(3) was dependent on MAPK/ERK, PI3K/Akt/mTOR-C1 pathway activation since the MEK inhibitor PD98059 or the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 abolished the stimulatory effect of T(3) . Conversely, the effect of T(3) on SREBP-1 level was enhanced by using rapamycin, mTOR-C1 inhibitor. These data suggest a negative control of mTOR-C1 target S6K-P70 on PI3K/Akt pathway. The effect of T(3) on SREBP-1 content increased also by using PKC inhibitors. These inhibitors increased the action of T(3) on Akt phosphorylation suggesting that conventional PKCs may work as negative regulators of the T(3) -dependent SREBP-1 increase. T(3) effects were partially abrogated by tetrac, an inhibitor of the T(3) -αvβ3 receptor interaction and partially evoked by T(3) analog T(3) -agarose. These findings support a model in which T(3) activates intracellular signaling pathways which may be involved in the increment of SREBP-1 level through an IRES-mediated translation mechanism.
