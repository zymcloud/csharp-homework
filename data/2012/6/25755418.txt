Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and third leading cause of death worldwide. Main causes of HCC are hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. mEPHX, a xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme, exhibits a dual role of procarcinogen detoxification and activation, hence considered as a cancer risk factor as well as a protective factor. Two known polymorphic forms of mEPHX, exon in exon 3 and 4, are associated with the development of HCC.Objective:To determine the association of genotypes and haplotypes of mEPHX with risk of HCC developments separately in HBV- and HCV-infected carriers and patients with hepatitis.Methods:Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were carried out using primers to amplify exon 3 (113 Tyr→His variant) and exon 4 (139 His→Arg) polymorphic sites. To distinguish the wild and variant forms, PCR amplification products were digested with restriction endonucleases EcoRV and Rsa1 for exons 3 and 4, respectively.Result:Exon 3 genotypes, Y113H and H113H, shared a protective association with HBV-chronic hepatitis infection (P Conclusion:Polymorphic and haplotypic variant forms of mEPHX exon 3 and 4 variably determine the susceptibility to develop HCC in HBV- and HCV-carrier subjects.
