Background:In cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), poor differentiation in pre-liver transplantation (LT) biopsy of the largest tumour is used as a criterion for exclusion from LT in some centres. The potential role of pre-LT biopsy at one centre was explored.Methods:A prospective database of patients undergoing orthotopic LT for radiologically diagnosed HCC at St James's University Hospital, Leeds during 2006-2011 was analysed.Results:A total of 60 predominantly male (85.0%) patients with viral hepatitis were identified. There were discrepancies between radiological and histopathological findings with respect to the number of tumours identified (in 27 patients, 45.0%) and their size (in 63 tumours, 64.3%). In four (6.7%) patients, the largest lesion, which would theoretically have been targeted for biopsy, was not the largest in the explant. Nine (31.0%) patients with multifocal HCC had tumours of differing grades. In two (6.9%) patients, the largest tumour was well differentiated, but smaller tumours in the explant were poorly differentiated. In one patient, the largest lesion was benign and smaller invasive tumours were confirmed histologically.Conclusions:The need to optimize selection for LT in HCC remains. In the present series, the largest tumour was not always representative of overall tumour burden or biological aggression and its potential use to exclude patients from LT is questionable.
