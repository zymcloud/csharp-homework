Acquisition of anoikis resistance is a prerequisite for the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Activation of growth factor signaling pathways and rearrangement of the cytoskeleton have been reported as vital steps in this process. However, key molecules involved in anoikis resistance remain to be determined. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of CD147 on HCC cells resistant to anoikis. The human SMMC-7221 human HCC cell line was used. Immunofluorescence was used to investigate the expression levels of CD147. Anoikis-induced cell death was assessed using trypan blue exclusion. In the present study, the results showed that SMMC-7721 HCC cells exhibited significant morphological changes when suspended in culture medium supplemented with 1% methocel and a subpopulation of cells resistant to anoikis was acquired with higher viability and invasion ability. CD147 was identified to be significantly increased in cells resistant to anoikis, when compared to the parental cells. CD147 knockdown by siRNA notably induced cell anoikis, partially through the inactivation of PI3K/Akt pathway. All of these evidence provide a novel CD147-related mechanism underlying the metastasis of HCC cells.
