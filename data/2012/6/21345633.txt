Purpose:To assess the validity of contrast-enhanced ultrasonic parametric perfusion imaging in the evaluation of antiangiogenic tumor treatment by using histology as the reference standard.Materials and methods:H22 hepatoma-bearing mice were treated with thalidomide or placebo by intraperitoneal injection. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound was performed on day 8 after bolus injection of SonoVue. Three different parametric perfusion images were calculated based on the following parameters: area under the curve (AUC), maximum intensity (IMAX) and perfusion index (PI). A score from 1 to 5 (1 = low, 5 = excellent) was used for analysis of parametric perfusion images by two independent readers. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed for evaluation of microvascular density (MVD).Results:Treatment with thalidomide resulted in a significant decrease in perfusion scores assigned to AUC, IMAX and PI parametric images as compared with control tumors (P Conclusion:Contrast-enhanced ultrasonic parametric perfusion imaging provides a noninvasive tool to directly visualize tumor perfusion changes after antiangiogenic tumor treatment.
