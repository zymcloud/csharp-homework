Objective:This study aims to investigate the correlation between polymorphism of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) Asp327Asn (rs6259) locus and occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:621 cases with HCC and 621 cancer-free controls from two hospitals of Guangxi were recruited from January, 2007 to June, 2010. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of SHBG Asp327Asn were detected by ABI7500 Fast Real-Time fluorescence quantitative PCR. Multivariate unconditional logistic regression was applied to analyze risk of HCC among different genotypes carriers and their interaction with the exposure factors. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to detect the relationship between onset age of HCC and genotypes.Results:The frequencies of Asp/Asp, Asp/Asn and Asn/Asn genotype in case group were 86.31% (536/621), 12.40% (77/621) and 1.29% (8/621), respectively; while those in control group were 81.00% (503/621), 17.39% (108/621) and 1.61% (10/621), respectively. Significant difference in the genotype frequencies distribution was found between case and control groups (Ï‡2=6.465, PConclusion:Polymorphism of SHBG (Asp327Asn) may be associated with both the risk of HCC occurrence and onset age of HCC.
