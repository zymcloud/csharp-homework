Background:Metabolic syndrome (MS) is an emerging risk factor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC related to MS may occur either in advanced fibrosis or before the development of cirrhosis, suggesting involvement of different molecular pathways according to the features of background liver.Objective:To investigate genomic aberrations in HCC related to MS in order to identify new target genes involved in liver carcinogenesis.Methods:Chromosomal aberrations of HCC obtained from 20 patients with MS (HCC/MS) were studied by comparative genomic hybridisation and compared with HCC related to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (HCC/HCV, n=10) and, within the group of HCC with MS, according to the condition of the background liver (presence or absence of significant fibrosis).Results:Among the most frequent chromosomal alterations observed in HCC, 6p21.1 amplification had a higher incidence in HCC/MS than in HCC/HCV (60% vs 20%, pConclusions:This study demonstrates specific genomic alterations in HCC/MS and points to CUL7 as a novel gene potentially involved in liver carcinogenesis associated with MS, the amplification of which might influence cell proliferation.
