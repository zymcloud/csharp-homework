Although considerable effort has been devoted to the design of various nanoprobes for the fluorescent detection of multiple biomarkers in a single assay, they often suffer from emission-overlapping, owing to small Stokes shifts and wide emission spectra, which results in cross-talk and inaccurate quantification. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a new nanoprobe for multienzyme detection with completely resolved emission peaks under single-wavelength excitation. The probe was assembled by attaching a cleavable peptide spacer, which was comprised from a matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) substrate and a MMP-7 substrate, onto the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) through cysteine residues. A lanthanide complex, BCTOT-Eu(III) (BCTOT=1,10-bis(5'-chlorosulfo-thiophene-2'-yl)-4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7-octafluorodecane-1,3,8,10-tetraone), and 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) were attached to the N terminus and the C terminus of the peptide, respectively. In the presence of one or both targeting enzymes, the substrate was cleaved and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the dyes and AuNPs was prohibited, thereby resulting in the dramatic fluorescence emission of dyes. Importantly, there was no emission cross-talk between the two dyes, thereby ensuring accurate detection of each enzyme. Based on this, the simultaneous fluorescence image of MMP-2 and MMP-7 was accomplished in living cells under single wavelength excitation. The apparent differences in the fluorescence imaging indicated distinct differences between the expression levels of MMPs between the human normal liver cells and the human hepatoma cells.
