Background:Biopsy of metastatic site of disease can influence treatment decisions, but its impact on survival remains uncertain.Patients and methods:One-hundred patients with first metachronous liver metastases (LM) from breast cancer (BC) who underwent liver biopsy between 1999 and 2009 were identified. One-hundred matched control patients with LM from BC and no biopsy were selected.Results:Liver biopsy had no statistically significant impact on survival when comparing biopsied patients to controls [HR 0.82 (95% CI 0.58-1.16)]. Patients with early metastasis (within 3 years) undergoing liver biopsy had a better survival [HR 0.60 (95% CI 0.38-0.97)] compared to those who did not. Liver biopsy had no statistically significant impact on survival in patients with late LM (after 3 years) [HR 1.09 (95% CI 0.69-1.74)]. We observed that 18 out of 100 biopsied patients (18.0%) had a conversion of predictive factors which allowed adjusting for therapy, specifically new expression of ER (n=5), overexpression of HER2 (n=12) or both (n=1). Fourteen out of 18 (77.8%) received anti-HER2 treatment for the first time at the time of metastasis and 3 others (16.7%) received hormone therapy. Those 18 patients showed a better survival compared to the other 82 biopsied patients [HR 0.55 (95% CI 0.28-1.10)] and compared to the 13 biopsied patients with disappearance of features which predicted responsiveness to a given treatment [HR 0.19 (95% CI 0.06-0.62)].Conclusions:Liver biopsy can impact survival of patients with early metastases from BC. Discordance between primary and distant lesions can offer the patients new treatment options.
