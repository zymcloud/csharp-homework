Background/aims:To explore the relationships among differentiation degree, contrast-enhanced ultrasound and the expression of EphB4/EphrinB2 in primary hepatocarcinoma.Methodology:Forty one patients that were diagnosed with hepatocarcinoma by contrast-enhanced ultrasound before operation and then confirmed to have primary hepatocarcinoma by postoperative pathology were enrolled in our study. The expression of EphB4/EphrinB2 in tumor specimens were detected by immunohistochemical assay and compared with the result of contrast-enhanced ultrasound.Results:Differentiation degree was related to EphrinB2 expression and contrast-enhanced ultrasound in primary hepatocarcinoma. EphrinB2 expression was significantly higher in poorly differentiated hepatocarcinoma (88.9%, 16/18) then in moderately and well differentiated hepatocarcinoma (34.8%, 8/23) (?2=12.17, pConclusions:EphrinB2 is an important indicator of poorly differentiated hepatocarcinoma. There is a good correlation of EphrinB2 expression with vascular perfusion pattern and morphology in arterial phase displayed by contrast-enhanced ultrasound, so contrast-enhanced ultrasound has a certain value in evaluating differentiation degree of primary hepatocarcinoma before operation.
