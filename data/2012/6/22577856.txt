Background:Polypropylenimine dendrimers have been shown to be alternative vectors for DNA delivery.Purpose:Up to now, polypropylenimine dendrimers have not been investigated for the transport of specific single stranded modified oligonucleotides for targeted gene alteration.Methods:We investigated generation four polypropylenimine dendrimers to target a 45 base (phosphorothioate modified) DNA oligonucleotide in the cell nuclei of cultured cells in order to correct a specific point mutation in hprt.Results:Transfection resulted in a high cellular uptake of the FITC-labeled oligonucleotides in V79 hamster fibroblasts and HuH-7 human liver cell lines, at low toxicity levels. Using transmission electron microscopy and immunolabeling, oligonucleotides were found 24 h after transfection predominantly in the nuclear compartment. The oligonucleotides showed the desired biological activity, the correction of the hprt point mutation in V79-400 cells.Conclusions:For the transfection of modified oligonucleotides in targeted gene alteration, generation four polypropylenimine dendrimer is a suitable vector.
