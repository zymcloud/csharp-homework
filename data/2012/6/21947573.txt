Background:Leiomyosarcoma is rare in the oral cavity, where it may arise as primary, radiation-associated, or metastatic tumor. This article reports two cases of oral leiomyosarcoma, discussing the range of clinicopathological features and the significance of these presentations.Case report:One case is a radiation-associated leiomyosarcoma arising in the tongue of a 71-year-old male occurring 22 years after radiation therapy for tonsil squamous cell carcinoma that was surgically treated. The other one is a mandible metastasis from a retroperitoneal widespread leiomyosarcoma in a 69-year-old man, who was treated by surgery and chemotherapy but died from the disease.Discussion:Post-radiotherapy sarcomas of the oral cavity and oral metastasis from soft tissue sarcomas are very uncommon, but based on patient's clinical history, they should be considered by oral health care providers in order to allow an early diagnosis and proper and timely management. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this seems to be the first reported case of tongue leiomyosarcoma arising in a previously irradiated field.
