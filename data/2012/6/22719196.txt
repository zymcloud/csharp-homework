Aim:To investigate whether DNA-dependent activator of interferon-regulatory factors (DAI) inhibits hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and what the mechanism is.Methods:After the human hepatoma cell line Huh7 was cotransfected with DAI and HBV expressing plasmid, viral protein (HBV surface antigen and HBV e antigen) secretion was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and HBV RNA was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Northern blotting, and viral DNA replicative intermediates were examined by Southern blotting. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation and nuclear translocation were analyzed via Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining respectively. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity induced by DAI was detected by immunofluorescence staining of P65 and dual luciferase reporter assay. Transwell co-culture experiment was performed in order to investigate whether the antiviral effects of DAI were dependent on the secreted cytokines.Results:Viral protein secretion was significantly reduced by 57% (P < 0.05), and the level of total HBV RNA was reduced by 67% (P < 0.05). The viral core particle-associated DNA was also dramatically down-regulated in DAI-expressing Huh7 cells. Analysis of involved signaling pathways revealed that activation of NF-κB signaling was essential for DAI to elicit antiviral response in Huh7 cells. When the NF-κB signaling pathway was blocked by a NF-κB signaling suppressor (IκBα-SR), the anti-HBV activity of DAI was remarkably abrogated. The inhibitory effect of DAI was independent of IRF3 signaling and secreted cytokines.Conclusion:This study demonstrates that DAI can inhibit HBV replication and the inhibitory effect is associated with activation of NF-κB but independent of IRF3 and secreted cytokines.
