Context:Data on the potential effect of metformin on the risk of liver cancer are limited and inconsistent.Objective:The objective of this study was to review the evidence currently available to examine the potential role of metformin in chemoprevention for liver cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes.Data sources:The data sources of the study included the PubMed and SciVerse Scopus databases.Study selection:Selection included studies that assessed the effect of metformin therapy on the risk of liver cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes.Data extraction:Summary effect estimates were derived using a random-effects meta-analysis model.Data synthesis:A database was developed on the basis of five studies consisting of approximately 105,495 patients with type 2 diabetes. In meta-analyses, metformin was associated with an estimated 62% reduction in the risk of liver cancer among patients with type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.24, 0.59; P Conclusions:Metformin appears to be associated with a lower risk of liver cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes. Further investigation, including mechanistic studies, well-designed cohort studies, and possibly controlled trials, is needed.
