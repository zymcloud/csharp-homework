Distant metastases from oral squamous cell carcinoma are unusual, but generally occur in lungs, bone, and liver. Cutaneous metastasis is extremely rare, and it often reflects an advanced stage with sinister prognosis. The authors report an 81-year-old male patient with multifocal cutaneous metastases from a recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the hard palate 5 months after primary treatment.
