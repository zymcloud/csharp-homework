Recently, we have reported tissue- and stage-specific expression of miR-195 in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and so far, not many reports discuss the function of this microRNA (miRNA). Expression profiling of miRNAs revealed a limited set of miRNAs with altered expression in drug resistant hepatocellular carcinoma cell line BEL-7402/5-FU compared to its parental BEL-7402 cell line. Real-time PCR confirmed down-regulation of miR-195 in BEL-7402/5-FU cells. Western blots were performed to determine protein levels of LATS2, P53 and CDK2. MTT analysed the cell proliferation activity. Flow cytometry were performed to determine apoptosis rate. Up-regulation of miR-195 increased expression of LATS2 and increased apoptosis of HCC cells, while Anti-miR-195 treatment inhibited expression of LATS2. miR-195 over-expression inhibited the luciferase activity of a LATS2 3' untranslated region-based reporter construct in BEL-7402/5-FU cells. These results indicate that miR-195 could increase cell apoptosis by targeting LATS2 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
