Purpose:Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an accepted treatment option for primary and metastatic liver tumors. As percutaneous RFA has some limitations, laparoscopic RFA (LRFA) has been used as a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of hepatic malignancies.Methods:Between March 2006 and September 2009, thirty patients with hepatic malignancies that were contraindicated for resection or percutaneous RFA underwent LRFA. Indications for this procedure were hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, 21 patients), metastatic liver tumor (8 patients) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (1 patient).Results:Among the 30 patients who underwent LRFA, 5 patients underwent concomitant laparoscopic liver resection. Intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasound detected new malignant lesions in 4 patients (13.3%). A total of 46 lesions were ablated by LRFA. There was no postoperative mortality. The three-year overall survival rate was 83.7% for the HCC group and 64.3% for the metastatic group.Conclusion:LRFA for hepatic malignancies proved to be a safe and effective treatment. Also, this procedure is indicated for lesions that are not amenable to percutaneous RFA or liver resection.
