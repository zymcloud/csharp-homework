Background:NF-κB expression has been shown to be responsible for resistance to antineoplastic agents.Aims:The aim of our study was to investigate the importance of NF-κB expression as prognostic factor in locally advanced rectal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy.Methods:We retrospectively analysed the immunoreactivity for NF-κB in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who underwent neoadjuvant treatment (chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy) in our Institution between March 2003 and June 2006.Results:Seventy-four consecutive patients were enrolled into this study. Immunohistochemistry analysis for NF-κB was performed both in biopsies and in primary tumour samples. NF-κB was considered positive when at least 1% of the tumour cells showed nuclear positivity. A significant correlation between a positive NF-κB nuclear expression, both in biopsies and in tumour samples, and a worse overall survival was observed. Moreover, median time to progression was significantly shorter in the NF-κB-positive subgroup of patients.Conclusion:Globally, our findings seem to suggest that NF-κB could represent an important parameter able to predict the outcome in patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment for rectal cancer. It also could be useful in order to select patients to receive adjuvant chemotherapy, intensifying the adjuvant therapy and, in the next future, obviating the use of drugs involving NF-κB system in their mechanism of action in NF-κB-positive patients.
