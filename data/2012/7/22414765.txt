Background & aims:Hepatocyte apoptosis is a key feature of chronic liver disease including viral hepatitis and steatohepatitis. A previous study demonstrated that absence of the Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1 led to increased hepatocyte apoptosis and development of liver tumors in mice. Since Mcl-1 not only inhibits the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis but can also inhibit cell cycle progression and promote DNA repair, it remains to be proven whether the tumor suppressive effects of Mcl-1 are mediated by prevention of apoptosis.Methods:We examined liver tumor development, fibrogenesis, and oxidative stress in livers of hepatocyte-specific knockout (KO) of Mcl-1 or Bcl-xL, another key antagonist of apoptosis in hepatocytes. We also examined the impact of additional KO of Bak, a downstream molecule of Mcl-1 towards apoptosis but not the cell cycle or DNA damage pathway, on tumor development, hepatocyte apoptosis, and inflammation.Results:Bcl-xL KO led to a high incidence of liver tumors in 1.5-year-old mice, similar to Mcl-1 KO. Bcl-xL- or Mcl-1-deficient livers showed higher levels of TNF-α production and oxidative stress than wild-type livers at as early as 6 weeks of age and oxidative DNA damage at 1.5 years. Deletion of Bak significantly inhibited hepatocyte apoptosis in Mcl-1 KO mice and reduced the incidence of liver cancer, coinciding with reduction of TNF-α production, oxidative stress, and oxidative DNA damage in non-cancerous livers.Conclusions:Our findings strongly suggest that chronically increased apoptosis in hepatocytes is carcinogenic and offer genetic evidence that inhibition of apoptosis may suppress liver carcinogenesis in chronic liver disease.
