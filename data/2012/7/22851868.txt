Aim:To assess vitamin D (Vit D) abnormalities in hepatitis C infected patients and their relationship with interleukin (IL)-17, IL-23 and N-terminal propeptide of type III pro-collagen (PIIINP) as immune response mediators.Methods:The study was conducted on 50 Egyptian patients (36 male, 14 female) with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, who visited the Hepatology Outpatient Clinic in the Endemic Disease Hospital at Cairo University. Patients were compared with 25 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. Inclusion criteria were based on a history of liver disease with HCV genotype 4 (HCV-4) infection (as new patients or under follow-up). Based on ultrasonography, patients were classified into four subgroups; 14 with bright hepatomegaly; 11 with perihepatic fibrosis; 11 with hepatic cirrhosis; and 14 with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Total Vit D (i.e., 25-OH-Vit D) and active Vit D [i.e., 1,25-(OH)â‚‚-Vit D] assays were carried out using commercial kits. IL-17, IL-23 and PIIINP levels were assayed using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kits, while HCV virus was measured by quantitative and qualitative polymerase chain reaction.Results:Levels of Vit D and its active form were significantly lower in advanced liver disease (hepatic cirrhosis and/or carcinoma) patients, compared to those with bright hepatomegaly and perihepatic fibrosis. IL-17, IL-23 and PIIINP levels were markedly increased in HCV patients and correlated with the progression of hepatic damage. The decrease in Vit D and active Vit D was concomitant with an increase in viral load, as well as levels of IL-17, IL-23 and PIIINP among all subgroups of HCV-infected patients, compared to normal healthy controls. A significant negative correlation was evident between active Vit D and each of IL-17, IL-23 and PIIINP (r = -0.679, -0.801 and -0.920 at P Conclusion:The negative correlations between Vit D and IL-17, IL-23 and PIIINP highlight their involvement in the immune response in patients with HCV-4-related liver diseases in Egypt.
