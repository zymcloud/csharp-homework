Aim:To follow up blood donors found with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, to improve the outcome by antiviral treatments.Methods:Between 1991 and 2001, 3377 of the 1 925 860 donors (0.18%) were found to have HCV infection at the Hiroshima Red Cross Blood Center in Japan. Of them, 987 were able to be followed regularly over 9-18 years until 2009, and received antiviral treatments as required.Results:At the start, chronic hepatitis was diagnosed in 541 (54.8%), cirrhosis in five (0.5%) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in one (0.1%), whereas the remaining 439 (44.5%) had persistently normal aminotransferase levels (PNAL). Hospital visits were terminated voluntarily in 24.3% within the first year, 46.8% by 10 years and 50.9% by 17 years. Liver disease improved in 178 (18.0%), remained stable in 606 (61.4%) and aggravated in 170 (17.2%). Of the 541 donors with chronic hepatitis, HCC developed in 28 (5.2%) and cirrhosis in 11 (2.0%), whereas HCV infection was cleared in 107 (19.8%) by antiviral treatments. In addition, HCV infection resolved in 54 of the 439 donors (12.3%) with PNAL after they had developed chronic hepatitis and received treatments. In donors with chronic hepatitis, the cumulative incidence of HCC was 4.1% at 10 years. By multivariate analysis, age and diagnosis of chronic hepatitis at the entry were found to be independent risk factors for the development of HCC.Conclusion:Individuals with undiagnosed HCV infection need to be identified and receive medical care. They have to be motivated to merit from this health-care program.
