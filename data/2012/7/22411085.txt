Background:The effectiveness of subcuticular absorbable suture with subcutaneous drainage to decrease the risk of postoperative incisional surgical site infection (SSI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients was evaluated.Methods:A total of 149 patients with HCC who underwent hepatectomy (Hx) were retrospectively investigated. Patients were divided into two groups: the patients with subcuticular suture combined with subcutaneous drainage (the drainage group; 61 patients) and the patients with nylon suture without subcutaneous drainage (the nylon group; 88 patients). After the operations, the complication rate of postoperative incisional SSI was analyzed and compared between the two groups.Results:In the drainage group the rate of incisional SSI was significantly lower compared to the nylon group: 14-3 % (p = 0.033), respectively. Patients with incisional SSI needed significantly longer postoperative hospital care than the patients without incisional SSI: 28 versus 15 days (p Conclusions:We have demonstrated that the subcuticular suture with subcutaneous drainage is effective in preventing incisional SSI in patients undergoing Hx for HCC.
