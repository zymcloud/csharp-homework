Purpose:The pretreatment C-reactive protein (CRP) level is reported to be a prognostic indicator in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We investigated the prognostic implications of the changes in the CRP level after initial treatment in patients with HCC. We prospectively evaluated a cohort of 150 patients with newly diagnosed HCC. The patients were categorized into three groups: group 1 (n = 120) with pre- and post-treatment CRP Results:The 1- and 3-year overall survival rates were 92.3 and 82.9 % for group 1, 80.0 and 53.3 % for group 2, and 58.8 and 4.2 % for group 3. The overall survival rate for group 3 was significantly lower than that for group 1 (P Conclusions:A persistently elevated CRP level after initial treatment is an independent marker of a poor prognosis, and normalization of the CRP level after initial treatment is associated with a better outcome in patients with HCC.
