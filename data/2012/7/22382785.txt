Although sEH inhibitors are well studied in inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases, their effects on gliomas are unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of t-AUCB, a more potent and selective sEH inhibitor, on U251 and U87 human glioblastoma cell lines and the HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. Our results showed that t-AUCB efficiently inhibited sEH activities in all three cell lines (the inhibition rate was more than 80% in each) and suppressed U251 and U87 cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, but exhibited no cell growth inhibition on HepG2. We detected high levels of phosphorylated NF-κB-p65 (Ser536) in t-AUCB-treated U251 and U87 cells, and then found that the NF-κB inhibitor PDTC can completely abolish t-AUCB-induced growth inhibition. This indicated that t-AUCB suppresses U251 and U87 cell growth by activating NF-κB-p65. Moreover, we found that t-AUCB induces cell-cycle G0/G1 phase arrest by regulating Cyclin D1 mRNA and protein levels and CDC2 (Thr161) phosphorylation level. We propose to further test this promising reagent for its anti-glioma activity in clinical relevant orthotopic brain glioma models.
