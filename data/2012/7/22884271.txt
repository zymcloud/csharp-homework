Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurring in pregnancy is very rare. The prognosis is usually poor because of unclear clinical presentation. A 30-year-old woman who suffered from HCC during pregnancy underwent hepatectomy twice, and resection for pulmonary metastasis once. A healthy infant was delivered after the first hepatectomy. Currently, she remains disease free 55 months after the second hepatectomy and 39 months after pulmonary metastatectomy. Moreover, she had another healthy infant 37 months after pulmonary metastatectomy. Aggressive resection of recurrent HCC may prolong life, and pregnancy should not alter the treatment strategy for HCC.
