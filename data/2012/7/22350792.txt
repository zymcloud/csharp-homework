Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4 plays a crucial role in tumor invasion and metastasis of various human cancers. However, little is known about the correlation of BMP4 expression with clinical aggressiveness and prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of BMP4 in HCC and determine its correlation with tumor progression and prognosis. Immunohistochemistry assay was used to determine the expression of BMP4 in HCC and corresponding paracarcinomatous tissues from 156 patients. The potential prognostic value of BMP4 was investigated by comparing the survival rates between the BMP4-positive and BMP4-negative HCC patients. Immunohistochemically, BMP4 protein expression in the HCC tissues (120/156, 76.9%) was significantly higher than that in the paracarcinomatous tissues (19/156, 12.2%, P
