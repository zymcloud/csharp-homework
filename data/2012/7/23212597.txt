Transarterial radioembolisation with yttrium-90 (TARE-Y90), a catheter-directed therapy, has been used extensively in adults to treat primary and secondary hepatic malignancies. To our knowledge, the use of this palliative technique has not been described in children. We present two children with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with TARE-Y90.
