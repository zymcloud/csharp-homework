The aim of this study was to determine serum selenium (Se) levels during the development of liver disease as well as the possible Se supplementation benefits in liver disease patients. Serum was collected from 187 patients with liver diseases and 120 normal healthy people living in Seoul. The samples were collected at the Kangnam St. Mary's Hospital College of Medicines, The Catholic University of Korea, in accordance with procedures approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Catholic University of Korea. Serum Se levels were quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and were compared between healthy and liver diseases patients. Se levels were 92.65 ± 32.50 μg/l in hepatitis infection, 92.33 ± 30.66 μg/l in hepatitis B virus infection and 96.41 ± 51.50 μg/l in hepatitis C virus infection, 96.42 ± 32.80 μg/l in cirrhosis, and 67.47 ± 14.30 μg/l in hepatoma patients. Findings were significantly lower in hepatitis and hepatoma as compared with the healthy participants (P
