Background:Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is minimally invasive and can achieve a high rate of cure of liver cancer. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a bipolar RFA device (CelonPOWER System) in the treatment of Japanese liver cancer patients.Methods:The study was a multicenter, single-group, open-label trial. The indications for RFA were based on the Japanese guidelines for the management of liver cancer. The subjects had a Child-Pugh classification of A or B, and the target tumors were defined as nodular, numbering up to 3 lesions, each of which was 3 cm or less in diameter, or solitary lesions up to 4 cm in diameter. To test for the non-inferiority of the CelonPOWER System, this system was compared with the Cool-tip RF System, which has already been approved in Japan, in terms of the complete necrosis rate (CNR).Results:The CNR obtained with the CelonPOWER System was 97.8 % (88/90 patients). The CNR obtained with the Cool-tip RF System was 86.2 % (50/58 patients), confirming the non-inferiority of the CelonPOWER System (p Conclusions:The CelonPOWER System was confirmed to be an effective and safe RFA device. It could become extensively used as a safe next-generation RFA device, reducing the physical burden on patients.
