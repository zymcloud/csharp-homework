Background:The prognosis of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poor, particularly among patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT). This study evaluated the efficacy of combined 5-fluorouracil and pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) α-2b in patients with advanced HCC.Methods:Subjects comprised 59 HCC patients with PVTT treated using subcutaneous administration of PEG-IFNα-2b (50-100 μg on day 1 of each week for 4 weeks) and intra-arterial infusion of 5-fluorouracil (250 mg/d for 5 hours on days 1-5 of each week for 4 weeks). One treatment cycle lasted 4 weeks. The current therapy was discontinued in patients with progressive disease (PD). For responses other than PD, treatment was repeated for ≥1 cycle. The primary efficacy endpoint was the objective early response rate. Secondary efficacy endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival.Results:Objective early response rate was 73.0%. Cumulative PFS rates were 67.4% at 6 months, 30.2% at 12 months, 25.9% at 18 months, and 20.7% at 24 months. Median PFS was 9.7 months. Cumulative survival rates were 82.4% at 6 months, 73.6% at 12 months, 52.8% at 24 months, and 44.0% at 36 months. Median survival time was 29.9 months. All adverse reactions were controllable by temporary suspension of treatment. Serious complications and treatment-related deaths were not observed.Conclusions:Although a prospective randomized controlled trial using a larger population of patients with advanced HCC is needed to evaluate combination therapy with 5-fluorouracil and PEG-IFNα-2b, this new combination therapy may be useful for patients with advanced HCC.
