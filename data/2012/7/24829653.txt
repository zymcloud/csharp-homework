A young man presented with a large liver mass and positive hepatitis B virus markers. This 18-year-old male has developed ascites, jaundice, high serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level, liver mass and portal hypertension, without fever or calcification in the mass. All favored the diagnosis of rapidly, progressive hepatocellular carcinoma, however proven hepatoblastoma in liver biopsy. Hepatoblastoma usually manifests prior to the third year of life, but can rarely be seen in older children or adults. Although HCC rarely can be presented in young patients with HBV infection, but in patients without cirrhosis hepatoblastoma should be considered as the first possible diagnosis.
