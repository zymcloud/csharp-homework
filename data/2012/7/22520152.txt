A new series of substituted quinazolin-4-(3H)-one-tyrphostin derivatives was prepared and screened for their cytotoxic activity against three tumor cell lines, namely human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) and human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2) using the colorimetric MTT assay. Among the current series, 10 compounds exhibited remarkable in vitro antiproliferative activity against the three tested cell lines with the IC(50) values ranging from 0.009 to 0.015 mM. All the compounds showed suitable drug like characteristics according to Lipinski's rule.
