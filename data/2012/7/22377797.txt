Patients who have received liver transplant are at increased risk of skin complications due to long-term immunosuppression regimen. The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence and risk factors of skin complications in liver transplant patients. We analyzed 161 liver transplant recipients. The mean age at transplantation was 47.4 years. Mean follow-up was 6 years. Seventy-one percent of patients presented with skin complications, including aestethic alterations, infections, precancerous lesions and malignancies, which represented 57%, 43%, 18% and 9%, respectively. Risk factors were: age at transplantation â‰¥ 45 years, immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine, and phototype II and III. Our study indicates that although liver transplant recipients are at greater risk of developing skin complications compared to the general population, the risk is lower than for other solid organ transplants, particularly for premalignant and malignant lesions.
