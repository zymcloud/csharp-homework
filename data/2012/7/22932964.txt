Aim:To compare the survival outcome between surgical resection (SR) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The retrospective study enrolled eighty-two patients with newly diagnosed BCLC early HCC (single nodule, size ≦3 cm, and Child-Pugh class A) treated either surgically (n = 46) or with RFA (n = 36) from year 2004 to 2009. The patients' survival outcomes were compared.Results:There were no significant differences in overall survival (OS) rates between SR and RFA (p = 0.204). The 3- and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 65.8 % and 53.7 % respectively, in the SR group, which were significantly higher than those in the RFA group (34.8 % and 14.9 % respectively) (p = 0.009 and p = 0.001). In subgroup analysis, the DFS was similar between RFA and SR in patients with presentation of lower platelet count (≦100,000/mL) and smaller tumor size (tumor size ≦1 cm). Multivariate analysis showed SR as a procedure type was a significant predictive factor for DFS [HR = 2.26 (CI 1.462-5.227), p = 0.002].Conclusion:SR yielded similar OS but better DFS when compared to RFA for patients with BCLC early HCC (single nodule, ≦3 cm and Child-Pugh class A). In subgroup patients with lower platelet count (≦100,000/mL) and smaller tumor size (tumor size ≦1 cm), DFS was similar between both treatments.
