Metastasis to the stomach from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is extremely rare. Usually, gastric metastasis seems to be a late event in patients with RCC and is accompanied by disseminated tumor spread to other organs. Solitary synchronous gastric metastasis from small, localized RCC has rarely been reported. We report a case of 79-year-old man with synchronous gastric metastasis presenting with a single erosive lesion from pT1 RCC. The patient underwent radical nephrectomy and endoscopic resection for metastatic gastric cancer. The resected specimen showed an ill-defined tumor, approximately 0.6 cm long, with a clear resection margin. The morphologic features of the tumor cells were consistent with those of metastatic RCC of the clear cell type. At 6 months's follow-up, the patient did not show local recurrence or additional metastasis on upper endoscopy and computed tomography scan.
