Background:Although anatomical resection (AR) is considered better than non-anatomical resection (NAR) for the treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), there is only limited evidence in support of this argument.Aim:The aim of this study was to investigate whether AR is superior to NAR regarding postoperative outcomes in patients with small solitary HCC and preserved liver function.Methods:The study subjects were 92 curatively-resected patients with adequate liver function reserve (indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min 70%, serum albumin >3.5 g/dl) and macroscopically small (â‰¤3.0 cm) solitary HCC without macroscopic vascular invasion; 30 patients underwent AR and 62 patients NAR. Postoperative short-term outcomes including mortality and morbidity and long-term outcomes were compared in the two groups.Results:There was no significant difference in clinicopathological background in the two groups. Although resected liver volume was significantly larger in the AR group than the NAR group (p Conclusions:AR of a solitary small HCC did not carry postoperative outcome advantages compared with NAR in patients with preserved liver function. We recommend NAR for hepatic resection of small solitary HCC in patients with preserved liver function.
