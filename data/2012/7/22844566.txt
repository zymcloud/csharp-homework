Background/aims:The purpose of this study was to assess the value of acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) for predicting the extent of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by correlating the elasticity of HCC and peritumoral parenchyma (as measured by ARFI) with the extent of ablation determined by computed tomography (CT).Methods:From September 2009 to June 2011, 158 patients underwent RFA ablation for HCC (single, â‰¤3 cm). We evaluated the data of a total of 38 prospectively enrolled patients who underwent both ARFI imaging and contrast-enhanced CT after one session of 12 minutes of RFA without a change in needle position. The ARFI imaging indices, including the mean shear wave velocity (SWV) of HCC, mean SWV of the peritumoral parenchyma and tumor size, were evaluated to determine the statistical correlation with RFA extent after one session of 12 minutes of RFA.Results:A stiffer liver parenchyma in patients with cirrhosis results in a smaller ablation zone.Conclusions:SWV of ARFI in liver parenchyma was well correlated with RFA extent. After evaluating the correlation between ARFI and RFA extent, we suggest that the SWV in liver parenchyma might be a non-invasive supplementary tool for predicting the extent of RFA.
