Aim:to evaluate treatment compliance and survival of patients receiving oral sorafenib in Indonesia.Methods:a prospective cohort trial. Unresectable Hepatocelullar carcinoma patients receiving Sorafenib in NexPAP program were recruited between October 2008 and September 2011. A historical cohort from Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, between 1998 and 2000 was selected to serve as control group. Patients in the control group received symptomatic treatment. Survival analysis was done by the Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis and the log-rank test. Median survival difference between the NexPAP and control group was tested using the Cox-regression hazard analysis.Results:There were 48 patients in the NexPAP group and 40 patients in the control group. Treatment compliance was very good; no patient with drew from the study. Sorafenib generally could be tolerated by the patients. The most common adverse events are mild or moderate hand and foot skin reaction and diarrhea. The median survival was 49 weeks in NexPAP group (95% CI 37.9-60.1) vs. 20 weeks in the control group (95% CI 9.0-31.0). Cox-regression analysis showed that sorafenib significantly prolonged overall survival with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.339 (95% CI: 0.196-0.584). There was no survival difference between patients with Child-Pugh class A and class B in both NexPAP (median 49 vs. 52 weeks; HR 1.1; 95% CI 0.5-2.3; p=0.855) and control groups (27 vs. 20 weeks; HR 1.1; 95% CI 0.5-2.4; p=0.822).Conclusion:Sorafenib patient assistant program in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma ensured compliance treatment and significantly prolonged overall survival over the historical cohort receiving palliative treatment.
