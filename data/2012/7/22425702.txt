Background & aims:SCY-635 is a non-immunosuppressive analog of cyclosporin A that inhibits cyclophilins A and B and hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication in vitro. In a phase 1b multi-dose escalation study, we evaluated the safety, plasma pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of 15 days of monotherapy with SCY-635 in adults with chronic genotype 1 HCV infection.Methods:Twenty adults with chronic HCV genotype 1 were randomized to SCY-635 oral doses of 100, 200, or 300 mg three times daily for 15 days.Results:No dose-limiting clinical or laboratory toxicities were identified. On day 15, the mean decline in plasma viremia was 2.24±1.74 log(10) IU/ml with SCY-635 900 mg/d. Individual antiviral responses correlated with host IL28B genotype. Post hoc analyses indicated treatment with SCY-635 increased plasma protein concentrations of interferon α (IFNα), IFNs λ(1) and λ(3), and 2'5' oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (2'5'OAS-1), with the greatest increases in IL28B CC and CT subjects. Changes in plasma concentrations for all markers were coincident with changes in the plasma concentration of SCY-635. Peaks of IFNs α, λ(1), and λ(3) and 2'5'OAS-1 were observed within 2 h after drug administration. In replicon cells, SCY-635 enhanced secretion of type I and type III IFNs and increased the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG).Conclusions:These studies establish clinical proof of concept for SCY-635 as a novel antiviral agent and suggest that restoration of the host innate immune response to chronic hepatitis C infection may represent a major mechanism through which cyclophilin inhibitors exert clinical antiviral activity.
