Background:This study was intended to assess the effect of resection of pulmonary metastasis (PM) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation (LT). No effective treatment modality exists for PM-HCC, and little is known about the posttransplant outcomes of pulmonary metastasectomy (PMT).Methods:Of 587 adult LT recipients diagnosed with HCC, 43 had PM-HCC. We retrospectively compared outcomes in 23 patients who underwent PMT and 20 who did not. PMT was precluded in ten patients in the non-PMT group by multiple (usually â‰¥ 5) lung nodules, in nine by lung nodules with concurrent or residual extrapulmonary metastasis, and in one by comorbidity.Results:Of the 23 patients in the PMT group, 14 underwent a single session of PMT, 7 underwent 2 sessions each, and 2 underwent 3 sessions each, for a total of 34 sessions. There were no surgery-related deaths or complications. After first PMT, 41 nodules, each 0.2-2.5 cm in diameter, were observed: 1-5 nodules per patient. Every available treatment was provided to patients with post-PMT recurrence and those in the non-PMT group to control pulmonary and extrapulmonary metastases. Patient survival rates before PM diagnosis did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.141). However, 2 year post-PM survival rate was significantly greater in the PMT group (30.6% vs. 0%, p = 0.007), resulting in a significantly greater overall 5 year survival rate (44.7% vs. 12.8%, p = 0.017). Univariate analysis showed no risk factor significantly associated with patient survival after PMT.Conclusions:PMT should be performed for resectable PM-HCC because it may provide a chance of long-term survival.
