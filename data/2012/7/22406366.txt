Pseudomyxoma peritonei (mucinous carcinoma peritonei) is a rare clinical disease. Although most cases derive from appendiceal mucinous tumors, a few are associated with pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. Intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile duct share many similarities with pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and are thought to be their biliary counterparts. We report a case of low-grade intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct who developed pseudomyxoma peritonei 6 years after surgical treatment of the primary biliary tumor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of pseudomyxoma peritonei associated with intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct. The tumor recurrence in our case may be due to tumor spillage at the time of the first surgery, since there is no recurrent biliary tumor in the preserved liver lobe. Prevention of spillage of epithelial cell-containing mucin during surgical operations is important in treating intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile duct.
