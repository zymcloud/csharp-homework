Objective:To investigate the effects of omeprazole (OME), a proton pump inhibitor, on the proliferation and apoptosis of human hepatoma cell line HepG2.Methods:HepG2 cells were cultured to the logarithmic phase, and then treated with OME of different concentrations (10, 20, 40, 80, 160 mg/L) for 24 h or 48 h. Cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay, DNA synthesis was measured with 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (Edu) fluorescent assay and the apoptosis of cells was measured by the Hoechst33342 assay.Results:MTT assay showed that OME (40, 80 and 160 mg/L concentrations) could inhibit the proliferation of HepG2 cells for 24 h or 48 h treatment (P < 0.05) and 80 mg/L group has strongest effect. Compared with that of 24 h treatment, the same concentration of OME could inhibit HepG2 more significantly with 48 h treatment. After different concentrations of OME treatment for 24 h and then incubation with Edu for 2 h, compared with the control group, the proportion of Cells in S phase in 20, 40, 80, 160 mg/L groups decreased. Hoechst33342 staining demonstrated that treatment with OME (40, 80,160 mg/L) for 24 h could significantly promote the cell apoptosis.Conclusion:Omeprazole could inhibit human hepatoma cell line HepG2 cell proliferation and promote apoptosis.
