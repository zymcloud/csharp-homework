Objective:To investigate the anti-angiogenic effects and mechanisms of Zengmian Yiliu Granule (ZMYLG) on ovarian carcinoma xenograft.Methods:The SKOV3 ovarian carcinoma bearing mouse model was established. The tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into the control group, the paclitaxel group, the high, medium, and low dose ZMYLG group, 8 in each group. The medication was lasted for ten days. The microvessel density (MVD) in the xenograft was calculated by the method of using cell membrane differentiation antigen 34 (CD34) antibody marking new vascular endothelial cells. The protein and mRNA expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor fetal liver kinase-1 (FLK-1), hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) in the tumor were determined using immunohistochemical assay and RT-PCR.Results:The MVD of ovarian carcinoma xenografts in the paclitaxel group, the high, medium, and low dose ZMYLG group obviously decreased, showing statistical difference when compared with the control group (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). Each ZMYLG dose group could down-regulate the protein and mRNA expressions of VEGF, FLK-1, and HIF-1alpha (P < 0.01, P < 0.05).Conclusions:ZMYLG could inhibit neogenesis of tumor vessels. Its mechanisms might be associated with down-regulating the expression of HIF-1alpha, modifying the hypoxic state, inhibiting the expressions of VEGF and FLK-1, and exerting its anti-angiogenic effects.
