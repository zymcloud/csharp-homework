Background:Our purpose was to assess the clinicopathological features and surgical outcomes of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-CC) in an Asian center.Methods:Between 1998 and 2009, 27 patients were diagnosed with combined HCC-CC at our hospital. Their medical records were reviewed and clinicopathological data retrospectively analyzed.Results:The 27 patients included 24 (88.9%) males and 3 (11.1%) females with a mean age of 58.26 Â± 11.18 years. Cirrhosis was present in 10 patients (37.0%), and 12 patients had hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus infection. Serum alpha fetoprotein was >20 ng/ml in 7 of the 19 patients in whom it was measured (36.8%). Twenty-five patients underwent hepatic resections and 2 received liver transplantations. Five (18.5%) patients had separate HCC and CC within the same liver (type I), 21 (77.8%) had tumors with mixed components (type II), and 1 patient had a type III tumor (3.7%). Of 22 patients with immunohistochemical data, 19 (86.4%) were cytokeratin (CK) 7-positive, 20 (90.9%) were CK19-positive, and 4 (18.2%) were CK20-positive. Mean follow-up was 25.8 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 72.5 and 49.4%, respectively. The 1- and 2-year disease-free survival rates were 54.2 and 41.3%, respectively. Symptoms at the time of diagnosis, and regional lymph node metastases, were associated with higher mortality and recurrence.Conclusions:Lymph node metastasis and positive resection margins are important factors affecting HCC-CC surgical outcomes.
