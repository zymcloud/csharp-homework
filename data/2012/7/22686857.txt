Aim:The Japanese Nutritional Study Group for Liver Cirrhosis (JNUS) was assembled in 2008 with the support of a Health Labor Sciences Research Grant from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan. The goal of the study group was to propose new nutritional guidelines for Japanese patients with liver cirrhosis (LC), with the aim of preventing hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Between 2008 and 2010, the member investigators of JNUS conducted various clinical and experimental studies on nutrition on LC. These included anthropometric studies, a questionnaire study on daily nutrient intake, clinical trials, experimental studies using animal models, re-evaluation of previous publications and patient education. Over this 3-year period, the group members regularly discussed the nutritional issues related to LC, and a proposal was finally produced.Results:Based on the results of JNUS projects and discussions among the members, general recommendations were made on how Japanese patients with LC should be managed nutritionally. These recommendations were proposed with a specific regard to the prevention of hepatocarcinogenesis.Conclusion:The new JNUS guidelines on nutritional management for Japanese patients with LC will be useful for the actual nutritional management of patients with LC. The JNUS members hope that these guidelines will form the basis for future discussions and provide some direction in nutritional studies in the field of hepatology.
