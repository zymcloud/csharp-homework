Primary small cell esophageal carcinoma is a rare cancer with a poor prognosis, for which to date there is no recommended standard treatment. We present a 60-year-old male with this disease who was successfully managed by the combination of radiation and chemotherapy. The patient was referred to our hospital for liver dysfunction of unknown cause. On admission, he was diagnosed as having a primary small cell esophageal carcinoma and multifocal metastasis in the liver. He received cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil(CDDP 40mg/m2-days 1, 8, 5-FU 400 mg/m2-days 1-5, 8-12)and local radiation of 50 Gy for the esophagus, followed by 4 courses of chemotherapy the same as listed above. At the end of therapy, radiological findings showed that both primary and metastatic lesions completely disappeared. Unfortunately, he died of liver failure due to the recurrence of metastatic small cell carcinoma in the liver 13 months after the end of initial therapy. However, the primary cancer lesion had not recurred by that time. These findings suggest the beneficial effect of the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy for advanced-stage small cell esophageal carcinoma.
