Background:High mobility group box 1(HMGB1) overexpression has been reported in a variety of human cancers. However, the role of HMGB1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The aim of present study was to analyze HMGB1 protein expression in tumor, para-tumor and normal tissue and to assess its prognostic significance for HCC after curative hepatectomy.Methods:The levels of HMGB1 mRNA and protein in tumor, para-tumor and normal tissue were evaluated in 11 HCC cases by Reverse Transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. Additionally, HMGB1 protein expression in 161 HCC was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and survivals. Student's t-test, spearman's rank correlation, Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox proportional hazards regression model were used to analyze the data.Results:By RT-PCR and Western blot, the levels of HMGB1 mRNA and protein were significantly higher in HCC, compared to that in para-tumor (p 5 cm (p = 0.031), but not for tumor â‰¤5 cm (p = 0.101).Conclusions:HMGB1 protein might contribute to the malignant progression of HCC, high expression of HMGB1 predicts poor prognosis for patients with HCC after curative hepatectomy, especially for patients with tumor >5 cm.
