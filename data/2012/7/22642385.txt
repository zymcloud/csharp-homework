Rhenium-188 is one of the most readily available generator derived and useful radionuclides for therapy emitting Î²(-) particles (2.12 MeV, 71.1% and 1.965 MeV, 25.6%) and imageable gammas (155 keV, 15.1%). The (188)W/(188)Re generator is an ideal source for the long term (4-6 months) continuous availability of no carrier added (nca) (188)Re suitable for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals for radionuclide therapy. The challenges associated with the double neutron capture route of production of the parent (188)W radionuclide have been a major impediment in the progress of application of (188)Re. Tungsten-188 of adequate specific activity can be prepared only in 2-3 of the high flux reactors operating in the World. Several useful technologies have been developed for the preparation of clinical grade (188)W/(188)Re generators. Since the specific activity of (188)W used in the generator is relatively low 185 GBq(
