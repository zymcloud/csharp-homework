ING3, a member of the inhibitor of growth (ING) family, has been reported to be involved in transcription modulation, cell cycle control and the induction of apoptosis. Previous studies have demonstrated that the expression of ING3 decreased in melanoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ING3 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumorigenesis and progression. The correlation between ING3 expression and clinicopathological variables of HCC was analyzed. Using the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), it was found that ING3 was downregulated in HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues (p
