Gene therapy mediated by murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based replicating retrovirus vector (RRV) was previously proven to be highly effective in tumor cell killing, resulting in significant suppression of tumor growth in vivo. Recently, we developed a different form of RRV which is derived from another retrovirus, gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV), as a cancer therapeutic agent. We compared the gene delivery efficiency and antitumor effects in the two types of RRV in experimental hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our results show that both RRVs can efficiently spread throughout entire HCC cell populations in vitro and achieve high transduction efficiency in HCC xenografts in vivo, while GALV RRV, in general, exhibited more rapid replication kinetics in the tumors. In vitro, substantial HCC cell killing was achieved even when initially only 1% of the HCC cells were producing RRVs that express the yeast cytosine deaminase suicide gene, indicating that the high efficiency of gene transfer by replicative spread of RRVs greatly increased suicide gene toxicity. In vivo, GALV RRV-mediated suicide gene therapy efficiently suppressed HCC tumor growth and no detectable RRV signals were observed in extratumoral tissues, showing promise in using GALV RRV as a cancer therapeutic agent.
