Objectives:To compare the diagnostic performance of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI using 3.0 T with that of multiphasic 64-multirow detector CT (MDCT) for the detection of small (≤2 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic liver disease.Methods:A total of 54 patients (44 men, 10 women; age range, 33-81 years) with 59 HCCs (≤2 cm in diameter) who underwent both multiphasic (arterial, portal venous, equilibrium) 64-MDCT and gadoxetic acid-enhanced 3.0 T MRI were enrolled in this study. Two observers independently and randomly reviewed the MR and CT images on a lesion-by-lesion basis. The diagnostic performance of these techniques for the detection of HCC was assessed by alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, in addition to evaluating the sensitivity and positive predictive value.Results:For each observer, the areas under the ROC curve were 0.874 and 0.863 for MRI, respectively, as opposed to 0.660 and 0.687 for CT, respectively. The differences between the two techniques were statistically significant for each observer (p0.05).Conclusion:Gadoxetic acid-enhanced 3.0 T MRI shows a better diagnostic performance than that of 64-MDCT for the detection of small (≤2 cm) HCCs in patients with chronic liver disease.
