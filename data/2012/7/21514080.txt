Purpose:To investigate the usefulness of T2* mapping of liver on gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced MRI for estimating liver function.Materials and methods:33 patients were classified into 3 groups as follows: normal liver function (NLF) (n = 7); mild liver damage (MLD) (n = 16) with Child-Pugh A; severe liver damage (SLD) (n = 10) with Child-Pugh B. T2*-weighted gradient-echo (T2*W-GRE) and T1-weighted gradient-echo (T1W-GRE) images were obtained before and after Gd-EOB-DTPA administration (3, 8, 13, and 18 min; 5, 10,15, and 20min; respectively). T2* mapping of liver was calculated from T2*W-GRE, then T2* values of liver and T2* reduction rates of T2* value between pre- and post-contrast enhancement were measured. The increase rates of liver-to-muscle signal intensity (LMS) ratio on T1W-GRE between pre- and post-contrast enhancement were calculated.Results:T2* values on pre- and post-contrast showed no significant differences among three groups. Significant differences in T2* reduction rates were found among groups, and those of LCB were lower than those of other groups (NLF:MLD:SLD, 3.8:6.0:0.6% at 3 min, 8.2:10.3:1.0% at 8 min, 10.7:11.5:1.2% at 13 min, and 16.1:13.2:3.5% at 18 min, respectively) (PConclusion:T2* reduction rate and increase rate of LMS ratio on T1W-GRE may allow us estimation of liver function according to Child-Pugh score.
