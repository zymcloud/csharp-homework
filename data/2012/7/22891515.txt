We carried out a retrospective study of all patients admitted to Al-Thawra Teaching Hospital in Sana'a with hepatocellular carcinoma to study the disease profile in Yemeni patients and identify possible risk factors. During the 8-year study period, January 2001-December 2008, 251 patients were admitted with confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma. From hospital records we collected data on demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, histological characters, viral markers, treatment and outcome. Around 75% of the patients were males. Age range was 26-75 years, mean 53.5 (SD 13.9) years. Most patients were farmers (73.7%) and had a history of chemical contact. Chronic hepatitis B virus infection (48.2%) and hepatitis C virus infection (38.2%) were the most frequently identified risk factors. Qat chewing and smoking were not statistically significant risk factors. Right lobe involvement was seen in 109 (43.4%) patients and 154 (61.4%) presented with multiple lesions. We found 187 (74.0%) patients had cirrhotic liver associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Overall mortality rate within 6 months of admission to hospital was 24.3%.
