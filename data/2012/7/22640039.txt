Objective:To investigate the effect of LBP on differentiation and maturation of healthy human peripheral blood-derived dendritic cells cultured in different tumor microenvironment in vitro, and discuss the molecular and immunological mechanisms of LBP in treatment of tumor.Methods:In this study, we procured the peripheral blood-derived dendritic cells precursor cell by the Density gradient centrifugation method, and used the tumor-cell supernatant to prepare conditioned medium. The GM-CSF and IL-4 induced DCs precursor cell differentiation to DCs, the TNF-α promoted the immature DCs developed to mature DCs. In this way, we detected the influence of LBP on the expressions of surface molecules of DCs cultured in different environments, and especially on the role of related-immunity and NF-κB activity.Results:In LBP-treated group, the molecular phenotype of DCs, its capacity to stimulate allogeneic lymphocyte proliferation, and the levels of IL-12p70 and IFN-γ secretion were higher than the untreated group (p Conclusion:LBP could increase the expression of the phenotype of DCs, the secretion of IL-12p70 and IFN-γ in MLR, and enhance the NF-κB expression, especially in the virus-related group, suggesting LBP plays the anti-tumor role stronger in the virus-related environment and this phenomenon correlates with the NF-κB signaling pathway.
