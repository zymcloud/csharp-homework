Background:Studies have previously indicated that surgical outcomes are poorer for obese patients. To date, few reports concerning the effect of obesity on patient outcomes following a hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been published. The present study, therefore, sought to determine the impact of patients' body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) on short- and long-term surgical outcomes and to identify potential prognostic factors for HCC following a hepatectomy.Methods:Patient data was retrospectively collected from 181 consecutive patients between September 2002 and August 2007 who had undergone hepatectomy for HCC with curative intent. Patients were assigned to three groups according to their BMI (low 25), and the clinical and pathological data, surgical outcome, and long-term survival were analyzed and compared between the three groups.Results:The overall survival rate of the low BMI group was notably below that of the standard group. Surgical outcomes were not significantly different between the three groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that a low BMI (Conclusions:The present study suggests that a low BMI is a significant prognostic factor for low overall survival when performing a hepatectomy for HCC.
