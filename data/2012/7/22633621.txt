Purpose:Serial α-fetoprotein (AFP) measurements are useful for assessing tumor responses to numerous therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study tested the predictive value of changes in des-γ-carboxy prothrombin (DCP), in parallel with AFP, as an indicator of HCC response after transarterial chemoembolization.Materials and methods:The study group consisted of 327 patients with HCC initially seropositive for DCP (≥ 40 mAU/mL) and/or AFP (≥ 100 ng/mL) who underwent repeated chemoembolization as first-line therapy. Radiologic responses were measured based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors guidelines. Serologic response was defined as a decrease of at least 50% in DCP or AFP level from baseline. Radiologic-serologic correlation and disease progression and survival according to serologic responses were analyzed.Results:Before treatment, 129 patients (39%) had high DCP alone, 66 (20%) had high AFP alone, and 58 (18%) had high levels of both. Radiologic and serologic responses were achieved in 88.2% and 91.4% of patients with high DCP levels and in 89.5% and 91.1% of those with high AFP levels, respectively. Serologic response based on AFP or DCP was significantly correlated with radiologic response, and this was confirmed by landmark analysis (P Conclusions:After transarterial chemoembolization for HCC, DCP response may be a useful surrogate endpoint of immediate and prolonged clinical outcomes, along with AFP response.
