4',5,7-Trihydroxy-3',5'-dimethoxyflavone (Tricin), a naturally occurring flavone, has anti-inflammatory potential and exhibits diverse biological activities including antigrowth activity in several human cancer cell lines and cancer chemopreventive effects in the gastrointestinal tract of mice. The present study aimed to investigate the biological actions of tricin on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in vitro, exploring its potential as a treatment of liver fibrosis, since HSC proliferation is closely related to the progression of hepatic fibrogenesis in chronic liver diseases leading to irreversible liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Tricin inhibited platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-induced cell proliferation by blocking cell cycle progression and cell migration in the human HSC line LI90 and culture-activated HSCs. It also reduced the phosphorylation of PDGF receptor Î² and the downstream signaling molecules ERK1/2 and Akt, which might be due to its tyrosine kinase inhibitor properties rather than inhibition of the direct binding between PDGF-BB and its receptor. Our findings suggest that tricin might be beneficial in HSC-targeting therapeutic or chemopreventive applications for hepatic fibrosis.
