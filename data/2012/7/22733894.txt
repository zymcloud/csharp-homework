Objective:Novel drugs targeting molecular pathways involved in tumor development have revolutionized cancer treatment. Radiologists often focus on therapeutic response when evaluating cancer patients and may miss important signs of drug toxicity. This article familiarizes radiologists with the complications of molecular targeted agents in abdominal solid organs, enabling early identification and appropriate intervention and thus reducing patient morbidity and mortality.Conclusion:Knowledge of the common abdominal toxicities--including hepatitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, fluid retention, and infection--is crucial for early diagnosis, which may spare patients devastating complications or the need for surgery.
