18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose avidity for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and hepatocellular carcinoma is variable, depending on the underlying tumor biology. Experience with non-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracers (eg, 18F-labeled amine precursors l-dihydroxyphenylalanine and 68Ga-DOTA-peptides for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and radiolabeled acetate or choline for hepatocellular carcinoma) is evolving and expanding rapidly. This article reviews the role of FDG and non-FDG radiotracers in the imaging evaluation of patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or hepatocellular carcinoma.
