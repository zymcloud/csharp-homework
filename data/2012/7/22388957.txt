Background and aim:To evaluate the role of chemokine CC ligand 20 (CCL20) as a biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:Ninety patients in four groups were enrolled in this prospective cross-sectional study: 30 with HCC (group I), 30 with liver cirrhosis (group II), 15 with hepatitis C virus infection (group III), and 15 healthy blood donors as controls. Alpha fetoprotein (AFP), CCL20 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured in all groups.Results:Serum levels of CCL20 were significantly different among the study groups (F=230.979, pConclusion:CCL20 may be used for the detection of HCC in HCV-infected patients with comparable specificity and higher sensitivity than AFP.
