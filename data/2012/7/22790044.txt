We evaluated the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy using modified OPTIMOX1 plus bevacizumab for advanced rectal cancer.Patients and methods:Nine cases with highly advanced rectal cancer for which curative surgery was potentially difficult were enrolled(clinical T4 in 7 cases, lateral node metastasis in 3 cases, M1 in 2 cases).Results:The number of courses of modified OPTIMOX1(mFOLFOX6 and sLV5FU2, alternating administration)plus bevacizumab ranged from 1 to 21(median: 10). Surgical procedures consisted of internal sphincter resection(ISR)in 4 patients, ultra-low anterior resection(ULAR)in 2 patients, pelvic exenteration(TPE)in 2 patients, and Hartmann's procedure in 1 patient. Liver resection was conducted in 2 patients. RM1 was confirmed in 2 patients, but curative surgery was performed in the other patients. Histological efficacy of grade x/1a/1b/2were seen in the above 1/4/2/2 cases, respectively. Neurotoxicity associated with oxaliplatin was mild; no grade 3 neurotoxicity was noted. Recurrence has been confirmed in 5 patients at the median follow-up period of 650 days.Conclusion:It was suggested that modified OPTIMOX1 plus bevacizumab is effective and safe to administer as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy for curative resection or anus-preserving surgery in patients with highly advanced rectal cancer.
