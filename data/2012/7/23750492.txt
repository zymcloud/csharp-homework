Background:Obesity has been associated with poor oncologic outcomes following pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer. However, there is a paucity of evidence on the impact of obesity on postoperative complications, oncologic outcome and survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).Methods:From a database of over 1000 patients who underwent OLT during 1996-2008, 159 patients with a diagnosis of HCC were identified. Demographic data, body mass index (BMI), perioperative parameters, recurrence and survival were obtained. Complications were grouped according to Clavien-Dindo grading (Grades I-V).Results:There were increased incidences of life-threatening complications in overweight (58%) and obese (70%) patients compared with the non-obese patient group (41%) (P Conclusions:These findings indicate that BMI is an important surrogate marker for obesity and portends an increased risk for complications and a poorer oncologic outcome following OLT for HCC.
