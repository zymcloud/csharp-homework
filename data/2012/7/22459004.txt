Background:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a known carcinogen with considerable genetic heterogeneity: six different genotypes have been identified. HCV genotype distribution varies from country to country. In the United States, the most prevalent genotypes are 1a, and 1b followed by genotypes 2, and 3.Objectives:To examine whether the distribution of HCV genotypes differed by cancer status among patients in the same area.Study design:We reviewed epidemiologic and virological data of 636 patients with HCV infection evaluated at 3 institutions in Houston, Texas, in 2008 and 2009.Results:We included 129 cancer patients (53 with hematologic malignancies and 76 with solid tumors), 333 immunocompetent patients, and 102 HIV-co-infected patients. The prevalence of genotype 1 (G-1) was 66% among cancer patients, 84% among immunocompetents (P=0.00004), and 99% among HIV-co-infected patients (PConclusions:This multicenter retrospective study provides evidence of differences in HCV genotype distribution by underlying disease among geographically related patients and suggests a possible greater carcinogenic potential of some variants. Large-scale prospective studies are warranted to investigate HCV genotype distribution in other regions.
