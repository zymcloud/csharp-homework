Lipiodol-based transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been performed for over 3 decades for the treatment of solid tumors and describes the infusion of chemotherapeutic agents followed by embolization with particles. TACE is an effective treatment for inoperable hepatic tumors, especially hypervascular tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma. Recently, drug eluting beads (DEBs), in which a uniform embolic material is loaded with a drug and delivered in a single image-guided step, have been developed to reduce the variability in a TACE procedure. DEB-TACE results in localization of drug to targeted tumors while minimizing systemic exposure to chemotherapeutics. Once localized in the tissue, drug is eluted from the DEB in a controlled manner and penetrates hundreds of microns of tissue from the DEB surface. Necrosis is evident surrounding a DEB in tissue days to months after therapy; however, the contribution of drug and ischemia is currently unknown. Future advances in DEB technology may include image-ability, DEB size tailored to tumor anatomy and drug combinations.
