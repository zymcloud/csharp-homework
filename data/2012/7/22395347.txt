Background:Patients with large-size (>10 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Child B cirrhosis are usually excluded from curative treatment, i.e., hepatic resection, because of marginal liver function and poor outcome. This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of the radiofrequency (RF)-assisted sequential "coagulate-cut liver resection technique" in expanding the criteria for resection of large HCC in cirrhotic livers with impaired liver function.Methods:Forty patients with Child-Pugh A or B cirrhosis underwent liver resection from December 1, 2001 to December 31, 2008. Of these, 20 patients (13 Child-Pugh A and 7 Child-Pugh B) with advanced stage HCC (stage B and C according to Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer Group) underwent major liver resection. The two groups were comparable in terms of patient age, liver cirrhosis etiology, tumor number, and size.Results:All resections were performed without the Pringle maneuver. There was no significant difference found between the two groups regarding resection time, perioperative transfusion, postoperative complications, hospital stay, and day 7 values of hemoglobin and liver enzymes. Likewise, there was no significant difference found in the overall survival between Child A and Child B patients who underwent major liver resectionConclusions:RF-assisted sequentional "coagulate-cut liver resection technique" may be a viable alternative for management of patients with advanced HCC in cirrhotic liver with impaired function.
