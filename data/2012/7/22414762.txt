Background & aims:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is more frequent in kidney recipients than in the general population with a higher rate of liver-related morbidity and mortality. We evaluated the benefit associated with HBV viral suppression by nucleos(t)ide analogues treatment in HBV-infected kidney recipients.Methods:This retrospective study included 42 HBsAg-positive kidney recipients, 33 males, 9 females, median age 54 years, followed up during a mean of 15.4±11.8 years after kidney transplantation. Mean treatment duration by single or combined nucleos(t)ide analogues was 6.8±4.3 years. Fibrosis, before treatment, according to Metavir score was: F4 for 6 patients, F3 for 10, F2 for 6, and F0-F1 for 20 patients. The primary end point, the patient survival, was defined as patient death or liver transplantation, the secondary end point was graft survival.Results:HBV DNA at the last evaluation was undetectable (Conclusions:Suppression of HBV replication associated with nucleo(s)tide analogues treatment improves the survival of HBV-infected kidney recipients. Viral suppression does not exclude regular follow-up given the risk of occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma even in non-cirrhotic patients.
