Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) is a pattern-recognizing receptor that is involved in immune signaling and plays a crucial role in survival by being able to recognize various viral components including double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). TLR3 expression and function in cancer cells are not well understood. In this study, we investigated whether TLR3 agonist dsRNA (BM-06) can inhibit proliferation and invasion, and promote apoptosis in HepG2.2.15 cells. HepG2.2.15 cells secreting hepatitis B virus (HBV) were treated with BM-06 and poly(I:C). Western blot analysis and PCR were employed to determine pharmacodynamic changes in biomarkers relevant to TLR3 signaling. Cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis were analyzed by CCK-8 assay, transwell assay and flow cytometry. The expression of HBsAg, and HBcAg was observed by immunohistochemistry. Compared with untreated cells, pharmacological NF-κB activity of the TLR3 pathway by BM-06 (1.734-fold) or poly(I:C) (1.377-fold) was induced. By western blot analysis, we found that dsRNA induced TLR3-activated HepG2.2.15 cells which expressed NF-κB levels predominantly in the cytoplasmic fraction but fewer signals in the nucleus. BM-06 inhibited the proliferation, invasion and secretion of HBV, and induced apoptosis in HepG2.2.15 cells. In addition, the antitumor effects of BM-06 were superior to poly(I:C). Pharmacological activation of the TLR3 pathway by BM-06 can inhibit HepG2.2.15 cell growth.
