Background:During the resent years there has been interest in using bone marrow stem cells to treat liver cirrhosis. However, there is a potential concern for malignant transformation after stem cell therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation for liver cirrhosis.Methods:All the patients who underwent autologous stem cell transplantation for liver cirrhosis between 2005 and 2011 at our center were enrolled. Cellular infusion was made through peripheral vein, portal vein, or hepatic artery.The patients were invited to undergo screening for hepatocellular carcinoma. The screening was made with ultrasonography and alpha-feto protein (AFP) measurement.Results:Thirty two patients (18 males) were included in the study. Mean age of patients was 45.7 years. Fifteen patients (47%) received mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), 9 (28%) received bone marrow mononuclear cells, 5 (16%) were given CD 133-positive bone marrow cells, and 3 (9%) patients received CD 34-positive bone marrow cells. Mean duration of follow up was 20.5months. Mean serum level of AFP was 2.8 ng/ml at baseline and 3.4ng/ml at the end of follow up (p= 0.3). One patient was found to have hepatocellular carcinoma three months after infusion of bone marrow mononuclear cells. The incidence rate for HCC was 1.8 cases per 100 person-years in this study.Conclusion:Autologous bone marrow stem cell infusion does not appear to increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. The incidence rate of HCC in this study is comparable or even less than the reported rates of HCC in cohort studies of cirrhotic patients.
