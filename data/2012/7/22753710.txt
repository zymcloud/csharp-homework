Background:Deregulated RAS/RAF/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways are found in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to test the inhibitory effects of PI-103 (a small molecule inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR) and sorafenib as single agents and in combination on HCC tumorigenesis in an in vivo xenograft model.Materials and methods:In vitro study: Huh7 proliferation was assayed by 3H-thymidine incorporation and by thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Western blots were used to detect phosphorylation of the key enzymes in the two pathways. In vivo study: Human HCC cell line Huh7 was inoculated into nude mice s.c. and the mice were treated with sorafenib (20 mg/kg/day) and PI-103 (5 mg/kg, every 4 days). Tumor size was measured every other day. Tumors were isolated for western blot and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay detection of apoptosis and signaling pathway enzymes.Results:Our in vitro study found that combination of sorafenib and PI-103 additively inhibited Huh7 proliferation as compared to single-agent treatment. Sorafenib and PI-103 as single agents differentially inhibited or activated key enzymes (MEK, ERK, AKT, mTOR, and S6K) in PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MAPK signaling pathways. Combination of sorafenib and PI-103 inhibited all the key enzymes in the two pathways. Our in vivo study demonstrated significant differences between control group, mono-drug groups and drug-combination group (pConclusion:The combination of PI-103 and sorafenib has the advantage over mono-drug therapy on inhibition of HCC cell proliferation and tumorigenesis by inhibiting both PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MAPK signaling pathways.
