Objective:Cytokines play important roles in angiogenesis, inflammation, and cell growth. The present study aimed to investigate the correlation between cytokine changes and clinical characteristics in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients receiving transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:Forty-one TACE-näive HCC patients receiving 73 sessions of TACE and 30 healthy controls were studied. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), angiogenin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), epidermal growth factor receptor, and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) before and at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days after TACE as well as clinical parameters were analyzed.Results:Baseline serum levels of VEGF, bFGF, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α in HCC patients were significantly elevated, whereas EGF and TGF-β1 levels were lower compared to those in healthy controls (p Conclusions:TACE is associated with the modulation of serum angiogenic, inflammatory, and cell growth cytokines in HCC patients. Serum IL-6 correlates with post-TACE fever, and baseline serum VEGF independently predicts patient survival.
