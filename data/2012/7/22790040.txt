Some clinical studies confirmed the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC), for which the standard initial dose is 400 mg twice daily. However, it is unclear whether this dosage is tolerable for patients with a low body surface area(BSA). We retrospectively analyzed the difference in efficacy and safety of sorafenib between patients with low BSA and high BSA.Method:From July 2009 to June 2010, 64 patients with Child-Pugh grade A cirrhosis receiving sorafenib at 4 institutions were enrolled, and divided into two groups(BSAResults:In BSAConclusion:Standard dosage seems intolerable for patients with low BSA, and results in poor prognosis.
