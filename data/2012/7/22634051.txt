The roles of furin and intrahepatic cytokines in chronic heptatitis B virus (HBV) infection remain largely unknown. Here, we examined the relations between furin, IL-10, IL-12β, interferon (IFN)-γ, programed death (PD)-1, programed death ligand (PD-L)1, and the suppression of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and surface antigen (HBsAg) biosynthesis. Liver biopsies were performed on 20 chronically HBV-infected (15 HBeAg-positive and 5 HBeAg-negative) patients to assess liver inflammation/fibrosis, and mRNA levels of furin, IL-10, IL-12β, IFN-γ, PD-1, and PD-L1 were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. IFN-γ mRNA abundance was associated with lower furin mRNA levels and higher PD-1 and PD-L1 mRNA levels in liver tissue from HBeAg-positive patients. IL-10 and IL-12β mRNA levels positively correlated with IFN-γ expression levels (P
