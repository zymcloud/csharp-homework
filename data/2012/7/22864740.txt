ZCVI(4)-2 was a novel nitric oxide-releasing glycosyl derivative of oleanolic acid that displayed strong cytotoxicity selectively against human hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. In this study, ZCVI(4)-2 was characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffractometry, Raman spectroscopy, hygroscopicity and stability. A high performance liquid chromatography method was also established for the quantitative determination of solubility and additional stability profile of ZCVI(4)-2. ZCVI(4)-2 was found to be an amorphous and stable solid with low solubility of less than 10 Î¼g/mL. Based on the solubilization tests that included methods of cosolvency and micellization, the solution mixture of 5% Solutol HS-15, 5% 1, 2-propylene glycol and 5% anhydrous ethanol was determined to be the system for the preparation of the ZCVI(4)-2 early injection solution. The effect of pH, temperature, light and injectable isotonic glucose or NaCl solution on ZCVI(4)-2 injection was also investigated. Good stability was observed at all testing conditions. Under the conditions studied, the NO-releasing rate and amount of ZCVI(4)-2 from the early injection solution in rat plasma demonstrated a promising therapeutic efficacy while maintaining a good safety profile.
