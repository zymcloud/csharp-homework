Background and aims:Intratumoral hypoxia affects every major aspect of cancer biology, but the relationship between hypoxia-induced genes and hepatocellular carcinoma has not been fully investigated. From a previously ranked microarray of hypoxia-inducible genes related to hepatocellular carcinoma, we focused on a histone H3 lysine 9 demethylase, known as Jumonji domain containing 1A. One function of this demethylase is to amplify hypoxia-inducible gene expression. We hypothesized that the demethylase would be a significant marker of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:We examined Jumonji domain containing 1A expression in 110 hepatocellular carcinoma samples with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. We performed a small interfering RNA suppression analysis to determine the biological roles of the demethylase in proliferation, invasion, and the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related genes.Results:The level of Jumonji domain containing 1A in cancer tissues was higher than in normal tissues (P Conclusion:Jumonji domain containing 1A is a useful prognostic marker and may ameliorate malignant transformation in hepatocellular carcinoma.
