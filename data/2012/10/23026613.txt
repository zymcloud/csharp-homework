Sirolimus has immunosuppressive properties and antitumor effects. It was prescribed in liver transplantation initially in association with calcineurin inhibitors because of its lower nephrotoxic and neurotoxic effects and its potential antitumor effects. The aim of this study was to analyze the use of sirolimus as rescue therapy for liver transplant patients.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed all 15 patients treated with sirolimus from 2009 to 2011 among 150 liver transplantations. We analyzed pre- and postconversion data. With statistical analysis using the Student's t-test.Results:Sirolimus was the immunosuppressant therapy in 15 of 150 (10%) patients. Their average age was 56.2 years (range, 42-69) including 9 men (60%). The mean time between liver transplantation and the introduction of sirolimus was 24.6 months (range, 1-120). Sirolimus remained as the sole medication for 4 patients (26.6%). The overall time of sirolimus thereby averaged 14.3 months (range, 1-18). The reasons for the introduction of sirolimus were acute rejection (n = 8; 53.3%), chronic rejection (n = 2; 13.3%), development of malignancy (n = 3; 20%) or prior hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 2; 13.3%). Among 9 patients who initiated sirolimus because of rejection, 7 (77.7%) showed improvement in serum liver enzymes. Among the 3 (33.3%) patients who displayed renal insufficiency before the introduction of sirolimus (creatinine level > 1.5 mg/dL) 1 showed improvement with a decrease of â‰¥50%. The average follow-up was 18 months (range, 1-36). The average sirolimus level during the first 3 months was 10.3 ng/mL (range, 6.1-19.3). All patients developed side effects such as anemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and infection. In conclusion, sirolimus was useful as rescue therapy.
