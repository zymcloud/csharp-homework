To investigate the relationship of tumor associated glycoprotein-72 (TAG-72) expression with clinicopathological features in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Sixty pairs of HCC and paracarcinomatous (PCLT) tissues, and 10 normal liver (NL) tissues were collected for Western blot analysis, and 244 pairs of HCC and PCLT tissues were collected for immunohistochemistry analysis. TAG-72 protein expression was elevated significantly in HCC tissues compared with PCLT and NL tissues. Its increased expression was correlated with TNM stage, Edmondson-Steiner grade, vein invasion and multiple tumor nodes. It is noteworthy that the HCC patients with high TAG-72 expression had shorter overall survival and disease-free survival than the patients with low expression. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that TAG-72 expression was an independent prognostic factor for HCC patients. The current study demonstrated for the first time that the increased expression of TAG-72 was correlated with poor survival in patients with HCC, indicating that TAG-72 is a novel prognostic marker for HCC.
