Purpose:To evaluate the in vitro anti-proliferative and radical scavenging properties of the essential oil and its fractions and to determine the chemo-type of P. wallichiana essential oil.Method:Pinus wallichiana oil was extracted by hydro-distillation and fractionated by silica gel column chromatography method. The oil and its fractions were analyzed by Gas chromatography, Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and (13)C NMR. Different concentrations of oil 12.5, 25, 50 and 100μg/ml and single concentration 50μg/ml of its fractions B(1), B(2), A(2), G(2), Uk(13) and I(2) were evaluated for its anti-proliferative activity by in vitro {3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide} assay against human monocyte, lung carcinoma, liver adenocarcinoma, prostate and ovarian carcinoma, while as the radical scavenging activity was evaluated by different in vitro DPPH assays.Results:The analyses indicated the presence of 17 constituents with β-pinene (46.8%) and α-pinene (25.2%) as major constituents. The oil and its fractions showed significant anti-proliferative activity. The radical scavenging activity also showed good results.Conclusion:The oil could be used as a drug to control the diseases like cancer, cirrhosis and arteriosclerosis, caused by reactive oxygen species.
