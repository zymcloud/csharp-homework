Gastric hepatoid adenocarcinoma is a special type of gastric carcinoma, which produces AFP. We report a case of an metastatic gastric hepatoid adenocarcinoma mistaken for primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A 72 year-old woman was transferred to our hospital for treatment of the hepatic mass. She underwent subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer 2 years ago. A year ago, she was diagnosed with hepatic mass and treated with transhepatic chemoembolization under the suspicion of primary HCC in other hospital. The hepatic mass looked like primary HCC on CT, and serum AFP was elevated to 18,735 IU/mL. We did the transhepatic mass biopsy and compared it to the histology of the previous gastric cancer. The results of immunohistochemical staining between them was coincident, and so it was diagnosed as a hepatic metastasis of gastric hepatoid adenocarcinoma.
