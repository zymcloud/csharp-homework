Aims:To assess the expression of Twisted gastrulation (TWSG1) protein, which regulates the activity of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in the extracellular space in malignant epithelial tumours of the liver.Methods:Thirteen hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples and 12 intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCA) samples were compiled into diagnosis-specific tissue microarrays. Sections were immunostained with a monoclonal antibody against TWSG1 and a polyclonal antibody against BMP4. Human cell lines were also used, including one HCC cell line (HepG2), three CCA cell lines (OZ, Huh-28, HuCCT-1) and a Papova-immortalised normal hepatocyte cell line (THLE-3) for western blot analysis (WBA).Results:Immunostaining and WBA showed a stronger TWSG1 expression in CCA than in HCC. The difference in expression was significant (pConclusions:TWSG1 is expressed in both malignant epithelial carcinomas, although the level of expression is higher in CCA than in HCC and seems to correlate at least partially with BMP4 expression.
