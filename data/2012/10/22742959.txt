Three ellagitannins and one disulfated flavonol were isolated from the aerial parts of Reaumuria vermiculata L. Besides that, 16 known compounds were characterized as well. The structures of all compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic data including 1D and 2D NMR and ESI HR-FTMS. The in vivo antioxidant activity using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method, of the extract, its column fractions and two of the isolated ellagitannins was accomplished. In addition, a possible cytotoxicity of the extract and two of the new ellagitannins on HaCaT human keratinocytes and the activity of both compounds against the prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) were also assessed, whereby a potent cytotoxicity with IC₅₀ less than 1 μg/ml was determined for both compounds. Besides, the extract exhibited a potential cytotoxic effect against four different solid tumor cell lines, namely liver (Huh-7), colorectal (HCT-116), breast (MCF-7) and prostate (PC-3). The IC₅₀s were found to be substantially low (ranged from 1.3±0.15 to 2.4±0.22 μg/ml) with relatively low resistance possibility reaching to 0% in the case of Huh-7 cell.
