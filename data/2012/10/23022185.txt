Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide. The mechanisms by which hepatoma cells resist apoptosis induced by doxorubicin are largely unknown. MAPKAPK5 (MK5), also named as p38-regulated/activated protein kinase (PRAK), has been identified as a crucial mediator of skin tumorigenesis in mouse and colon cancerogenesis in human. Here, we describe a novel role of MK5 in doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in human hepatoma cells. Expression of MK5 was highly upregulated in hepatoma cell lines. Doxorubicin rather than other chemotherapeutic drugs reduced MK5 protein level in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in hepatoma cells (HepG2 and Hep3B). We further showed that MK5 degradation induced by doxorubicin was via the 26S proteasome. Remarkably, stable overexpression of MK5 led to decreased cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP and attenuated doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, while stable knockdown of endogenous MK5 sensitized hepatoma cells to doxorubicin, which was coupled with increased cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP. Taken together, our results firstly demonstrate that MK5 is degraded in response to doxorubicin and negatively regulates doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, providing novel insights into the molecular mechanism of doxorubicin resistance in hepatoma cells.
