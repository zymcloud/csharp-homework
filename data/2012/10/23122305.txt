Objective:To investigate the toxic effects of decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), used as an alternative to decabromodiphenyl ether in vitro.Methods:HepG2 cells were cultured in the presence of DBDPE at various concentrations (3.125-100.0 mg/L) for 24, 48, and 72 h respectively and the toxic effect of DBDPE was studied.Results:As evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide and lactate dehydrogenase assays and nuclear morphological changes, DBDPE inhibited HepG2 viability in a time- and dose-dependent manner within a range of 12.5 mg/L to 100 mg/L and for 48 h and 72 h. Induction of apoptosis was detected at 12.5-100 mg/L at 48 h and 72 h by propidium iodide staining, accompanied with overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a widely used ROS scavenger, significantly reduced DBDPE-induced ROS levels and increased HepG2 cells viability.Conclusion:DBDPE has cytotoxic and anti-proliferation effect and can induce apoptosis in which ROS plays an important role.
