The primary treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is external beam radiotherapy. However, until now, there is little experience with the management of NPC occurred after solid organ transplantation. In this report, a 60-year-old man was found to have NPC (T2N1M0; stage III) 3 years after orthotopic liver transplantation treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) was performed for NPC. One month after IMRT, complete response of NPC was achieved. However, multiple lung metastases occurred 18 months after the IMRT with the largest lesion measuring 4.1Ã—5.5 cm and confirmed to be originated from NPC. Combined chemo-/targeted therapy consisted of capecitabine, and nimotuzumab was administered for four cycles. One month after initiation of capecitabine plus nimotuzumab treatment, a near-complete response was achieved for lung metastases. A repeat CT scan 1 year later showed sustained resolution of the lung metastases. The patient is still alive 16 months after the combined chemo-/targeted therapy.
