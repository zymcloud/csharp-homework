3,5-Dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (DHMBA), an antioxidant isolated from the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), was studied in a cell-based fluorometric antioxidant assay using human hepatocyte-derived cells (C3A) and diphenyl-1-pyrenylphosphine (DPPP) as a fluorescent probe. In comparison with two hydrophilic antioxidants, DHMBA showed the stronger inhibition of DPPP-mediated fluorescence than chlorogenic acid and l-ascorbic acid: at a concentration of 320 μM of DPPP, the inhibition was 26.4±2.6%, 11.1±1.2%, and 0±2.0% for DHMBA, chlorogenic acid, and l-ascorbic acid, respectively (mean±SD, n=4). Their relative oxygen radical absorbance capacities (ORAC) were dissociated with their cell-based antioxidant activities: 1.47±0.40, 4.57±0.30, and 0.53±0.13 μmol TE/μmol for DHMBA, chlorogenic acid, and l-ascorbic acid, respectively (mean±SD, n=4). The amphiphilicity of DHMBA was better than chlorogenic acid and l-ascorbic acid might underlie this dissociation. Since the C3A cells are human hepatoma-derived cells, DHMBA might be useful in the prevention and treatment of liver diseases by involving an oxidation process.
