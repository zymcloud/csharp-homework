Objectives:To compare the outcomes after liver resection for a single small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (≤ 5 cm) between non-cirrhotic patients and cirrhotic patients, and to explore the influence of liver cirrhosis on recurrence and overall survival after liver resection in patients with a single small HCC.Methods:A consecutive series of 256 patients with a single small HCC undergoing liver resection from April 2001 to October 2009 was retrospectively reviewed. Among the 256 patients, 227 patients were male, and 29 were female. The medium age was 49 years (ranged, 14 - 79 years); 224 (87.5%) patients were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, 241 (94.1%) patients were with preoperative liver function of Child-Pugh grade A. The entire cohort were divided into non-cirrhosis group (n = 44) and cirrhosis group (n = 212). Univariate analysis and then multivariate analysis were performed to determine the prognostic factors of recurrence and overall survival after liver resection for all patients.Results:The 1-, 3-, 5-year recurrence-free survival rates after liver resection were 93.0%, 85.3%, and 68.5%, respectively, in non-cirrhosis group, while 81.1%, 58.6%, and 45.0%, respectively, in cirrhosis group. The 1-, 3-, 5-year overall survival rates after liver resection were 100%, 92.5%, and 92.5%, respectively, in non-cirrhosis group, while 93.8%, 78.7%, and 67.8%, respectively, in cirrhosis group. Both the recurrence-free survival and overall survival of non-cirrhosis group were significantly better than those of cirrhosis group (χ(2) = 8.756, P = 0.003; χ(2) = 8.603, P = 0.003). Cirrhosis, absence of tumor capsule, presence of microvascular invasion and moderate/poor tumor differentiation were the independent adverse prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival and overall survival in patients with a single small HCC after liver resection.Conclusions:Cirrhosis is an important adverse prognostic factor for long-term survival in patients with a single small HCC after liver resection. Liver resection resulted in much worse survival for cirrhotic patients compared to non-cirrhotic patients.
