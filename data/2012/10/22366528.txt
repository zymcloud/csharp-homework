Background/aims:The prognostic impact of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) on patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing curative resection remains unclear. We conducted a case-control study to investigate it.Methodology:A total of 196 HCC patients with negative preoperative AFP were admitted and treated by curative liver resection. During the same period, 196 patients with positive preoperative AFP were enrolled to match the TN M stages, Child-Pugh score and HBs-Ag status of the AFP-negative patients. Time to recurrence (TTR) and overall survival (OS) were prospectively studied.Results:Through a median follow-up duration of 5.25 years, we found that the median TTR of patients with negative preoperative AFP was significantly longer than those with positive AFP (17.3 vs. 12.8 months, p=0.001). The median TTRs of AFP-negative and positive patients were 22.1 and 21.0 months (p=0.266), 145 and 7.4 months (p=0.005) and 3.7 and 2.9 months (p=0.197) in TNM stages I, II and IIIa, respectively. The median TTRs of TNM stage II patients with :â‰¤20, 20-400, 400-1000 and >1000 ng/mL preoperative AFP concentration were 14.5, 13.7, 10.7 and 9.6 months (p=0.092), respectively.Conclusions:Preoperative AFP level is an independent prognostic factor affecting postoperative recurrence in HCC patients and correlated with the TTR of TNM II.
