Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the world's most common malignant cancers. Its incidence is particularly high in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa but, in recent years, significant increases in HCC have been observed in Australia and other Western countries. Therapeutic advances have contributed to improved survival rates in patients with HCC although intracranial metastases are extremely rare. Here we report the first two published Australian cases of brain metastases from HCC, both in Caucasian patients.
