Primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the liver is rare and reported sporadically. Up to date, only 24 such cases have been reported in the literature. It is associated with hepatic teratoma, congenital cysts, solitary benign non-parasitic hepatic cysts, hepatolithiasis/Caroli's disease or cirrhosis. We reported a case of primary SCC of the liver associated with multiple intrahepatic cholesterol gallstones. The patient underwent hepatectomy followed by radiotherapy, and has survived for over 19 mo without recurrence.
