A 57-year-old female with fatigue presented to our hospital. High-quality contrasted abdominal computerized tomography images demonstrated extensive filling defect within the left renal vein and the inferior vena cava and an enhancing hepatic mass with no obvious mass lesion in the left kidney. The patient underwent a total resection of the left kidney and venous thrombectomy by open surgery; intraoperative hepatic mass biopsy with frozen section confirmed a metastatic disease and right hepalobectomy was conducted in one surgical session. Histopathologic examination revealed a lesion of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma within the left kidney.
