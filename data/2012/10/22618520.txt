Objectives:To investigate whether the addition of nitroglycerine to transcatheter arterial (chemo)embolization (TAE/TACE) can increase the delivery and effectiveness of TAE/TACE in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by dual-energy CT.Methods:HCC patients (BCLC stage A or B) were randomized to (n = 51) or not to (n = 50) receive nitroglycerine and an emulsion of Lipiodol with or without doxorubicin, followed by embolization with Gelfoam pledgets. Dual-energy CT was performed pre- and 1 to 3 months post-embolization to assess changes in tumour diameter and Lipiodol levels in tumours.Results:Median tumour diameter decreased from baseline in both groups with and without nitroglycerine (7.11 % vs. 12.5 %, respectively), and was statistically significant in the group receiving nitroglycerine (P = 0.023). There was no difference between the two groups in disease response (P = 0.237). The concentration and percentage of Lipiodol retained in tumours were significantly greater in patients treated with nitroglycerine compared to those without (median concentration 15.05 mg/mL vs. 4.40 mg/mL, respectively, P Conclusions:Nitroglycerine increased delivery of the Lipiodol emulsion via TAE/TACE to HCC tumours with significant tumour reduction. Dual-energy CT can accurately quantify the amount of Lipiodol deposited in tumours.Key points:• Nitroglycerine improves delivery of tumour-targeted therapy via enhanced permeability and retention. • In hepatocellular carcinoma, nitroglycerine added to TAE/TACE showed greater tumour reduction. • Dual-energy CT can reliably quantify the amount of Lipiodol in TAE/TACE.
