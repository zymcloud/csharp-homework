Objective:To investigate the expression of CK19 in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues in patients with low serum AFP concentration and the relationship between them and the recurrence and prognosis of HCC after R0 radical hepatectomy.Methods:The expressions of CK19 and Ki67 in HCC tissues of 235 cases were examined using tissue microarray and two-step methods of PV-6000 immunohistochemistry. The expression of CK19 mRNA in 20 frozen HCC specimens was examined by RT-PCR. The correlation between gene expressions and tumor recurrence and prognosis was analyzed.Results:Among the 235 HBV-related HCC patients after R0 radical hepatectomy, the median disease-free survival (DFS) was 31.2 months in the patients with serum AFP 0.05). The OS was significantly lower in the CK19-positive cases than that in the CK19-negative cases (P = 0.023). Both DFS and OS in the CK19-positive cases with AFP Conclusion:In HBV-related HCC patients after radical hepatectomy with AFP
