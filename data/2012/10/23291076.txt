The treatment group received sorafenib + MCT + TACE, and the control group received MCT + TACE.Results:RR of the treatment group was 66.7%, which of the control group was 52.0% (P > 0.05). DCR was 83.3% in the treatment group and 64.5% in the control group (P Conclusion:Sorafenib combined with MCT and TACE can improve the disease control rate and prolong the survival in patients with recurrent HCC.
