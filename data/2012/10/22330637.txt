We evaluated expression of TLR2, TLR4 and proinflammatory genes [NF-κB, TNF-α, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)] in liver samples of patients in different stages of liver disease. Fifteen patients with unexplained transaminases elevation (reference group), 22 with viral chronic hepatitis (hepatitis group), 14 with virus-induced severe fibrosis/cirrhosis (cirrhosis group) and 10 with hepatocarcinoma (hepatocarcinoma group) were consecutively included in the study. Quantification of TLR2, TLR4, NF-κB, TNF-α and COX-2 mRNA was done by real-time RT-PCR and TLR2 and TLR4 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Compared with reference, TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA was increased in hepatitis (TLR2: 2.66 ± 0.69; TLR4: 3.11 ± 0.79; P
