Background and aim:We investigated long-term outcomes and prognostic factors in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver cirrhosis in the era of oral nucleos(t)ide analog antiviral agents.Methods:Between January 1999 and February 2009, a total of 240 consecutive patients who had HBV-related cirrhosis without malignancy were treated with lamivudine and second line nucleos(t)ide analogs. The group of historical controls consisted of 481 consecutive patients with HBV-related cirrhosis who were managed without any antiviral treatment prior to 1999.Results:In 78% of the patients who received antiviral treatment, sustained viral suppression (serum HBV DNA 10(5) copies/mL at last follow-up) was an important independent risk factor of death (P Conclusions:Oral antiviral agents have improved the prognosis of patients with HBV-related cirrhosis and affected the prognostic values of factors constituting the Child-Pugh system, necessitating a more efficient prognostic system.
