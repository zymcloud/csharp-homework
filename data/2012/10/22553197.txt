Background:Previous evidence indicated that incidence rates of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) are high in Egypt although little is known about risk factors.Materials and methods:Using data from the population-based cancer registry of Gharbiah governorate in Egypt, we assessed the 1999-2005 incidence of hematopoietic cancers (HCs) based on the ICD-O3 by age- and sex-specific urban-rural distribution.Results:NHL showed the highest incidence among all HCs (11.7 per 100 000). Urban incidence of HCs was higher than rural incidence. Incidence rates of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and NHL were high especially among urban males up to the 64-year age category. Rural incidence of HL and NHL was high below age 20. Among the districts of the governorate, we observed NHL incidence pattern similar to that observed for hepatocellular carcinoma because of the possible link to hepatitis C virus for both cancers. Comparison to the published HCs data from Algeria, Cyprus, and Jordan showed the highest NHL rate in Egypt than the other countries in the region.Conclusions:Future studies should define the role of environmental exposures in hematopoietic carcinogenesis in this population. In-depth studies should also investigate the role of access to health care in the urban-rural variation of HC distribution in this population.
