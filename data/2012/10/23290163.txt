Objective:To explore the feasibility, short-term efficacies and complications of computed tomography (CT)-guided ¹²⁵I interstitial implant therapy for recurrent ovarian cancer.Methods:From October 2009 to November 2010, a total of 25 lesions for 12 patients were diagnosed as recurrent ovarian cancer by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Among 25 lesions, 21 underwent ¹²⁵I seed implantation. And 4 lesions of liver and spleen in one patient were treated with microwave ablation. Nine patients underwent 2 - 6 cycles of chemotherapy after seeding. There were 11 lesions with diameter > 2 cm and 10 ≤ 2 cm. According to the area of physiologic 18FDG uptake in lesions, the treatment plans were formulated by computerized treatment planning system (TPS) and Memorial Sloan-Ketterin nomograph. The matched peripheral dose (MPD) was 145 Gy in target mass. A median of 20.5 seeds per patient (range: 9 - 45) were implanted. The efficacies were evaluated by CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT findings.Results:One patient died of renal failure while the other patients survived during a median follow-up of 15 mouths (range: 9 - 19). Ten lesions showed complete remission, 6 partial remission and 5 progressive disease. The effective rate was 76.2% (16/21). Compared with those > 2 cm, the lesions ≤ 2 cm in diameter had a better local control rate by Fisher's exact test (P = 0.035). The hepatic and renal lesions treated by microwave ablation showed inactivation on PET/CT. Only one patient suffered from sciatic nerve injury caused by punctuation and numbness and pain of right lower extremity were persistent. There was no onset of the complications of radiation injury, such as intestinal fistula and proctitis.Conclusion:The CT-guided ¹²⁵I interstitial implant therapy for recurrent ovarian cancer yields excellent short-term efficacies with fewer complications. The combined modality of ¹²⁵I interstitial implant and chemotherapy may further improve the patient outcomes.
