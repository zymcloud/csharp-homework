Effect of Metformin in chemically induced hepatocarcinogenesis was assessed in Wistar rats. Intraperitoneal administration of chemical carcinogen diethyl nitrosamine (DENA) (200 mg/kg) in single dose elevated the levels of serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and reduced high density lipoproteins (HDL), total proteins (TPR) and blood glucose level in tested animals. Histopathological examinations of the liver tissue showed marked carcinogenicity of the chemical carcinogen. Food and water intake, animal weights and serum albumin (ALB) were also assessed. The animals exposed to DENA showed a significant decrease in the body weights and, there were no significant alterations found in the total bilirubin (TBR) levels and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGTP), whereas the decreased levels of serum ALB were maintained by Metformin treatment. The elevated levels of serum SGOT, SGPT, ALP, AFP, TC and TG were restored by administration of Metformin in reduced dose (125 mg/kg) daily for 16 weeks p.o. Physiological and biochemical analysis showed the beneficial effects of Metformin in the animals exposed to DENA.
