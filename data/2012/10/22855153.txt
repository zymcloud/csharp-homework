Background:Increasing evidence shows that bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) have antitumor activities both in vitro and in animal models. Further studies fleshed out the supportive data that the antitumor activity of BMSCs could be markedly enhanced by cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-β (interferon). However, powerful strategies to activate BMSCs other than by genetically engineering interventions are still required.Methods:In this study, new methods of generating antitumor activities of murine marrow-originated MSCs pulsed with homologous tumor-derived exosomes (TEX) were explored to yield potent immune effectors against hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro.Results:The results showed that BMSCs pulsed with exosomes and IFN-γ exhibited increased migration ability with a result of 163.22 ± 26.90 versus 129.89 ± 29.28 cells/HP by transwell determination (p Conclusions:This study demonstrated that BMSCs pulsed with TEX could enhance its antitumor activities, which might be regarded as a novel promising antitumor treatment.
