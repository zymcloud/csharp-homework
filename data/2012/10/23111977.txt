ARFI (Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse) is a novel method based on the use of shear acoustic waves remotely induced by the radiation force of a focused ultrasonic beam. Recently, ARFI has been investigated as a non-invasive method for the assessment of liver fibrosis. The reproducibility of ARFI technology was proved in determining liver fibrosis: in detail, for cirrhosis Fibroscan had its best cut-off at >/= 11 kPa (AUROC of 0.80) whereas ARFI >/= 2.0 m/s (AUROC of 0.89). By pair-wise comparison of AUROC, ARFI was significantly more accurate than TE for a diagnosis of significant and severe fibrosis. Due to the low amount of collagen deposition within hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) nodules in a context of "hard" cirrhotic parenchyma, ARFI propose itself also as a novel, specific method for an early identification of primitive neoplastic nodules during the follow up of cirrhotic patients. The diagnostic accuracy can be demonstrated either versus the surrounding liver tissue or versus dysplastic or metastatic nodules. Further studies are required to confirm ARFI as a useful tool for HCC follow-up.
