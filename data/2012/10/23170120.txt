Embelin is a small-molecule inhibitor extracted from plants of the Myrsinaceae family demonstrating specific inhibition of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) to affect the proliferation and apoptosis of various types of tumor cells. However, the mechanism of action for this effect remains unclear. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of the mitochondrial pathway in embelin-induced HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cell apoptosis and the effect of embelin on the cell cycle. HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells were treated with different doses of embelin. The MTT method was used to determine cell viability, and flow cytometry was used to assess the rate of apoptosis and the changes in mitochondrial membrane potential; the cell cycle was also analyzed. Western blot analysis was performed to determine the expression levels of the apoptosis-associated proteins Bax, Bcl-2 and the caspase family. The results revealed that embelin induced the apoptosis of the HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, embelin caused changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that embelin caused blockade of the HepG2 cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle.
