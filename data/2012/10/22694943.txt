Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Developed on a pathological liver in 90% of cases, theoretically liver transplantation (LT) is its best treatment because it cures both malignancy and cause of malignancy, the underlying pathological liver. Cadaveric donors are the main source of liver in Western countries as France and living donors are the rules in Eastern countries as Japan. Because organ shortage could impact choices in HCC treatments, it was interesting to compare a Western and Eastern surgeon's points of view about treatment of HCC to assess if the source of organs has modified therapeutic strategies. Hence, aim of this work was to compare points of view of two hepatobiliary and transplant surgeons specialized in the treatment of HCC in France and Japan concerning five keys points that are decisive to choose one of the two curative treatments in HCC on pathological liver: liver resection or LT. These questions included the definition of an oncological treatment of HCC, the assessment of liver function, the treatment of HCC recurrences, the incidence of pathological information on therapeutic strategy and potential future therapeutics strategies.
