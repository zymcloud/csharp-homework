Background:Host genetic factors may affect clinical outcomes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection; however, the possible mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study aimed to evaluate transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-509 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-308 genes polymorphisms as a risk factors for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis C patients.Materials and methods:Two hundred and eighty HCV patients (152 patients with cirrhosis, 128 patients with HCC) and 160 controls were enrolled in the study. Polymorphisms of TGF-β1-509 and TNF-α-308 gene were determined using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Serum TGF-β1 and TNF-α were determined using ELISA.Results:TGF-β1-509 TT, TNF-α-308 AA and GA genotypes frequencies were significantly increased in cirrhotic and HCC groups. Serum TGF-β1 and TNF-α level were significantly increased in TGF-β1-509 TT and TNF-α-308 AA genotypes respectively.Conclusion:TGF-β1-509 and TNF-α-308 genes polymorphisms are associated with risk of liver cirrhosis and HCC in patients with chronic HCV infection.
