The scarcity of liver grafts in Asia leads to a significant dropout of patients from liver transplant waiting lists, particularly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and a low model for end-stage liver disease score. In order to reduce dropping out, different bridging therapies are employed. We report the use of high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation as a bridging therapy for a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma of stage two and an extremely low platelet count (20X109/L). The ablation was successful. Blood tests showed that his liver function was similar before and after the treatment. No adhesion was encountered in the liver transplantation performed six months later.
