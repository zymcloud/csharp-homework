Background and aims:MicroRNAs have been recently identified as important regulators that influence human carcinogenesis, cancer progression, and the interaction between the host and virus. This study investigates an association between microRNAs (miR-101-1, miR-101-2, and miR-338) and the risk of liver diseases through clearance of hepatitis B virus infection, development of liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence.Methods:Genetic variations were genotyped using the TaqMan assay in 1439 Korean hepatitis B virus patients. To investigate the relationship between four polymorphisms in three microRNAs and the disease phenotypes, differences in frequency distribution of variations were analysed using logistic and multiple regression analyses after adjusting for age and gender as covariates.Results:We find that the rs7536540 polymorphism in miR-101-1 is significantly associated with development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence. In addition, rs12375841 and its unique haplotype (ht2) in miR-101-2 show significant association with clearance of hepatitis B virus infection.Conclusions:To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine a relationship between the three microRNA genes and the risk of hepatitis B-related liver diseases. We expect that the findings in this study will be helpful to further genetic studies in the pathophysiology of hepatitis B virus-related liver diseases.
