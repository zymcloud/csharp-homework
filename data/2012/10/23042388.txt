Objective:To determine the expression level of Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (SMURF1) gene in hepatocellular carcinoma, and to explore its role in liver cancer.Methods:With non-neoplastic adjacent normal tissues as controls, real-time PCR and Western blotting were used for measuring the expression of SMURF1 mRNA and protein in 89 samples of hepatocellular carcinoma. Correlations between SMURF1 expression and clinical features were explored. Following transfection of SMURF1--specific small interference RNA(siRNA), the apoptosis and proliferation of hepatic cancer cells Hep G2 were detected using flow cytometry and MTT assays .Results:The expression of SMURF1 mRNA and protein were significantly higher in hepatocellular cancer tissues compared with the paired normal tissues (P 0.05). Transfection of SMURF1-specific siRNA can promote the apoptosis whilst inhibit the proliferation of Hep G2 cells.Conclusion:The expression of SMURF1 is enhanced in hepatocellular carcinoma, which may have played a role in the disease through affecting apoptosis and proliferation of hepatic cancer cells.
