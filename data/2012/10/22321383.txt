N-Trimethyl chitosan (TMC) was synthesized and used to prepare lactosyl-norcantharidin TMC nanoparticles (Lac-NCTD-TMC-NPs) using an ionic cross-linkage process. Lac-NCTD-TMC-NPs with an average particle size of 120.6 ± 1.7 nm were obtained, with an entrapment efficiency of 69.29% ± 0.76%, and a drug-loading amount of 9.1% ± 0.07%. The release of Lac-NCTD-TMC-NPs in vitro was investigated through a dialysis method, and its sustained effect was evident. In the human liver cancer cell line HepG2, the half-maximum inhibiting concentration (IC(50)) of TMC-encapsulated Lac-NCTD (Lac-NCTD-TMC-NPs) was only 24.2% that of free Lac-NCTD at 24 hours. Lac-NCTD induced HepG2 cell death by triggering apoptosis. In vitro cellular uptake and in vivo NIR fluorescence real-time imaging both indicated a high targeting efficacy. In comparison with Lac-NCTD and Lac-NCTD chitosan NPs (Lac-NCTD-CS-NPs ), Lac-NCTD-TMC-NPs had the strongest antitumor activity on the murine hepatocarcinoma 22 subcutaneous model.From the clinical editor:In this article the preparation of N-trimethyl chitosan-encapsulated lactosyl-norcantharidin nanoparticles is described that displayed efficient targeting and sustained release in a hepatocarcinoma SC murine model.
