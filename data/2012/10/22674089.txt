Background:Steroid use after liver transplantation is known to increase the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus (NODM). In this study, we tried to identify a patient subgroup who would benefit with regard to NODM by an early steroid withdrawal regimen (ESWR) after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) METHODS: Among 100 adult LDLT patients, 65 were on a conventional immunosuppressive regimen (CIR), and 35 were on an ESWR. With the ESWR, the steroid was tapered off mostly within 7 days with induction of basiliximab in combination with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). The CIR was a combination of tacrolimus and steroid. MMF was added in selected patients. Steroid was tapered off 2-6 months after LT. The presence of NODM was investigated cross-sectionally 6 months after LT.Results:There was no significant difference in terms of acute cellular rejection, sepsis, or death during follow-up. NODM had developed in 13 patients (13 %). Old recipient age (≥ 55) and pretransplant history of hypertension were significant risk factors for NODM. The type of immunosuppression was the single risk factor for NODM in subgroup of old-age recipients (≥ 55 years) on the CIR (hazard ratio 13.34, p = 0.04).Conclusions:ESWR can safely reduce the incidence of NODM after LDLT in old-age recipients. Therefore, ESWR should be considered first in old-age recipients undergoing LDLT.
