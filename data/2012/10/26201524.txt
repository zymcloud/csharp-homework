Background:In Asian countries, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is widely applied in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with extra-hepatic metastasis in the absence of main portal vein thrombosis. However, its survival benefit is unclear. The study aimed to analyze the role of TACE in patients with metastatic HCC.Methods:From 2002 to 2009, 2,165 consecutive HCC patients were retrospectively reviewed. Of the 893 Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C patients, 105 who had extra-hepatic metastasis on initial presentation without main portal vein thrombosis were enrolled, including 46 who received TACE (TACE group) and 59 who received supportive treatment (control group). Factors associated with survival were evaluated by multivariate analysis. Survival between the two groups was compared by propensity score matching analysis.Results:Median survival in the TACE and control groups was 6.6 and 3.2 months, respectively (p 10 cm (HR = 1.606, p = 0.045), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) >2,000 ng ml(-1) (HR = 1.599, p = 0.037) were factors associated with survival. After propensity score matching analysis, a better survival was noted in the TACE group (median survival 4.0 vs. 3.0 months, p = 0.029). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with tumor size ≤10 cm and AFP levels ≤2,000 ng ml(-1) had the best survival from TACE. Smaller tumor size is the only independent predictor for survival longer than 6 months in patients receiving TACE.Conclusions:TACE provides survival benefit for metastatic HCC patients. Prospective randomized controlled trials are warranted to delineate the role of combining TACE with sorafenib or other treatment for metastatic HCC.
