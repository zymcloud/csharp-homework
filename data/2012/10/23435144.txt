Background/aims:The effects of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) prior to hepatectomy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are controversial.Methodology:Clinicopathological profiles and prognosis were compared between patients who underwent hepatic resection following preoperative TACE (Group A, 69 patients) or only resection (Group B, 158 patients). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate whether TACE influenced patient prognosis.Results:Profiles of Group A were comparable with those of Group B except for younger age, higher frequency of major hepatectomy, higher incidence of positive surgical margin, vascular invasion and poorly differentiated HCC. Overall survival was significantly worse in Group A than in Group B (5-year survival rate; 29% vs. 69%; p1L (HR=1.8; 95% CI=1.1-2.8) and vascular invasion (HR=2.3; 95% CI=1.4-3.6) were independent predictors of poor survival. Preoperative TACE was also an independent predictor of extrahepatic metastases (odds ratio, 2.8; 95% CI=1.1-7.1).Conclusions:Preoperative TACE should not be routinely applied for HCC.
