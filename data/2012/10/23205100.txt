The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between H-ras mutation and primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to describe the role of H-ras mutation in carcinogenesis. Clinical samples of 69 patients were collected and the expression levels of H-ras in HCC and the surrounding normal tissues were examined using HotStarTaq PCR. H-ras mutation was further analyzed using the PCR direct sequencing method. The results showed that H-ras mutation was present in 49 samples (49/69, 71.01%), of which 19 had codon 40 mutated from CTA to CTG and 30 had codon 61 mutated from GGC to AGC. By contrast, only 2 mutations were found in the normal tumor-adjacent tissues. The H-ras mutation rate in the high-risk of metastatic recurrence group was markedly higher than that in the low-risk group (P
