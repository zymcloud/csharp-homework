Aim:Corona enhancement is the visualized drainage area from a hypervascular tumor observed on single-level dynamic computed tomography during hepatic arteriography (CTHA) and is thought to be a high-risk area for micrometastases. However, because it cannot be visualized with ordinary ultrasonography (US), we aimed to visualize corona enhancement on US by means of arterial injection of the contrast material and to measure its thickness.Method:Forty-one hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases were prospectively investigated. US during hepatic arteriography (USHA) was executed by means of selective injection of the contrast material perfluorobutane (Sonazoid) from the hepatic artery. Ordinary contrast-enhanced US with venous administration of contrast material and single-level dynamic CTHA were also performed.Results:Corona enhancement was observed in 36 cases (88%) on USHA and in 25 cases (61%) on single-level dynamic CTHA. The thickness of corona enhancement of 36 cases visualized with USHA ranged 3.1-18.4 mm and the mean thickness ± standard deviation was 6.0 ± 3.0 mm. Thickness of corona enhancement was less than 10.0 mm in 34 cases (94%).Conclusion:Corona enhancement could be visualized even on US images, and the average thickness of them was 6 mm.
