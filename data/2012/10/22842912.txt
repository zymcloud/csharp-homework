Structural maintenance of chromosome 4 (SMC4) is associated with tumorigenesis. The present study aimed at detecting SMC4 expression in primary liver cancer and its association with clinicopathological patient data. A total of 72 primary liver cancer tissues and 6 liver cell lines were assessed for expression of SMC4 mRNA and protein with qRT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. SMC4 siRNAs were constructed to knockdown SMC4 expression, and phenotypic changes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells were analyzed using flow cytometry and cell viability assays. The data showed that SMC4 mRNA and protein were highly expressed in HCC tissues compared to the normal tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 52 of 72 (72.2%) paraffin-embedded primary liver cancer tissues displayed strong cytoplasmic staining of SMC4 protein, whereas only 6 (8.3%) normal liver tissues showed immunostaining of SMC4. Statistical analysis showed that SMC4 expression was significantly associated with tumor size, de-differentiation, advanced stages and vascular invasion of the primary liver cancers. Moreover, knockdown of SMC4 expression reduced HCC cell proliferation. These data demonstrated that expression of SMC4 protein may be useful for the early detection and prediction of primary liver cancer progression.
