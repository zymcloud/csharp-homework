Background/aims:The aims of this study were to examine the expressions of endothelium specific VE-cadherin, intestine specific LI-cadherin, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and to determine their relationships with the clinicopathological parameters of gastric cancer.Methods:A total 47 patients with gastric cancer who underwent surgery were enrolled. Endoscopic biopsies were obtained from the cancer and normal mucosa, respectively. Using semiquantitative RT-PCR, the mRNA expression levels of VE-cadherin, LI-cadherin and VEGF were measured by tumor/normal (T/N) ratios. The protein expressions of VE-cadherin, LI-cadherin and VEGF were examined by Western blot and immunohistochemical stain in surgically resected tissues. The clinicopathological variables were reviewed and analyzed, retrospectively.Results:Twenty two cases (46.8%) of VE-cadherin, 25 cases (53.2%) of LI-cadherin and 27 cases (51.1%) of VEGF mRNA expressions were overexpressed in gastric cancer compared to normal tissue. There was a tendency for T/N ratio of VE-cadherin mRNA to correlate with the lymphatic invasion (p=0.07) and the lymph node metastasis (p=0.099) in advanced gastric cancer. The T/N ratio of LI-cadherin mRNA showed significant association with distant metastasis (p=0.031) and lymphatic invasion especially in advanced gastric cancer (p=0.023). There was a tendency for the T/N ratio of VEGF mRNA to correlate with the distant metastasis (p=0.073) in advanced gastric cancer.Conclusions:As increased mRNA expression of LI-cadherin was associated with distant metastasis and lymphatic invasion especially in the biopsy specimen of advanced gastric cancer before surgery, it may provide useful preoperative information on tumor aggressiveness.
