The effects of over-expression of ANXA10 gene on proliferation and apoptosis of hepato-cellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 were elucidated. The human ANXA10 gene was subcloned into the lentiviral vector, PGC-FU, to generate the lentiviral expression vector, PGC-FU-ANXA10. The corrected ANXA10 was confirmed by endoenzyme digestion, and sequencing. Recombinant lentiviruses were produced by 293T cells following the co-transfection of PGC-FU-ANXA10 with the packaging plasmids pHelper1.0 and pHelper2.0. The resulting recombinant lentiviruses carrying ANXA10 were then used to infect human embryonic kidney epithelial cells, and lentiviral particles were produced. The ANXA10 expression in 293T cells was detected by using fluorescent microscope and Western blotting. HepG2 cells were infected, and divided into PGC-Fu-ANXA10 group, PGC-Fu group and HepG2 cell group. The changes of ANXA10 mRNA and protein expression were detected by using RT-PCR and Western blotting respectively. Flow cytometry and MTT assay were performed to examine the changes in cell apoptosis and proliferation respectively. The recombinant PGC-FU-ANXA10 vector was successfully constructed, the ANXA10 protein was detected by using Western blotting, and virus titer was 2Ã—10(8) TU/mL. The recombinant lentiviruses were effectively infected into HepG2 cells in vitro and the infection efficiency was 70%. At 72 h after infection, the ANXA10 mRNA and protein expression levels in PGC-Fu-ANXA10 group were significantly higher than in PGC-Fu group and HepG2 cell group (P
