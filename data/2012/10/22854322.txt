In order to investigate the anti-angiogenesis potential and related mechanisms of Ta1722 (a novel taspine derivative compound), a series of experiments in vivo and in vitro were carried out. The proliferation on human cell lines of SMMC-7721, A549, MCF-7, Lovo, and ECV304 was examined by MTT. Angiogenesis inhibition was examined by chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) angiogenesis and tube formation assays. Related angiogenesis proteins and their mRNA expression were determined by western blotting and RT-PCR. In addition, the SMMC-7721 nude mouse xenotransplant model was used to evaluate the inhibition of tumor growth. The results showed that Ta1722 inhibited cell proliferation, angiogenesis of CAM and tube formation, and downregulated related positive angiogenesis proteins. The above indicated Ta1722 could serve as a promising candidate of angiogenesis inhibitors by interrupting the VEGF/VEGFR-2 pathway.
