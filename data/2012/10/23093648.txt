Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has a high metastatic potential due to its hematogen and vascular features. It metastasizes frequently to the lungs, the bones, the liver, the lymph nodes and the brain. Metastasis of RCC to the head and neck region is quite rare. In this case report, two RCC patients with head and neck metastases are presented: one occurring after 5 years and the other occurring 17 years after diagnosis.
