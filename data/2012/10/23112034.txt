Spontaneous regression of hepatocellular carcinoma is extremely rare, and the exact pathogenesis leading to this remarkable phenomenon remains unclear. We describe a case of spontaneous regression of an incidentally discovered hepatocellular carcinoma in a 63-year-old man with hepatitis C cirrhosis. The regression followed a series of events, in particular, an upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Ischaemic insult may be a major pathway leading to tumour regression. As limited data is available in the literature, knowledge and recognition of this rare event will have implications for patient management and may alter treatment. Further, data may be useful to assess if these patients have an altered prognosis with improved survival.
