This study investigated the clinicopathological characteristics and the surgical outcome in patients with non-small cell carcinoma (NSCLC) with parietal pleura invasion or chest wall invasion (p3/T3). This study clinicopathologically evaluated 760 patients who had undergone a resection for NSCLC between 1999 and 2008. There were 43 (5.7 %) patients with p3/T3 NSCLC. The patients included 37 males and 6 females. The histological types included 23 squamous cell carcinomas, 13 adenocarcinomas, 3 large cell carcinomas, 3 pleomorphic carcinomas, and 1 spindle cell carcinoma. Pneumonectomy was performed in 2 patients, bilobectomy in 1, lobectomy in 31, segmentectomy in 3, and partial resection of the lung in 6. The combined resection regions were parietal pleural in 23, ribs in 16, pericardium in 2, and diaphragm in 2 patients. Major complications included empyema in 1, chylothorax in 1, and postoperative bleeding in 1 patient. The first recurrence sites in 16 patients with recurrent disease were the lung in 5 patients, brain in 3, bone in 2, adrenal gland in 2, skin in 2, liver in 1, mesenterium in 1, mediastinal lymph node in 1, axillary lymph node in 1, and carcinomatous pleuritis in 1. The overall 5-year survival rate after surgery was 50.6 %. An en bloc resection for p3/T3 NSCLC provides a modestly favorable prognosis. Local recurrence was observed in a minority of case, and recurrence by distant metastasis was observed in most cases, suggesting a greater need for postoperative chemotherapy.
