Objective:To analyze the incidence and survival rates of primary liver cancer (PLC) among residents in Pudong district of Shanghai.Methods:Permanent residents of Pudong district, Shanghai were recruited in the study between 2002 and 2011, among whom 7981 PLC cases were diagnosed and 7233 death cases were certified. Both morbidity and mortality of PLC were calculated and standardized (ASR) by the world population of 1966, in order to analyze the survival condition of PLC patients on gender or address, to explore the prognosis of surgical excision treatment.Results:Among the incident cases of PLC between 2002 and 2011, 5754 cases were males, with an average age of 60.27; while 2227 cases were females, with an average age of 68.26. The crude incidence rate for both sexes was 30.73 per 100 000 person-year, and was 44.30 per 100 000 person-year for males, higher than that in females, 17.16 per 100 000 person-year. The difference showed statistical significance (u = 3.46, P < 0.01). The ASR for incidence rates were 25.72 per 100 000 person-year in males and 8.22 per 100 000 person-year in females, respectively, with difference statistically significant (u = 3.00, P < 0.01). There were 7233 PLC death cases in total, including 5151 males and 2082 females, with the crude mortality rate as 27.85 per 100 000 person-year. Rate for males was 39.65 per 100 000 person-year, significantly different from 16.04 per 100 000 person-year in females, statistically (u = 3.16, P < 0.01). The ASRs for mortality were 22.77 per 100 000 person-year in males and 7.39 per 100 000 person-year in females, with statistically significant difference (u = 2.80, P < 0.01). Both incidence and mortality rates increased apparently for males aged over 35 and females aged over 45. The 1- to 5-year survival rates of PLC were 19.88%, 14.91%, 12.19%, 10.29% and 8.56%, respectively. There were statistically significant differences among urban, town and rural areas in the over-all survival rates (Ï‡(2) = 8.711, P = 0.013); The differences in 1- to 5-year survival rates between surgical and non-surgical groups showed statistically significant differences (u = 10.8, 6.93, 4.75, 3.3 and 2.61, respectively, P < 0.01).Conclusion:The incidence and mortality rates in males were significantly higher than in females and the over-all survival in rural area was significantly lower than in other areas of Pudong district, suggesting that surgical treatment could improve the prognosis of PLC.
