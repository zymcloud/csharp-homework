Purpose:The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and feasibility of same-day discharge of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after doxorubicin drug-eluting bead (DEB) transarterial chemoembolization and to elucidate the factors predisposing to overnight admission.Materials and methods:Consecutive patients with unresectable HCC who underwent superselective 100-300 μm DEB transarterial chemoembolization were included. The parameters of same-day therapy (group A) were compared with those of patients admitted overnight (group B). A χ2 test and a t test were used to compare categorical and continuous variables accordingly.Results:Seventy-six patients (mean, 61 y) received 110 DEB transarterial chemoembolization treatments over an 8-month study period. In 84.5% (93/110) of DEB transarterial chemoembolization procedures, the patients were discharged on the same day (group A). The causes of hospitalization included the worsening of comorbidities in 41.1% (7/17), pain control in 29.4% (5/17), and groin and closure device-related complications in 29.4% (5/17) of patients. The mean Charlson comorbidity scores in groups A and B were 6.96 (standard deviation [SD] ± 1.98) and 8.47 (SD ± 2.18) (P = .0005), respectively. All of the patients in group B had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages C and D HCC (P = .024). There were no Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade III or worse adverse events (AEs). There was no mortality or emergency visits within 30 days of discharge.Conclusions:Same-day discharge after superselective DEB transarterial chemoembolization for unresectable HCC is safe and feasible. BCLC C or D stage of disease, a higher Charlson comorbidity score, and groin or closure device complications are correlated with a greater likelihood for overnight admission.
