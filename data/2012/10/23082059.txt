Aim:To identify the prevalence of pre-S2 start codon mutations and to assess their association with liver disease progression.Methods:The mutations were identified by direct sequencing from 73 asymptomatic carriers, 66 chronic hepatitis (CH), 66 liver cirrhosis (LC) and 63 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Statistical significances were determined using Fisher's exact test, χ² test, and t-test analyses whenever appropriate. Pre-S mutation as a risk factor for advanced liver disease was estimated by unconditional logistic regression model adjusted with age, sex, and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). P Results:Mutation of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) pre-S2 start codon was found in 59 samples from 268 subjects (22.0%), with higher prevalence in patients with cirrhosis 27/66 (40.9%) followed by HCC 18/63 (28.6%), chronic hepatitis 12/66 (18.2%) and asymptomatic carriers 2/73 (2.7%) (P Conclusion:Pre-S2 start codon mutation was higher in Indonesian patients compared to other Asian countries, and its prevalence was associated with advanced liver disease, particularly in HBeAg⁺ patients.
