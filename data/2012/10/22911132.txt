The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease globally. A chronic infection can result in liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure in a significant ratio of the patients. About 170 million people are currently infected with HCV. Since 80 % of the infected patients develop a chronic infection, HCV has evolved sophisticated escape strategies to evade both the innate and the adaptive immune system. Thus, chronic hepatitis C is characterized by perturbations in the number, subset composition and/or functionality of natural killer cells, natural killer T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages and T cells. The balance between HCV-induced immune evasion and the antiviral immune response results in chronic liver inflammation and consequent immune-mediated liver injury. This review summarizes our current understanding of the HCV-mediated interference with cellular immunity and of the factors resulting in HCV persistence. A profound knowledge about the intrinsic properties of HCV and its effects on intrahepatic immunity is essential to be able to design effective immunotherapies against HCV such as therapeutic HCV vaccines.
