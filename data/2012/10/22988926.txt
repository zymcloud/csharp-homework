Objective:To investigate the potential effect of Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) on the prevention and treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Methods:Male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups (the control group, GBE group, high-fat diet [HFD] group and HFD + GBE group). The human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) was treated with GBE and its flavonoid ingredients. The fatty acid composition of the rat liver was analyzed with gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/TOFMS). Triglyceride contents of both the rat liver and HepG2 cells were measured by enzymatic colorimetric method. The expressions of fatty acid metabolism-related genes were analyzed with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The protein expression and enzymatic activity were subsequently measured.Results:In rat livers, GBE reduced the elevations of hepatic triglyceride contents caused by HFD and the increased hepatic fatty acids were differentially affected by GBE. Notably, the expression and total activity of the fatty acid Î²-oxidation rate-limiting enzyme, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1A), were also promoted with GBE ingestion. In HepG2 cells, GBE and its ingredients, quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin, could decrease the cellular triglyceride content and upregulate the expression and total activity of CPT1A, respectively.Conclusions:The triglyceride-lowering effect of GBE on the HFD rat liver is closely associated with the increased expression and activity of CPT1A, and the flavonoid ingredients are the major contributors of GBE.
