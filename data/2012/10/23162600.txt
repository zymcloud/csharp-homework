CONTEXTS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant diseases in the world. Because less than 20% of patients with HCC are resectable, various types of non-surgical treatment have been developed.Evidence acquisition:At present, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is accepted as the standard local treatment for patients with HCC because of its superior local control and overall survival compared to other local treatments.Results:New devices for RFA and combination treatments of RFA with other procedures have been developed to improve anti-tumoral effects.Conclusions:This review mainly focuses on the status of RFA in the management of HCC and recent advances in RFA treatment technology.
