Background/aims:Somatostatin analog improves survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma by interacting with its specific receptor 2 and 5. However, expression of somatostatin receptor (SSTR) in operable HCC is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed the expression of SSTR-2 and -5 in HBV-related HCC and compared its clinicopathological features and follow-up data.Methodology:Seventy six patients with HCC were enrolled. SSTR-2 and -5 expression was investigated by QPCR and immunohistochemistry in all the samples. Furthermore, the association between gene expression and survival was analyzed.Results:Compared to surrounding cirrhotic tissues, mRNA levels of SSTR-2 and -5 in HCCs were significantly reduced. Seventy six HCC patients were divided into two groups according to SSTR-2 and 5 expression profiles. Both groups were well balanced with respect to baseline characteristics. According to univariate analysis, the mean survival time was longer in the HIGH SSTR-2/5 expression group. Multivariate Cox analysis showed that tumor expression level of SSTR-2 can be used as an independent prognostic marker of HCC as well as tumor TNM stage.Conclusions:Downregulation of SSTR transcription may result in loss of a tumor suppressive. Characterization of SSTR expression can be used as a useful parameter to evaluate the prognosis of HCC.
