Background:Elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is not only a diagnostic marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but is also a risk factor for HCC in chronic hepatitis C patients who do not have HCC.Aim:The aim was to analyse the hepatic gene expression signature in chronic hepatitis C patients with elevated AFP, who were at high risk for HCC.Methods:Liver tissue samples from 48 chronic hepatitis C patients were stratified by their serum AFP levels and analysed for gene expression profiles. The association between aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) expression and serum AFP was confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analyses. A matched case-control study was performed to evaluate the risk of AKR1B10 expression for HCC development.Results:Distinct hepatic gene expression patterns were demonstrated in patients with elevated AFP (â‰¥10 ng/mL) and normal AFP (6%) was an independent risk factor for HCC development (hazard ratio, 21.4; P = 0.001).Conclusion:AKR1B10 was up-regulated in association with serum AFP, and was an independent risk factor for HCC in chronic hepatitis C patients, suggesting its possible involvement at a very early stage of hepatocarcinogenesis.
