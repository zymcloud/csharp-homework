Background:Although there appears to be incomplete cross-resistance between docetaxel and paclitaxel in several types of malignancies, to our best knowledge there have been no available data on this for advanced gastric cancer.Methods:We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy and safety of docetaxel in patients with paclitaxel-resistant advanced gastric cancer. Docetaxel was administered at 50-60 mg/m2 every 3 weeks.Results:Twenty-one patients were evaluated. All patients had received 2 or more previous chemotherapy regimens. Among the 12 patients with measurable lesions, apparent tumor shrinkage was seen in 1 patient for an overall response rate of 8. 3% and a disease control rate of 33. 3%. Median progression free survival and overall survival of all patients were 2. 6 months and 6. 7 months, respectively. There were no correlations between the progression free survival of docetaxel and the progression free survival of previous paclitaxel and between the progression free survival of docetaxel and taxane-free interval(Spearman's correlation coefficients of ρ=-0. 14 and ρ=-0. 02, respectively). Grade 3/4 neutropenia developed in 8 patients(38%)and Grade 3 febrile neutropenia in 1 patient(4. 8%).Conclusions:Docetaxel showed modest activity in paclitaxel-resistant advanced gastric cancer patients, and no correlations between previous efficacy of paclitaxel or taxane-free interval were seen.
