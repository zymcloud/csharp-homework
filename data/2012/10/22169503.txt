Traditional radiotherapy is only effective in treating hepatocellular cancer (HCC) in doses above 50 Gy, but this is above the recommended liver radiation exposure of about 35 Gy, which is an important limitation making this treatment unsuitable for routine clinical practice. Trans-arterial radio-embolisation (TARE), consists of delivery of compounds linked to radio-emitter particles which end up in hepatic end-arterioles or show affinity for the neoplasm itself, allowing localised delivery of doses beyond 120 Gy. These are well tolerated in patients treated with this type of internal radiation therapy. TARE for HCC is used for palliative treatment of advanced disease which cannot be treated in other ways, or for tumour down-staging before liver transplantation, or as adjuvant therapy for surgically resected HCC. Tumour response after TARE is between 25% and 60% if assessed by using RECIST criteria, and 80% by EASL criteria. In this review we outline the advantages and limitations of radio-emitter therapy including 131-I, 90-Y and 188-Re. We include several observational, and all comparative studies using these compounds. In particular we compare TARE to trans-arterial chemo-embolisation and other intra-arterial techniques.
