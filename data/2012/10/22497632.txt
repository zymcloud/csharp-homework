Background and aim:Renal insufficiency (RI) often coexists with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and predicts a poor outcome in patients receiving transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). The modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) and chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations are used to provide estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). This study aimed to determine a prognsotic renal surrogate for outcome prediction in HCC patients receiving TACE.Methods:A total of 684 patients with HCC undergoing TACE were retrospectively analyzed. The prognostic ability between the MDRD and CKD-EPI equation was compared by the Akaike information criterion (AIC).Results:Patients were categorized by eGFR into > 60, 30-60 and 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) in the multivariate Cox model. The eGFR defined by the MDRD equation consistently had better prognostic ability when patients were stratified by the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score of 5 and > 5 and Cancer of the Liver Italian Program score 0 to 1 and > 1.Conclusions:The eGFR according the MDRD equation may provide better prognostic accuracy than the CKD-EPI equation independent of liver functional reserve and tumor staging, and is a more feasible renal surrogate for outcome prediction in CKD stage 1-3 HCC patients receiving TACE.
