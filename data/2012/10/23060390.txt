Background:Sorafenib has become the standard first-line treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in advanced HCC patients and explore its true value for specific subgroups.Data sources:A computer-based systematic search from January 2005 to June 2011 with "sorafenib" and "advanced hepatocellular carcinoma" as search terms was performed for possible clinical trials. Hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP), rates of partial response (PR), rates of toxicity effects, and details of subgroup analysis were extracted. Meta-analyses were done using the software Review Manager (version 5.0).Results:Six trials with 1164 patients were included. Based on three randomized controlled trials, the pooled HR (sorafenib/placebo) was 0.66 for OS (95% CI: 0.56-0.78; PConclusions:Sorafenib-based therapy benefits advanced HCC patients. Meanwhile, sorafenib is less effective for patients with extrahepatic spread, with normal AFP level and with elevated level of bilirubin.
