Background/aims:The safety and effectiveness of hepatic resection for recurrent or refractory hepatocellular is not established, particularly in cases treated by non-surgical treatment.Methodology:Surgical outcomes of 38 patients who underwent curative hepatic resection for recurrent or refractory disease after previous treatment were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify prognostic predictors.Results:There were no postoperative deaths, morbidity occurred in 9 patients (prolonged ascites retention, 5; biliary fistula, 3; intraabdominal abscess, 1), and all of them were treated conservatively. Recurrence-free and overall 1, 3 and 5-year-survival rate was 54, 28 and 24%, and 78, 60 and 55%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed hepatitis B or C virus infection (HR=12.8; 95% CI=2.3-245.1), tumor size >5 cm (HR=5.9; 95% CI=5.9-25.6), and vasculo- biliary invasion (HR=5.2; 95% CI=1.4-21.0) were independent predictors of poor overall survival. Type of previous treatment did not influence prognosis.Conclusions:Hepatic resection for recurrent or refractory hepatocellular carcinoma is safe and achieves long survival in selected patients.
