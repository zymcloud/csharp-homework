We report a 62-year-old man who presented with pain on the right side of his hip. CT revealed destructive masses in the right femur and left ilium. Histological examination indicated metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma, and further investigations revealed the primary tumor in the liver. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy using 99mTc N-pyrydoxyl-5-methyltryptophan and fused SPECT/CT clearly showed abnormal accumulation in these bone metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma.
