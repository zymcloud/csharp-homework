Objective:To evaluate the correlation of clinical effects and reasonable doses of docetaxel salvage therapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer.Methods:We reviewed retrospectively the clinical records of patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with docetaxel and statistically analyzed the correlation between clinical effects and reasonable doses of docetaxel.Results:The objective response rate and clinical benefit rate of docetaxol in patients with metastatic breast cancer were 27.0% and 35.0%, respectively, and the median progression free survival (PFS) was 5.0 (3.8 - 6.3) months. In the analysis at a single dose level, the clinical benefit rate and PFS of the ≥ 90.0 mg/m(2) docetaxel group were superior to that of the < 90.0 mg/m(2) group (P = 0.008, P = 0.045). Multi-dose level group stratified analysis showed that the docetaxel < 75.0 mg/m(2) group was better than the 75.0 - 84.9 mg/m(2) PFS group (P = 0.018), and the ≥ 95.0 mg/m(2) group was better than the 75.0 - 84.9 mg/m(2) group (P = 0.048). In patients who received >third line treatment or previously received paclitaxel adjuvant therapy, the PFS of the ≥ 94.9 mg/m(2) docetaxel group was 6.0 months, better than the 3.0 months of the 75.0 ∼ 84.9 mg/m(2) group (P = 0.031; P = 0.021).Conclusion:There is a clear correlation between clinical effects and reasonable doses of docetaxel salvage therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
