Background/aims:We conducted a case-control study in China to clarify the association between XRCC1-Arg-399Gin polymorphism and HCC risk.Methodology:A total of 150 cases and 158 controls were selected from May 2008 to May 2010. XRCC1-Arg399Gin and XRCC3-Thr241Met polymorphisms were based upon duplex polymerase-chain-reaction with the confronting-two-pair primer (PCR-CTPP) method. All analysis was performed by using the STATA statistical package.Results:A significant increased risk of HCC was associated with XRCC1 399Arg/Gin, and a heavy risk of HCC was also found in individuals with XRCC3 241Met/Met genotypes. A significant association was found between positive HBsAg and Arg/Gin. XRCC3 Thr/Met genotypes had a significant positive association with HBsAg (+) and a heavy risk of HCC was found in HBsAg (+) individuals with XRCC3 Met/Met genotype. Individuals carrying XRCC1 Gin/Gin genotypes showed significantly lower median survival than XRCC1 Arg/ Arg genotypes and significant hazard ratio (HR=l.38, 95% CI=l.04-1.84) was found. Meanwhile, we found a moderate HR for XRCC3 Thr/Met (HR=l.96, 95% CI=l.23-3.15) and a heavy HR for XRCC3 Met/Met (HR=2.98, 95% CI=1.77-7.54).Conclusions:In conclusion, we observed that XRCC1-Arg399Gln and XRCC3-Thr241Met polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to HCC and XRCC1 Gin allele and XRCC3 Met allele genotype showed significant poor prognosis of HCC.
