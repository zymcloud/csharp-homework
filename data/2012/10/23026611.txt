Background and aims:Survival rates after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have significantly increased after Milan criteria and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score implementation. However, few studies have reported this survival in countries with organ donor shortages over a period of 10 years and long waiting lists.Methods:This retrospective analysis of clinical data from 93 consecutive HCC patients who underwent OLT from June 2001 to September 2011 excluded 22 who underwent living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Seventy-one deceased donor liver transplantations (DDLT) were evaluated before and after the MELD era. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to plot survival rates. The follow-up was 2 months to 10 years.Results:The overall survival and recurrence rates at 10 years were 67% and 12.2%, respectively. After MELD, patient survival at 5 years decreased from 70% to 64% and the recurrence rate decreased from 15.3% to 12.5%. The most frequent recurrence sites were lung and liver.Conclusion:In our center MELD score implementation had a small impact on long-term survival post OLT for HCC.
