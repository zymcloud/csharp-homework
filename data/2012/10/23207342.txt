Objective:To develop an early and accurate detection method for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on detection of tumor-associated serum markers using a multiplex quantitative antibody array.Methods:The double-antibody sandwich principle was used to establish an antibody array composed of eight cancer-related serum markers, including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-b1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Serum samples from 160 cases of clinically diagnosed HCC and from 58 cases of liver cirrhosis (LC; controls) were obtained to test the array. Sixty percent of the samples were randomly selected for use as the training set (HCC, n = 96; LC, n = 36), and the remaining 40% was used as the test set (HCC, n = 64; LC, n = 22). The SPSS statistical software was used to perform logistic regression analysis and to create a diagnostic model.Results:When used with the training set, the model had sensitivity of 93.3%, specificity of 83.3%, and accuracy of 90.9%. When used with the test set, the model had sensitivity of 89.0%, specificity of 77.3%, and accuracy of 86.0%. The traditional serum AFP value (cut-off value of 20 ng/mL) showed 70.0% diagnostic sensitivity, 59.0% specificity, and 64.0% accuracy.Conclusion:The newly developed multiplex quantitative antibody detection system has high sensitivity and specificity. The diagnostic model with AFP and seven other cancer-related factors was superior to the traditional AFP only approach for early diagnosis of liver cancer, indicating its potential clinical value.
