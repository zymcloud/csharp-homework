Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of the liver is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. Only one-third of patients with HCC are suitable candidates for hepatic resection. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is performed in unresectable HCC. Drug-eluting beads (DEB) TACE is a modification of TACE, in which doxorubicin beads are used as embolizing material. These beads deliver the drug and embolize the vessels; however, it carries the risk of non-target embolization and it is difficult in cases with absent arterial blush on digital subtraction angiography (DSA). This is resolved using C-arm cone-beam computed tomography in the DSA suite. It identifies the tumor-feeding vessels, their area of supply, and differentiates between tumor and normal liver parenchyma. In addition, it is very useful in the embolization of hypovascular HCC. It helps and guides the radiologist in performing TACE effectively and also prevents non-target embolization of normal liver parenchyma.
