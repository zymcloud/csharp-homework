Background:Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a widely applied treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but insufficient RFA can promote rapid progression of the residual tumor through the hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)/vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) pathway. Although sorafenib has been successfully applied to advanced HCC, the use of sorafenib in residual tumor cells after RFA has rarely been tested.Purpose:To evaluate the potential role of sorafenib as an adjunct to RFA to reduce the recurrence rate after insufficient RFA.Material and methods:Xenograft tumors of SMMC 7721 were created by subcutaneously inoculating nude mice with hepatoma cells (5 × 10(6) cells per mouse). Fourteen days after inoculation, all mice were divided into three groups (control group [sham puncture], RFA group, and RFA combined with sorafenib treatment group) with six mice in each group. Each group was given a different treatment procedure. After treatment, the volume of the tumors was calculated from the resected specimens. The mRNA and protein expression of HIF-1α and VEGFA was quantified by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry analysis. The micro-vessel density (MVD) was determined by CD34 immunohistochemistry.Results:Real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry analysis showed that, compared to the RFA group, HIF-1α and VEGFA expression were significantly decreased in the group that received RFA combined with sorafenib treatment (P Conclusion:Sorafenib was able to inhibit the expression of HIF-1α and VEGFA, and sorafenib was able to increase time to recurrence when used as an adjunct to RFA.
