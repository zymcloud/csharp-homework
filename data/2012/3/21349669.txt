Objective:The quantitative parameters in contrast-enhanced ultrasonography-time-intensity curve of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were studied to explore their potential importance in monitoring the effects of anti-angiogenic therapy for HCC.Methods:115 HCC patients were studied with contrast-enhanced ultrasonography-time-intensity curve (CEUS-TIC) and with immunohistochemical analysis of tissue sections. The CEUS images were analyzed off-line to obtained quantitative parameters including maximum of intensity (IMAX), rise time (RT), time to peak (TTP), mean transit time (mTT), rise slope (RS), and washout time (WT). Monoclonal antibodies specific for smooth muscle actin and anti-CD34 were used to observe unpaired arteries (UAs) and microvessel area (MVA) of sinusoidal capillarization, respectively. The UAs and MVA of 82 HCC cases were successfully stained.Results:The number of UAs had moderate correlation with RT (r=-0.446), TTP (r=-0.432), and RS (r=0.431) (PConclusion:Quantitative CEUS-TIC parameters reflecting hemodynamics of tumors are correlated with UAs, but not with MVA, and they might be used to monitor the effects of anti-angiogenic therapy on HCC.
