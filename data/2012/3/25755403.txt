Background:The interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are a family of transcription factors known to be involved in the modulation of cellular responses to interferons (IFNs) and viral infection. While IRF-1 acts as a positive regulator, IRF-2 is known to repress IFN-mediated gene expression. The increase in the IRF-1/IRF-2 ratio is considered as an important event in the transcriptional activation of IFN-α gene toward development of the cellular antiviral response.Objective:This study was performed to assess the expression of IRF mRNAs along with the expression level of IFN-α, its receptor (IFNAR-1), and the signal transduction factor (STAT-1) in treatment naive hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected subjects.Materials:Thirty-five chronically infected (CHC) patients and 39 voluntary blood donors as controls were included in the study. Quantification of HCV-RNA (ribonucleic acid) and genotyping were done by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridization assays, respectively, using patient's serum/plasma. In both controls and patients, the serum level of IFN-α and IFN-α was measured by flow cytometry. Target gene expressions were studied by retro-transcription of respective mRNAs extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) followed by PCR amplification and densitometry. Minus-strand HCV-RNA as a marker of viral replication in PBMCs was detected by an inhouse PCR assay.Results:Both IRF-1 and IRF-2 genes were significantly enhanced in CHC than in control subjects (P Conclusion:Our findings indicate that HCV modulates host immunity by inducing IRF-2 gene to counteract IRF-1-mediated IFN-α gene expression. Since the IRF-2 gene is known to encode oncogenic protein, the role of IRF-2 in CHC patients developing hepatocellular carcinoma warrants further studies.
