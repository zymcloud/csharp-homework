Objective:To observe the in vivo effects of oxysophoridine on hepatocellular carcinoma in mice and to study the related mechanisms.Methods:C57BL mice were inoculated with mouse hepatoma H22 cells subcutaneously, then divided into 5 groups (14 per group), and treated with oxysophoridine (50, 100, or 150 mg/kg) or cisplatin (4 mg/kg) for 10 days. Inhibitory rate of tumor, body weight gain, and influence indices on internal organs (liver, spleen and thymus) were evaluated. The differentially expressed genes between the oxysophoridine-treated group, and the control group were analyzed using cDNA microarray and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) experiments.Results:Compared with the tumor weight of the control group (2.75Â±0.66 g), oxysophoridine significantly suppressed hepatocellular carcinoma growth in mice (P Conclusion:Oxysophoridine was a promising compound for developing drugs against hepatocellular carcinoma, and its anti-hepatoma effect was probably related to osteoprotegerin activation.
