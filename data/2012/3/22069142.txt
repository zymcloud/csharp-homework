Objective:The implementation of NTBC into treatment of hypertyrosinemia type I (HT I) greatly improved survival by prevention of acute liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, there are first reports of cognitive impairment in patients with elevated plasma tyrosine concentrations.Methods:We here assess the neurocognitive development using standardized psychometric test batteries with respect to cognition, motor abilities and speech in nine early-treated patients with HT I under long-term NTBC treatment.Results:High plasma tyrosine concentrations were frequently documented resulting in elevated 12-month median plasma tyrosine concentrations in seven out of nine patients. Plasma NTBC concentrations were generally in the lower therapeutic range. Five out of seven patients (71%) above 3 years of age had a total IQ score below the average. In addition, five out of seven patients above 3 years showed an inhomogenous test profile with significant differences between the different testing scales. Motor abilities were subnormal in four out of seven patients(57%). Cerebral MRI revealed no abnormalities. Logopedic evaluation in children at school age documented dysfunction or retardation in language development in all but one of the tested patients (80%), however, all but one patients had a migration background.Conclusions:A high number of patients performed below normal in the assessment of development, motor function and speech. We propose intellectual impairment as long-term complication in HT type I with elevated plasma tyrosine under NTBC treatment as observed in other hypertyrosinemias. These findings remain to be reproduced in greater patient numbers.
