Objective:To extract the active component from the root of Actinidia valvata Dunn and to investigate the effects on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in vitro.Methods:Total saponin was extracted from the root of A. valvata (TSAVD). HCC cells, such as BEL-7402, HepG2, PLC, SMMC-7721, MHCC-97-H, and MHCC-97-L, were treated with TSAVD in 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenytetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. BEL-7402 and MHCC-97-H cells were also treated respectively with TSAVD at different concentrations for 24 h in wound healing and adhesion assays, and the effects of TSAVD on BEL-7402 and MHCC-97-H cells mobility and adhesion abilities were observed. Meanwhile, the effects of TSAVD on invasion and migration of BEL-7402 and MHCC-97-H cells were also investigated by transwell chamber in invasion and migration assays.Results:TSAVD at 1.5 mg/mL inhibited BEL-7402 cell proliferation with inhibition ratios (IRs) of 61.08%, 74.12%, 84.55% at 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. Meanwhile, TSAVD inhibited MHCC-97-H proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner from 1.5 to 0.5 mg/mL, with the IR of 36% at 1.5 mg/mL at 24 h. For SMMC-7721, PLC, and HepG2, the IR was lower than 30% at 1.5 mg/mL at 24 h. In the wound healing assay, mobility abilities of BEL-7402 and MHCC-97-H cells in TSAVD treated groups were significantly weaker than those of the control group. After pretreatment for 24 h with TSAVD, adhesion abilities were reduced in both MHCC-97-H and BEL-7402 cells, with IRs of 48.50%±4.86% and 49.85%±5.25% at 200 μg/mL. The IRs of MHCC-97-H and BEL-7402 cells in the migration assay were 49.13%±2.91% and 79.37%±0.09% at 200 μg/mL. In the invasion assay, IRs were 69.78%±4.88% and 82.48%±0.25% at 200 μg/mL.Conclusions:Of all HCC cells, the highest inhibition by TSAVD was seen for BEL-7402 proliferation. TSAVD could restrain adhesion, invasion, mobility, and migration abilities of BEL-7402 and MHCC-97-H cells in vitro.
