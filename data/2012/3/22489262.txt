Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurs commonly and with increasing frequency in developing countries, where it also carries an especially grave prognosis. The major risk factor for HCC in these regions is chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, although dietary exposure to aflatoxin B1 also plays an important etiological role. Prevention of HCC in developing regions is unlikely in the foreseeable future. Although an effective vaccine against HBV is available, the percentage of babies born in developing countries that receive the full course of immunization remains low. Moreover, the usually long interval between infection with HBV and the development of HCC means that 30 to 50 years will elapse before the full effect of the vaccine will be realized. Practical measures to prevent aflatoxin B1 exposure are not in place. Serum α-fetoprotein levels are a useful pointer to the diagnosis of HCC in low-income countries, but definitive diagnosis is hampered both by the lack of the sophisticated imaging equipment now available in developed countries and by obstacles to obtaining histological proof. In the majority of patients in low-income regions, the tumor is inoperable by the time the patient presents. Hepatic resection is seldom possible in sub-Saharan Africa, although the tumor is successfully resected in a larger number of patients in China. Liver transplantation for HCC is rarely performed in either region. Sophisticated new radiotherapy techniques are not available in developing countries. The beneficial effects of the multikinase inhibitor, sorafenib, are encouraging, although financial considerations may restrict its use in low-income countries.
