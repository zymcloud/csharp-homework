Objective:To investigate the effects of the histone deacetylase inhibitor, MS-275, on the immune molecule content and categories in hepatocarcinoma exosomes.Methods:Exosomes were isolated from the human hepatocarcinoma cell lines, HepG2 and Hep3b, and purified by a combination technique of ultrafiltration centrifugation and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. The expressions of heat shock protein (HSP)70, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-I, HLA-DR, cluster of differentiation (CD) 80 and NY-ESO-1 on exosomes were analyzed with immunoelectron microscopy and Western blotting before and after MS-275 treatment. Intergroup differences were statistically analyzed by the Student's paired t-test.Results:MS-275 treatment of both HepG2 and Hep3b cell types significantly increased the numbers of exosomes, their total protein content, and expression of HSP70, HLA-I and CD80 (per 100 exosomes), as compared to non-treated cells (all, P less than 0.01). MS-275 was also found to induce de novo expression of HLA-DR, but had no significant effect on NY-ESO-1 expression (P more than 0.05). The findings from immunoelectron microscopy confirmed those from Western blotting.Conclusion:The histone deacetylase inhibitor, MS-275, can significantly alter the immune molecule content and categories in exosomes of hepatocarcinoma cells. The differential expression profile may reflect an anti-cancer immune response and represent molecular targets for novel anti-hepatoma therapeutic or preventative strategies.
