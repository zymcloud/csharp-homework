Background:Because hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has important angiogenic activity, the expression of angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) may have a pathogenic role. The information about the influence of serum Ang-2 (sAng-2) in patients with HCC is scarce.Aims:The aim was to assess the association between sAng-2 levels and characteristics of tumor and liver disease in patients with HCC.Methods:sAng-2 concentrations in peripheral (sAng-2-P) and hepatic (sAng-2-H) veins were analyzed by ELISA in 33 patients with chronic liver disease who underwent a splanchnic hemodynamic study. Thirty-two patients received treatment for HCC.Results:The median age was 61 years and 79% were male. Hepatitis C infection (70%) was the main etiology. Most patients were Child-Pugh grade A (72.7%). sAng-2-P and sAng-2-H were well correlated (r = 0.95; p Conclusions:Ang-2 seems to play an important role in the angiogenic processes of HCC and its serum levels are associated with tumor characteristics and invasive behavior. Our results suggest that Ang-2 is not related with treatment response and its level is not modified by treatment.
