Background and goals:There are no highly sensitive and specific minimally invasive biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to date. The objective of this study was to identify serum microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential HCC biomarkers.Methods:Using miRCURY LNAâ„¢ microRNA arrays, the levels of circulating miRNAs in the serum of patients with HCC were compared and controls were matched. Then 253 subjects (112 HCC, 85 chronic hepatitis B [CHB], and 56 healthy controls) were recruited and 12 serum miRNAs were compared by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). It was followed by the comparison of serum miRNA concentrations before and after the surgical resection in HCC group.Results:Median levels of miR-483-5p and miR-500a were higher in HCC patients than in patients with CHB and in healthy controls (p 0.05) and miR-483-5p levels were significantly reduced in serum samples obtained 30 days after surgical resection (p Conclusion:Our observations suggest that serum miR-483-5p and miR-500a might serve as novel, noninvasive biomarkers for HCC. Serum miR-483-5p might complement AFP in detecting HCC.
