Tumor vascular invasion is one of the worst factors of metastasis and/or recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), leading to poor outcomes. We investigated the relevance between preoperative parameters and histological vascular invasion among HCC patients who underwent LDLT. We enrolled 27 HCC patients who underwent LDLT from September 2003 to February 2011 in our hospital. Their primary diseases were hepatitis C (n=16) hepatitis B (n=9), primary biliary cirrhosis (n=1), and cryptogenic liver cirrhosis (n=1). The 2 groups were positive (N=7) versus negative (N=20) histological vascular invasion. We compared the greatest size and numbers of tumors from preoperative enhanced computerized axial tomography (CAT) scans, preoperative serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II), as well as preoperative anticancer therapy. The preoperative greatest average diameter and numbers of tumor were 2.99 cm and 2.43, respectively, among positive patients, and 1.93 cm and 1.3, respectively, among patients with negative vascular invasion. The mean values of AFP and PIVKA-II were 3568.7 ng/mL and 2511.7 mAU/mL, respectively, among positive patients, and 812.8 ng/mL and 134.8 mAU/mL, respectively, among patients with negative vascular invasion. Five positive and 11 negative patients received preoperative anticancer therapy. Even if the tumor was within Milan criteria, namely, maximum size 3 cm and number of tumors 3, preoperative treatment may be a preoperative predictive factor for positive histological vascular invasion.
