Aim:To examine the significance of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) treatment before transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:This study included 99 patients who underwent TACE therapy for HCC at our hospital and were followed up without treatment for at least 6 mo between January 2004 and January 2010. They were divided into 2 groups: those receiving BCAA granules (n = 40) or regular diet (n = 59, control). Data obtained were retrospectively analyzed (prior to TACE, and 1 wk, 1, 3, and 6 mo after TACE) in terms of nutritional condition and clinical laboratory parameters (serum albumin level and Child-Pugh score), both of which are determinants of hepatic functional reserve.Results:The BCAA group comprised 27 males and 13 females with a mean age of 69.9 ± 8.8 years. The patients of the BCAA group were classified as follows: Child-Pugh A/B/C in 22/15/3 patients, and Stage II/III/IVA HCC in 12/23/5 patients, respectively. The control group comprised 32 males and 27 females with a mean age of 73.2 ± 10.1 years. In the control group, 9 patients had chronic hepatitis, Child-Pugh A/B/C in 39/10/1 patients, and StageI/II/III/IVA HCC in 1/11/35/12 patients, respectively. Overall, both serum albumin level and Child-Pugh score improved significantly in the BCAA group as compared with the control 3 and 6 mo after TACE (P 3.5 g/dL; and (3) epirubicin dose. A similar trend indicating a significant improvement of all variables in the BCAA group was noted (P Conclusion:Treatment with BCAA granules in patients who have undergone TACE for HCC is considered useful to maintain their hepatic functional reserve.
