Objective:To evaluate a new 2-step technique for obtaining adequate but short-term parenchymal hypertrophy in oncologic patients requiring extended right hepatic resection with limited functional reserve.Background:Patients presenting with primary or metastatic liver tumors often face the dilemma that the remaining liver tissue may not be sufficient. Preoperative portal vein embolization has thus far been established as the standard procedure for achieving resectability.Methods:Two-staged hepatectomy was performed in patients who preoperatively appeared to be marginally resectable but had a tumor-free left lateral lobe. Marginal respectability was defined as a left lateral lobe to body weight ratio of less than 0.5. In the first step, surgical exploration, right portal vein ligation (PVL), and in situ splitting (ISS) of the liver parenchyma along the falciform ligament were performed. Computed tomographic volumetry was performed before ISS and before completion surgery.Results:The study included 25 patients with primary liver tumors (hepatocellular carcinoma: n = 3, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: n = 2, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: n = 2, malignant epithelioid hemangioendothelioma: n = 1, gallbladder cancer: n = 1 or metastatic disease [colorectal liver metastasis]: n = 14, ovarian cancer: n = 1, gastric cancer: n = 1). Preoperative CT volumetry of the left lateral lobe showed 310 mL in median (range = 197-444 mL). After a median waiting period of 9 days (range = 5-28 days), the volume of the left lateral lobe had increased to 536 mL (range = 273-881 mL), representing a median volume increase of 74% (range = 21%-192%) (P Conclusions:Two-step hepatic resection performing surgical exploration, PVL, and ISS results in a marked and rapid hypertrophy of functional liver tissue and enables curative resection of marginally resectable liver tumors or metastases in patients that might otherwise be regarded as palliative.
