Background and aim:CABYR, a calcium-binding tyrosine phosphorylation regulated fibrous sheath protein, was initially reported to be testis-specific and subsequently shown to be present in brain tumors, pancreas cancer and lung cancer. This study aimed to investigate the expression and effects of the CABYR-c transcript of CABYR gene in hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:mRNA and protein expression of CABYR-c was examined in 20 paired hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues by real-time quantitative RT-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot analysis respectively. HepG2 cells were treated with the antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting CABYR-c mRNA (CABYR-c antisense oligonucleotides [AS ODNs]) for indicated times, the AS ODNs inhibition effect was evaluated by measuring the CABYR-c mRNA expression level of HepG2 cells after treatment using real-time quantitative RT-PCR, then cell proliferation was studied using MTT assay, and cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry as well.Results:CABYR-c mRNA levels in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues were significantly higher than that in the paired adjacent non-cancerous tissues (27.5 ± 1.2 versus 2.5 ± 0. 9, P Conclusion:CABYR-c is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and may play an oncogenic role in heptocarcinogenesis as well as its progression.
