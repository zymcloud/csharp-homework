Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is a rate-limiting enzyme of aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells and plays important roles in cancer metabolism and growth. Here we show that vitamin K(3) and K(5) (VK(3) and VK(5)) are relatively specific PKM2 inhibitors. VK(3) and VK(5) showed a significantly stronger potency to inhibit PKM2 than to inhibit PKM1 and PKL, 2 other isoforms of PK dominantly expressed in most adult tissues and liver. This study combined with previous reports supports that VK(3) and VK(5) have potential as adjuvant for cancer chemotherapy.
