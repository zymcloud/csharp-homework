Purpose:The goal of this research was to investigate the feasibility of volumetric modulated arc therapy, RapidArc (RA), in association with the active breathing coordinator (ABC) for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with radiotherapy.Patients and materials:A total of 12 patients with HCC, after receiving transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment, underwent three-dimensional computer tomography (3D-CT) scanning associated with ABC using end inspiration hold (EIH), end expiration hold (EEH), and free breathing (FB) techniques. The three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and RA plans (three 135Â° arcs) were designed on different CT images, respectively. The liver volume, gross tumor volume (GTV), and planning target volume (PTV) of the three breath status and the dosimetric differences of the different plans were compared.Results:There were no significant differences in the volumes of live and GTV between the three breathing techniques (p > 0.05); the PTV in FB was greater than in the EEH and EIH (p Conclusion:RA in conjunction with ABC for the treatment of HCC with radiotherapy can achieve better dose delivery and ensure the accuracy of the target volume, which spares more organs at risk, uses fewer monitor units, and shortens treatment time.
