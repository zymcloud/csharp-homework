Social relationship was the least affected domain, while environment was the second least affected area. Quality of life of hepatic patients was significantly lower than dermatological patients with respect to physical health and environment, lower than cancer patients in relation to psychological health, and lower than cardiac patients in the social relationship domain. The quality of life of cardiac patients was noted to be significantly higher than the other three categories in the domains of psychological health and environment.Conclusion:In the face of the evidence of high deterioration in the quality of life of the patients in terms of physical and psychological health, medical units should be better equipped with facilities to enhance a sense of betterment in patients.
