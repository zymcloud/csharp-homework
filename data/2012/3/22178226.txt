Because of the relatively high human oral exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) compared to the inhalation exposure, the known carcinogenicity of this type of compounds and the limited data from oral studies available with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, an oral carcinogenicity study was performed using benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) as a PAH representative. Wistar rats, 52 animals per sex and group were exposed daily (5 days a week) to 0, 3, 10 or 30 mg B[a]P/kg bw/day by gavage for 104 weeks and were subject to gross- and histopathology. The main tumours observed were hepatocellular carcinomas and forestomach tumours. Other tumours induced in this study were tumours of the auditory canal, skin and appendages, oral cavity, small intestine, kidney, and soft tissue sarcomas. For hepatocellular carcinomas and forestomach tumours, the BMDL10 were 3 and 1 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. The incidence of altered hepatic foci was increased in the 3mg/kg bw/day group. The increase in liver tumours is considered the most relevant effect for human risk assessment in terms of pathogenesis and sensitivity, and is proposed as the basis for human cancer risk assessment for oral PAH exposure.
