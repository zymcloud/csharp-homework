The International Liver Transplantation Society held its yearly meeting as a joint conference with the European Liver and Intestine Transplant Association and the Liver Intensive Care Group of Europe at the Valencia Congress Center (Valencia, Spain) from June 22 to 25, 2011. Nearly 1500 registrants attended the meeting, which opened with a premeeting conference entitled "Global Challenges and Controversies in Liver Transplantation." This was followed by numerous oral and poster abstract sessions and topic sessions focused on medical, surgical, and intensive care aspects of liver transplantation (LT). This report summarizes key symposia and oral abstracts delivered at the meeting and is conveniently divided into subsections relevant to LT. It is not meant to be a critical or comprehensive evaluation of all the meeting presentations and is merely intended to highlight presentations and associated published literature dealing with key topics.
