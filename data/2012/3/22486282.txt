Introduction:Virus of hepatitis C (HCV) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and cancer, and the most common indication for liver transplantation. In industrialised countries, injecting drug use is currently the most important risk factor for infection with hepatitis C, resulting in high prevalence of hepatitis C among injecting drug users (IDUs). The aim of the study was to assess the seroprevalence of HCV infection and distribution of genotypes among IDUs in the years 2004-2008.Probands and methods:A total number of 846 probands, both sexes (590 males and 256 females) with mean age from 24 to 29 years were investigated in the years 2004-2008. Standard virological tests were performed.Results:The seroprevalence of anti-HCV positivity during the years 2004-2008 were in range 34-78% and positivity of HCV RNA assessed by PCR method were in range 17-71%. The genotypes distribution was in favour of genotype 3.Conclusions:In Slovakia IDUs represent risk group with high prevalence of hepatitis C. These results are comparable to those published in other European countries.
