Objectives:An association between celiac disease (CD) and peripheral neuropathy (PN) has been reported.Methods:Patients with CD and/or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were recruited from the gastroenterology clinics at a medical center and local support groups. Control subjects without CD or IBD were recruited from the staff of the medical center as well as relatives and attendees at support groups. Each participant completed a survey that used two validated PN instruments to define and characterize PN.Results:In the CD group, 38.9% met criteria for PN compared with 38.7% in the IBD group (P = 0.97) and 20.5% in the control group (P < 0.001). On multiple logistic regression, the odds of PN after adjusting for age, gender, diabetes, vitamin B12 deficiency, and cancer history were increased for CD (odds ratio, 2.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.82-3.47) and IBD (odds ratio, 2.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.85-4.18).Conclusions:PN is more often found in patients with CD and/or IBD than in the general population.
