Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common type of highly malignant tumor. Guangxi is an area of China characterized by a high incidence of HCC. Previous epidemiological studies have found that chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the major etiological risk factors for HCC in China. With the increased understanding of the host immune response against HBV and the pathogenesis of the virus, at present, greater attention is being given to the immune response of cytokine genes, as polymorphisms may have a major impact on the course and outcome of HBV infection. In the present study, we genotyped tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) rs1800629 (-308G/A), rs1800630 (-863C/A); interleukin-1B rs1143627 (-31T/C); and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) rs1800469 (-509C/T) in a hospital-based study of 772 HCC cases and 852 cancer-free controls. The distribution of the frequency of TNF-α rs1800630 sites of CC, CA, AA were 65.67, 27.46 and 6.87% in the case group, respectively, as compared with 67.02, 29.58 and 3.40% in the controls, all with a statistical significance (P
