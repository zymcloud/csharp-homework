Purpose:The objective of this study was to assess the results and tolerance of radiofrequency ablation in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) older than 75 years.Patients and methods:Over a period of 9 years from January 2001, 235 patients with cirrhosis and 3 or less HCC≤5 cm of diameter were treated by radiofrequency ablation. Among them, 52 patients older than 75 years were selected for this study.Results:The mean age was 79.4±3. 5 years. There were 36 males, cirrhosis was classified Child-Pugh class A (n=52) related to alcohol (n=13), HCV infection (n=33), or other causes (n=6). The mean tumour diameter was 32.5±10.6 mm, and 14 patients had a multifocal HCC. A complete ablation was obtained in 50/52 patients (96%). No severe complication occurred. The estimated overall survival rates were 62%, 52% and 36% at 3 years, 4 years and 5 years, respectively; it was similar to those observed in patients younger than 75 years.Conclusion:In patients with cirrhosis older than 75 years, radiofrequency ablation of 3 or less HCC≤5cm is well tolerated and survivals rates are similar to those of younger patients.
