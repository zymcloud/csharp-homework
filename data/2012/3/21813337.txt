Hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) has rarely been associated with familial adenomatosis polyposis (FAP). Between 1950 and 2011, only a few cases of HCC associated with classic FAP have been reported in the medical literature. Here, we report the first case to our knowledge of HCC associated with attenuated FAP (aFAP). The patient possessed a single nucleotide mutation in the noncoding region after exon 4, which is rarely observed in attenuated FAP, and not previously reported in classic FAP–associated HCC. Our patient underwent liver transplantation for a 22-cm-large HCC (in China), however, her HCC recurred 1.5 years after the transplantation. Here we review the medical literature on FAP and HCC, with a particular focus on the role of the Wnt/APC/β-catenin pathway toward a better understanding of HCC pathogenesis.
