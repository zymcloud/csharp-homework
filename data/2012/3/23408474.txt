To investigate the effects of Hu Qisan (HQS) on apoptosis in diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a Solt-Farber two-step test model of precancerous liver lesions was established in rats using a previously described method. HQS (4 and 8 g/kg body weight/day) was administered for 4 weeks, after the majority of the liver was removed. HepG2 cells were used to detect the HtrA serine peptidase 2 (HtrA2/Omi) release from mitochondria and caspase-3 activation promoted by HQS. Exposure of the rats to DEN for 6 weeks induced hepatic carcinogenesis. HQS (4 and 8 g/kg body weight/day) markedly induced cell apoptosis. The protective effects against hepatic carcinogenesis were mediated by multiple mechanisms, including the reduction of DEN-induced Î³-GT-positive cell proliferation, mitochondrial morphological changes, HtrA2/Omi release from mitochondria and the activation of caspase-3. In conclusion, HQS is a potential anti-carcinogenic agent that may induce apoptosis by reducing the inhibitory effects of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) on caspase-3. Thus, HQS should be further explored as a potentially promising new therapeutic agent against human hepatic cancer.
