Background/aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is the third most common cancer in Korea, has a very poor prognosis. However, only a few studies have performed a comprehensive survival-related analysis in all patients who were consecutively diagnosed and treated over a given period of time. The aim of this study was to determine the 5-year survival rate and its prognostic factors among HCC patients.Methods:In total, 257 patients who were consecutively diagnosed with HCC between January 2000 and December 2003 were followed until death or until December 2008. We analyzed their survival outcomes according to their clinical characteristics, tumor staging, and treatment modalities, and determined the independent prognostic factors affecting survival.Results:The patients were aged 59±10 years (mean±SD). During the follow-up period, 223 patients (86.8%) died and the overall median survival was 10.8 months; the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 44.4%, 21.0%, and 12.1%, respectively. The outcomes in patients with tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage I or II and Child-Pugh class A or B were significantly better with surgical resection than with other treatment modalities (PConclusions:This retrospective cohort study elucidated survival outcomes and prognostic factors affecting survival in HCC patients at a single center.
