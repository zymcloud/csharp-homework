Background:We sought to evaluate total and segmental liver regeneration by comparing preoperative computed tomographic (CT) volumetry and CT volumetry on postoperative day (POD) 7 after a right hepatectomy, in patients with various status and surgical indications.Method:We included 36 patients who underwent right lobectomy for living donor liver transplantation (healthy group), and 29 for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment (disease group). All of the disease group patients were Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class A. The regeneration of lateral, medial segment and total remnant liver volumes were assessed on POD 7 using a CT-based program. Total volumes and segmental volumes were measured for total liver, future liver remnant (FLR), and liver remnant. We calculated total and segmental early regeneration indexes, defined as [(VLR-VFLR)/VFLR]Ã—100, where VLR is volume of the liver remnant and VFLR is volume of the FLR.Result:The VLR at POD 7 showed a 72.9% increase in volume among the healthy versus 55% in the disease group, (P=.012) In the disease group, segmental volume and regeneration indexes were also significantly lower than among the healthy group: 59.0% versus 46.9% in the medial and 86.8% versus 57.7% in the lateral segment (P=.023 and PConclusion:The volume regeneration potential in diseased livers is significantly lower than that of a normal, healthy liver. So, we must consider a patient's liver status and volume profile before an extensive liver.
