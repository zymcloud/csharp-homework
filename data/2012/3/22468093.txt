Non-hepatocellular carcinoma (non-HCC) with macroscopic bile duct tumor thrombus (BDTT) formation is rare, few radiological studies have been reported. In this case report, we retrospectively analyzed the imaging findings of three cases of non-HCC with macroscopic BDTT on dynamic enhanced multislice computed tomography (MSCT) scan. One case of primary hepatic carcinosarcoma was presented as a solitary, large well-defined tumor with significant necrotic changes. One case of liver metastasis from colon cancer was presented as a lobulated, large ill-defined tumor. One case of intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm involved the entire pancreas, presented as a cystic and solid mass with multilocular changes (the individual loculi were less than 5.0 mm in diameter). The bile duct was dilated due to expansible growth of the BDTT in all three patients. The BDTT was contiguous with hepatic or pancreatic tumor, and both of them showed the same enhancement patterns on dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan: early enhancement in the hepatic arterial phase and a quick wash-out of contrast agent in the portal and equilibrium phases. Macroscopic BDTT in non-HCC patient is rare, dynamic enhanced MSCT scan may be valuable in the diagnosis of non-HCC with BDTT.
