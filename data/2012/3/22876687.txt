Objective:To observe the effects of resveratrol on apoptosis and ROS production in murine hepatocarcinoma Hepa 1-6 cells in vitro.Methods:Hepa 1-6 cells were treated with different dose of resveratrol (20 micromol/L, 40 micromol/L, 80 micromol/L). Cell proliferation was detected with MTT assay at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Hoechst 33258 staining was used to visualize apoptotic morphology. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry analysis. Activated caspase-3 was detected by western blot. Intracellular ROS production was observed by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF-DA) staining.Results:Compared with the control, upon treatment with 20-80 micromol/L resveratrol for 24 h, 48 h or 72 h, the proliferation of Hepa 1-6 cells was significantly inhibited in a time-dose dependent manner. 20-80 micromol/L resveratrol also induced apoptosis and apoptotic morphology change in Hepa 1-6 cells accompanied with caspase-3 activation and ROS generation.Conclusion:Resveratrol could inhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis in murine hepatocarcinoma Hepa 1-6 cells, and the mechanism may associated with caspase-3 activation and ROS production.
