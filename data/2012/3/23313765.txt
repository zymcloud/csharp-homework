The purpose of this study is to perform absorbed dose calculations based on Monte Carlo simulations for a novel beta emitter bioglass Ho-166 seed which is proposed for treating small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). The bioactive glass seed has been developed by use of the sol-gel method. Monte Carlo simulations were carried out for the seed using the version 5 of the (MCNP) Monte Carlo radiation transport code to investigate the dosimetric parameters recommended by the AAPM Task Group 60 (TG-60). Dose distributions due to the beta and photon radiation were obtained at different radial distances surrounding the source. The dose rate in water at the reference point was calculated to be 6.71 ± 0.4 cGy h(-1) μCi(-1). The anisotropy function values ranging from 0.745 to 1.928 were obtained for radial distances of 0.3-8 mm and polar angles of 0°-90°. The (166)Ho seed source can deliver high radiation doses to the tumor, while the short range of the beta particles limits damage to the adjacent normal tissue.
