Background:A tumor thrombus in the portal vein originating from gastric cancer is a rare condition. Little is known about the development of portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) and its effect on the survival of gastric cancer patients.Methods:PVTT originating from gastric cancer was identified retrospectively with computed tomography in 51 patients, from January 2002 to June 2007. PVTT was classified by metastatic routes as follows: lymph node (LN), hepatic mass, and hematogenous type. The median survival from PVTT, and the factors affecting the survival of gastric cancer patients with PVTT were analyzed.Results:The median survival of gastric cancer patients with PVTT (N = 51) was 5.4 months. The median survival was compared according to clinical characteristics, and multivariate analysis proved that female and hepatic mass type were independent risk factors for poor prognosis. The characteristics of the hepatic mass type were old age, higher proportion of tumors located in the upper-third of the stomach, and liver metastasis, compared to the LN or the hematogeneous type.Conclusions:PVTT originating from gastric cancer was a poor prognostic factor and the median survival from PVTT was different according to several clinical factors.
