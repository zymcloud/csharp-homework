Objectives:We investigated the effects of xeroderma pigmentosum D (XPD) on the growth of hepatoma cells and the expressions of P21, Bax, Bcl-2 and Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx). In addition, we examined whether XPD affected the aforementioned genes via the P53 pathway.Methods:Human hepatoma cells (HepG2.2.15) were transfected with XPD expression vector, followed by incubation with Pifithrin-α (P53 inhibitor). By using RT-PCR and Western blotting, the expression levels of XPD, P53, phospho-P53 (ser-15), P21, Bax, Bcl-2 and HBx were detected. The cell cycle and the apoptosis rate were examined with flow cytometry, and the cell viability was detected by MTT.Results:Over-expression of XPD up-regulated the expressions of P53, phospho-P53 (ser-15), P21 and Bax but down-regulated the expressions of Bcl-2 and HBx. XPD inhibited the viability of HepG2.2.15 and exacerbated the apoptosis. However, the inhibition of P53 by Pifithrin-α abolished the above-mentioned effects of XPD.Conclusion:XPD could suppress growth of hepatoma cells, up-regulate the expressions of P21 and Bax, and down-regulate the expressions of Bcl-2 and HBx through the P53 pathway. There may be mutual influences among XPD, P53 and HBx that co-regulate hepatocarcinogenesis.
