Actinomycosis is a chronic disease characterized by abscess, tissue fibrosis and draining sinuses. Pelvic actinomycosis in women most commonly occurs during ascending infections, which are usually associated with intrauterine devices; however, secondary hepatic actinomycosis, while rare, can also occur. We describe a patient with an unusual case of metastatic hepatic actinomycosis misdiagnosed as distant metastases of ovarian cancer.
