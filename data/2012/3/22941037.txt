Transferrin receptor (TfR) has been used as a target for the antibody-based therapy of cancer due to its higher expression in tumors relative to normal tissues. Great potential has been shown by anti-TfR antibodies combined with chemotherapeutic drugs as a possible cancer therapeutic strategy. In our study, we investigated the anti-tumor effects of anti-TfR monoclonal antibody (mAb) alone or in combination with sinomenine hydrochloride in vitro. Results suggested that anti-TfR mAb or sinomenine hydrochloride could induce apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, and affect the cell cycle. A synergistic effect was found in relation to tumor growth inhibition and the induction of apoptosis when anti-TfR mAb and sinomenine hydrochloride were used simultaneously. The expression of COX-2 and VEGF protein in HepG2 cells treated with anti-TfR mAb alone was increased in line with increasing dosage of the agent. In contrast, COX-2 expression was dramatically decreased in HepG2 cells treated with sinomenine hydrochloride alone. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of sinomenine hydrochloride and anti-TfR mAb administered in combination were more prominent than when the agents were administered singly. To sum up, these results showed that the combined use of sinomenine hydrochloride and anti-TfR mAb may exert synergistic inhibitory effects on human hepatoma HepG2 cells in a COX-2-dependent manner. This finding provides new insight into how tumor cells overcome the interference of iron intake to survive and forms the basis of a new therapeutic strategy involving the development of anti-TfR mAb combined with sinomenine hydrochloride for liver cancer.
