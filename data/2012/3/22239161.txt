Context:In India, Dregea volubilis (L.f.) Benth. ex Hook.f. (Asclepediaceae), a large twining shrub with a woody vine, is used to treat tumors traditionally.Objective:This study evaluated the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of the methanol extract of Dregea volubilis leaves (MEDV) and elucidated its possible mechanism of action.Materials and methods:In vitro antitumor activity of MEDV was evaluated against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cell-line. In vivo antitumor and antioxidant activity of MEDV at three dose levels (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) were determined against EAC tumor-bearing mice. After 24 h of EAC inoculation, the extract was administered for 9 consecutive days. After the administration of the last dose on the 9th day followed by 18 h fasting, mice from all groups were sacrificed to determine antitumor activity and hematological profiles along with liver related biochemical parameters like lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzymatic activity, etc.Results:For in vitro antitumor activity, IC(50) value of MEDV for EAC tumor cells was 85.51 ± 4.07 µg/ml. The MEDV showed a decrease in tumor volume, packed cell volume and viable cell count and an increase in the non-viable cell count of the EAC tumor-bearing mice (p < 0.001). Hematological profile reverted near to normal level in extract treated mice. MEDV decreased the hepatic lipid peroxidation level and enhanced superoxide dismutase and catalase level in tumor-bearing mice (p < 0.001).Discussion and conclusion:MEDV exhibited in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity in EAC tumor-bearing mice mediated through augmenting antioxidant defense system.
