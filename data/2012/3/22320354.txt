Noscapine and its 7-hydroxy and 7-amino derivatives were characterized for their binding to tubulin. A solution NMR structure of these compounds bound to tubulin shows that noscapine and its 7-aniline derivative do not compete for the same binding site nor does its small molecule crystal structure match its tubulin-bound conformation. These compounds were also tested for their antiproliferative effects on a panel hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines.
