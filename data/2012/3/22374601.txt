A 77-year-old male with chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis underwent a right middle-lower lobectomy and lymph node dissection because of non-small cell carcinoma of the lung. On the 1st post-operative day (POD1), a large quantity of chylous pleural effusion was recognized after he initiated oral intake. The diagnosis was postoperative chylothorax. Conservative therapy including a medium chain tryglyceride diet and total parental nutrition were not effective. Considering of the patient's past history, we decided to continue conservative therapy using octreotide acetate on POD7. After administration of the octreotide acetate, the volume of chylous pleural effusion gradually decreased. The chest tube was removed on POD19. Octeotide acetate should be a choice for the conservative treatment of postoperative refractory chylothorax.
