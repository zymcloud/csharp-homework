Early mitotic inhibitor-1 (Emi1) is a key cell-cycle regulator that promotes S-phase and M-phase entry by inhibiting anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) activity. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed in 114 human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples, and the data were correlated with clinicopathologic features. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed to determine the prognostic significance of the proteins. Expression of Emi1 correlated directly with the stage of HCC. More importantly, high expression of Emi1 was associated with a poor outcome. Western blot analysis showed that Emi1 was highly expressed in HCC compared with the adjacent noncancerous tissue. In vitro, after the release of HCC cell lines from serum starvation, the expression of Emi1 APC/C substrates (cyclins A, B) and Skp2 was up-regulated, whereas p27(Kip1) was down-regulated. In addition, we used small interfering RNA to knock out Emi1 expression and observed its effects on HCC growth in vitro to determine whether loss of Emi1 could inhibit cell proliferation by blocking S-phase and mitotic entry. Western blot analyses indicated that deletion of Emi1 was positively correlated with APC/C substrates (cyclins A, B) and Skp2 but was negatively correlated with p27(Kip1). Emi1 inhibits APC/C activity, whereas Skp2 degradation is mediated by APC/C, and degradation of Skp2 can stabilize p27(kip1). These results suggested that Emi1 participates in HCC cell proliferation and that progression is controlled by APC/C inhibition, which stabilized Skp2 and enabled p27(kip1) degradation. These findings provide a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC.
