Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) contributes to 14.8% of all cancer mortality in Egypt, which has a high prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV). We have previously shown alterations in the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor signalling pathway during experimental hepatocarcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine whether serum levels of IGF-1, IGF-2 and IGFBP-3 can be used to discriminate between HCC and the stages of hepatic dysfunction in patients with liver cirrhosis assessed by the Child-Pugh (CP) score, and to correlate these levels with HCC stages. We recruited 241 subjects to the present study; 79 with liver cirrhosis, 62 with HCV-induced HCC and 100 age-matched controls. Results showed that serum levels of IGF-1, IGF-2 and IGFBP-3 were reduced significantly in cirrhosis and HCC patients in comparison to the controls, and that this reduction negatively correlated with the CP scores. However, only IGFBP-3 levels showed significant negative correlation with Î±-fetoprotein levels. The reduction in IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 but not IGF-2 levels was significant in HCC in comparison to patients with cirrhosis. None of the parameters significantly correlated with the HCC stage. IGFBP-3 levels discriminated between cirrhosis and HCC at a sensitivity of 87%, a specificity of 80% and a cut-off value of
