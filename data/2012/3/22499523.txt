Golgi glycoprotein 73(GP73) is a transmembrane glycoprotein residing in the cis-Golgi complex, which is strongly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and secreted into the blood. It has been regarded as a promising serum tumor marker for the detection of HCC with higher sensitivity and specificity than AFP. GP73 is also significantly elevated in kidney cancer, prostate cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, esophageal cancer and seminomas; therefore, it would be helpful for the diagnosis of these diseases. However, the function of GP73 and the regulatory mechanism for its expression are unclear. In this article, the physical-chemical properties, the regulation of its expression, the relation with various cancers and the clinical applications of GP73 are reviewed.
