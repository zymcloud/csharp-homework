MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been linked to the molecular pathogenesis of many cancers. In this study, we found that miR-219-5p was significantly downregulated in 83 HCC tissues and three HCC cell lines, compared to their non-tumor counterparts. MiR-219-5p expression correlated with tumor size, histological differentiation, and overall survival time in HCC patients. We also found that miR-219-5p could inhibit cell proliferation in vitro and arrest cell cycle at the G1 to S transition. Further studies identified that miR-219-5p reduced both the mRNA and protein levels of glypican-3 (GPC3). These findings indicate that miR-219-5p exerts tumor-suppressive effects in hepatic carcinogenesis through negative regulation of GPC3 expression.
