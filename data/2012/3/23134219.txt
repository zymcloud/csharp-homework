Serum response factor (SRF) is a transcription factor of the MADS box family. To date, DNA binding sites for SRF [serum response elements (SREs)] have been found in the promoters of approximately 50 different genes known to be involved in the regulation cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Recent studies have indicated that SRF plays a role in the development of some tumors, including hepatocellular, thyroid, esophageal, and lung carcinomas. However, expression of SRF and its roles in gastric carcinoma are unclear. We found SRF to be highly expressed in human gastric carcinoma as well as ectopic or reduced expression for E-cadherin and Î²-catenin. Blockage of SRF expression was found to inhibit proliferation, invasion, and migration. We also found that an inhibitor (Y-27632) of Rho-associated coiled kinase (ROCK1), a regulator of actin cytoskeleton that regulates cell adhesion, migration, and motility, suppressed SRF expression as well. These results demonstrate that SRF is involved in the aggressive behavior of gastric carcinoma cells. We also found that the inhibition of ROCK1 by Y-27632 can inhibit the invasion and migration of gastric cells done at least, in part, by attenuating SRF expression.
