Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes acute and chronic hepatitis which can lead to HCC (Hepatocelluar carcinoma) via oxidative stress, steatosis, insulin resistance, fibrosis and liver cirrhosis. Apoptosis is essential for the control and eradication of viral infections. In acute HCV infection, enhanced hepatocyte apoptosis is significant for elimination of viral pathogen. In case of chronic HCV, down regulation of apoptosis and enhanced cell proliferation not only causes HCV infection persistency in the majority of patients. However, the impact of apoptosis in chronic HCV infection is not well understood. It may be harmful by triggering liver fibrosis, or essential in interferon (IFN) induced HCV elimination. Regulation of apoptosis in hepatocytes by HCV Core is so important in progression of HCC. This review focuses on the dual character of HCV Core on regulation of apoptosis and progression of HCC.
