Background:Aim of this work was to compare quality of life (QoL) of patients affected by HCC and submitted to hepatic resection (HR), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), or no treatment (NT).Methods:Patients affected by HCC between 2001 and 2009 were considered for this study. Gender, diabetes, hepatitis status, Child grade, tumor size, and recurrence were analyzed. QoL was assessed before treatment and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after, using a FACT-Hep questionnaire. P value was considered significant if Results:Fourteen patients (27.45%) were treated with HR, 15 patients (29.41%) underwent TACE, RFA was performed in 9 patients (17.65%), and 13 patients (25.49%) were not treated. Physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being and additional concerns 24 months after HR were significantly higher compared to all other treatments.Conclusions:Hepatic resection provides the best QoL at 24 months. RFA provides a worse QoL compared to HR, but a higher QoL compared to TACE or NT.
