Purpose:Cancer patients were generally excluded from the therapeutic guidelines of antiviral therapy. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of antiviral therapy in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection concomitant with malignancy other than hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Twenty-five HCV patients with curative malignancy other than HCC (group A) and 75 sex- and age-matched controls (group B) were recruited into a prospective and case-control analysis. All patients received peginterferon-alpha-2a (PegIFN-alpha-2a) and weight-based ribavirin according to the current treatment recommendations. The primary outcome measurement was sustained virological response (SVR). The safety issue between groups was also compared.Results:There were 22 (88.0 %) patients of group A and 59 (78.7 %) patients of group B who achieved an SVR (p = 0.39). The SVR rate was comparable between groups both in genotype-1 (HCV-1) (81.8 vs. 72.7 %, p = 0.70) and in genotype-2 (HCV-2) (92.9 vs. 83.3 %, p = 0.66) patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the achievement of a RVR (viral clearance during first 4 weeks of treatment) was the strongest predictor of an SVR (odds ratio/95 % confidence intervals [OR/CI]: 6.357/1.50 - 26.99, p = 0.01), followed by lower baseline viral loads (OR/CI: 0.403/0.174 - 0.936, p = 0.034) and higher dose of ribavirin exposure (OR/CI: 1.287/1.092 - 1.517, p = 0.003), whilst previous occurrence of cancer was not associated with SVR. Treatment adherence (76.0 vs. 72.0 %, p = 0.70) and the incidences of grade 3 or more adverse events (28.0 vs. 20.0 %, p = 0.40) were comparable between two groups.Conclusions:Chronic hepatitis C patients with non-HCC malignancies receiving peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy carried favorable efficacy and safety outcomes.
