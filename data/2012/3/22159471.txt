Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) have been shown to be involved in inflammation and carcinogenesis, and our previous study revealed that they were co-overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue and a positive correlation was found. Saikosaponin-d (SSD), a triterpene saponin extracted from Bupleurum falcatum L. (Umbelliferae), is known to exert inhibitory effects on COX-2 expression, together with inflammation and hepatic fibrosis. These findings prompted us to investigate the chemopreventive potential of SSD against hepatocarcinogenesis and its possible molecular mechanism in vivo. An experimental model with diethylinitrosamine (DEN)-treated Sprague Dawley rats was used in the present study. DEN (50 mg/kg body weight) and SSD (2 mg/kg body weight) were intraperitoneally injected weekly and daily, respectively. Administration of SSD alone had no side effects. The liver nodule formation, tumorous invasion to surrounding organs and increased cellular atypia induced by DEN were markedly reduced by SSD in the SSD + DEN group compared with the DEN group. On the other hand, immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that the expression of COX-2 and C/EBPβ proteins was significantly increased in tumor cells and macrophages of liver tissue from DEN-treated rats, whereas the expression of the two proteins was markedly lowered in the SSD + DEN group. Overall, our results suggest that SSD prevents DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rats through inhibition of C/EBPβ and COX-2, providing indispensable experimental evidence for the clinical application of SSD as a novel chemopreventive agent against HCC in the future.
