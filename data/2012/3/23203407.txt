Background:Presurgery serum osteopontin (OPN) level has been demonstrated to correlate to tumor recurrence and survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. This study investigated the postoperative dynamic changes of serum OPN level and its clinical significance in HCC patients.Methods:Presurgery serum OPN levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in cohort A of 179 HCC patients and were compared with the multiple controls including different kinds of liver diseases and healthy individuals. In cohort B of 110 patients with resectable HCCs, besides preoperative assays, serum OPN was monitored at 1 week, 1, and ≥2 months after operation.Results:The baseline presurgery serum OPN of HCC patients was significantly higher than that of the patients with the other kinds of liver diseases (p Conclusions:After a transient fluctuation, serum OPN levels significantly decrease after curative resection of HCCs. Postoperative serum OPN could serve as a surrogate serologic biomarker for monitoring treatment response and tumor recurrence after HCC resection, including α-fetoprotein-negative ones.
