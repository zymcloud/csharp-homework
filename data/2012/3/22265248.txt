Purpose:To determine whether nucleoside analogue therapy is associated with improved survival in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are treated solely with transarterial chemoembolization.Materials and methods:A retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with HBV-associated HCC was performed to identify patients treated solely with chemoembolization. Relevant demographic and clinical data were extracted and recorded. The influence of therapy with nucleoside analogues (lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, or entecavir) was determined by estimating the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method.Results:The inclusion criteria for chemoembolization were met by 81 patients (67 men and 14 women, mean age 60.6 years ± 9.2); 21 (25.9%) of these patients had been treated with nucleoside analogues. The number of chemoembolization treatments was significantly greater in the patients who were treated with nucleoside analogues (3.43 ± 2.32) than in the patients who did not receive nucleoside analogues (1.82 ± 0.95; P = .0022). The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates were 89.5%, 66.8%, and 40.5% in the patients treated with nucleoside analogues and 72.6%, 27.5%, and 14.3% in the patients not treated with nucleoside analogues. The survival rate was significantly higher in the patients who received nucleoside analogues (P = .0051). Nucleoside analogue intake was an independent factor that was associated with increased survival (P = .0063).Conclusions:Administration of nucleoside analogues was associated with longer survival in patients with HBV-associated HCC who were treated with transarterial chemoembolization.
