Genes associated with retinoid-interferon-induced mortality 19 (GRIM-19) was identified as a tumor suppressor protein associated with apoptosis and growth inhibition. Here, we report that the expression levels of GRIM-19 are significantly attenuated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with deteriorating differentiation states, hepatic capsule invasion and microvascular invasion, suggesting the potential role of GRIM-19 not only at the origin but also in the invasive progression of HCCs. To dissect the possible mechanisms by which GRIM-19 regulates tumor cell invasion, we established the hepatic HL-7702 and HCC Huh-7 cell lines stably depleted of GRIM-19. Results show that downregulation of GRIM-19 induces a morphological transformation resembling epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as aberrant expression of epithelial and mesenchymal molecular markers. Additionally, these cells lose contact inhibition, a phenomenon of cessation of cell migration in contact with neighboring cells, as assessed by cell imaging, growth curve and S-phase transition in confluent conditions.Conclusion:Our observations demonstrate a novel mechanistic insight into a critical role of GRIM-19 in HCC invasive potential.
