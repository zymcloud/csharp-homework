Objective:To construct recombinant lentiviral vectors carrying Rheb gene and its mutant Rheb'D60K gene, and examine their expression in human liver cancer cells.Methods:Rheb gene was amplified by PCR to construct the recombinant plasmid LV31-Rheb-WT and LV31-Rheb-D60K. HEK-293 FT cells were contransfected with the recombinant lentiviral vector together with a lentiviral package plasmid to produce the lentiviral particles. The expression of PS6 protein was detected in the lentivirus-infected MCF-7 cells. The apoptosis of SK-HEP-1 cells transfected with LV31-Rheb-WT or LV31-Rheb-D60K was observed.Results:The recombinant LV31-Rheb-WT and LV31-Rheb-D60K vectors were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. Western blotting showed that PS6 protein expression was increased in LV31-Rheb-WT-transfected cells while decreased in LV31-Rheb-D60K-transfected cells. LV31-Rheb-D60K-transfected SK-HEP-1 cells showed more obvious apoptosis after starvation than LV31-Rheb-WT-transfected cells.Conclusion:Lentiviral vectors carrying Rheb gene and its mutant has been successfully constructed, which can be useful in further investigation of the role of Rheb gene in cancer cells.
