Case history:A 13-year-old female spayed domestic shorthaired cat was examined because of lethargy, inappetance and weight loss.Clinical findings:No clinically significant haematological or biochemical abnormalities were detected, but an abdominal mass was palpated. Abdominal examination using ultrasonography revealed soft tissue masses in the cranial abdomen, involving the spleen, as well as the liver and abdominal wall; the pancreas was not identified. Despite supportive therapy the condition of the cat rapidly deteriorated and euthanasia was performed.Pathological findings:Cytological preparations from the cranial abdominal mass revealed a population of pleomorphic epithelial cells consistent with a squamous cell carcinoma. On post-mortem examination, firm creamy white to yellow nodular masses were present in the region of the pancreatic left limb, spleen, liver, diaphragm, right abdominal wall and in the left lung. Sections of all masses were examined histopathologically and demonstrated infiltration by neoplastic epithelial cells indicative of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).Diagnosis:Squamous cell carcinoma of presumed pancreatic duct origin.Clinical relevance:There are few reports of haematogenous or lymphatic metastasis of SCC in cats, and none reporting transcoelomic spread. This report describes the clinical and pathological features of a case of presumed primary pancreatic ductal SCC, and should alert veterinarians to the potential for metastasis and carcinomatosis.
