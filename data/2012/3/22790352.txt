Background:Perihepatic lymph node enlargement (PLNE) is a common ultrasound finding in chronic hepatitis C patients. Although PLNE is considered to reflect the inflammatory response to hepatitis C virus (HCV), its clinical significance remains unclear.Methods:Between December 2004 and June 2005, we enrolled 846 chronic hepatitis C patients in whom adequate ultrasound examinations had been performed. PLNE was defined as a perihepatic lymph node that was at least 1 cm in the longest axis by ultrasonography. We analyzed the clinical features of patients with PLNE and prospectively investigated the association between PLNE and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development.Results:We detected PLNE in 169 (20.0%) patients. Female sex, lower body mass index (BMI), and HCV serotype 1 were independently associated with the presence of PLNE. However, there were no significant differences in liver function tests, liver stiffness, and hepatitis C viral loads between patients with and without PLNE. During the follow-up period (mean 4.8 years), HCC developed in 121 patients. Unexpectedly, patients with PLNE revealed a significantly lower risk of HCC development than those without PLNE (p = 0.019, log rank test). Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of PLNE was an independent negative predictor of HCC development (hazard ratio 0.551, p = 0.042). In addition, the sustained viral response rate in patients who received interferon (IFN) therapy was significantly lower in patients with PLNE than in patients without PLNE.Conclusions:Patients with PLNE had a lower risk of HCC development than those without PLNE. This study may provide new insights into daily clinical practice and the pathophysiology of HCV-induced hepatitis and hepatocarcinogenesis.
