Objective:To study the immunologic function of dendritic cells (DCs) cultured in two kinds of hepatoma cell line's supernatant and the enhancing effects of carboxymethylpachymaran (CMP) on DCs.Methods:DCs were harvested after stimulation by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin (IL)-4 from umbilical cord blood using density-gradient centrifugation method. Cultured supernatant of two hepatoma cell lines (HepG2 and HepG2.2.15) were collected for condition medium (CM) according to a volume ratio of supernatant to incomplete RPMI-1640 medium, which was 3:1. CMP was dissolved in incomplete RPMI-1640 medium. Experimental groups were divided according to the culture medium, either CM or with CMP in it. DCs subsets CD83, CD86, CD1a, and d-related human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR) were analyzed by flow cytometry. The proliferation ability of allogeneic T cells in mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) stimulated by DCs was examined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) analysis. IL-12p70, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis.Results:The proliferation of lymphocytes and secreting level of IL-12 and expression of phenotype of DCs cultured in two kinds of CM were lower than those of normal group (P 0.05).Conclusions:Two kinds of hepatoma cell line's supernatant can inhibit the immunologic function of DCs. This suppressive effect may be related to the inhibition of NF-κB/Rel pathway. CMP may up-regulate the DCs function by activating the NF-κB/Rel pathway.
