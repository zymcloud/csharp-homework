Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are found to hold promise in wide range of applications due to their well-known unique properties. However, their applications in biomedicine are still limited by the relative cytotoxicity. In this study, we introduce the biocompatible gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) modified on MWCNTs, forming new stable nanocomposites: Au-MWCNTs. Further, we design a strategy to explore their drug delivery applications and anti-tumor effects by combining with daunorubicin (DNR), using human hepatocarcinoma cells (SMMC-7721 cells) as cancer cells model. Our results show better biocompatibility of Au-MWCNTs than that of MWCNTs. Moreover, compared with DNR treatment alone, when cells treated by Au-MWCNTs together with DNR, obviously increased DNR concentrations in SMMC-7721 cells and anticancer functions are found, which indicates that Au-MWCNTs could be well qualified for efficient delivery carrier importing anticancer agents like DNR into target cells. This strategy develops an avenue to lessen the toxic side-effect of delivery carrier and thus as the promising approach in relevant cancer therapy.
