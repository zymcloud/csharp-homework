Portal vein complications after liver transplantation (LT) can lead to graft liver failure. In this living donor liver transplantation case a stenosis developed in the right posterior branch of the portal vein of the graft liver from a living donor with type 2 portal vein variation. A 61-year-old woman diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma due to hepatitis B received a liver graft revealing a single lumen divided by a septum. The portal vein was anastomosed to the recipient portal vein without venoplasty. Postoperative Doppler sonogram revealed poor flow in the right posterior portal vein with compensatory arterial hyperperfusion. The postoperative computed tomography (CT) scan revealed narrowing of the proximal part of the right posterior portal vein with periportal tracking. Without intervention, the liver enzyme and bilirubin levels decreased to normal and the follow-up CT scan showed decreased periportal tracking. The patient was discharged without major complications. We believe that the posterior portal vein stenosis resulted from the direct anastomosis of the portal vein without a further venoplasty. Although there was no major complication due to the posterior portal vein stenosis in our patient, we suggest a venoplasty to prevent portal vein stenosis when using right lobe grafts with a type 2 portal vein, even if a single lumen is present and there is a margin for a direct anastomosis.
