Background:A high Model For End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score≥25 has been reported to be associated with increased posttransplant mortality and morbidity among patients undergoing living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). We reviewed the results of patients undergoing LDLT at our transplant center for decompensated cirrhosis to determine whether a high MELD impacted posttransplant survival.Methods:From April 2002 to May 2011, 86-176 patients (49%) who underwent LDLT at our center had the indication of decompensated cirrhosis without hepatocellular carcinoma. Data were expressed in mean values±standard error of the means (range). Patients survival rates were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method.Results:Among the 86 patients with decompensated cirrhosis: Age was 49±2 (1-68) years and 60 (70%) were of male gender. The causes in 25 (29%) were hepatitis B and 25 (29%) hepatitis C as well as one each for hepatitis B/C and B/D coinfections: 9 (10%), alcoholic cirrhosis. MELD score was 18±1 (range=6-40). In hospital mortality was 6/86 (7%). At 1152±95 (range=7-3317) days posttransplant follow-up 64 (74%) were alive with 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of 84%, 70%, and 70%, respectively. MELD scores did not differ between those who survived and those who died (17.5±8.0 versus 17.8±8.4). No difference was noted in those with MELDConclusion:A high MELD score had no impact on posttransplant survival among cirrhotic patients undergoing LDLT. It should be considered to be an urgent indication rather than a contraindication to LDLT.
