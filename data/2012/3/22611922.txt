Objective:The effect of serum from rats supplemented with selenium and zinc on the proliferation of human esophageal cancer cell line Eca109 was observed by serophysiology.Methods:Rats were randomly divided into seven groups. Eight rats in each group were fed with basic feeds (deprived of both selenium and zinc). The experimental rat groups were supplemented with selenium or zinc at low or high dosage intragastrically for 30 days Serum selenium and zinc content of rats was measured by Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (GFAAS) and Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (FAAS). MTT assay,3H-TDR incorporation and flow cytometry were used to explore the effect of serum from different rat groups on the growth and proliferation of cancer cell line Ecal09 cells.Results:(1) The content of serum zinc in the high zinc group was the highest and the content of serum zinc was the lowest in basic diet group. The content of serum selenium in high selenium and high zinc group was the highest and the content of serum selenium was the lowest in the basic diet group. (2) In comparing the growth of control cancer cell group cultured with calf serum, the growth of cancer cells cultured with the serum from high selenium and high zinc rats was inhibited in culturing for 72 h, but the growth of normal liver cells were also inhibited. The growth of cancer cells were promoted by serum from other groups. (3) Both MTT assay and 3H-TDR incorporation test showed that the DNA synthesis in cancer cells was inhibited by the serum from high selenium and high zinc group, but the DNA synthesis of normal liver cells was also inhibited by this type of serum. The result of DNA synthesis in other cell groups was closed to the control group.Conclusions:Low serum selenium and zinc might promote the growth of EC cell. Elevating the content of serum selenium and zinc by increasing selenium and zinc intake might inhibit EC cell proliferation.
