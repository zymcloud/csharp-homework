Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies, yet there have been no significant advances in effective therapeutics. In this study, HS-111 was synthesized as a novel thiazolamine derivative, N-(5-(2-chlorobenzyl) thiazole-2-yl) benzofuran-2-carboxamide, and its anticancer effect and mechanism were examined in human HCC cells. HS-111 strongly suppressed the growth of HCC cells in a dose-dependent manner. Also, apoptosis by HS-111 was identified by DAPI and TUNEL staining, and the increases of the cleaved caspase-3 were observed. In addition, HS-111 decreased protein expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1Î±) and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and inhibited tube formation and the migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). These results showed that HS-111 not only inhibited cell growth and angiogenesis, but also induced apoptosis of human HCC cells. We suggest that HS-111 may be a potential candidate for chemotherapy against HCC.
