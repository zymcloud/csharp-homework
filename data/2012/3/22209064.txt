Background:Intraoperative blood loss is an important factor contributing to morbidity and mortality in liver surgery. To address this we developed a bipolar radiofrequency (RF) device, the Habib 4X, used specifically for hepatic parenchymal transection. The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the peri-operative data using this technique.Methods:Between 2001 and 2010, 604 consecutive patients underwent liver resections with the RF assisted technique. Clinico-pathological and outcome data were collected and analysed.Results:There were 206 major and 398 minor hepatectomies. Median intraoperative blood loss was 155 (range 0-4300)ml, with a 12.6% rate of transfusion. There were 142 patients (23.5%) with postoperative complications; none had bleeding from the resection margin. Only one patient developed liver failure and the mortality rate was 1.8%.Conclusions:RF assisted liver resection allows major and minor hepatectomies to be performed with minimal blood loss, low blood transfusion requirements, and reduced mortality and morbidity rates.
