Objective:Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) exceeding the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) criteria are normally rejected for cadaveric liver transplants. However, whether they should be allowed to undergo living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has been controversial. We reviewed the outcome of patients with advanced HCC who underwent LDLT at our center.Methods:From April 2002 to May 2011, 176 patients underwent LDLT at our center; of these, 77 (44%) had HCC at the explant liver. Patient overall survival and recurrence-free survival (RFS) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was performed by Cox analysis.Results:Age was 56±1 (56, 29-71) years; 62 (80.5%) were male; Model for End-stage Liver Disease Score was 11±1 (9, 6-36), alpha fetoprotein (AFP) was 3683±2019 (69, 3-139,591) ng/L; maximum tumor size was 4.5 (0.5-15) cm. Number or tumor nodules was 5 (1-10), and 32 (42%) had macrovascular invasion diagnosed pretransplant. Eleven (14%) were within UCSF criteria. After follow-up of 953±90 (744, 2-2989) days, 53 (69%) were alive and 48 (62%) were recurrence-free. One-, 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were 80%, 70%, and 57% and 80%, 65%, and 48%, respectively. Five-year OS and RFS for those within UCSF criteria were both 78% versus 55% and 46% outside UCSF criteria (P=not significant). At multivariate analysis, high AFP, younger age, and macrovascular invasion were associated with both poor RFS.Conclusion:In HCC patients exceeding UCSF criteria, a reasonable 5-year overall survival of 55% post-LDLT can be obtained. Patients with HCC exceeding the UCSF criteria, especially in the older age group with no portal vein invasion and lower AFP level, should be actively considered for LDLT.
