Coronin-1C is an important F-actin binding protein which is critical for cell motility. Furthermore, the expression of this protein was found to be increased in diffuse tumors and was correlated with the degree of tumor malignancy. However, the mechanism(s) through which this protein enhances malignancy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poorly understood. In this study, we found that Coronin-1C was overexpressed in human HCC tissues compared with the adjacent non-tumor tissues. Overexpression of Coronin-1C enhanced the cell migration in the human HCC cell line BEL-7402, whereas suppressed cell migration and proliferation were observed in Coronin-1C-knockdown BEL-7402 cells together with impaired cell polarity, disrupted cytoskeleton and decreased Rac-1 activation. Moreover, the Coronin-1C knockdown cells displayed a lower degree of malignancy by inducing smaller tumors in nude mice. Thus, we demonstrated a relationship between Coronin-1C overexpression and human HCC growth through enhancement of tumor cell proliferation and migration, which are correlated with Rac-1 activation.
