Hepatic artery (HA) occlusion is a sinister complication after liver transplantation. It frequently leads to graft loss if untreated. Urgent arterial reconstruction with thrombectomy may reduce the need for retransplantation. Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) offers further challenges due to smaller-caliber vessels, shorter vascular stumps, and occasional multiple HA. Alternatives to the HA are needed when the native HA cannot be used or when HA complications develop. We describe the use of the recipient's ileocolic artery as an alternate HA in adult LDLT. Graft revascularization and timely salvage resulted in good patient recovery. A 6-month computed tomography angiography follow-up showed patency of the alternate vessels reconstructed.
