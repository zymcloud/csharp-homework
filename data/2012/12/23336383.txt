Objective:To assess the efficacy and safety of percutaneous cryoablation (PCC) and (125)I seed implantation combined with chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer.Methods:Sixty-seven patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (6 in stage III, 61 in stage IV) received PCC and (125)I seed implantation combined with concomitant gemcitabine hydrochloride and DDP chemotherapy. The clinical benefit response (CBR), survival rate and therapy-related complications were assessed.Results:All patients except one were followed up over 1 year. The 6-month and 1-year survival rates were 84.8% and 33.4%, respectively. The median progression free survival were 6.3 months and 5.5 months in the group stage III and group stage IV (P > 0.05), respectively, while the overall survival was 9.1 months in the group stage III and 11.0 months in the group stage IV (P > 0.05). CR,PR and SD were achieved in 5, 8, 54 patients, respectively. Fifty-four and 50 in the 67 patients experienced a ≥ 50% reduction of pain score and analgesic consumption, respectively, 18 patients experienced a ≥ 2 kg weight gaining, and KPS was increasing from 71.2 ± 0.4 to (90.0 ± 0.3, P < 0.05), the overall benefit rate was 80.6%. No serious therapy-related complications except pancreatic fistula accompanied abdominal hemorrhage, bile leakage, acute pancreatitis and needle track seeding in 1, 1, 2 and 1 case, respectively.Conclusion:Percutaneous cryoablation and (125)I seed implantation combined with chemotherapy are effective and safe for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.
