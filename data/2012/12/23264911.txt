Genetic studies were performed in a French series of hepatocellular carcinomas. New oncogenes (NFE2L2) and tumor suppressor genes (IRF2, ARID1A and RPS6K3) were found to be recurrently altered. Moreover, a genotoxic signature was identified, raising the possible implication of a genotoxic exposure in the etiology of HCC, which remains to be characterized.
