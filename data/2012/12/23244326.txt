Glypican-3 (GPC3) has been reported as a novel serum and histochemical marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by several groups. As an oncofetal protein, it is expressed abundantly in the fetal liver, inactive in the normal adult liver, and frequently reactivated in HCC. Immunology reagents are urgently needed to proceed with mechanism-related research, clinical validation, and application. In this report, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against GPC3 were made from hyperimmune BALB/c mice by injecting 100 Î¼g of purified antigen intraperitoneally. Hybridomas were screened by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using purified protein. Finally 13 mouse hybridomas producing MAbs to GPC3 were established. The MAbs obtained were fully characterized using Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. The results showed that these antibodies could be used for preliminary application of the next step mechanism-related research and GPC3 expression level analysis.
