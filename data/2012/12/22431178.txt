Expression of phenotype markers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) in HCC and CC components of 20 combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinomas (CHCs) of the liver was investigated immunohistochemically. Both HCC and CC components of all CHCs expressed at least one of the CC phenotype markers [cytokeratin (CK)-7, CK-19, and carbohydrate (CA) 19-9]. HCC components in 90% of CHCs and CC components in 95% of CHCs expressed at least one of these CC phenotype markers in more than 40% of cancer cells. HCC components in all CHCs expressed at least one of the HCC phenotype markers [hepatocyte antigen (HA), Î±-fetoprotein (AFP), and canalicular carcinoembryonic antigen]. HCC components in 90% of CHCs and CC components in 75% of CHCs expressed HA, AFP, or both. HCC components in 75% of CHCs and CC components in 60% of CHCs expressed HA, AFP, or both in more than 10% of cancer cells. The present results show that both HCC and CC components of most of the CHCs expressed both HCC and CC phenotypes, supporting the hypothesis that CHC originates from a hepatic progenitor cell capable of differentiating into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes.
