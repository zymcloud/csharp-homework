A nationwide survey in Japan revealed that about 6 % of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients are coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). To further analyze the features of liver disease in HIV/HBV-coinfected patients, we analyzed 252 patients from six hospitals in the HIV/AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) Network of Japan. The mean age was 39.5 years, and the proportion of male patients was very high (243 of 252; 96 %). The main transmission route was male homosexual contact (186 of 252; 74 %), followed by heterosexual contact. The HBV genotype was determined in 77 patients. Among them, genotype A HBV was the most frequent (58 of 77; 75 %) and was detected almost exclusively in homosexual patients. Acute hepatitis B was documented in 21 patients (8 %). Three of the 252 HIV/HBV-coinfected patients developed advanced liver disease with the complication of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or hepatocellular carcinoma. A comparison between patients not treated and those treated with antiretroviral drugs including anti-HBV drugs revealed that the baseline liver function was worse in treated patients. However, the serum albumin levels and platelet counts in both groups increased after treatment and were similar. Liver disease-associated death was not observed. Here, we characterize the clinical features of liver disease in HIV/HBV-coinfected patients in Japan for the first time. The findings suggest that antiretroviral therapy with anti-HBV drugs may retard the progression of a liver disease and prevent liver disease-associated death in such patients.
