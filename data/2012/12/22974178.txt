Objective:This study evaluated the role of the micronucleus (MN) in liver fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology.Methods:Histological features of 75 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), of which 25 were well differentiated, 37 moderately differentiated and 13 poorly differentiated, and 58 benign hepatic lesions (total, 133 cases) were correlated with MN expression observed in FNA smears reported as benign (n =40), atypical (n = 14), suspicious (n = 30) and malignant (n =49).Results:Stepwise increases in the MN score (0.4 ± 0.6, 1.2 ± 1.3, 6.3 ± 4.2 and 14.8 ± 8.8) correlated with the degree of cytological abnormality: benign, atypia, suspicious and malignant, respectively. The mean MN scores for well-, moderately and poorly differentiated HCC were 5.4 ± 2.2, 11.5 ± 4.5 and 24.9 ± 9.1, respectively, which was significantly different between malignant and suspicious (P Conclusions:The MN score is an effective HCC biomarker and has a good potential use as an ancillary tool for diagnosing HCC using FNA cytology.
