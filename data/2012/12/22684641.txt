RPS6KB1 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70 kDa, polypeptide 1) plays a key role in regulating protein translation. The role of RPS6KB1 in HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) has not been fully investigated. This study was undertaken to determine the clinicopathological features and prognostic value of RPS6KB1 in HCC. We examined RPS6KB1 expression in 30 paired liver cancer tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues by reverse transcription real-time PCR and Western blotting. In addition, we analyzed RPS6KB1 expression in 87 HCC samples by immunohistochemistry. The expression of RPS6KB1 was significantly increased in cancer tissues. Clinicopathological analysis showed that the expression of RPS6KB1 was significantly correlated with tumor size, histopathologic classifications, and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that increased expression of RPS6KB1 correlated with poor prognosis of HCC patients. RPS6KB1 expression was an independent prognostic marker for overall survival of HCC patients by multivariate analysis. Our data suggest that RPS6KB1 may play an important role in the progression of HCC and could serve as a potential molecular target for HCC therapy.
