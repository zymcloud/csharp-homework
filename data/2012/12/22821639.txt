Liver transplantation (LT) is a curative modality for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially in patients with cirrhosis. However, there are still risks of recurrence. C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute-phase inflammatory reactant that is synthesized by hepatocytes, has been related to the prognosis of various malignancies, including HCC. In this study, we investigated the role of a high CRP level in predicting the posttransplant outcomes of HCC patients. We analyzed 85 patients undergoing LT between August 2000 and July 2010 whose pretransplant serum CRP levels were available. Only 2 patients underwent deceased donor LT, and the remaining patients underwent living donor LT. With 1 mg/dL used as a cutoff value, 27 patients showed high CRP levels (â‰¥1 mg/dL) at the time of LT, and 58 showed low CRP levels (
