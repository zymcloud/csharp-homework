The most effective regimen for relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who do not achieve complete remission (CR) after a course of salvage therapy has not been established. We evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of fludarabine and cytarabine in patients with AML in first relapse who did not respond to a course of salvage chemotherapy with mitoxantrone and etoposide. CR was achieved in 39 % of treated patients, and in 47 % of patients with a favorable/intermediate-risk karyotype. The median overall survival was 4.75 months. The median survival for patients achieving CR with fludarabine-cytarabine was significantly higher than for those who did not respond to therapy (9.6 vs. 4.5 months, P = 0.04). Our data suggest that the fludarabine-cytarabine regimen merits further investigation in relapsed AML patients with favorable or intermediate-risk karyotype with persistent leukemia after a course of salvage therapy.
