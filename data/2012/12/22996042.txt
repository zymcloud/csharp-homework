Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common primary malignant liver tumor, is the third leading cause of cancer deaths. The pathogenesis of HCC is closely associated with chronic liver inflammation fired by a variety of stimulates such as virus infection and metabolic stress. Recent work indicates that autophagy, a homeostatic self-degradation process, which decides cell survival or death upon stress, acts as an effector machinery of immune systems in defending microbial invasion and carcinogenesis. SQSTM1 is a selective target and receptor of autophagy, and the protein content of SQSTM1 reflects the level of autophagic flux in cells. Through degrading SQSTM1, decreasing SQSTM1 aggregates, and therefore interrupting the positive feedback between SQSTM1 aggregates and ROS production, autophagy plays a protective role against hepatocellular carcinoma. Indeed, our studies indicate that toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-mediated immune activities in the genotoxic carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-injured liver tissue provide essential nutrient stimulates to induce intracellular senescence, which can ensure the activation and maturation of autophagy in liver cells. Loss of TLR2-mediated immune activity and senescence leads to the attenuation of autophagic flux, which cannot eliminate SQSTM1 aggregates, ROS accumulation, and DNA damage, and facilitates the development and progression of HCC.
