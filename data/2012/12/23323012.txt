Aim:To improve the outcome of orthotopic transplantation in a mouse model, we used an absorbable gelatin sponge (AGS) in nude mice to establish an orthotopic implantation tumor model.Methods:MHCC-97L hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells stably expressing the luciferase gene were injected into the subcutaneous region of nude mice. One week later, the ectopic tumors were harvested and transplanted into the left liver lobe of nude mice. The AGS was used to establish the nude mouse orthotopic implantation tumor model. The tumor suppressor gene, paired box gene 5 (PAX5), which is a tumor suppressor in HCC, was transfected into HCC cells to validate the model. Tumor growth was measured by bioluminescence imaging technology. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and histopathology were used to confirm the tumorigenicity of the implanted tumor from the MHCC-97L cell line.Results:We successfully developed an orthotopic transplantation tumor model in nude mice with the use of an AGS. The success rate of tumor transplantation was improved from 60% in the control group to 100% in the experimental group using AGS. The detection of fluorescent signals showed that tumors grew in all live nude mice. The mice were divided into 3 groups: AGS-, AGS+/PAX5- and AGS+/PAX5+. Tumor size was significantly smaller in PAX5 transfected nude mice compared to control mice (P Conclusion:Using an AGS is a convenient and efficient way of establishing an indirect orthotopic liver transplantation tumor model with a high success rate.
