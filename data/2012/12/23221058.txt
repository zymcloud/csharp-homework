A 37-year-old man underwent lobectomy of the right liver for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) producing hepatocellular carcinoma accompanying type B hepatitis. Within two months after the surgery, lung metastases were revealed and administration of sorafenib was begun, however, the lung metastases continued to enlarge. Changing the patient's medication to tegafur-uracil provided remarkable reduction of the lung metastases. The patient is alive two years after diagnosis and receives outpatient chemotherapy. We concluded that this case is valuable with regard to the extreme rarity of G-CSF producing hepatocellular carcinoma and its successful treatment in this case.
