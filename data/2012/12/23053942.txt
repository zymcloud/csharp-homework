The results from the published studies on the association between glutathione S-transferases (GST) gene polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Asian population are still conflicting. GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 are the mainly mutant sites reported at present. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between GST gene polymorphism and HCC risk in Asians. Association studies were identified from the databases of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and CBM-disc (China Biological Medicine Database) on February 1, 2012, and eligible investigations were synthesized using meta-analysis method. Results were expressed with odds ratios (OR) for dichotomous data, and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were also calculated. Twenty-five investigations were identified for the analysis of association between polymorphic deletion of GSTM1 and HCC, consisting of 3,547 patients with HCC and 6,132 controls. There was a marked association between GSTM1 null genotype and HCC susceptibility (OR 1.48, 95 % CI 1.19-1.85, P = 0.0004). GSTM1 null genotype was associated with HCC risk in Chinese. Furthermore, null genotype of GSTT1 was associated with HCC susceptibility in Asians. For the GSTM1-GSTT1 interaction analysis, the dual null genotype of GSTM1/GSTT1 was significantly associated with HCC susceptibility in Asian population. However, GSTP1 ile105 val gene polymorphism was not associated with HCC risk in Asian population. In conclusion, GSTM1/GSTT1 null genotype is associated with the HCC susceptibility. However, GSTP1 gene polymorphism is not associated with HCC risk.
