Aims:Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) has characteristic histological features which may not be seen in needle biopsy specimens. We investigate the diagnostic role of glutamine synthetase (GS) in needle biopsy specimens.Methods:Sixty-one hepatic tumours were categorised into 20 'definite' FNHs, 13 'probable' FNHs, and 28 cases without specific diagnosis. Needle biopsy specimens of 92 non-tumourous lesions, 25 well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (WDHCCs), and 4 high-grade dysplastic nodules (HGDNs) and resection specimens of 10 macroregenerative nodules were also selected for immunohistochemical stain of GS for comparison.Results:All 20 'definite' FNHs, nine 'probable' FNHs, and five cases without specific diagnosis expressed typical map-like staining pattern of GS. The demographic data of these five cases were similar to those of FNH. All cases of chronic hepatitis B and C, cirrhosis, macroregenerative nodule and peritumourous liver tissue showed normal pericentral/periseptal pattern. Fifteen of 25 WDHCCs and one HGDN showed diffuse pattern. Ten WDHCCs and two HGDNs showed negative staining. One HGDN showed mosaic pattern.Conclusions:Immunohistochemical staining of GS increases the diagnostic sensitivity of FNH in needle biopsy, especially in those without typical morphology. It also helps in differentiating FNH from other tumourous and non-tumourous lesions.
