Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy is an effective locoregional anticancer treatment for liver cancer patients. Serum biomarkers involved in immunogenic cell death may be valuable for early predicting therapy response and estimating prognosis. Sera of 50 prospectively and consecutively included hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, undergoing TACE therapy, were taken before and 24 h after TACE application. In these samples, soluble biomarkers involved in immunogenic cell death, and among them, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), soluble receptor of advanced glycation end products (sRAGE), and DNase activity were measured. They were compared with radiological response to therapy. A total of 71 TACE therapies were evaluated, of which 32 were classified as "no progression," and 39, as "progression." While HMGB1 levels increased already 24 h after TACE, there was an early decrease of sRAGE and DNase activity. Pretherapeutic and 24-h values of sRAGE were significantly higher in the no progression group than those in the progression group. There was no difference with respect to treatment response for DNase and HMGB1. Soluble RAGE is a new parameter with predictive relevance in primary liver cancer patients undergoing TACE therapy.
