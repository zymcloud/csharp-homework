Glycogenotic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with glycogen-ground-glass hepatocytes has recently been described as an allegedly "novel variant" of HCC, but neither the historical background nor the heuristic relevance of this observation were put in perspective. In the present contribution, the most important findings in animal models and human beings related to the emergence and further evolution of excessively glycogen storing (glycogenotic) hepatocytes with and without ground glass features during neoplastic development have been summarized. Glycogenotic HCCs with glycogen-ground-glass hepatocytes represent highly differentiated neoplasms which contain subpopulations of cells phenotypically resembling those of certain types of preneoplastic hepatic foci and benign hepatocellular neoplasms. It is questionable whether the occurrence of glycogen-ground-glass hepatocytes in a glycogenotic HCC justifies its classification as a specific entity. The typical appearance of ground-glass hepatocytes is due to a hypertrophy of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which is usually associated with an excessive storage of glycogen and frequently also with an expression of the hepatitis B surface antigen. Sequential studies in animal models and observations in humans indicate that glycogen-ground-glass hepatocytes are a facultative, integral part of a characteristic cellular sequence commencing with focal hepatic glycogenosis potentially progressing to benign and malignant neoplasms. During this process highly differentiated glycogenotic cells including ground-glass hepatocytes are gradually transformed via various intermediate stages into poorly differentiated glycogen-poor, basophilic (ribosome-rich) cancer cells. Histochemical, microbiochemical, and molecular biochemical studies on focal hepatic glycogenosis and advanced preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions in tissue sections and laser-dissected specimens in rat and mouse models have provided compelling evidence for an early insulinomimetic effect of oncogenic agents, which is followed by a fundamental metabolic switch from gluconeogenesis towards the pentose-phosphate pathway and the Warburg type of glycolysis during progression from preneoplastic hepatic glycogenosis to the highly proliferative malignant phenotype.
