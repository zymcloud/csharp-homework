Background:Olive oil intake has been shown to induce beneficial effect on health. This study aimed to investigate the effects of olive oil polyphenol hydroxytyrosol (HT) on cell proliferation and its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity in human hepatoma Hep3B and HepG2 cell lines.Materials and methods:Cell growth after HT treatment was measured by 3-(4,5 di-methylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test. Lipogenic enzyme activity was evaluated by radiochemical assay. Cell total antioxidant activity and cell interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were measured by enyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods.Results:HT caused an evident antiproliferative effect mediated by inhibition of lipogenic enzymes. Moreover, HT induced activation of the cell antioxidant system and reduced cellular IL-6 levels.Conclusion:Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms of action of HT in the context of inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and prevention of oxidative stress in human hepatoma cells. Our results also show a down-regulation of lipogenic enzymes involved in cell proliferation.
