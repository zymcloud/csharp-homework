The development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is often associated with chronic inflammation, suggesting a strong relationship between inflammation and carcinogenesis. This study evaluated the prognostic values of inflammatory and T-helper (Th) cytokines in the clinical outcome and survival of HCC. The study included 110 patients with HCC undergoing loco-regional therapy and 24 healthy controls. Five Th1/Th2 cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP) were quantified before and after loco-regional treatment, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Levels of CRP, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-6 were higher in patients with HCC than those in healthy subjects. Tumor characteristics, Child-Pugh class, and CRP, IL-6, and IL-10 levels were associated with HCC survival (all P
