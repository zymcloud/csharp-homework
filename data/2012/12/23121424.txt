Liver is subject to various chronic pathologies, progressively leading to cirrhosis, which is associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. There is an urgent need for diagnostic and prognostic markers of chronic liver diseases and liver cancer. Spectroscopy-based approaches can provide an overview of the chemical composition of a tissue sample offering the possibility of investigating in depth the subtle chemical changes associated with pathological states. In this study, we have addressed the composition of cirrhotic liver tissue by combining synchrotron Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy and synchrotron micro-X-ray fluorescence (XRF) on the same tissue section using a single sample holder in copper. This allowed investigation of the in situ biochemical as well as elemental composition of cells and tissues at high spatial resolution. Cirrhosis is characterized by regeneration nodules surrounded by annular fibrosis. Hepatocytes within cirrhotic nodules were characterized by high content in esters and sugars as well as in phosphorus and iron compared with fibrotic septa. A high heterogeneity was observed between cirrhotic nodules in their content in sugars and iron. On fibrosis, synchrotron XRF revealed enrichment in calcium compared to cirrhotic hepatocytes. Careful scrutiny of tissue sections led to detection of the presence of microcrystals that were demonstrated as precipitates of calcite using synchrotron FTIR. These results demonstrated that synchrotron FTIR and synchrotron XRF microspectroscopies provide complementary information on the chemical composition of cirrhotic hepatocytes and fibrotic septa in cirrhosis.
