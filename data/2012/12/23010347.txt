Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer mortality. Metastasis is the major concern that causes death in HCC. The goal of this study was to identify tumor-derived proteins in serum during HCC metastasis using an orthotopic xenograft tumor model and explore the role of key protein in HCC metastasis. Serum samples collected from HCCLM3-R metastatic HCC tumor model at specific stages of metastasis (1 wk, 3 wks and 6 wks) were subjected to iTRAQ labeling followed by 2DLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. Twenty tumor-derived proteins were identified through human specific peptides. Secretory clusterin (sCLU), which was significantly upregulated during cancer progression and metastasis, was chosen for further study. The expression of sCLU was significantly higher in metastatic HCC cell lines and samples from metastatic HCC patients. ShRNA-mediated down-regulation of sCLU resulted in a reduced migratory capacity in HCC cell lines, as well as a reduction in pulmonary metastasis in vivo. Overexpression of sCLU in HepG2 cell line showed increased cell migratory ability. Further study found that sCLU contributed to HCC migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro, and metastasis in vivo. In addition, sCLU also plays an important role in the regulation of TGF-Î²1-smad3 signaling. These findings suggest that sCLU may promote HCC metastasis via the induction of EMT process and may be a candidate target for HCC therapy.
