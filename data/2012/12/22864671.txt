HOXA1 overexpression is sufficient for malignant transformation of nontumorigenic epithelial cells. It is known that HOXA1, which was upregulated in squamous cell carcinomas, affects both cell growth and death. The forced expression of HOXA1 in human breast cancer cells results in increased cell growth activity. However, it has not been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we used immunohistochemistry to compare HOXA1 protein expression in HCC and normal liver tissues and further analyzed HOXA1 protein expression in 156 clinicopathologically characterized HCC cases. We stably knocked down the endogenous expression level of HOXA1 in HepG2 cells with specific shRNA-expressing lentiviral vector. Following the successful establishment of stable cells, we examined in vitro cell growth by the MTT assay, anchorage-independent growth through a soft agar colony formation assay and cell migration/invasion by transwell and Boyden chamber assay. In addition, we also investigated in vivo tumor growth by xenograft transplantation of HepG2 cells into nude mice. Our results showed that the protein expression level of HOXA1 was markedly higher in HCC tissues than that in normal liver tissue (P = 0.019). In addition, a high expression level of HOXA1 protein was positively correlated with the T classification (P
