Background:In patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma, photodynamic therapy (PDT) with porfimer sodium promotes biliary drainage and may improve survival and quality of life.Aim:To prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of PDT in patients with locally advanced biliary tract carcinoma.Methods:Eligible patients had unresectable, histologically confirmed disease, a Karnofsky performance status of â‰¥30% and life expectancy >12 weeks. Patients received 2mg/kg i.v. of porfimer sodium, followed by endobiliary laser activation and stent replacement 48 h later. Patients were assessed clinically and radiologically before treatment and on day 28, and followed up thereafter at three-monthly intervals until death.Results:36 patients were entered over an 18 months period: 14 males, 22 females, with a median age of 65 (30-79)yr and performance status of 80 (50-100). PDT was technically successful in all cases and was generally well tolerated; there was no grade 4 toxicity and no treatment-associated mortality. The median survival was 12 (1-84) months.Conclusions:Porfimer sodium PDT can be delivered safely to patients with biliary tract cancer and is suitable for testing in phase III studies (UKCRN ID 1218).
