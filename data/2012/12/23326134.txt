Aim:To investigate the growth-inhibiting and apoptosis-inducing effects of the gene MOB2 on human hepatic carcinoma cell line SMMC-7721.Methods:The full-length cDNA of the MOB2 gene was amplified from human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The correct full-length MOB2 cDNA was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-C1. After lipofection of the MOB2 gene into cancer cells, the levels of MOB2 protein in the cancer cells were detected by immunoblotting. To transfect the recombined plasmid vector pEGFP-CI-MOB2 into SMMC-7721 cells, the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium with 10% fetal calf serum and glutamine, and then mixed with liposomes, Lipofectamine 2000 and the plasmid vector pEGFP-CI-MOB2.Results:We observed the growth and proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells containing pEGFP-CI-MOB2 and analyzed their apoptosis and growth cycle phases by flow cytometry. We successfully transfected the recombined plasmid vector pEGFP-CI-MOB2 into SMMC-7721 cells and screened for a single clone cell containing MOB2. After transfection, MOB2 enhanced growth suppression, induced apoptosis, increased the ratio of G0/G1, significantly inhibited the advance of cell cycle phase, and arrested cells in G0/G1 phase.Conclusion:MOB2 overexpression induces apoptosis and inhibits the growth of human hepatic cancer cells, which may be useful in gene therapy for hepatic carcinoma.
