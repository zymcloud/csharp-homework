Objective:To compare the efficacies of portal vein stenting and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined therapy performed with or without endovascular implantation of iodine-125 (125I) seeds strand in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and main portal vein tumor thrombus (MPVTT).Methods:One-hundred-and-six patients with HCC complicated by MPVTT who were treated with portal vein stents and TACE, either with (Group A, n=56) or without (Group B, n=50) endovascular implantation of 125I seeds strand, between July 2005 and April 2011, were retrospectively analyzed. Overall survival, stent patency, and procedure-related adverse events were compared between the two groups.Results:The technical success rate was 100% for placement of 125I seeds strands and stents in the obstructed main portal vein. No serious procedure-related adverse events were recorded. Group A had significantly higher median survival (335 days vs. group B: 146 days; P=0.001, hazard ratio (HR)=2.244). Additionally, group A had significantly higher median stent patency (400 days vs. group B: 190 days; P=0.005, HR=2.479).Conclusion:The combination therapeutic strategy of portal vein stenting and TACE with endovascular implantation of 125I seeds strands improves the survival of HCC patients with MPVTT complication.
