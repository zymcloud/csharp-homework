Aims:Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to be a key driving force for angiogenesis and tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). As an emerging approach to block this angiogenic stimulator, the RNA interference (RNAi) technique has rapidly developed but is hindered for in vivo applications due to low cellular uptake and poor stability of small RNA. Based on low molecular weight chitosan (LMWC), a gene delivery system of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against VEGF was constructed. The objective of this study was to investigate whether LMWC/shRNA nano-complexes can effectively inhibit VEGF expression in cancer cells and tumor tissues and suppress tumor growth in different HCC models.Main methods:The transfection experiment and Real-time qPCR assay were used to evaluate the transfection efficiency and gene suppression activity of LMWC/shRNA complexes in Hepa 1-6 murine hepatocarcinoma cells. The therapeutic effect of LMWC/ VEGF shRNA was further tested in ectopic and orthotopic liver cancer models.Key findings:LMWC/VEGF shRNA complexes significantly inhibited VEGF expression of HCC cells and liver tumor tissues. LMWC obviously enhanced and prolonged the deposition of shRNA at the tumor site when LMWC/shRNA complexes were intravenously injected into orthotopic allograft liver tumor-bearing mice. The administration of LMWC/VEGF shRNA complexes by intratumoral or intravenous injection demonstrated more effective suppression of tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth in different HCC models compared with naked shRNA.Significance:This study demonstrated the feasibility of using LMWC as a potential carrier for RNA interference drugs in liver cancer therapy.
