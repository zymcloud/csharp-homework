We aimed to compare the survival benefit of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with conservative treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT), furthermore, to reveal which PVTT types benefit from TACE treatment. From August 2007 to January 2010, a prospective controlled study was performed on consecutive patients with advanced HCC and PVTT. Of a total of 150 patients, 115 were treated with TACE (lipiodol and anticancer agents Â± gelatin sponge embolization), and 35 who refused to accept the procedure were treated with conservative treatment. We performed survival analysis of the two treatment groups and then stratified by a new classification of PVTT that was divided into four types. Overall survival was significantly better in the TACE group than in the conservative group (8.67 months vs. 1.4 months, P
