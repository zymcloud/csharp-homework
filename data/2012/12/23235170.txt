The safety and efficacy of miriplatin-lipiodol suspension were investigated in 174 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). We assessed 29 patients who underwent transarterial chemoembolization(TACE)for whole-liver multinodular HCC(mHCC), compared with 145 patients who underwent TACE for non-multinodular HCC(n-mHCC)as the controls. In the mHCC group, a treatment effect(TE)of 4 was obtained in 0%, TE3 in 38%, TE2 in 31%, and TE1 in 31%. In the n-mHCC group, TE4 was obtained in 24%, TE3 in 40%, TE2 in 32%, and TE1 in 4%. Efficacy was significantly higher in the mHCC group. In the mHCC group, Grade 3 adverse events(fever, elevated alanine aminotransferase, and thrombocytopenia)occurred in 4 patients(13. 7%). In the n-mHCC group, Grade 3 adverse events(ascites, elevated serum transaminase, and cytopenia)occurred in 33 patients(22. 7%). There was no significant difference in the change of Child-Pugh scores over time in 6 patients who underwent repetitive TACE for mHCC. In conclusion, TACE for whole-liver mHCC is generally safe, but its short-term therapeutic effects were not satisfactory. Variation in the TACE protocol using miriplatin, such as repetitive administration of miriplatin and a reduction in the treatment interval, can be alternative treatment choices for patients with whole-liver mHCC.
