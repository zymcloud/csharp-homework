Aim:To investigate the association between B-mode ultrasound classification of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and outcome after radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Methods:Ninety-seven cases of HCC treated using RFA between April 2001 and March 2006 were reviewed. Ultrasound images were classified as follows: type 1, with halo (n = 29); and type 2, without halo (n = 68). Type 2 was further categorized into three subgroups: type 2a, homogenous hyperechoic (n = 9); type 2b, hypoechoic with smooth margins (n = 43); and type 2c (n = 16), hypoechoic with irregular or unclear margins. Patients with type 2a HCC were excluded from analysis due to the small number of cases.Results:Two year recurrence rates for type 2b, type 1 and type 2c were 26%, 42% and 69%, respectively, with significant differences between type 2b and type 2c (P Conclusion:B-mode ultrasound classification of small HCC is a predictive factor for outcome after RFA.
