Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the liver is rare. It has a high malignancy rate and poor prognosis, and survival is typically no longer than one year. The pathogenesis of the disease is unclear, but is generally considered to be correlated with the long-term inflammation or metaplasia of biliary epithelial cells and congenital cyst of the liver. The current viewpoint is that surgical resection of the tumor, preoperative or postoperative subsidiary chemoembolization, radiotherapy and generalized chemotherapy may extend a patient's survival. In the present case study, a patient suffered from biliary calculosis for over 20 years. We theorized that the mechanism of carcinomatous change was correlated with the persistent stimulation of chronic biliary infection induced by calculus of the intrahepatic duct. However, the transformation mechanism from cholangiocellular carcinoma to squamous carcinoma is undetermined and further studies are needed.
