This letter describes the preparation of quinoline derivatives and their cytotoxic potentials toward human carcinoma cell lines. Among the selected compounds, 8-hydroxy-2-quinolinecarbaldehyde (3) showed the best in vitro cytotoxicity against the human cancer cell lines, including MDA231, T-47D, Hs578t, SaoS2, K562, SKHep1 (with a MTS50 range of 12.5-25 μg/mL) and Hep3B (with a MTS50 range of 6.25±0.034 μg/mL). The in vivo antitumor activity of compound 3 on subcutenaous Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft in athymic nude mice was then studied. The results showed that the dose of 10 mg/kg/day of compound 3 with intraperitoneal injection for 9 days totally abolished the growth of the xenograft tumor of Hep3B with no histological damage on vital organs as compared with the control. The experimental results suggested that compound 3 has a good potential as an antitumor agent.
