Neoplasms in children after organ transplantation are related to the type and intensity of immunosuppression and the donor-recipient serostatus, especially in relation to the Epstein-Barr virus. The patient was a two-yr-old female child with biliary atresia who underwent a liver transplantation from a female cadaver donor. Two adults received kidney transplants from the same donor. Nine months after transplantation, one of the adult recipients developed an urothelial tumor in the kidney graft. Imaging tests were repeated monthly in the liver-transplanted child and revealed no abnormalities. However, one yr and two months after the transplantation, the patient developed episodes of fever. At that time, imaging and liver biopsy showed a clear cell tumor of urothelial origin in the graft and the disease was limited to the liver. The patient underwent liver retransplantation, and she is currently free of tumor recurrence. Although rare, the occurrence of tumors in the post-transplant period from cadaver donors, without previously diagnosed tumors, is one of the many problems encountered in the complex world of organ transplantation.
