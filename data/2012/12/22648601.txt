Background:Populations with low income, economic barriers, and cultural and/or linguistic access barriers to medical care are at risk for worse cancer-related outcomes. Medically underserved patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have decreased survival compared with those in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Given this suboptimal outcome, the high cost of HCC treatment, and unknown risk-to-benefit ratios of invasive therapies, the authors sought to identify a predictive model of extremely poor overall survival (OS).Methods:A retrospective review of an institutional HCC database was conducted. Payor status, race, treatment, clinicopathologic, and outcome parameters were recorded. The primary outcome was OS Results:In total, 337 patients HCC (272 men and 65 women) were identified. Only 4% of patients had Medicare coverage; whereas 96% relied on publicly funded, safety-net health programs. OS 1 month. A higher percentage of patients who had an OS Conclusions:Survival for medically underserved patients with HCC remains poor. Advanced clinical stage and liver disease appear to preclude treatment, and novel methods to identify those who may benefit from palliative care/symptom control may be indicated for patients who are predicted to have poor survival.
