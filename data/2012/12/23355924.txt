A 59-year-old man underwent liver radiofrequency ablation under laparotomy for recurrent hepatic carcinoma located in the caudate lobe, however, near-fatal bleeding occurred 1 wk after the operation. The intra-operative ultrasound study during laparotomy revealed left hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm. Suture and packing with ribbon gauze was used to obtain hemostasis. A secondary hemorrhage followed 11 h later and hepatic angiography was performed immediately. Bleeding from the pseudoaneurysm in a branch of the left hepatic artery was found and the artery branch was embolized with coils. Other than slight bile leakage, post-embolization continued satisfactorily. Bleeding did not reoccur. The follow up visit 1 mo later found the pseudoaneurysm disappearing and no tumor recurrence.
