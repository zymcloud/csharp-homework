Background:Local ablation techniques are a major focus of current developments in oncology. The primary aim is to retain organs and preserve organ functions without compromising the oncological outcome.Method:Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a novel ablation technique that involves the application of high-voltage pulses to induce cell apoptosis without causing thermal damage to the target tissue or adjacent structures.Aim:First published in 2005 IRE is currently undergoing preclinical and clinical trials in several areas of oncology and the initial results have been promising. The IRE technique could be a significant development in ablation treatment for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) but decisive proof of its effectiveness for local RCC has not yet been provided. This study presents the results of preclinical and initial clinical trials which are discussed and compared with those of other ablation techniques in order to demonstrate the current value of IRE.
