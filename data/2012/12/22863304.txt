Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma in noncirrhotic liver (NC-HCC) presents usually with large size, which is seen as a contraindication to liver transplantation (LT) or even resection. The objective of our single-center study was to identify prognostic factors following resection of large NC-HCCs and to subsequently devise a treatment strategy (including LT) in selected patients.Methods:From 2000 to 2010, 89 patients who had hepatic resection for NC-HCC (large ≥ 8 cm in 52) were analyzed with regard to pathological findings, postoperative and long-term outcome.Results:Five patients died postoperatively. After a mean follow-up of 35 ± 30 months, NC-HCC recurred in 36 patients (26/47 survivors in group 8 cm+, 10/37 in group 8 cm-; p = 0.007). Five-year overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were significantly worse for group 8 cm+ (43.4% vs. 89.2% and 39.3% vs. 60.7% for group 8 cm-, p Conclusions:Although patients with NC-HCC ≥ 8 cm had a poorer prognosis, the absence of vascular invasion or fibrosis was associated with excellent survival, regardless of the tumor size. In recurrent patients, aggressive treatment (including LT) can be considered.
