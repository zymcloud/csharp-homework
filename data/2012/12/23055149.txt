We report four cases of possible human infections with Delftia lacustris. D. lacustris isolates, which were isolated from blood cultures and bile fluid of patients with underlying diseases such as empyema, renal injury, hepatocellular carcinoma, and renal infarction, were identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and biochemical tests. Four D. lacustris isolates did not show the same antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR) patterns, indicating their non-clonality.
