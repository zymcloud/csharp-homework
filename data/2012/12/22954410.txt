Purpose:To retrospectively determine whether the hyperintense hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) seen on the hepatobiliary phase of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging (EOB-MRI) might have different histologic characteristics from usual hypointense HCCs.Materials and methods:Two hundred three surgically proven HCCs from 192 patients who underwent preoperative EOB-MRI were analyzed. The demographic and histologic characteristics of hyperintense HCCs were compared with usual hypointense HCCs by using the t-test or Fisher's exact test.Results:By visual assessment, 18 (8.8%) tumors were classified as hyperintense HCCs. Patients with hyperintense HCC were significantly (pConclusions:Hyperintense HCCs seem to have clinical and histologic features that might be related with more favorable outcomes.
