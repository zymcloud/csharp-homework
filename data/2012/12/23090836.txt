Aim:The reported association of the leptin receptor (LEPR) protein with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) carcinogenesis prompted us to evaluate whether genetic polymorphisms of the LEPR gene affect susceptibility to HCC and its clinicopathologic characteristics.Methods:A total of 417 subjects who were diagnosed with HCC and 551 age- and sex-matched subjects without HCC were enrolled in this study. All subjects had chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the LEPR gene were determined.Results:The genotype frequencies of Lys109Arg and Gln223Arg differed significantly between HCC and non-HCC subjects (both p Conclusion:The Lys109Arg and Gln223Arg polymorphisms of the LEPR gene are associated with susceptibility to HCC but not with its clinicopathologic features. These polymorphisms may represent genetic markers for the risk of HCC in the context of chronic HBV infection.
