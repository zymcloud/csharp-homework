Aim:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common clinical problem all over the world. Fucosylated hemopexin (Fuc-Hpx) is a newly reported glycoprotein for the diagnosis of HCC, however, its clinical implications are unclear. The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical utility of Fuc-Hpx in Japanese patients with HCC.Methods:The sera from 331 HCC patients, 45 with liver cirrhosis (LC), 85 with chronic hepatitis (CH) and 22 healthy people were examined for the expression of Fuc-Hpx; the level was compared with clinical parameters as well as hemopexin (Hpx) expression. The expressions of Fuc-Hpx in 12 HCC tissues and corresponding adjacent non-cancerous liver tissues were also examined.Results:No correlation was observed between Hpx and Fuc-Hpx level. The median Fuc-Hpx levels in healthy people and CH, LC and HCC patients were 3.8, 3.7, 6.1 and 7.6 AU/mL, respectively (CH vs LC, P = 0.002; CH vs HCC, P Conclusion:Fuc-Hpx is a valuable biomarker for HCC but it might be a marker for hypercarcinogenic liver rather than a marker for tumor-bearing liver.
