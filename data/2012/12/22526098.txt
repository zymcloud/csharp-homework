Yttrium-90 ((90)Y) radioembolization represents an emerging transcatheter treatment option for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Elevation of the hepatopulmonary shunt fraction risks nontarget radiation to the lungs and may limit the use of (90)Y therapy in patients with locally advanced disease with vascular invasion, who often demonstrate increased shunting. We present two cases in which patients with HCC and portal vein invasion resulting in elevated hepatopulmonary shunt fractions underwent chemoembolic shunt closure to allow safe (90)Y radioembolization. Both patients demonstrated excellent tumor response and patient survival. On this basis, we propose a role for chemoembolic reduction of the lung shunt fraction before (90)Y radioembolization in patients with extensive tumor-related hepatopulmonary shunting.
