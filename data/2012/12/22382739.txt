Hypoglycemia is a well-known complication of insulinoma and other non-islet-cell tumors like hepatic tumor. In the emergency unit of neurology department, hypoglycemia is an uncommon cause of convulsive status epilepticus. We report a rare case with hypoglycemia-induced convulsive status epilepticus as the initial presentation of primary hepatic carcinoma. The previously healthy 57-year-old male peasant presented with persistent unconsciousness and repeated convulsive seizures. He was later found to have hepatoma related hypoglycemia. This case highlights the importance of blood sugar test in unexplained status epilepticus in the emergency room of neurology department. Intravenous glucose infusion rather than anti-epileptic drugs might be safer and more effective in treating status epilepticus caused by hepatoma related hypoglycemia.
