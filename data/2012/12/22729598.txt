Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening has been recommended for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected individuals in an effort to detect HCC at a sufficiently early stage to provide potentially curative treatments. The study reported here is the first to address the rate of HCC screening use in an HBV endemic area.Methods:Data were collected from 11,147 adults aged ≥40 years who participated in the 2007-2009 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and had a valid HBV surface antigen test. Current HCC screening was defined as either receiving an ultrasonography or an α-fetoprotein measurement in the past year. Prevalence estimates were weighted.Results:The response rate was 78.4 %, and 436 cases of HBV infection were identified. The overall seroprevalence of the HBV surface antigen was 4.1 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 3.9-4.4 %]. Of the 436 HBV-infected subjects, only 23.2 % (95 % CI 19.5 -27.4 %) were aware that they had been infected, and approximately 27 % (27.1 %; 95 %CI 23.2-to 31.5 %) were up to date with their HCC screening tests; more than half (52.9 %, 95 % CI 48.2-57.5) had never been screened. In a multivariate analysis that included various sociodemographic variables, only self-reported awareness of HBV infection was significantly associated with current HCC screening tests (odds ratio 2.82; 95 % CI 1.64-4.84).Conclusions:Adoption of HCC screening as a standard practice among HBV-infected Korean adults aged ≥40 years is suboptimal. Evidence-based programs in communities and education for both healthcare providers and HBV-infected persons are needed to improve the implementation of HCC screening in clinical practice.
