The molecular mechanisms and cellular targets of sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), remain to be fully characterized. Recent studies have shown that sorafenib induces tumor cell death through the activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling and/or autophagy in various cellular models. Using liver cancer-derived cell lines, we specifically show that the IRE1 and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase arms of the unfolded protein response (UPR) become activated upon sorafenib treatment, whereas the ATF6 arm is inhibited. Our results also reveal that sorafenib treatment causes disruption to the secretory pathway, as witnessed by the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus and the induction of autophagy. On the basis of these observations, we tested the relevance of the AAA‚Å∫ ATPase p97/VCP as a potential functional target of sorafenib. Our results show that p97/VCP tyrosine phosphorylation is prevented upon sorafenib treatment, and that this can be correlated with enhanced membrane association. Moreover, we show that DBeQ, a recently discovered inhibitor of p97/VCP, enhances sorafenib-mediated toxicity in cultured cells. Our data show a novel mechanism for sorafenib-mediated cell death in HCC, which depends on the integrity of the secretory pathway; and we identify p97/VCP phosphorylation as a potential target for improved sorafenib treatment efficacy in patients.
