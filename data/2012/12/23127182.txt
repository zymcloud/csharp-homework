In order to detarget undesirable transduction in the liver by an adenovirus (Ad) vector, we previously demonstrated that insertion of sequences perfectly complementary to liver-specific miR-122a into the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of transgene specifically reduced the transgene expression in the liver by approximately 100-fold; however, a certain level of residual transgene expression was still found in the liver. In order to further suppress the hepatic transduction, we developed a two-Ad vector system that uses the microRNA (miRNA)-regulated transgene expression system and the Cre-loxP recombination system, i.e., insertion of miR-122a target sequences and loxP sites into the transgene expression cassette and coadministration of a Cre recombinase-expressing Ad vector. In addition, to maintain as much as possible the transgene expression in the spleen, which is the target organ of this study, spleen-specific miR-142-3p target sequences were inserted into the 3'-UTR of the Cre recombinase gene to suppress Cre recombinase expression in the spleen. The spleen is an attractive target for immunotherapy because the spleen plays important roles in the immune system. Coadministration of Ad vector possessing CMV promoter-driven Cre recombinase expression cassette with miR-142-3p target sequences resulted in a further 24-fold reduction in the hepatic transgene expression by the Ad vector containing miR-122a target sequences and loxP sites, compared with coadministration of control Ad vector. On the other hand, there was no significant reduction of transgene expression in the spleen.
