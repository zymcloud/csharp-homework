The aim of the present study was to compare the levels of essential trace and toxic elements in biological samples (blood and serum) of male liver cirrhotic/cancer patients (n = 144), of age groups 30-50 years, before and after 60 days treatment with mineral supplementation. For comparison purposes, the same biological samples were also collected from healthy male subjects (n = 120) of the same age groups. The biological samples were oxidized by 65 % HNO₃/30 % H₂O₂ (2:1) in a microwave oven. The digests of all biological samples were analyzed for arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. The levels of Se and Zn were lower in liver cirrhotic/cancer patients as compared to healthy individuals (p < 0.001). The patients with liver cirrhosis/cancer have twofold higher As and Cd levels in biological samples as compared to age-matched referents. Moreover, a negative correlation was observed between essential and toxic elements. The pathogenesis of liver cirrhosis/cancer has been associated with changes in the balance of certain essential trace and toxic elements. The study confirms that oral supplements of Se and Zn produce metabolic effects in patients with liver cirrhosis/cancer. It was observed that the status of essential trace elements, Se and Zn, was improved in biological samples of all patients after 60 days of treatment with mineral supplementation.
