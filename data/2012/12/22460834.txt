The anti-apoptosis factor Bcl-2 is known to contribute to tumorigenesis and metastasis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may also participate in tumor invasion and metastasis. This study investigated the relationship between coexpression profiles of Bcl-2 and EMT regulators in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor samples and clinical outcome. The nuclear (Nu) and cytoplasmic (Cyt) expression of Bcl-2 and the EMT regulators Twist-1, Twist-2, and Snail were determined by immunohistochemical staining in tumor tissue isolated from 97 HCC patients. The clinical prognostic values of both individual protein expression and various expression combinations were investigated using univariate and multivariate survival analysis. Results showed that patients with nuclear expression of Bcl-2 had worse clinical outcomes than patients exhibiting cytoplasmic expression. Overall survival was significantly shorter in HCC patients individually expressing Bcl-2-Nu, Twist-1-Nu, Twist-1-Cyt, and Snail (all P
