Objective:It has been suggested that HIV infection has a detrimental impact on patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study sought to test this hypothesis, while controlling for tumor extension and liver disease.Design and setting:A case control and a cohort approach were performed in patients with HCC managed prospectively via dedicated multidisciplinary team meeting in a single tertiary institution between 2004 and 2009.Subjects:Of 473 consecutive treatment-naive patients with HCC, 23 were HIV-positive (HIV) and 450 were HIV-negative (HIV). HIV patients were matched 1:2 with a control group of HIV patients in terms of the etiology of HCC, the severity of liver disease, tumor extension, and year of diagnosis.Intervention:Curative or palliative treatment of HCC.Main outcome measures:Eligibility for HCC treatment, the treatment actually administered, and the survival rate.Results:The HIV population was younger than the HIV population (mean age: 49 vs. 61 years, respectively; P Conclusion:In an equal-access unbiased environment, HIV status does not significantly influence treatment access, delivery, and outcome.
