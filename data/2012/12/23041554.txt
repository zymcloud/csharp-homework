Aim:The programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) is a potent immunoregulatory molecule which is responsible for the negative regulation of T-cell activation and peripheral tolerance. Recently, overexpression of PD-1 has been reported to contribute to immune system evasion and poor survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A common single nucleotide polymorphism in intron 4 of PD-1 gene called PD-1.3 has been reported to influence PD-1 expression, but its association with HCC has yet to be investigated. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether this polymorphism could be involved in the risk of HCC susceptibility.Methods:The genotype frequency of PD-1.3 polymorphism was determined by using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method in 236 subjects with HCC and 236 cancer-free control subjects matched on age, gender, smoking and alcohol status.Results:No statistically significant differences were found in the genotype distributions of the PD-1.3 polymorphism among HCC and cancer-free control subjects (P=0.22).Conclusion:Our results demonstrate for the first time that the PD-1.3 polymorphism has not been in any major role in genetic susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinogenesis, at least in the population studied here. Independent studies are needed to validate our findings in a larger series, as well as in patients of different ethnic origins.
