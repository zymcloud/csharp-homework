Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is difficult to eradicate due to its resilient nature. Portal vein is often involved in tumors of large size, which exclude the patient from surgical resection and local ablative therapy, such as percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) because they were considered neither effective nor safe. Currently, there is almost no effective treatment for HCC of such condition. As a unique antitumor agent in form of lipophilic fluid for local injection, para-toluenesulfonamide (PTS) produces mild side effects while necrotizing the tumor tissues quickly and efficiently. Being largely different from both PEI and RFA therapies, PTS can disseminate itself in tumors more easily than other caustic agents, such as alcohol. So PTS may offer additional benefit to HCCs with vascular involvement. We herein describe a 70-year-old HCC patient who was treated with the combination of PTS injection and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, resulting in a significantly improved clinical prognosis.
