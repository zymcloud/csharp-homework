Objectives:Hepatocellular carcinoma with bile duct tumor thrombus is considered an aggressive malignancy, and the prognosis of liver transplant for it remains obscure.Materials and methods:A 42-year-old man with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma and a history of surgical resection was admitted to our hospital with a 10-day history of yellowish urine and itchy skin. There were 3 lesions in the right lobe with the diameter of 2 cm each. A mass was found in the upper part of common bile duct, and the intrahepatic bile duct was dilated. His serum alpha-fetoprotein level was 2476 μg/L, total bilirubin level was 327 μmol/L, direct bilirubin level was 261 μmol/L, and alanine aminotransferase was 714 U/L. There was no main portal vein thrombus or extrahepatic metastases. Because of his poor liver function, he was listed for a liver transplant. During the wait (30 d), he underwent 9 episodes of plasmapheresis to decrease the serum level of bilirubin. He had an orthotopic liver transplant with the graft from a deceased donor. After the liver transplant, he received 5 cycles of chemotherapy with the regimen of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil.Results:This patient has survived without recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma for more than 82 months and remains in good condition.Conclusions:Liver transplant may have a favorable result for hepatocellular carcinoma patient with a bile duct tumor thrombus, within the Milan criteria.
