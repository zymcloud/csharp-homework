Background & aims:Aim of the study was to assess the clinical impact of conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) repeated "on demand" on HCC outcome. Outcome measures were: response rate to first and repeated cTACE, recurrence rates and overall survival.Methods:The outcome of 151 consecutive HCC patients submitted to a first cTACE from January 2004 to December 2005 was retrospectively analyzed.Results:Complete radiological response (CR) was observed in 72/151 (48%), 34/60 (52%) and 12/22 (55%) patients after first, second and third cTACE, respectively. Recurrence rates at 6 and 12months were 37% and 61% after the first cTACE, and 40% and 59% after the second cTACE, respectively. Patients not achieving CR or with a recurrence after CR not treated with curative therapies were 94 and 84 after first and second cTACE, respectively. Of these, 60/94 (64%) and 22/84 (26%) were submitted to a second and third cTACE, respectively. Median overall survival was 32.0months but 25.0months excluding transplanted patients. Factors at the time of first cTACE associated with overall shorter survival at multivariate analysis were higher bilirubin, higher AFP and not achieving CR.Conclusions:CR and recurrence rates after first and second cTACE were similar. About 64% of patients were submitted to second cTACE, while only few patients (26%) were submitted to third cTACE using an "on demand" policy. These figures may be also useful for planning trials for the evaluation of the efficacy of repeated TACE vs. TACE combined with adjuvant treatments or vs. systemic treatments.
