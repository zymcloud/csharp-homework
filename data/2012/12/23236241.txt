Aim:To investigate the clinicopathological features and prognostic value of lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We examined LSD1 expression in 60 paired liver cancer tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. In addition, we analyzed LSD1 expression in 198 HCC samples by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between LSD1 expression, clinicopathological features and patient survival was investigated.Results:Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and qRT-PCR consistently confirmed LSD1 overexpression in HCC tissues compared to adjacent non-neoplastic tissues (P Conclusion:Our data suggest for the first time that the overexpression of LSD1 protein in HCC tissues indicates tumor progression and predicts poor prognosis.
