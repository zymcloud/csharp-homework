Purposes:This study aimed to evaluate a novel surgical device combination [VIO system containing a bipolar clamp (BiClamp) and the monopolar soft-coagulation (SOFT COAG)] in hepatic resection for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:This study performed 124 hepatic resections for HCC and divided them into 2 groups: 60 patients (Conventional group) underwent liver parenchymal transection using Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) system and saline-coupled bipolar electrocautery for hemostasis; the BiClamp was used with the CUSA system for liver parenchymal transection and SOFT COAG was used with saline-coupled bipolar electrocautery for hemostasis in 64 patients (VIO group).Results:The median blood loss in the VIO group was 345 mL, which was less than that in the Conventional group (median 548 mL, P = 0.0423). A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that no use of the VIO system (P = 0.0172) was an independent predictor of intraoperative blood loss, respectively. In patients with liver cirrhosis, the VIO group included a significantly lower proportion of patients with liver cirrhosis that experienced more than 500 mL of intraoperative blood loss in comparison to those in the Conventional group (P = 0.0262).Conclusions:The VIO system was safe for hepatic resection and its use was associated with a significant decrease in intraoperative blood loss even in cirrhotic patients.
