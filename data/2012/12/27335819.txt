Introduction. Hepatitis C is the first major cause for HCC in Morocco. Antiviral treatment reduces the risk of developing HCC but few cases of HCC in HCV-treated patients were reported. We aimed to define this population's features and to identify predictive factors of developing HCC. Patients and Methods. We included all HCV carriers who developed HCC after antiviral treatment from January 2002 to April 2010. We compare HCV-treated patients with no developed HCC to HCC population using khi-2 and Fisher Exact analysis. Results. 369 HVC-treated patients were considered, and 20 HCC were reported. The risk of HCC was not significant according to gender and genotypes (resp., P = 0.63 and P = 0.87). Advanced age and severe fibrosis were significant risk factors (resp., P = 0.003 and P = 0.0001). HCC was reported in 2.6% of sustained virological responders versus 12.5% of nonresponders (P = 0.004). Conclusion. In our series, 5% of previously treated patients developed an HCC. Advanced age and severe fibrosis at HCV diagnosis are predictive factors of HCC occurrence. Sustained virological response reduces considerably the risk of HCC occurrence but screening is indicated even after SVR.
