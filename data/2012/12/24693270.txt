Background and aims:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the United States. This study evaluated the impact of surveillance and treatment on HBV-infected HCC patients and identified factors associated with survival.Methods:From 1981 to 2010, 166 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive HCC patients were evaluated. Fifty-eight patients had HCC detected by surveillance, while 108 patients presented with HCC.Results:Compared to patients detected by surveillance, those presenting with HCC had more symptoms (65.7% vs 41.4%; P=.002), were more frequently outside of Milan criteria (73.7% vs 29.6%; PConclusion:In the United States, HBV-related HCC is a common malignancy, especially among Asian immigrants. Identification of HBsAgpositive subjects and routine HCC surveillance are essential for improving survival in these patients.
