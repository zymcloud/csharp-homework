Purpose:To show that hepatic tumor volume and enhancement pattern measurements can be obtained in a time-efficient and reproducible manner on a voxel-by-voxel basis to provide a true three-dimensional (3D) volumetric assessment.Materials and methods:Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data obtained from 20 patients recruited for a single-institution prospective study were retrospectively evaluated. All patients had a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and underwent drug-eluting beads (DEB) transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for the first time. All patients had undergone contrast-enhanced MR imaging before and after DEB transcatheter arterial chemoembolization; poor image quality excluded 3 patients, resulting in a final count of 17 patients. Volumetric RECIST (vRECIST) and quantitative EASL (qEASL) were measured, and segmentation and processing times were recorded.Results:There were 34 scans analyzed. The time for semiautomatic segmentation was 65 secondsÂ±33 (range, 40-200 seconds). vRECIST and qEASL of each tumor were computedConclusions:Semiautomatic quantitative tumor enhancement (qEASL) and volume (vRECIST) assessment is feasible in a workflow-efficient time frame. Clinical correlation is necessary, but vRECIST and qEASL could become part of the assessment of intraarterial therapy for interventional radiologists.
