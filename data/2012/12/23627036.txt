Objective:By the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with GP73 content to explore its significance for liver cancer diagnosis and clinical treatment.Methods:Up-converting phosphor immunochromatography methods was used for detection of serum GP73 in 302 cases of liver cancer, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis patients and normal control, application electrochemiluminescence detection of AFP as a comparison. And ROC curve analysis of its diagnostic performance, and patients with HCC before and after treatment GP73 periodic testing of the treatment effect.Results:GP73 content of liver cancer patients was (160.83 +/- 37.24) ng/ml, significantly higher than the chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis patients and normal controls. The area under ROC curve for GP73 diagonosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis was 0. 907 which higher than the area under the ROC curve of AFP was 0. 727. Determine 110 ng/ml most of its critical value, the sensitivity was 84.7%, specificity was 75.8%; liver cancer patients with AFP Conclusion:GP73 has a high sensitivity for the diagnosis of HCC can add to the AFP's lack of sensitivity that can be used to monitor liver cancer treatment.
