Choline kinase α (CHKA) has been identified to be associated with cancer development and progression. In this study, we investigated whether exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the CHKA gene are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Among all SNPs in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR), 5'-UTR and the coding region of CHA, only two SNPs (rs3794186 and rs11481) in the 3'-UTR had a heterozygosity above 0.1 and a minor allele frequency above 0.1. Therefore, we selected and assessed these two SNPs (rs3794186 and rs11481) in 189 HCC patients and 194 controls. Genetic data were analyzed using the SNPAnalyzer Pro, SNPStats and Haploview programs. No SNPs of the CHKA gene were found to be associated with the risk of HCC development. Upon analysis of the clinical characteristics of HCC, the genotypic frequency of rs3794186 was significantly associated with serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) levels (P=0.022 in the co-dominant 1 model, P=0.0045 in the dominant model and P=0.0052 in the log-additive model). A significant difference in the allelic frequency of rs3794186 was also observed between the high AFP (>200 ng/ml) group and the low AFP (≤200 ng/ml) group [P=0.009, odds ratio (OR) = 0.33, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.14-0.75]. The T allele frequency of rs3794186 was lower in the high AFP group (6.6%) compared to that in the low AFP group (17.8%). Our results suggest that CHKA SNPs (rs3794186 and rs11481) are not associated with HCC development; however, rs3794186 may correlate with serum AFP levels in HCC.
