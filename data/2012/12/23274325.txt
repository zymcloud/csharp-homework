Background:Fungal infections after liver transplantation have received considerable interests because of their association with substantial morbidity and mortality. This study investigated risk factors of fungal infection after liver transplantation.Material/methods:Retrospective analysis was performed based on clinical data from 120 patients with fungal infection after liver transplantation from January 1, 2003 to May 30, 2012. χ2 test was used to analyze risk factors for fungal infections.Results:The fungal infection rate after liver transplantation is 13.5% (120/886) and the case fatality rate reaches 70.8%; most are infected by Candida albicans (67.5%), with infection located in the lung (73.3%). Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation scores of the infected group are higher than those of the control group 24 hours after the surgery (27.1±5.2 vs. 21.9±5.0). The percentage of primary liver cancer patients in the infected group was lower than in the control group (26.7% vs. 45.8%). Compared to the control group, the infected group had a higher percentage of patients with HBV, gestational diabetes mellitus, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Percentages of patients with long continuous parenteral nutrition time, poorly controlled high blood sugar, long-term mechanical ventilation, and antibiotics use were higher in the infected group than in the control group.Conclusions:Preoperative original attack, postoperative critical condition, chronically high blood sugar, long-term use of antibiotics, and mechanical ventilation are probably vital risk factors for fungal infection after liver transplantation.
