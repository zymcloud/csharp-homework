Background:Hepatectomy is the main curative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but postoperative long-term survival is poor. Preoperative radiological features of HCC displayed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging could serve as additional prognostic factors. This study aimed to identify preoperative radiological features of HCC that may be of prognostic significance in hepatectomy.Methods:Ninety-two patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC were included in this study. Preoperative radiological features including tumor number, size, location (peripheral, middle, central), portal vein invasion, hepatic vein invasion, and presence of pseudo-capsule were analyzed in relation to survival.Results:With a median follow-up period of 41.7 months, the 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 85%, 65% and 58%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that portal vein invasion and absence of pseudo-capsule were significant prognostic factors for overall survival, while all the examined radiological features were prognostic factors for disease-free survival. Multivariate analysis for overall survival found no significant factor. On multivariate analysis for disease-free survival, patients who had tumors with portal vein invasion had poorer survival with a hazard ratio of 2.26 (95% CI, 1.05-4.91; P=0.038) and patients with single nodular HCC or pseudo-capsulated HCC had better survival with a hazard ratio of 0.50 (95% CI, 0.27-0.94; P=0.032) and 0.38 (95% CI, 0.14-0.99; P=0.048), respectively.Conclusions:Demonstrable pseudo-capsule of HCC and solitary HCC on imaging and absence of portal vein invasion are features associated with better disease-free survival after hepatectomy. These features may guide treatment planning for HCC.
