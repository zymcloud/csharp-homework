Objectives:Latex from Hevea brasiliensis (natural rubber tree primarily cultivated for its rubber particles) has no known primary metabolic function, although its biological role is as a plant defence system. The present study has evaluated specific anti-proliferative effects of latex whole C-serum and its subfractions, on human cancer cell lines.Materials and methods:Cell viability assay using MTT, DNA fragmentation assay and real-time PCR were used to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of latex whole C-serum and its subfractions on the cell lines.Results:MTT assay revealed very low LC(50) values, 2.0 and 280 ng/ml, for DCS and DCP treatments, respectively. DCS was proven to be more potent compared to DCP, in conferring specific anti-proliferative effects on the cancer cell lines. The study also indicated that anti-proliferative activity of pre-heated C-serum fractions diminished significantly.Conclusion:Although noteworthy cell death was reported, DNA fragmentation assay and real-time PCR confirmed that that induced by latex C-serum subfractions was not promoted via the classical apoptotic signalling pathway.
