The study was undertaken to investigate the clinical implications of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes, basal core promoter (BCP), precore (PC) and surface gene mutations in HBV infected patients from Orissa, southeastern India. HBV infections were identified by serology testing and HBV DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction among the 152 patients. After sequencing, surface gene mutation were studied by sequence analysis as well as by using BLOSUM scores and BCP mutations were studied only by sequence analysis. A high proportion of HBV/D5 (66.0%) was found among the study samples having significant relation with liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients (p
