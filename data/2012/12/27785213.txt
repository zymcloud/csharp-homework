Background:Laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation (LRFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) under guidance of intra-operative laparoscopic ultrasound (IOLUS) aiming of obtaining additional information for liver situation, better tumor staging and effective treatment of hepatic focal lesion (HFL) in patients with a difficult percutaneous approach.Methods:Between September 2010 and July 2012, 301 patients with HCC in liver cirrhosis were referred from HCC clinic at National Hepatology and Tropical Medicine Research Institute (NHTMRI). Twenty nine patients were submitted to LRFA with IOLUS guidance. Operation time, hospital stay, post procedure complication were recorded. Spiral CT scan one month postoperative was mandatory during follow up.Results:LRFA was completed in all patients. The IOLUS examination identified new HFL in three patients. A total of 32 lesions were treated. The mean operative time was 120 minutes; eight procedures were associated in six patients: cholecystectomy (6) and adhesiolysis (2). A complete tumor ablation was observed in all patients which were documented via spiral computed tomography (CT scan) one month after treatment.Conclusion:LRFA of HCC proved to be a safe and effective technique. IOLUS is superior on spiral CT scan in detection a small HCC.
