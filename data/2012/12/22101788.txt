Vasohibin-1 has recently been found and is known as an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, but the role of vasohibin-1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unknown. This study investigated the expression pattern of vasohibin-1, its correlation with clinicopathological features, and its potential role in tumor angiogenesis and prognosis of HCC. Expression of vasohibin-1, vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), and intratumoral microvessel density (MVD, labeled by CD34) were assessed by immunohistochemistry in 117 HCC specimens and adjacent nontumor liver tissues (ANLT). Correlation between vasohibin-1 and VEGF-A, MVD, and clinicopathological features was then investigated. Prognostic value of these factors was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis and a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Cytoplasm high expression of vasohibin-1 was detected in 38.5% (45/117) of the HCC tissues, which was significantly higher than that in 16.2% (19/117) of ANLT (P
