The expression status of CD74 in breast cancer stem cells and its clinical implications was evaluated in order to lay a foundation for managing breast cancer. Five hundred and eighty breast cancer specimens were enrolled in the study. The relationship between the CD74 protein and clinicopathological parameters as well as prognosis was subsequently determined. In total, 468 (80.69 %) of the 580 breast cases showed CD74-positive expression. After universal analysis, CD74 was observed to be related to lymph node metastasis and triple-negative breast cancer (P = 0.01 and 0.001). Moreover, CD74 expression has a line correlation with lymph node metastasis and triple-negative breast cancer (P = 0.02 and 0.001). Furthermore, periostin was shown to attain a significantly more distant liver metastasis and worse disease-specific survival than those with none or low-expressed CD74 protein (P = 0.001). In the Cox regression test, CD74 protein was detected as an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.001). CD74 is consistently expressed in triple-negative subgroups of breast cancer and might be a new potential marker for triple-negative breast cancer.
