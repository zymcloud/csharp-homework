Background:We aimed to evaluate the impact of body mass index (BMI) on the short- and long-term outcomes of hepatic resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We performed 371 hepatic resections in HCC patients whom we categorized into two groups based on BMI: BMI ≥ 25 (n = 77) and BMI Results:The incidence of postoperative complications in the BMI ≥ 25 group was comparable to those in the BMI Conclusions:A BMI ≥ 25 is not a risk factor for mortality or postoperative complications, and is considered to provide a better long-term prognosis (>20 y) than a BMI
