Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global health problem which can lead to liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma in one-fifth of chronically infected patients. HCV-4 infection is common in the Middle East and Africa, with an extraordinary high prevalence in Egypt. Interferon is a cytokine, a specific protein that is no stranger to the human body. In fact, the human body is constantly making interferon, and makes even greater amounts when trying to fight off an intruder, such as a virus. This work studied the impact of liver fibrosis on the efficacy of interferon in treating HCV.
