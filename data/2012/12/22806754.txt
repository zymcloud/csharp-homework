The impact of amino acid (aa) 70 substitution in the core region on hepatocarcinogenesis and survival for liver-related death in patients of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b (HCV-1b), who had not received antiviral therapy, is unknown. The relationships among aa 70 substitution, IL28B genotype, and hepatocarcinogenesis are also not clear. A total of 1,181 consecutive HCV-infected patients, who had not received antiviral therapy, were included in a follow-up study to determine predictive factors of hepatocarcinogenesis and survival for liver-related death. The cumulative hepatocarcinogenesis rates in HCV-1b of Gln70(His70) (glutamine (histidine) at aa 70) were significantly higher than those in HCV-1b of Arg70 (arginine at aa 70) and HCV-2a/2b. The cumulative survival rates for liver-related death in HCV-1b of Gln70(His70) were significantly lower than those in HCV-1b of Arg70 and HCV-2a/2b. Multivariate analysis identified gender (male), age (â‰¥ 60 years), albumin (Conclusion:Substitution of aa 70 in the core region of HCV-1b is an important predictor of hepatocarcinogenesis and survival for liver-related death in HCV patients who had not received antiviral therapy. The IL28B genotype might partly affect changes over time of dominant amino acid in core aa 70 of HCV-1b.
