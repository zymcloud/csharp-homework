We previously showed that high expression levels of SOX9 correlate with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. However, the exact role that SOX9 plays in HCC remains unclear. In this study, we firstly confirmed that miRNA-101 directly targets SOX9 in HCC. Ectopic expression of miR-101 significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation and tumorigenicity by targeting SOX9. Moreover, the down-regulation of miR-101 in clinical HCC tissues correlates with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Therefore, miR-101 may suppress HCC tumor progression by down-regulating SOX9. MiR-101 may be a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target for HCC.
