An 85-year-old man complained of macroscopic hematuria and painful urination. Cytoscopy revealed a non-papillary tumor at the bladder neck extending to the trigone. Abdominal computed tomography revealed thickening of the bladder wall in the same area but did not reveal lymph node swelling. Urinary cytology was class IIIb. We conducted a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) after which a histopathological examination showed urothelial carcinoma, G3, INFÎ³, pT2. From 6 days after TURBT, severe fever persisted despite the administration of various antibiotics and his general condition deteriorated. He died of acute myocardial infarction at 37 days after TURBT. Histopathological examination at autopsy revealed extensive urothelial carcinoma, a plasmacytoid variant, of the bladder which had invaded into the entire body including the lungs, liver, kidneys, adrenal glands, and veins, although tumor cells were not identified in lymph nodes. We review the literature and report this rare case of urothelial carcinoma, a plasmacytoid variant, of the bladder.
