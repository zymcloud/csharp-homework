Background:Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) may play a significant role in the development of pancreatic cancer. One of COX-2 main metabolites is prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which is involved both in inflammation and carcinogenesis. As PGE2 is inactivated in the lungs and the liver we assumed that the best medium to assess the level of PGE2 is not peripheral but portal blood.Patients and methods:Fifty-seven patients with pathologically verified diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC group, n = 38) and chronic pancreatitis (CP group, n = 19) were enrolled in this study. Sample of blood from central line was collected before surgery. Intraoperatively portal vein was identified and sampled. PGE2 levels were determined using ELISA test. All the patients were followed-up for 1-35 months.Results:PGE2 portal blood levels in patients with PDAC were higher than in patients with CP (190.55 ± 149.86 versus 120.23 ± 132.60; p = .04). PGE2 concentration at a cut-off value of 94.46 pg/ml had a sensitivity of 91.67%, specificity of 50%, AUC = 0.631 (95% CI, 0.489-0.758).Conclusion:The PGE2 portal blood levels in PDAC patients are higher than in those with CP. The PGE2 portal concentration cannot be a single marker in diagnosing PDAC due to low specificity.
