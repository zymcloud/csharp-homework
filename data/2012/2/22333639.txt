A 31-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for back pain. After a close investigation, she was diagnosed with multiple bone, liver and brain metastases of breast cancer. She was administered a combination therapy of paclitaxel and capecitabine. Capecitabine was administered orally at 628mg/m / 2 twice daily on days 1-21, and paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 was injected on days 1, 8, and 15. Both drug courses were repeated every 28 days. After 5 courses of treatment, the level of tumor markers and all metastases were reduced. The combination treatment of paclitaxel and capecitabine is considered to be effective for metastatic breast cancer with brain metastases.
