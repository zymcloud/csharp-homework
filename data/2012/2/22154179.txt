Abdominal approach is commonly used for resection of liver tumors. However, in rare cases, transthoracic approach may be a valuable option for management of lesions located in the hepatic dome or involving the cavo-hepatic junction for very selected patients. This approach can be an open procedure (thoracotomomy), a video-assisted minimally invasive technique (thoracoscopy), or a strictly percutaneously treatment (CT-guided radiofrequency ablation). This approach seems useful for high-risk patients, with previous major abdominal surgery, or awaiting for liver transplantation (bridge concept) with cranially located single lesions. A limited liver resection (tumorectomy or segmentectomy) can be performed, but this approach is also suitable for percutaneous ablation therapy (radiofrequency or cryotherapy), with an acceptable morbidity.
