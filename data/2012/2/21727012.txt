Objective:The lung is the most common site for extrahepatic metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We previously reported in a series of 20 patients that pulmonary metastasectomy for HCC is feasible in selected patients. The objective of this study was to re-evaluate the long-term outcomes and prognostic factors with an additional 25 patients.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed the records of 45 consecutive patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy due to HCC at our institution between 1990 and 2010.Results:Thirty-nine patients underwent hepatectomy or liver transplantation, whereas six patients underwent locoregional therapy for primary liver lesions. Twenty-seven patients died during a median 17.6-month follow-up period. The 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 19.5%. The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 40.9%. History of recurrence and serum des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) level >40 mAU ml(-1) at initial pulmonary resection were unfavorably associated with OS in univariate analysis.Conclusions:Pulmonary metastasectomy for HCC in selected patients resulted in relatively good outcomes with regard to OS. History of recurrence and serum DCP levels were shown to be candidates of prognostic factors for OS.
