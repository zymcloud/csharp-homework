The purpose of this study is to investigate associations between allelic variations of ABCG2 and ABCB1 with skin toxicity, diarrhea, liver injury and interstitial lung disease (ILD) in gefitinib-treated patients. A prospective clinical study of 83 Japanese patients with non-small-cell lung cancer was performed. Polymorphic loci in ABCG2 and ABCB1 were genotyped, and their effects on gefitinib toxicities were evaluated. ABCG2 34G>A was statistically associated with occurrence of skin rash; 13 (42%) of the 32 patients with at least one variant ABCG2 34G>A allele (G/A and A/A) developed grade 2 or worse skin rash, whereas only 10 (19%) of 51 patients homozygous for the reference allele (G/G) for the wild-type sequence for both alleles did so (P=0.046). There was no significant association between severe toxicities and polymorphisms of ABCG2 421C>A nor ABCB1 3435C>T. The results suggested that ABCG2 34G>A would be useful for predicting grade 2 or worse skin rash.
