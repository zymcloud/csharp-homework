Background and aim:The clinical utility of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and des-γ-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) as a predictor of treatment outcome in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving hepatic artery infusional chemotherapy (HAIC) or concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) has been poorly defined.Methods:Between January 2003 and December 2007, we enrolled 127 treatment-naïve patients who received HAIC (n = 60) or CCRT (n = 67) as an initial treatment modality. An AFP or DCP response was defined as a reduction of more than 20% from the baseline level.Results:AFP responders showed significantly better overall survival (OS) than non-responders among patients with HAIC (median 17.3 vs 6.4 months, P Conclusions:Early on-treatment AFP response was predictive of OS in treatment-naïve patients with advanced HCC receiving HAIC and CCRT as an initial treatment modality. Furthermore, DCP response was useful for predicting PFS in patients with CCRT.
