Recently, interest in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has grown due to its high mortality and increased incidence. Unlike other malignancies, HCC mainly arises in the context of chronic liver injury, complicating its management and the prediction of prognosis. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging classification currently offers an efficient decision-making guide in these patients. However, preoperative identification of patients with a higher risk of recurrence after resection and of those who could benefit from liver transplantation despite not meeting the Milan criteria would be useful. New high-throughput genomic technologies that can be applied to paraffin-embedded tissue have facilitated the identification of gene signatures and other biomarkers able to predict prognosis in HCC patients. None of these biomarkers, based on transcriptome, microRNAs or metilome, has been incorporated into clinical practice, although in future they may be able to complement the prognostic value of clinical and pathologic variables.
