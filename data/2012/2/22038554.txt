Background:Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), an isoprenoid compound which includes retinoids, has been used orally as an anti-ulcer drug in Japan. GGA acts as a potent inducer of anti-viral gene expression by stimulating ISGF3 formation in human hepatoma cells. This drug has few side effects and reinforces the effect of IFN when administered in combination with peg-IFN and ribavirin. This study verified the anti-HCV activity of GGA in a replicon system. In addition, mechanisms of anti-HCV activity were examined in the replicon cells.Methods:OR6 cells stably harboring the full-length genotype 1 replicon containing the Renilla luciferase gene, ORN/C-5B/KE, were used to examine the influence of the anti-HCV effect of GGA. After treatment, the cells were harvested with Renilla lysis reagent and then subjected to a luciferase assay according to the manufacturer's protocol.Result:The results showed that GGA had anti-HCV activity. GGA induced anti-HCV replicon activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner. GGA did not activate the tyrosine 701 and serine 727 on STAT-1, and did not induce HSP-70 in OR6 cells. The anti-HCV effect depended on the GGA induced mTOR activity, not STAT-1 activity and PKR. An additive effect was observed with a combination of IFN and GGA.Conclusions:GGA has mTOR dependent anti-HCV activity. There is a possibility that the GGA anti-HCV activity can be complimented by IFN. It will be necessary to examine the clinical effectiveness of the combination of GGA and IFN for HCV patients in the future.
