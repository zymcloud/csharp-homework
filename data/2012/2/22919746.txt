Objective:To investigate the hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutation in the Enhancer I (HBV Enh I)/X-promoter and to analysis the relationship between chronic HBV-related disease spectrum.Methods:275 patients were enrolled in this study, including 100 cases of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 74 cases of liver cirrhosis (LC), 101 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), grouping by different HBV genotypes, using semi-nested PCR amplification of HBV Enh I/X-promoter and sequencing DNA, the mutations were determined by alignment to HBV reference sequence, the data was compared by chi2 test and analyzed by multivariate logistic regression.Results:(1) Genotyping results: 61.48% (158/257) were infected with HBV genotype B, including 70 cases of CHB, 36 cases of LC and 52 cases of HCC; 38.52% (117/257) were infected with HBV genotype C, including 30 cases of CHB, 38 cases of LC and 49 cases of HCC. (2) In the patients were infected with HBV genotype B, A1123Y mutation in LC was significantly higher than in CHB (30.56% vs. 8.58%, chi2 = 8.533, P = 0.005, A = 4.693, 95% CI [1.567-14.056]), HCC was significantly higher than in CHB (28.85% vs. 8.58%, chi2 = 8.607, P = 0.003, A = 4.324,95% CI [1.544-2.109]); A1317G mutation in HCC was significantly higher than in CHB (30.77% vs. 7.14%, chi2 = 11.687, P = 0.001, A = 5.778, 95% CI [1.955-17.076]). In the patients were infected with HBV genotype C, T1323C mutation in HCC was significantly higher than in CHB (30.61% vs. 6.67%, chi2 = 6.318, P = 0.12, A = 6.176, 95% CI [1.301-29.331]). (3) Multivariate regression analyses showed that A1317G (OR = 5.706, 95% CI [1.770-18.837], P = 0.004) and T1323C (A = 5.810, 95% CI [1.114-30.306], P = 0.037) mutation were risk factors for HCC.Conclusion:HBV Enh I/X-promoter mutations were associated with the development of LC and HCC, the mutations can help to predict the occurrence of LC and HCC.
