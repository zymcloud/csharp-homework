microRNA-122 (miR-122) was one of the first examples of a tissue-specific miRNA. It is highly expressed in liver, where it constitutes 70% of the total miRNA pool. miR-122 expression is specific to the vertebrate lineage, where the sequence of the mature miRNA is completely conserved. miR-122 is a target for extensive study due to its association with cholesterol metabolism and hepatocellular carcinoma, and its important role in promoting hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. This review will discuss the biogenesis and function of miR-122.
