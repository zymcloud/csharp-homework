S-nitrosoglutathione reductase is the primary enzyme responsible for the metabolism of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), the body's main source of bioavailable nitric oxide. Through its catabolic activity, GSNO reductase (GSNOR) plays a central role in regulating endogenous S-nitrosothiol levels and protein S-nitrosation-based signaling. By inhibiting GSNOR, we aim to increase pulmonary GSNO and induce bronchodilation while reducing inflammation in lung diseases such as asthma. To support the clinical development of N6022, a first-in-class GSNOR inhibitor, a 14-day toxicology study was conducted. Sprague-Dawley rats were given 2, 10 or 50 mg/kg/day N6022 via IV administration. N6022 was well tolerated at all doses and no biologically significant adverse findings were noted in the study up to 10 mg/kg/day. N6022-related study findings were limited to the high dose group. One male rat had mild hepatocellular necrosis with accompanying increases in ALT and AST and several male animals had histological lung assessments with a slight increase in foreign body granulomas. Systemic exposure was greater in males than females and saturation of plasma clearance was observed in both sexes in the high dose group. Liver was identified as the major organ of elimination. Mechanistic studies showed dose-dependent effects on the integrity of a rat hepatoma cell line.
