Objective:The objective of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) using internally cooled wet electrodes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:From March 2008 to October 2010, 122 patients with 129 HCCs (mean size, 2.2 Â± 0.6 [SD] cm; range, 0.7-4 cm) were treated with RFA using internally cooled wet electrodes. Primary technical effectiveness, the frequency of major complications, and local tumor progression rates were evaluated.Results:Two patients (2%) had major complications (liver abscess, significant pleural effusion) after RFA. When evaluated 1 month after RFA, the primary technical effectiveness rate was 99%. The 1- and 2-year local tumor progression rates were 8% and 12%, respectively. Additionally, there was no difference in effectiveness and complication rates between patients with subcapsular HCC and those with nonsubcapsular HCC.Conclusion:Percutaneous RFA using internally cooled wet electrodes is safe and provides successful local tumor control in patients with HCC. The safety and effectiveness of RFA using internally cooled wet electrodes are comparable to those reported in the literature using conventional RFA electrodes and are similar for nonsubcapsular and subcapsular tumors.
