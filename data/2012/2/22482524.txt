Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) represents the only reliable therapeutic approach for acute liver failure (ALF), liver failure associated to end-stage chronic liver diseases (CLD) and non-metastatic liver cancer. The clinical impact of liver failure is relevant because of the still high ALF mortality and the increasing worldwide prevalence of cirrhosis that, in turn, is the main predisposing cause for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Moreover, in the next decade because an increased number of patients reaching end-stage disease and requiring OLT may face a shortage of donor livers. This clinical scenario led several laboratories to explore the feasibility and efficiency of alternative approaches, involving cellular therapy, to counteract liver failure. The present chapter overviews results and concepts emerged from recent experimental and clinical studies in which adult or embryonic hepatocytes, hepatic stem/progenitor cells, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells as well as extrahepatic stem cells have been used as putative transplantable cell sources.
