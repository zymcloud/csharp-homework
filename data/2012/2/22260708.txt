Phosphorylation of histone H4 on one or both of its two histidine residues has been known to occur in liver cells for nearly 40 years and has been associated with proliferation of hepatocytes during regeneration of the liver following mechanical damage. More recently, large increases in histone H4 histidine kinase activity have been found to occur associated with proliferation and differentiation of liver progenitor cells following chemical damage that prevents hepatocyte proliferation. In addition, it has been shown this histone H4 histidine kinase activity is elevated nearly 100-fold in human foetal liver and several hundredfold in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue compared with normal adult liver. In the present paper, we review what is currently known about histone H4 histidine phosphorylation, the kinase(s) responsible and the phosphatases capable of catalysing its dephosphorylation, and briefly summarize the techniques used to detect and measure the histidine phosphorylation of histone H4 and the corresponding kinase activity.
