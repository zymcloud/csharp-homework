Chemoresistance prevents effective cancer therapy and is rarely predictable prior to treatment, particularly for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Following the chemoresistance profiling of eight HCC cell lines to each of nine chemotherapeutics, two cell lines (QGY-7703 as a sensitive and SMMC-7721 as a resistant cell line to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment) were systematically studied for mechanistic insights underpinning HCC 5-FU chemoresistance. Genomic profiling at both DNA methylation and microRNA (miR) levels and subsequent mechanistic studies illustrate a new mechanism for how DNA methylation-regulated miR-193a-3p dictates the 5-FU resistance of HCC cells via repression of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2) expression. In turn, SRSF2 preferentially up-regulates the proapoptotic splicing form of caspase 2 (CASP2L) and sensitizes HCC cells to 5-FU. Forced changes of miR-193a-3p level reverse all of the phenotypic features examined, including cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and 5-FU sensitivity, in cell culture and in nude mice. Importantly, the siRNA-mediated repression of SRSF2 phenocopies all of the miR-193a-3p mimic-triggered changes in QGY-7703. This newly identified miR-193a-3p-SRSF2 axis highlights a new set of companion diagnostics required for optimal 5-FU therapy of HCC, which involve assaying both the DNA methylation state of the miR-193a gene and the expression of miR-193a-3p and SRSF2 and the relative level of the proapoptotic versus antiapoptotic splicing forms of caspase 2 in clinical samples.
