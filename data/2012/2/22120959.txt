Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a commonly transmitted infection that has both hepatic and extrahepatic repercussions. These range from the inflammatory to the oncologic with an undisputed link to hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Its role in the development of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) is becoming better understood, leading to opportunities for research, therapy, and even prevention. Research in the field has progressed significantly over the last decade, with the number of patients diagnosed with HCV and B-NHL rising incrementally. It is therefore becoming crucial to fully understand the pathobiologic link of HCV in B cell lymphomagenesis and its optimal management in the oncologic setting.
