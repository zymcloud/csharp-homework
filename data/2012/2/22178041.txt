Purpose:A phase I dose escalation study was performed with systemically delivered lyso-thermosensitive liposomal doxorubicin (LTLD). The primary objectives were to determine the safe maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetic properties, and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of LTLD during this combination therapy.Materials and methods:Subjects eligible for percutaneous or surgical radiofrequency (RF) ablation with primary (n = 9) or metastatic (n = 15) tumors of the liver, with four or fewer lesions as large as 7 cm in diameter, were included. RF ablation was initiated 15 minutes after starting a 30-minute intravenous LTLD infusion. Dose levels between 20 mg/m(2) and 60 mg/m(2) were evaluated. Magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and computed tomography were performed at predetermined intervals before and after treatment until evidence of recurrence was seen, administration of additional antitumor treatment was performed, or a total of 3 years had elapsed.Results:DLT criteria were met at 60 mg/m(2), and the MTD was defined as 50 mg/m(2). RF ablation was performed during the peak of the plasma concentration-time curve in an effort to yield maximal drug deposition. LTLD produced reversible, dose-dependent neutropenia and leukopenia.Conclusions:LTLD can be safely administered systemically at the MTD (50 mg/m(2)) in combination with RF ablation, with limited and manageable toxicity. Further evaluation of this agent combined with RF ablation is warranted to determine its role in the management of liver tumors.
