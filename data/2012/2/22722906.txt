Background:Butein has been reported to prevent and partly reverse liver fibrosis in vivo; however, the mechanisms of its action are poorly understood. We, therefore, aimed to determine the antifibrotic potential of butein.Methods:We assessed the influence of the incubation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and hepatoma cells (HepG2) with butein on sensitivity to ethanol- or acetaldehyde-induced toxicity; the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); the expression of markers of HSC activation, including smooth muscle α-actin (α-SMA) and procollagen I; and the production of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), metalloproteinases-2 and -13 (MMP-2and MMP-13), and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). The influence of butein on intracellular signals in HSCs; i.e., nuclear factor-κB (NFκB), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) induced by ethanol was estimated.Results:Butein protected HSCs and HepG2 cells against ethanol toxicity by the inhibition of ethanol- or acetaldehyde-induced production of ROS when cells were incubated separately or in co-cultures; butein also inhibited HSC activation measured as the production of α-SMA and procollagen I. As well, butein downregulated ethanol- or acetaldehyde-induced HSC migration and the production of TGF-β, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2; decreased the activity of MMP-2; and increased the activity of MMP-13. In ethanol-induced HSCs, butein inhibited the activation of the p38 MAPK and JNK transduction pathways as well as significantly inhibiting the phosphorylation of NF κB inhibitor (IκB) and Smad3.Conclusions:The results indicated that butein inhibited ethanol- and acetaldehyde-induced activation of HSCs at different levels, acting as an antioxidant and inhibitor of ethanol-induced MAPK, TGF-β, and NFκB/IκB transduction signaling; this result makes butein a promising agent for antifibrotic therapies.
