Recognition of Helicobacter pylori as an important factor in genesis of gastric adenocarcinoma lead to a large number of studies concerning potential role of Helicobacter spp. in the development of extragastric digestive malignancies. The serological studies indicated possible localizations in the digestive system being from interest in enlightening Helicobacter spp. carcinogenic potential. The PCR obtruded itself as a gold standard in proving existence of actual correlation. In this review, the authors have examined studies conducted in the last 10 years examining Helicobacter spp. correlation with extragastric digestive carcinogenesis. Studies have been observed in four groups referring to hepatic carcinoma, bile duct cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colon cancer. The results of these researches have shown that there is a strong correlation between Helicobacter spp. colonization and primary liver tumors as well as bile duct tumors, whereas conclusions made by authors examining pancreatic cancer are contradictory and demands further investigation. No correlation between Helicobacter spp. and colon cancer have been proven. The PCR subtype most widely used in studies included in this review was nested PCR, whereas genes targeted most frequently for amplification are 16S rDNA of Helicobacter spp. and UreA gene or cagA gene of H. pylori. During the last 10 years PCR has proven itself as a sovereign method for Helicobacter spp. diagnostic in extragastric organs in the digestive system. Knowledge and experiences obtained in this domain could be encouraging for researchers in analogous fields of interest.
