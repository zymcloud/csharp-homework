Introduction:Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma is a rare form of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma, first recognized as a distinct entity in the Revised European-American Lymphoma classification. Typical presentation includes lymphomatous infiltration of spleen and liver, and peripheral lymphadenopathy is rarely seen. The prognosis is almost uniformly poor, and there are no prospective studies of treatment of HSTCL.Patients and methods:For this report, we conducted a retrospective review of all pts who underwent treatment for HSTCL at our institution. Individual chart review was performed to report clinical presentation, management, and outcome.Results:We identified 14 pts with HSTCL managed at our center, 7 of which remain alive with median follow-up of 65.6 months. Six of 7 received alternative induction chemotherapy regimens such as ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) or IVAC (ifosfamide, etoposide, high-dose cytarabine) as opposed to CHOP and all surviving pts had proceeded to undergo either autologous or allogeneic SCT.Conclusion:Our results suggest that use of non-CHOP induction regimen and early use of high dose therapy and SCT consolidation may translate to improved survival for pts with HSTCL.
