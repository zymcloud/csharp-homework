Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver metastases are an increasing problem worldwide. Non-invasive methods for the early detection of HCC and understanding of the tumor growth mechanisms are highly desirable. Both the diffusion-weighted (1)H (DWI) and (23)Na MRI reflect alterations in tissue compartment volumes in tumors, as well as physiological and metabolic transformation in cells. Effects of untreated growth on apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADC), single quantum (SQ) and triple quantum-filtered (TQF) (23)Na MRI were compared in intrahepatically and subcutaneously implanted HCCs in rats. Animals were examined weekly for 4 weeks after injection of N1S1 cells. ADC of intrahepatic HCC was 1.5-times higher compared to the nearby liver tissue, and with growth, the ADC did not increase. ADC of subcutaneous HCC was lower compared to intrahepatic HCC and it increased with growth. Untreated growth of both intrahepatic and subcutaneous HCCs was associated with an increase in SQ and TQF (23)Na signal intensity suggesting an increase in tissue Na(+) and intracellular Na(+) (Na(+)(i)), respectively, most likely due to an increase in relative extracellular space and Na(+)(i) concentration as a result of changes in tissue structure and cellular metabolism. Thus, SQ and TQF (23)Na MRI may be complementary to diffusion imaging in areas susceptible to motion for characterizing hepatic tumors and for other applications, such as, predicting and monitoring therapy response.
