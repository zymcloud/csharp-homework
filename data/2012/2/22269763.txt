Percutaneous procedures and endovascular prostheses are becoming increasingly frequent, replacing classic interventions, and new complications are now appearing. We report the case of a liver transplant patient with a stenosis in the anastomosis of the suprahepatic veins to inferior vena cava, treated by self-expanding prosthesis, who developed an aorto-right atrial fistula and an atrial septal defect. Open heart surgery was performed to correct the defects. Transthoracic echocardiogram 1 year later revealed no evidence of residual shunt.
