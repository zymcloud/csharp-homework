Curcumin (Cum), the principal polyphenolic curcuminoid, obtained from the turmeric rhizome Curcuma longa, is recently reported to have potential antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo. Docetaxel (Doc) is considered as first-line chemotherapy for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Here we report for the first time that Cum could synergistically enhance the in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy of Doc against lung cancer. In the current study, combination index (CI) is calculated in both in vitro and in vivo studies to determine the interaction between Cum and Doc. In the in vitro cytotoxicity test, media-effect analysis clearly indicated a synergistic interaction between Cum and Doc in certain concentrations. Moreover, in vivo evaluation further demonstrated the superior anticancer efficacy of Cum + Doc compared with Doc alone by intravenous delivery in an established A549 transplanted xenograft model. Results showed that Cum synergistically increased the efficacy of Doc immediately after 4 days of the initial treatment. Additionally, simultaneous administration of Cum and Doc showed little toxicity to normal tissues including bone marrow and liver at the therapeutic doses. Therefore, in vitro and in vivo evaluations demonstrated the satisfying synergistic antitumor efficacy of Cum and Doc against lung cancer and the introduction of Cum in traditional chemotherapy is a most promising way to counter the spread of non-small cell lung cancer.
