An 85-year-old man is presented, suffering end-stage metastasizing hepatocellular carcinoma with a disabling tumor mass of 5 cm in diameter on his forehead. The tumor emitted an extremely foul odor, very disconcerting to the patient and family. The tumor was excised under local anaesthesia. Histopathologic examination disclosed the astonishing diagnosis of an extremely rare lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the skin.
