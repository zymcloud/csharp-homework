Aim:To explore the clinical value of serum soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) in patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC) and its relationship with liver fibrosis.Methods:The serun sICAM-1, PC III, IV-C, LN and HA level of 45 cases of patients with PHC, 30 cases of benign tumor and 35 cases of healthy people were determined by ELISA, the relationship between sICAM-1 and liver fibrosis was analyzed.Results:The serum sICAM-1, PC III, IV-C, LN and HA levels of the PHC group were significantly higher than that of the benign tumor group and normal control group, compared the difference was significant (P0.05); The serum sICAM-1 was positively correlated with the PC III, IV-C, LN and HA (Î³= 0.683, 0.575, 0.573 and 0.539, PConclusion:Detection of serum sICAM-1 has important clinical significance for assessing the PHC patient's condition, early diagnosing and treating liver cancer.
