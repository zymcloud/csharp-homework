Aims:The study evaluated the role of increased intracellular nitric oxide (NO) concentration using NO donors or stably NO synthase-3 (NOS-3) overexpression during CD95-dependent cell death in hepatoma cells. The expression of cell death receptors and caspase activation, RhoA kinase activity, NOS-3 expression/activity, oxidative/nitrosative stress, and p53 expression were analyzed. The antitumoral activity of NO was also evaluated in the subcutaneous implantation of NOS-3-overexpressing hepatoma cells, as well NO donor injection into wild-type hepatoma-derived tumors implanted in xenograft mouse models.Results:NO donor increased CD95 expression and activation of caspase-8 and 3 in HepG2, Huh7, and Hep3B cells. NOS-3 overexpression increased oxidative/nitrosative stress, p53 and CD95 expression, cellular Fas-associated death domain (FADD)-like IL-1beta converting enzyme (FLICE) inhibitory protein long (cFLIP(L)) and its short isoform (cFLIP(S)) shift, and cell death in HepG2 (4TO-NOS) cells. The inhibition of RhoA kinase and p53 knockdown using RNA interference reduced cell death in 4TO-NOS cells. The supplementation with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) increased NOS-3 activity and cell death in 4TO-NOS cells. NOS-3 overexpression or NO donor injection into hepatoma-derived tumors reduced the size and increased p53 and cell death receptor expression in nude mice.Innovation and conclusions:The increase of intracellular NO concentration promoted oxidative and nitrosative stress, Rho kinase activity, p53 and CD95 expression, and cell death in cultured hepatoma cells. NOS-3-overexpressed HepG2 cells or intratumoral NO donor administration reduced tumor cell growth and increased the expression of p53 and cell death receptors in tumors developed in a xenograft mouse model.
