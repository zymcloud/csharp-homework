Rhenium-188 (188Re) is of widespread interest for treating various diseases because of its attractive physical and chemical properties. The routine preparation of therapeutic doses of 188Re-labelled tracers can result in significant radiation exposure to the operator. We studied the impact of automating the preparation of 188Re-Lipiodol on the radiochemist's exposure, as well as the importance of the model of syringe shielding. To monitor radiation exposure continuously readable electronic personal dosimeters were used. Thermoluminescence dosimeters were fixed to the probable most exposed fingers of the radiochemist during preparation of the radiotracer and during the syringing. Dose rates were measured using a Babyline. Automation of the synthesis reduced personal dose equivalents from 2.60±4.35 to 1.61±1.20 µSv/GBq [Hp(10)] and from 38.37±55.28 to 21.84±16.14 µSv/GBq [Hp(0.07)]. Dose to the extremities was also reduced (-80% for the right hand; -58% for the left one). The Lemer-Pax PSWG syringe shield led to a slightly lower dose to the hands compared with the Medisystem (1.1±0.27 vs. 1.34±0.6 mSv/GBq for the right finger). Automation of the synthesis leads to a significant decrease in radiation exposure to the operator. The Lemer-Pax PSWG syringe shield provides better hand protection than the smaller Medisystem Mediclic.
