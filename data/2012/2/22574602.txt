Objective:To investigate the reversing effects of curcumin on hepatocellular carcinoma drug resistance Bel7402/5-Fu cell line.Methods:Through the exposure to gradual increased concentrations of 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu), the cell line Bel7402 was induced to establish a multi-drug resistant sub-cell line Bel7402/5-Fu. The sensitivity to 6 chemotherapeutics of Bel7402 and Bel7402/5-Fu were detected using methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) and resistant index (RI) were calculated. The differences of the inhibition ratio of Bel7402/5-Fu by curcumin, 5-Fu, curcumin combined with 5-Fu were detected using MTT assay. The effects of curcumin, 5-Fu, curcumin combined with 5-Fu on the Bel7402/5-Fu apoptosis were detected using flow cytometry.Results:The Bel7402/5-Fu cell line showed multi-drug resistance (MDR) to various chemotherapeutics, with the highest RI shown of 5-Fu (being 109.55 +/- 14.30 times). The inhibition ratio of 5, 10, and 20 microg/mL curcumin combined with 5-Fu (50% IC50) was respectively 21.47% +/- 1.49%, 27.10% +/- 2.32%, and 59.37% +/- 2.45%. The Bel7402/5-Fu apoptosis ratio of 5, 10, and 20 microg/mL curcumin combined with 5-Fu (50% IC50) was 30.92% +/- 2.10%, 44.87% +/- 2.24%, and 50.36% +/- 2.58%, respectively, which was obviously higher than that of the curcumin group and the 5-Fu group. Besides, the apoptosis rate increased along with increased curcumin concentration in the range of 0 -20 microg/mL.Conclusion:Curcumin could induce the apoptosis of Bel7402/5-Fu. Meanwhile, it showed favorable reversing effects on MDR.
