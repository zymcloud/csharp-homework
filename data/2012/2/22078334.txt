Background:Residual tumor resection (RTR) after chemotherapy in patients with advanced germ cell tumors (GCT) is an important part of the multimodal treatment. To provide a complete resection of residual tumor, additional surgical procedures are sometimes necessary. In particular, additional vascular interventions are high-risk procedures that require multidisciplinary planning and adequate resources to optimize outcome.Objectives:The aim was to identify parameters that predict additional vascular procedures during RTR in GCT patients.Design, setting, and participants:A retrospective analysis was performed in 402 GCT patients who underwent 414 RTRs in 9 German Testicular Cancer Study Group (GTCSG) centers. Overall, 339 of 414 RTRs were evaluable with complete perioperative data sets.Measurements:The RTR database was queried for additional vascular procedures (inferior vena cava [IVC] interventions, aortic prosthesis) and correlated to International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) classification and residual tumor volume.Results and limitations:In 40 RTRs, major vascular procedures (23 IVC resections with or without prosthesis, 11 partial IVC resections, and 6 aortic prostheses) were performed. In univariate analysis, the necessity of IVC intervention was significantly correlated with IGCCCG (14.1% intermediate/poor vs 4.8% good; p=0.0047) and residual tumor size (3.7% size < 5 cm vs 17.9% size ≥ 5 cm; p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, IVC intervention was significantly associated with residual tumor size ≥ 5 cm (odds ratio [OR]: 4.61; p=0.0007). In a predictive model combining residual tumor size and IGCCCG classification, every fifth patient (20.4%) with a residual tumor size ≥ 5 cm and intermediate or poor prognosis needed an IVC intervention during RTR. The need for an aortic prosthesis showed no correlation to either IGCCCG (p=0.1811) or tumor size (p=0.0651).Conclusions:The necessity for IVC intervention during RTR is correlated to residual tumor size and initial IGCCCG classification. Patients with high-volume residual tumors and intermediate or poor risk features must initially be identified as high-risk patients for vascular procedures and therefore should be referred to specialized surgical centers with the ad hoc possibility of vascular interventions.
