Purpose:To assess the treatment response of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transarterial chemoembolization with diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with a 3-T system.Materials and methods:Between February 2010 and November 2010, 74 patients were treated with chemoembolization in our interventional radiology unit. Twenty-two patients (29%) who had liver MR imaging including diffusion and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging on a 3-T system before and after transarterial chemoembolization were evaluated retrospectively. Tumor size, arterial enhancement, venous washout, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of lesions, peritumoral parenchyma, normal liver parenchyma, and spleen were recorded before and after treatment. The significance of differences between ADC values of responding and nonresponding lesions was calculated.Results:The study included 77 HCC lesions (mean diameter, 31.4 mm) in 20 patients. There was no significant reduction in mean tumor diameter after treatment. Reduction in tumor enhancement in the arterial phase was statistically significant (P = .01). Tumor ADC value increased from 1.10 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s to 1.27 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s after treatment (P Conclusions:After transarterial chemoembolization, responding HCC lesions exhibited decreases in arterial enhancement and increases in ADC values in cellular and necrotic areas. Pretreatment ADC values were not predictive of response to chemoembolization.
