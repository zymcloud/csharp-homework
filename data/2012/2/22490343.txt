Objective:To explore and improve the diagnosis and treatment of benign hyperplasia tumor-like hepatic lesion.Methods:The clinical data of 72 patients who had undergone hepatic resection for benign non-cystic hepatic lesions between January 1987 and December 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. There were 46 male and 26 female patients. The median age was 49 years (ranging 15 to 72 years), and diagnosis were confirmed by postoperative pathological examination. Thirty-four cases had symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort in right upper quadrant, fever, fatigue. All the cases had undergone hepatic resection; totally 78 lesions were removed. The surgical procedure including hepatic lobectomy for 13 cases, hepatic segmentectomy for 19 cases and non-anatomy resection for 39 cases.Results:The finally diagnosis included focal nodular hyperplasia in 47 cases, adenomatous hyperplasia in 3 cases, hepatic dysplastic nodule in 3 cases, inflammatory pseudotumor in 3 cases, hepatic granuloma in 4 cases, nodular cirrhosis in 3 cases, hepatitis nodule in 6 cases, nodular regenerative hyperplasia in 1 case, lymphoid hyperplasia in 1 case. The postoperative complication rate was low (19.4%, 14/72). The follow-up period was 6 to 96 months. There was no mortality caused by lesion. One patient developed recurrence after 3 years.Conclusions:It is suggested that symptomatic lesions, lesions when malignancy cannot be excluded, and lesions which have canceration tendency, just like adenomatous hyperplasia, dysplastic nodule, and nodular cirrhosis regenerative hyperplasia need surgical resection. Operation is not necessary for other nodular hyperplasia lesions if the diagnoses are identified.
