NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver diseases including simple steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is characterized by inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning on a background of steatosis. NAFLD, the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, has become one of the most common causes of chronic liver diseases over the last decade in developed countries as well as in low and middle-income regions owing to dramatic epidemic proportions of obesity and diabetes worldwide. While simple steatosis has mostly a benign course, NASH can lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Insulin resistance is considered as the cornerstone in the development of NAFLD/NASH. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of NASH. However, non-invasive markers of NASH and fibrosis represent interesting tools to identify patients with severe liver injuries. Even if insulin sensitizers and hepatoprotective agents are promising drugs, no medication has been currently approved for the treatment of NASH. Diet, exercise and control of the metabolic disorders still represent crucial therapeutic options for the management of NAFLD/NASH.
