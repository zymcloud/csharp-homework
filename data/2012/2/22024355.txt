Several of the different bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are involved in development and progression of specific tumors. For hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) only BMP4 and BMP6 are described to be important for carcinogenesis. However, up to now neither the influence of other BMPs on tumor progression, nor the responsible signaling pathways to mediate target gene expression in HCC are known. In order to characterize BMP expression pattern in HCC cell lines, we performed RT-PCR analysis and revealed enhanced expression levels of several BMPs (BMP4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 15) in HCC. Thus, we treated HCC cells with the general BMP inhibitors chordin and noggin to determine the functional relevance of BMP overexpression and observed decreased migration and invasion of HCC cells. A cDNA microarray of noggin treated HCC cells was performed to analyze downstream targets of BMPs mediating these oncogenic functions. Subsequent analysis identified collagen XVI as 'Smad signaling specific' and nidogen-2 as 'MAPK/ERK signaling specific' BMP-target genes. To examine which signaling pathway is mainly responsible for the oncogenic role of BMPs in HCC, we treated HCC cells with dorsomorphin to determine the influence of BMP activated Smad signaling. Interestingly, also migratory and invasive behavior of dorsomorphin treated HCC cells was diminished. In summary, our findings demonstrate enhanced expression levels of several BMPs in HCC supporting enhanced migratory and invasive phenotype of HCC cells mainly via activation of Smad signaling.
