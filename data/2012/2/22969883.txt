The aim of this study was to characterize hepatocarcinogenesis in diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-treated hamsters. Syrian golden hamsters (n=36) were administered DEN by hypodermic injection and addition to drinking water. Morphological analyses, including light microscopy and immunohistochemistry of Î±-fetal protein (AFP), were performed on liver and lung tissues. Primary cell culture and tumor transplantation were carried out to evaluate the potential application in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) research. From 25 to 50 weeks of treatment, liver tumors, including macronodular HCC and ascites, were found in one-third (4/12) of the animals treated with DEN. HCC was characterized by poor differentiation, frequent mitosis, AFP reaction, vessel invasion and potential application in primary cell culture and xenotransplantation. Pre-neoplastic lesions were hyperplastic nodules comprised of clear cells, bile duct proliferation, fatty metamorphosis and multilocular cysts. The DEN-treated hamsters also showed lung tumors consisting of AFP-negative, well-differentiated neoplastic cells. Characterization of DEN-induced HCC in hamsters provides insights into human hepatocarcinogenesis. This animal model has potential applications in HCC research.
