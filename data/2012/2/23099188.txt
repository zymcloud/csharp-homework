Background & aims:HBV-related chronic liver disease is one of the most common indications for liver transplantation (LT) in Europe. The ELTR database was used to evaluate outcomes and evolution over 20 years (01/1988 and 12/2010).Methods:HBV transplanted patients were analysed according to indication for LT: decompensated cirrhosis (HBVdec) or hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV/HCC). These groups were compared with co-infected patients HBV/HDV (HBDV), HBV/HCV (HBCV), HBV/HDV/HCV (HBDCV); n = 16,664 and with HCV patients (n = 2452) according to LT indication.Results:5912 patients were transplanted for HBV (78% HBVdec, 22% HBV/HCC), with HBV/HCC patients who increased from 15.8% in 1988-1995 to 29.6% in 2006-2010 (p Conclusions:Outcomes of LT for HBV have improved in recent years, with disease recurrence being no longer a significant cause of death/graft loss. HBV-DNA at the time of LT seems to influence survival only in HBV/HCC patients.
