Background:Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common solid tumors. It is always associated with prolonged hospital stay, increased attributable mortality, and greater hospitalization cost. To identify new biomarkers that could improve the early diagnosis in hepatocellular carcinoma, we performed a proteomic study.Methods:Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) were used to compare the serum protein profiles between patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and healthy volunteers.Results:Eight protein spots were found significantly changed in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Among them, four proteins were successfully identified, including MYH2 protein, mitochondrial ATP synthase, sulfated glycoprotein-2 (SGP-2), and Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The increased levels of SGP-2 were further confirmed by Western blot analysis from independent series of serum samples.Conclusions:These results indicate that MYH2 protein, mitochondrial ATP synthase, SGP-2, and GFAP may be potential molecular biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma, and special attention should be cast on MYH2 protein.
