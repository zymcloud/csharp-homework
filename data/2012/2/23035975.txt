Purpose:To evaluate the efficacy of erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma receptors B4 (EphB4) knockdown on the development of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in vivo.Methods:We constructed recombinant lentiviral vectors (Lv) Lv-shRNA-EphB4 to specifically knock down the expression of EphB4. The mRNA and protein expression of EphB4 was investigated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot. CNV was induced by laser photocoagulation in C57BL/6 mice. The mice were then randomly assigned to be intravitreally injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Lv-shRNA-EphB4 recombinant lentivirus, or an unrelated shRNA recombinant lentivirus (pFU LV-shRNA-NC). An uninjected group was used as the control. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), histologic analysis, and choroidal flat mounts analysis were applied to evaluate the inhibition of CNV after an intravitreal injection.Results:Transfection of Lv-shRNA-EphB4 led to the knockdown of EphB4, and EphB4 mRNA was down-regulated by about 80%. FFA and histologic analysis revealed that the leakage areas and the mean thickness of CNV were much smaller in the Lv-shRNA-EphB4 group than in the PBS-treated, pFU Lv-shRNA-NC group and the non-injection group. Choroidal flat mounts showed significantly less leakage and smaller leakage areas in the Lv-shRNA-EphB4 group than those in other groups.Conclusion:Knocking down the expression of EphB4 exerts an inhibitory effect on CNV in vivo. It may provide a potential strategy for the treatment of CNV.
