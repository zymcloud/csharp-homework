Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO), one of the receptor types of phosphotyrosine phosphatases (PTP), was recently described as a tumor suppressor in various kinds of cancers. We aimed to clarify the role of PTPRO in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It was demonstrated in 180 pairs (120 male and 60 female) of clinical HCC specimens that the PTPRO level was significantly reduced, as compared with adjacent tissue, and the PTPRO level in male adjacent tissue was lower than in female. We further found that estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) could up-regulate PTPRO expression as a transcription factor. Moreover, an in vitro study showed that cell proliferation was inhibited and apoptosis was promoted in PTPRO-transduced HCC cell lines, whereas an in vivo study represented that tumor number and size was increased in ptpro(-/-) mice. As a result of its tumor-suppressive position, PTPRO was proved to down-regulate signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT3) activity dependent on Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) dephosphorylation.Conclusions:PTPRO expression results in pathological deficiency and gender bias in HCC, which could be attributed to ERα regulation. The suppressive role of PTPRO in HCC could be ascribed to STAT3 inactivation.
