Background & aims:To compare the survival between surgical resection (SR) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) very early/early stage.Methods:Between 2002 and 2009, patients with newly diagnosed BCLC very early/early stage HCC who received SR or RFA were enrolled. Medical records were reviewed. The cumulative overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared.Results:A total of 605 patients, including 143 very early (SR: 52; RFA: 91) and 462 early stages (SR: 208; RFA: 254) were enrolled. For very early stage, the 3- and 5-year OS rates were 98% and 91.5% for SR, and 80.3% and 72% for RFA, respectively (p=0.073). The 3- and 5-year DFS rates were 62.1% and 40.7% for SR, and 39.8% and 29.3% for RFA, respectively (p=0.006). Either multiple adjustment by Cox model or match analysis based on propensity score showed no significant difference in OS between the two groups. For early stage, the 3- and 5-year OS rates were 87.8% and 77.2% for SR, and 73.5% and 57.4% for RFA, respectively (p=0.001). The 3- and 5-year DFS rates were 59.9% and 50.8% for SR, and 28.3% and 14.1% for RFA, respectively (pConclusions:For HCC patients in BCLC very early/early stage, there was no significant difference in OS between SR and RFA. However, SR yielded better DFS than RFA.
