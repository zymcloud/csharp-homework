A growing body of data indicates that inhibiting the type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) might be an effective treatment strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). OSI-906 is a dual IGF-1R/IR kinase inhibitor currently in phase II clinical development for HCC. However, biomarkers are lacking to help identify patients with HCC who are more likely to benefit from OSI-906 treatment. We sought to determine the effect of OSI-906 on proliferation against a panel of 21 HCC cell lines and to investigate molecular determinants of responsiveness to OSI-906. We identified a subset of HCC cell lines that was sensitive to OSI-906, and sensitivity is associated with elevated phosphorylation levels of IGF-1R and IR and greater inhibition of AKT signaling. Dual targeting of both receptors seems to be important for maximal inhibition as treatment with a selective IGF-1R-neutralizing antibody was associated with increased IR signaling, whereas OSI-906 fully inhibited both phosphorylated IR and IGF-1R and resulted in greater inhibition of the IRS/AKT pathway. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) seems to predict HCC cell sensitivity to OSI-906, as the epithelial phenotype is strongly associated with expression of IGF-2 and IR, activation of IGF-1R and IR, and sensitivity to OSI-906, alone or in combination with erlotinib. Induction of EMT upon treatment with TGFÎ² reduced sensitivity to OSI-906. Collectively, these data support the concept for dual IGF-1R/IR targeting in HCC, where EMT status and expressions of IGF-2 and IR may be used to identify those patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment with an IGF-1R/IR dual inhibitor.
