Association studies on the X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) polymorphisms (Arg194Trp, Arg280His, and Arg399Gln) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have shown conflicting results. The aim of this study was to quantitatively summarize the evidence for such a relationship. Published literatures from PubMed, Embase, CNKI, and Chinese Biomedicine Database were retrieved. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) was calculated using fixed- or random-effects model. Thirteen studies including 3,011 HCC cases and 3,619 controls were included in the meta-analysis of the association between XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism and HCC risk. The results indicated that Arg399Gln polymorphism was significantly associated with risk of HCC in a codominant model (Gln/Gln vs. Arg/Arg, OR = 1.32, 95 % CI = 1.08-1.61; Arg/Gln vs. Arg/Arg, OR = 1.41, 95 % CI = 1.12-1.80) and a dominant model (Gln/Gln + Arg/Gln vs. Arg/Arg, OR = 1.39, 95 % CI = 1.15-1.69), but not in a recessive model (Gln/Gln vs. Arg/Gln + Arg/Arg, OR = 1.13, 95 % CI = 0.95-1.35). Limiting the analysis to the studies within Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the results were persistent and robust. When stratifying for region and source of controls, persistent results were observed in any subgroup. No evidence of association of Arg194Trp (980 HCC cases and 966 controls) and Arg280His (1,200 HCC cases and 1,236 controls) with HCC risk was found. No publication bias was found in the present study. The results from the present meta-analysis indicated that the Arg399Gln polymorphisms of XRCC1 may be a genetic susceptibility for HCC in the East Asian population. Further, large and well-designed studies are needed to confirm this conclusion.
