We investigated soluble human leukocyte antigen-G (sHLA-G) expression according to the phases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 267 sera from anti-HBs positive healthy individuals (n = 50), chronic HBV carriers (n = 45), as well as patients with active hepatitis B (n = 46), liver cirrhosis (LC, n = 46) and early stage HCC (n = 80) were collected and assayed for sHLA-G. Relationships between sHLA-G levels and clinicopathologic parameters including HCC stages, differentiation grades, and levels of aminotransferases, HBV DNA and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were assessed. Concentrations of sHLA-G were higher in the active hepatitis B and HCC groups (median sHLA-G 53.7 and 178.8 U/ml, respectively) in comparison to other groups (P
