As transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy is an effective locoregional treatment for patients with advanced liver cancer, prognostic biomarkers are highly needed for pretherapeutic stratification of patients to TACE therapy. Sera of 50 prospectively and consecutively included patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing TACE were taken before and 24 h after TACE application. Levels of liver-specific, tumor-related, and cell death biomarkers were analyzed and correlated with overall patient survival. The study was particularly focused on patients treated by TACE with palliative intention (N = 38). Sixteen of 38 patients died within 1 year after TACE, 22 were still alive. In univariate analysis, high levels of cytokeratin 19-fragments (CYFRA 21-1), alpha fetoprotein (AFP), and low choline esterase (CHE) levels measured before and 24 h after TACE were correlated with unfavorable outcome. Further high pretherapeutic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate-aminotransferase, and bilirubin levels as well as high 24 h C-reactive protein values were associated with poor survival. In multivariate analysis of clinical and only pretherapeutic biomarkers, AFP, CHE, and LDH showed to be independent prognostic parameters. When additionally 24 h values were included, CHE (24 h) and AFP (24 h) were the strongest independent prognostic biomarkers with a slightly higher prognostic power (Akaike's information criterion 90.3 vs. 92.7). The combination of AFP, CHE, and LDH enables efficient pretherapeutic stratification of HCC patients in advanced tumor stage for TACE therapy.
