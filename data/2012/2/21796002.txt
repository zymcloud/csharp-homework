Background:Kringle 1-5 (K1-5) is a potent antiangiogenesis factor for treating breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its use in treating brain tumors has not been studied.Objective:To evaluate whether K1-5 is effective at treating gliomas.Methods:The effects of K1-5 on cell morphology and cytotoxicity with or without lipopolysaccharide were tested in primary mixed neuronal-glial cultures. The antiglioma activity of K1-5 was evaluated by intra-arterial administration of K1-5 at 4 days after implantation of C6 glioma cells into the rat hippocampus. In 1 group of animals, tumor size, tumor vasculature, and tumor histology were evaluated on day 12. Animal survival was assessed in the other group.Results:In vitro studies showed that K1-5 did not induce cytotoxicity in neurons and glia. In vivo studies demonstrated that K1-5 reduced vessel length and vessel density and inhibited perivascular tumor invasion. In addition, K1-5 normalized vessel morphology, decreased expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± and vascular endothelial growth factor, decreased tumor hypoxia, and decreased pseudopalisading necrosis. The average tumor volume was smaller in the treated than in the untreated group. Furthermore, animals treated with K1-5 survived significantly longer.Conclusion:Kringle 1-5 effectively reduces the growth of malignant gliomas in the rat. Although still far from translation in humans, K1-5 might be a possible future alternative treatment option for patients with gliomas.
