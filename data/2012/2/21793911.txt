Background and aim:We investigated the prognosis of patients with C-viral chronic liver disease (C-CLD) according to the efficacy of interferon (IFN) therapy in a long-term retrospective cohort study.Methods:Of 721 patients with C-CLD who underwent liver biopsy between January 1986 and December 2005, 577 were treated with IFN, and 221 of these patients achieved sustained virological response (SVR) with a follow-up period of 9.9 Â± 5.3 years.Results:The annual rate of HCC development was 2.71%/year, 2.31%/year, and 0.24%/year in untreated, non-SVR, and SVR patients, respectively. Multivariate Cox proportional regression analysis showed that the risk of HCC development was significantly lower in SVR patients than in untreated or non-SVR patients; moreover, this risk was similar in non-SVR patients and untreated patients. The annual mortality rate in overall death was 3.19%/year, 1.98%/year, and 0.44%/year in untreated, non-SVR, and SVR patients, respectively. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that the SVR status reduced the risk ratio for overall death to 0.173, whereas the non-SVR status did not significantly reduce the risk ratio.Conclusions:The risk ratio of overall death and HCC development was significantly reduced in SVR patients, whereas no significant reduction was found in non-SVR patients in a long-term cohort study.
