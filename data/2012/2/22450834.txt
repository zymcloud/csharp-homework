A 25-year-old man presented to a local clinic with right flank pain and gross hematuria. Computed tomography revealed the right renal tumor and he was referred to our hospital. Laparoscopic radical nephrectomy was performed and diagnosis of Bellini collecting duct carcinoma was made pathologically. Adjuvant therapy with interferon-Î±, followed by a gemcitabine and cisplatin-based regimen of chemotherapy was performed, but the disease progressed. Sunitinib was started 14 months after the operation. After one course of sunitinib, mental status was altered due to hypercalcemia (serum calcium level was 18.6 mg/dl and PTH-rP was 3.7 pmol/l). Level of consciousness recovered along with decreasing serum calcium level, but he died of multiple organ dysfunction 17 months after the operation. Autopsy showed liver, bone, lymph node, mediastinum and left adrenal tumor metastases.
