S-CKD602 is a pegylated long-circulating liposomal formulation of CKD-602, a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor. A population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for encapsulated and released CKD-602 following administration of S-CKD602 was developed to assess factors that may influence S-CKD602 PK. Plasma samples from 45 patients with solid tumors were collected in a phase 1 study. S-CKD602 was administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion with doses ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 mg/m(2) . Plasma concentrations of encapsulated and released CKD-602 were used to develop a population PK model using NONMEM. PK of encapsulated CKD-602 was described by a 1-compartment model with nonlinear clearance, and PK of released CKD-602 was described by a 2-compartment model with linear clearance for all patients. Covariate analysis revealed that tumor in the liver was a significant covariate for clearance of encapsulated CKD-602 and that age significantly influenced the release rate of CKD-602 from S-CKD602. Maximum elimination rate in patients with liver tumor is 1.5-fold higher compared with patients without liver tumor. Release rate of CKD-602 from S-CKD602 in patients less than 60 years old was 2.7-fold higher compared with patients 60 years old or older. These observations have potential implications in the optimal dosing of liposomal agents.
