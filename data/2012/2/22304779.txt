Aim:To prepare anti-PES1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and detect the PES1 expression in several kinds of human cancer cell lines and its tissue distribution in the adult rat.Methods:pGEX-PES1(1-322aa) fusion protein was purified and inject-ed into mice for immunization. Anti-PES1 mAb was produced by cell fusion and screening after immunization. Anti-PES1 mAb was identified by Western blot. Several human cancer cell lines and different tissue samples of adult rat were detected the PES1 expressions with the mAb prepared.Results:Aanti-PES1 mAb was determined to be specific to PES1 with Western blot analysis. PES1 were expressed in all kinds of breast, ovary, liver and lung cancer cell lines detected in different levels with prepared mAb. Pescadillo was obviously expressed in the breast and ovary but not other tissues of adult rat using prepared mAb.Conclusion:Anti-PES1 mAb was successfully prepared. PES1 may play an important role in the tumorigenicity and may also play a role in the pathway of estrogen since breast and ovary, the most important estrogen target organ of adult rat, obviously express pesca-dillo.
