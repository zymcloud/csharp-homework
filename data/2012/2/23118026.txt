Deregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is linked to a broad range of cancers, stressing the necessity of studying their regulatory pathways. We and others demonstrated previously that c-Cbl is necessary for the lysosomal degradation of erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular B1 (EphB1) carcinoma and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) RTKs. Moreover, the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) was shown to modulate c-Cbl-dependent EGFR degradation. We therefore investigated the involvement of PTEN in EphB1 signaling and degradation. We used PTEN mutants, PTEN, and NHERF1 small interfering RNA in CHO-EphB1 and SW480 cells endogenously expressing EphB1 to delineate EphB1-PTEN interactions. PTEN was constitutively associated with c-Cbl, protecting it from degradation. EphB1 stimulation triggered âˆ¼50% serine-threonine PTEN dephosphorylation and PTEN-Cbl complex disruption, a process requiring PTEN protein phosphatase activity. Both proteins independently translocated to EphB1, with PTEN in association with the scaffold protein NHERF1. Biologically, PTEN lipid phosphatase activity impairs EphB1-dependent cell adhesion and chemotaxis. This study demonstrates for the first time in mammalian cells that the Eph receptor and PTEN associate and influence their signaling. Moreover, it contributes to the emerging concept that PTEN regulates expression of RTKs through modulation of their degradation. Finally, it reveals a new role for PTEN protein phosphatase activity involved in this process.
