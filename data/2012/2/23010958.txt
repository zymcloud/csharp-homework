Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate the symptom and symptom clusters of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) before and after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), and to discuss the relationship between symptoms, symptom clusters, and symptom interference.Materials and methods:Patients with HCC who received TACE were asked to rate their symptoms using the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory and the symptom checklist particularly for HCC. To determine the interrelationships among symptoms and identify the symptom clusters, a principal component analysis with varimax rotation was carried out on the symptom items. Spearman correlation analysis was done to assess the relationship between symptom clusters and symptom interference.Results:A total of 155 patients finished the whole procedure between November 2010 and May 2011. Before TACE, the five most severe symptoms, ranked in order, were fatigue (3.40 ± 2.26), distress (3.35 ± 2.60), sadness (3.01 ± 2.66), sleep disturbance (2.63 ± 2.57), and lack of appetite (2.26 ± 2.38). After TACE, fatigue (4.88 ± 2.31) was the most serious symptom, followed by sleep disturbance (4.80 ± 2.25), distress (4.59 ± 2.32), sadness (4.45 ± 2.16), lack of appetite (4.25 ± 2.51). Two symptom clusters were found before TACE: psychological symptom cluster and sickness symptom cluster. Two new symptom clusters were found after TACE: upper gastrointestinal symptom cluster and liver function impairment symptom cluster, with the two original symptom clusters remained relatively stable. The highest symptom interference items pre- and post-TACE were work and enjoyment of life, followed by mood. The symptoms of distress, sadness, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and lack of appetite were all significantly associated with the total interference (r = 0.443-0.615, p Conclusion:Psychological symptom cluster and sickness symptom cluster are common for HCC patients before and after TACE. Liver function impairment and upper gastrointestinal symptom clusters are directly related to TACE treatment. Both the symptoms and symptom clusters have significant interference on the daily life of HCC patients undergoing TACE. However, more work is needed to further clarify the symptom clusters associated with TACE and to test the effectiveness of TACE in easing symptoms and improving quality of life of HCC patients.
