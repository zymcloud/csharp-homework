Background:The brother of the regulator of imprinted sites (BORIS) is a novel member of the cancer testis antigen gene family, which are normally expressed only in spermatocytes, but abnormally activated in different malignancies.Aim:The aim of this study was to explore the expression of BORIS in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its correlation with the clinicopathologic features and prognosis of HCC.Methods:We investigated BORIS expression in HCC cell lines and 105 primary HCC clinical surgical specimens using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. We further examined the correlation of BORIS with a liver stem cell marker (CD90) in HCC tissues by histochemical double staining. The correlation of BORIS with clinicopathologic features and prognosis of HCC was analyzed using patient data.Results:The expression of BORIS was found in SMMC-7721, BEL-7402, and Huh-7, but not in hep-G2 cells. The expression rate of BORIS was significantly higher in the HCC tissues than in the adjacent noncancerous tissues (p=0.000). BORIS expression was correlated with the tumor size (p=0.000), CD90 expression (p=0.000), and satellite nodule (p=0.000). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients with positive expression of BORIS had lower overall survival rate (p=0.003).Conclusions:Our data indicate that BORIS may be an auxiliary diagnosis index and a novel favorable prognostic indicator of HCC.
