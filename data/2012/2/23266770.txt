Heat shock protein 72 (HSP72) and glycoprotein 96 (gp96) are highly expressed in cancer tissues. Recent studies indicate the possible roles of HSP72 and gp96 in the development and progression of gastrointestinal carcinomas but detailed mechanisms are still ambiguous. Human esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer and liver cancer are common gastrointestinal malignant carcinomas in the world. The studies indicated that there existed a significant correlation between the expression of HSP72, gp96 and the development and progression of digestive carcinomas. HSP72 and gp96 expression were significantly associated with the presence of tumor infiltration, lymph node and remote metastasis. Interestingly, studies have found that HSP72 chaperoned alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), HBx in hepatocellular carcinoma, and CD44 in colonic carcinomas. The further researches demonstrated that HSP72-AFP or gp96-AFP recombined vaccine could elicit specific anti-tumor immunity. The high-level expression of HSP72 and gp96 may be not only used as diagnostic or prognostic markers for gastrointestinal carcinomas but also as better immunotherapeutic vaccines in the cancers.
