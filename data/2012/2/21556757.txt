CXCL14 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 14) is a conserved member of chemokine family and functions as a chemoattractant for multiplicate immunocytes. CXCL14 expression is constitutive in normal tissues, but absent in wide range of epithelial tumors. Many reports have claimed its important role in tumorigenesis and vascularization. An association between rs2237062 polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) susceptibility was found in patients with chronic HCV infection in Japanese population. Here we analyzed, by using a polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR), the polymorphism in 202 non-HCC patients with HBV infection, 361 HBV-related HCC patients and 407 healthy controls. The aim was to detect the possible association of this single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with HBV-related HCC susceptibility and progression. However, no association was found between rs2237062 polymorphism and susceptibility to HBV infection or HBV-related HCC. Intriguingly, our stratification analysis revealed that HBV-related HCC patients in advanced phase (TNM-II-IV stage) had significantly higher C allele frequency at this polymorphism than patients at early stage (TNM-I stage) (33.5% vs. 25.7%), and its odds ratio reached 1.47 (95% CI 1.06-2.04, P = 0.021). These results suggest that the rs2237062 polymorphism in the CXCL14 gene might influence HBV-related HCC progression in Chinese population.
