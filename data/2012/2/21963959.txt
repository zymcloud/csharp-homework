Background & aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive tumor that frequently develops in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). We determined the mortality of patients with PBC who develop HCC, and which interventions (surgery, radiofrequency ablation, chemoembolization, alcohol injection, or transplantation) increase survival times. We investigated whether the Milan criteria predict outcomes of these patients and are effective in selection for liver transplantation.Methods:We evaluated data from 38 patients who had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC and HCC between March 1993 and February 2011. Patients were grouped based on whether or not they met the Milan criteria. Survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier analysis.Results:Eighteen of the 38 patients (47.3%) died during the follow-up period; 49.4% survived for 5 years and 31.7% survived for 10 years. Thirty-five patients (92.0%) underwent one or a combination of interventions. Liver transplantation improved survival (risk ratio, 0.06; P Conclusions:Five- and 10-year survival times for patients with PBC who developed HCC were 49.4% and 31.7%, respectively. Patients who meet the Milan criteria receive liver transplantation as often as those who do not; we did not observe a difference in survival time between groups. Patients with PBC who develop HCC appear to benefit from aggressive therapies.
