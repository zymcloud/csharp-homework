microRNAs (miRNAs) are negative regulators of gene expression and can function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Several miRNAs are associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). miR-96 has been closely associated with cell proliferation and clonogenicity. Upregulation of miR-96 has been observed in various types of cancer. However, the biological function of miR-96 in hepatocarcinogenesis remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-96 was upregulated in HCC and inhibition of miR-96 significantly suppressed HCC cell proliferation and colony formation. The expression levels of forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) and forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a) were upregulated when miR-96 was inhibited in HCC cells and the inhibition of FOXO1 and FOXO3a promoted HCC cell proliferation and colony formation. Collectively, these data reveal an important contribution of miR-96 to hepatocarcinogenesis and suggest a role for FOXO1 and FOXO3a dysregulation in this process. Thus, the use of a synthetic inhibitor of miR-96 may be a promising approach for the treatment of HCC.
