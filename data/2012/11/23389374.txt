Background:Colon cancer during pregnancy is a relatively rare occurrence. To date there has been sparse clinical evidence about the safety of chemotherapy in this setting because the available data derive only from single-institution case reports.Methods:Irinotecan and fluorouracil, as part of the FOLFIRI regimen, were administered to a 33-year-old pregnant woman at an estimated gestational age of 23+ weeks. She had been diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the transverse colon with liver and lymph node metastases.Results:Chemotherapy was administered from the 23+th to the 28+th week of gestational age. Chemotherapy was stopped because of disease progression. At 30 weeks' gestational age, the patient underwent an emergency cesarean section and colon resection. She gave birth to a healthy male infant with no particular problems in neurological, respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive and nutritional function. At follow-up, the 13-month-old child had achieved all appropriate growth and developmental milestones.Conclusions:Our report demonstrates the safety of exposure to FOLFIRI for both mother and fetus. The absence of any abnormalities in the infant makes irinotecan and fluorouracil a valid therapeutic option for colon cancer during pregnancy.
