To investigate the expression and role of PAR-2 in the proliferation of the human hepatoma cell line HepG2, PAR-2 protein and mRNA expression were evaluated by immuno-histochemistry, immunofluorescence and RT-PCR analysis. The signaling pathways downstream of PAR-2 activation that lead to hepatoma cell proliferation were analyzed. The results showed that PAR-2 is expressed in human hepatoma cells and PAR-2 mRNA expression was found to be upregulated in cells treated with trypsin or SLIGKV-NH2 (P
