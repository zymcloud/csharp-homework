Backgrounds/aims:To evaluate the effect of early enteral nutrition after hepatectomy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients on postoperative gastrointestinal motility recovery and admission days, liver function and nutrition recovery, and postoperative complication.Methods:From August 2010 to July 2011, 102 patients with primary HCC underwent hepatectomy. Forty two patients took a sip of water (SOW) at postoperative day (POD)#1, soft blended diet (SBD) at POD#2 (early diet group, ED group), otherwise 60 patients took a SOW at POD#3, SBD at POD#4 (conventional diet group, CD group). Postoperative flatus-pass day, stool-pass day, nausea, vomiting, admission days, immediate postoperative (POD#0) and POD#1, 3, 5, 7 profiles of albumin, prothrombin time (PT) INR, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), white blood cell (WBC), and POD#1, 3, 5, 7 profiles of C-reactive protein (CRP), and postoperative complications cases were compared between ED group and CD group. All clinical data were compared retrospectively.Results:Flatus-pass days (pConclusions:ED group had no difference in nutritional recovery and postoperative complication rates compared to CD group but it has better gastrointestinal motility recovery, liver function recovery, and shorter postoperative admission days.
Early diet; Early recovery after surgery; Gastrointestinal motility; Liver function; Postoperative admission days.
