Purpose:Radiofrequency ablation(RFA) is minimally invasive and is easy to perform. In the RFA procedure, puncture and passing of the electrical current are painful. Therefore, some facilities use general anesthesia for RFA. In order to evaluate the use of general anesthesia for RFA of hepatocellular carcinoma, a questionnaire survey was conducted.Methods:With the cooperation of Tokyo liver-tomo-no-kai(Tokyo Liver Association), a questionnaire survey was conducted for patients who underwent RFA. In the survey, data on the following were obtained "type of anesthesia used", "number of RFA treatment points", "duration of treatment", "length of impact of pain", and "if you need to receive RFA treatment again, how would you feel about this."Results:The ratio of local anesthesia (LA) to general anesthesia (GA) was 113:24. The ratios of the numbers of patients who felt pain to those who felt no pain were 64:49 (LA) and 0:24 (GA). The ratios of the patients who wished to not receive RFA again to the patients who were comfortable with receiving RFA were 65:45 (LA) and 4:20 (GA).Conclusion:GA achieves better pain control compared to LA, and the patients who receive GA have greater tolerance of RFA.
