This study investigated the effect of piperine on the gene expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) as well as pregnane-X-receptor (PXR) activity and also its implication on the bioavailability of diltiazem, a P-gp substrate. The effect of piperine on the systemic exposure of diltiazem was examined in rats after the intravenous and oral administration of diltiazem with/without 2 week pretreatment with piperine. Compared with the control group given diltiazem (20 mg/kg) alone, the pretreatment with piperine (10 or 20 mg/kg, once daily for 2 weeks) decreased the oral exposure of diltiazem by 36-48% in rats. Consequently, the bioavailability of oral diltiazem was significantly lower (p < 0.05) after the 2 week pretreatment with piperine. The pretreatment with piperine for 2 weeks also reduced the systemic exposure of desacetyldiltiazem, a major active metabolite of diltiazem by approximately 73%, accompanied by a significant decrease in the metabolite-parent ratio. In contrast to the oral pharmacokinetics, piperine did not affect the intravenous pharmacokinetics of diltiazem in rats. Immunoblot analysis indicated that the protein expression level of intestinal P-gp was significantly enhanced after the 2 week pretreatment with piperine in rats. In addition, piperine increased the PXR reporter activity in human hepatoma cells. Taken together, the 2 week pretreatment with piperine significantly induced intestinal P-gp expression in conjunction with stimulated PXR activity and decreased the oral exposure of diltiazem and desacetyldiltiazem in rats.
