To investigate the influence of bear bile on rat hepatocarcinoma induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN), a total of 40 rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: normal control group, model group, and two bear bile treatment groups. The rat liver cancer model was induced by breeding with water containing 100 mg x L(-1) DEN for 14 weeks. The rats of the bear bile groups received bear bile powder (200 or 400 mg x kg(-1)) orally 5 times per week for 18 weeks. The general condition and the body weight of rats were examined every day. After 18 weeks the activities of serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and total bilirubin (TBIL) were detected. Meanwhile, the pathological changes of liver tissues were observed after H&E staining. The expression of proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and a-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) in liver tissue were detected by immunohistochemical method. After 4 weeks the body weights of rats in normal group were significantly more than that in other groups (P
