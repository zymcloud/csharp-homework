We report a case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with multiple lymph node (LN) metastases. A 68-year-old man underwent hepatectomy at our hospital. Intrahepatic recurrence and swelling of multiple LNs were detected by enhanced CT 21 months later. FDG-PET was positive for multiple swollen LNs, but all were negative for the intrahepatic recurrences. Biopsy of para-aortic LNs was revealed LN metastases from HCC. Immunohistochemically, the LN metastases were composed of poorly differentiated HCC. The sensitivity of FDG-PET in patients with HCC varies in relation to degree of differentiation and decreased FDG uptake must be noted.
