Advances in molecular cell biology over the last decade have clarified the mechanisms involved in cancer growth, invasion, and metastasis, and enabled the development of molecular-targeted agents. To date, sorafenib is the only molecular-targeted agent whose survival benefit has been demonstrated in two global phase III randomized controlled trials, and has been approved worldwide. Phase III clinical trials of other molecular targeted agents comparing them with sorafenib as first-line treatment agents are ongoing. Those agents target the vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor receptors, as well as target the epidermal growth factor receptor, insulin-like growth factor receptor and mammalian target of rapamycin, in addition to other molecules targeting other components of the signal transduction pathways. In addition, the combination of sorafenib with standard treatment, such as resection, ablation, transarterial embolization, and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy are ongoing. This review outlines the main pathways involved in the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma and the new agents that target these pathways. Finally, the current statuses of clinical trials of new agents or combination therapy with sorafenib and standard treatment will also be discussed.
