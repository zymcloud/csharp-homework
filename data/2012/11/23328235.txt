Objective:To evaluate the clinical value of radiofrequency ablation with retroperitoneal metastatic lymph nodes from primary hepatic carcinoma (PHC).Methods:Thirty-two patients with retroperitoneal metastatic lymph node recurrence from PHC were enrolled in our study and the patients were stratified into two groups based on the treatment. Nineteen patients in Group A were percutaneously treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with computed tomographic (CT) guidance. Thirteen patients in Group B only underwent RFA for hematogenous metastases, but did not undergo any other treatment for metastatic lymph nodes. Follow-up contrast material-enhanced CT or positron emission tomographic(PET) scans were reviewed and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were analyzed.Results:The local control rate of 3, 6, 10, 15 months in Group A was 78.9%, 73.3%, 41.7%, 25.0% respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated the patients of Group A had an overall survival of 26.3% at one year compared with 7.7% for those of Group B. Mantel-Cox log rank test showed the one-year survival rate of Group A was significantly higher than that of Group B (P = 0.029). There was no thermal injury of gastrointestinal tract or bile duct during RF ablation in Group A.Conclusion:CT-guided RFA are effective and may be safely applied to retroperitoneal metastatic lymph nodes from PHC.
