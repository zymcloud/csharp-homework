Human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep G2 cells and Hep G2-bearing mice were used as in vitro and in vivo models to assess the efficacy and safety of MAP30, a natural component from Momordica charantia, as an anticancer agent against liver cancer. Molecular studies disclosed the contribution of both caspase-8 regulated extrinsic and caspase-9 regulated intrinsic caspase cascades in MAP30-induced cell apoptosis. The antitumor potential was also effective in Hep G2-bearing nude mice. Since bitter gourd is a staple in many Asian countries, MAP30 would serve as a novel and relatively safe agent for prophylaxis and treatment of liver cancer.
