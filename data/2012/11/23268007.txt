A 73-year-old man, who had a left nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma at the age of 58, visited our hospital for the treatment of 2 right lung tumors. Both tumors were resected. Immunopathology showed that one of these was a metastatic tumor from renal cell carcinoma, and the other was a primary lung adenocarcinoma. Four years later, a follows-up computed tomography showed a hypervascular nodule in the body of the pancreas. Distal pancreatectomy and spleenectomy were performed, and histopathological analysis revealed that the tumor was a metastasis from renal cell carcinoma. Three months after surgery, multiple liver metastases were discovered, and molecular-targeted therapy was started. If a distant metastasis from renal cell carcinoma can be resected completely, it has been reported that a good long-term prognosis can be expected. Therefore, postoperative long-term follow-up after resection of the renal cell carcinoma is essential, and if possible, the resection of metastasis should be considered.
