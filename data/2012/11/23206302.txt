Objective:To study the relationship between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the interaction of polymorphisms in the NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) gene with environmental factors using a hospital-based case-control study. FMETHODS: our-hundred newly diagnosed HCC cases and 400 healthy individuals (non-tumor controls) were enrolled in the study. Demographic information and medical history was obtained by questionnaire. TaqMan minor groove binder real-time PCR was carried out to detect the NQO1 C609T genotype using blood-derived DNA from all study participants. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was carried out to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results:The frequencies of NQO1 609 CC, CT and TT genotypes were 23.75%, 50.25% and 28.00% in the HCC group, and 37.55%, 43.75% and 18.25% in the control group. The differences between the HCC and control group reached statistical significance (all P less than 0.05). The ORs of NQO1 609 CT and TT genotypes were significantly higher compared to the CC genotype; the adjusted OR(95% CI) of CT was 2.106(1.137-3.110) and of TT was 2.564(1.357-4.744). Individuals carrying the NQO1 609 T allelic gene had a significantly higher risk of HCC than those carrying the C allelic gene; the adjusted OR(95% CI) was 1.86(1.235-2.980). Interactions were found between hepatitis B virus infection with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positivity and NQO1 gene polymorphisms (adjusted OR: 2.431) and history of cancer (adjusted OR: 8.3592).Conclusion:The NQO1 C609T genotype is associated with increased risk of HCC. Interactions between HBsAg-positive infection, history of cancer, and NQO1 gene polymorphisms may contribute to HCC.
