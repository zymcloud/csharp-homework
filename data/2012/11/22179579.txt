Background/purpose:We developed software to calculate the pixels of interest in the area between the hepatic and heart curves (ABC) of (99m)Tc-galactosyl human serum albumin (GSA) scintigraphy. The aim of this study was to examine the accuracy of the ABC to evaluate liver function before hepatectomy.Methods:Between January 2005 and December 2010, 205 consecutive patients who underwent initial hepatectomy were enrolled in this study. The ABC was calculated using original computer software. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated for evaluation of Child-Pugh score grade B (Child B), pathological chronic hepatitis (CH), and liver cirrhosis (LC).Results:The AUC of any indicator for Child B was more than 0.900 except bilirubin. The AUC of ABC for CH and LC (AUC 0.734 each) was comparable to those of HH15 (clearance index; AUC 0.704 and 0.700, respectively) and LHL15 (receptor index; AUC 0.703 and 0.706, respectively) in multiple receiver operating characteristic comparison.Conclusions:We have developed a novel liver function indicator, the ABC, to count radioactivity in sequence. The ABC reflects liver function according to pathological deterioration of the liver. Although the ABC gave no significant advantage compared to HH15 and LHL15, it improved the AUC evaluation by 0.028-0.034.
