The putative tumor suppressor, DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer-1), was recently found to negatively regulate SIRT1 in vitro and in vivo, but the mechanism whereby DBC1 regulates SIRT1 in liver cancer remains to be elucidated. In this study, it was found that although the expression of DBC1 and SIRT1 was not aberrantly regulated in a large cohort of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, these proteins were highly overexpressed in a subset of HCC tissues compared with surrounding non-cancer tissues. In liver cancer, DBC1 and SIRT1 were found to be positively correlated. Inactivation of DBC1 or SIRT1 reduced SNU-182 (a liver cancer cell line) proliferation as determined by MTT viability assays. Notably, although DBC1 functions as a negative regulator of SIRT1 in A549 lung cancer cells since it suppresses the deacetylase activity of the p53 protein, it did not affect the p53 deacetylase activity of SIRT1 in SNU-182 cells. Taken together, we conclude that DBC1 is associated with SIRT1 in HCC, but that it does not inhibit SIRT1.
