Hepatic resection is the most potentially curative local therapy for patients with hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC). However, the high rate of postoperative recurrence, 50-70% at 3 years, remains a major concern. Such recurrences usually occur in the liver owing to the high propensity of HCC to invade the portal vein branches and the underlying liver cirrhosis, which is the ideal background for HCC development. Two pivotal surgical techniques are commonly used to reduce such recurrences: anatomical resection (AR) and achievement of negative margins. However, controversies exist about the definition of anatomical resection and the requisite width of negative margins. Consequently, a consensus on these issues is far from being achieved in the specialized surgical community. Review of the literature and author's discernment support AR for HCC larger than 2cm, and tumor exposure when the tumor is in contact with major vessels. Therefore, tumor exposure is not a contradiction to an AR properly carried out.
