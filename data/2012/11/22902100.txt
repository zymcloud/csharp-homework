Background:Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) is the accepted method for determining tumor progression. However, RECIST may not estimate disease burden accurately because the axial plane often does not produce the actual longest diameter. Volumetric measurements may be an alternative to better determine tumor size. Our aim was to compare volumetric measurements with RECIST in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDA) and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC).Methods:RECIST and volumetric measurements were determined in 9 patients with metastatic PDA and 17 patients with HCC who subsequently underwent liver transplantation. Gross pathologic measurements after hepatectomy also were analyzed for volumes.Results:Three-dimensional diameter in volumetric analysis was 38% and 36% higher than RECIST diameter in PDA and HCC, respectively (P Conclusions:RECIST significantly may overestimate tumor burden compared with volumetric measurements in both PDA and HCC. Volumetric analysis may be the preferred method to detect tumor progression.
