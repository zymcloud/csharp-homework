Introduction:Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is an incomplete virus dependent on hepatitis B virus (HBV) for its multiplication. It can infect individuals with active HBV infection and cause severe liver disease. It is less prevalent than hepatitis B virus, but it causes more serious clinical pictures. In this study we investigated anti-HDV seroprevalance and epidemiological features among HBsAg seropositive outclinic patients at Izmir Tepecik Educational and Research Hospital.Methodology:Serum samples collected from outpatients at Izmir Tepecik Educational and Research Hospital between 1 September 2007 and 30 August 2009 were evaluated. Anti-HDV assay was performed by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Patients over the age of fourteen who were referred to our hospital were taken into the study.Results:Out of 3,094 HBsAg positive patients, 79 (2.5%) had anti-HDV IgG seroprevalance. Of these 79 patients, 42 were hepatitis B carriers, 34 had chronic hepatitis B, two had liver cirrhosis, and one had hepatocellular carcinoma.Conclusion:Although superinfection and co-infection of HDV are less prevalent than hepatitis B infection, the prognosis is worse as the response to therapy is poor; therefore, patients with hepatitis B should be evaluated further for HDV infection.
