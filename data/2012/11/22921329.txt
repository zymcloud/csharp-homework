Background:The incidence (0.6% to 1.3%) of primary hepatolithiasis (PHL), also known as Oriental cholangiohepatitis, is increasing in Western countries and the treatment remains challenging. We analyzed the outcomes of patients undergoing hepatic resection (HR) for PHL at a single Western center.Study design:The records of all patients undergoing HR for PHL between August 1998 and January 2012 were reviewed. Patients were required to have preserved liver function (Child-Pugh class A) with no evidence of portal hypertension. Diagnosis of disease recurrence was based on radiographic and clinical findings.Results:Of the 30 patients who underwent HR, 63.3% presented with earlier failed therapeutic strategies. The majority of the patients were female (63.3%), presented with cholangitis (66.6%), left-sided (66.6%), and unilateral (90.0%) disease, and underwent left-sided hepatic resection (76.6%). Previously created choledochoduodenostomies (13.3%) were all revised into Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy anastomoses in conjunction with the HR. The incidence of concomitant cholangiocarcinoma was 23.3%, with a mean tumor size of 4.2 cm. Perioperative morbidity and mortality rates were 6.6% and 0%, respectively. At a median follow-up of 35 months, all patients had complete intrahepatic stone clearance. One patient required postoperative ERCP. Of the 7 patients with cholangiocarcinoma, 2 had cancer recurrence within the first year of the HR. The remaining patients are disease-free at a median follow-up of 21 months.Conclusions:Hepatic resection is a safe and definitive treatment option in the management of PHL. It achieves excellent short- and long-term results. The high incidence of concomitant cholangiocarcinoma makes a compelling argument for resection of all involved hepatic segments, when possible.
