A 61-year-old male patient visited our hospital because of liver dysfunction. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a diffuse tumor in the right lobe of the liver with biliary tumor thrombi extending into the common bile duct. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage(PTBD) was performed for obstructive jaundice. After improvement in the liver function, the patient underwent surgical intervention. Right trisectionectomy with removal of tumor thrombi was selected. Although the postoperative course was uneventful, CT scan demonstrated recurrent nodules in the remnant liver 4 months after surgery. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(TACE) was successfully performed for the recurrent lesions. The patient survived without any occurrence of viable lesions in the remnant liver. This case indicates that aggressive and curative surgery may improve the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and biliary tumor thrombi.
