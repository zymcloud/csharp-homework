A 73-year-old man with advanced multiple hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) in both lobes(S2, S3, S4, S8, and S1) was admitted to our hospital. Abdominal computed tomography revealed neither vascular invasion nor distant metastasis. Because 3 attempts of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) resulted in successful control of the tumors in the right lobe, a left hepatic lobectomy was performed. Although postoperative recurrences were observed, they were controllable by repeated TACE, and the patient remains in a relatively good general condition 3 years and 8 months since the operation.
