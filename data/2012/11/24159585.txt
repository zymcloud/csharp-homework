The pathophysiologic complexity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and underlying hepatic cirrhosis, make optimal treatment choice a clinical challenge. The radical change in the treatment algorithm of patients with advanced unresectable HCC over the past 7 years, with the introduction of anti-angiogenic agents in patients with only preserved liver function reflect this challenge. Even though data from studies on the combination of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and anti-angiogenic agents demonstrate a survival advantage in selected patients, this combination is not straightforward. In this review, we'll examine current data of administering anti-angiogenic therapy in combination with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and critically evaluate the progress and gaps in current knowledge.
