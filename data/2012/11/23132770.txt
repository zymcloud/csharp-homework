The present study was designed to elucidate the involvement of acid phosphatase (ACP) in metastasis and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as an immediate compensatory alleviation mechanism for energy stress in liver lesions induced by hexachlorocyclohexane in Swiss mice. Animals were continuously exposed to hexachlorocyclohexane (500 ppm) for 2, 4, and 6 months. Neoplastic nodules and tumors developed after continuous exposure for 4 and 6 months, respectively. The distribution pattern of both enzymes markedly varied in neoplastic nodules and tumors. Intense ACP activity was more observed only in sinusoids and blood vessels of neoplastic nodule, whereas an overall increase in ACP activity was observed in the tumor. Noticeably, a significant decline in LDH activity was noted after 2 and 4 months of exposure, whereas LDH in a tumor region showed intense enzymatic activity. The role of acid phosphate in metastasis and LDH in oxidative stress during hepatocarcinogenesis induced by hexachlorocyclohexane has been discussed.
