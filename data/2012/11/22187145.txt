Purpose:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ultrasound (US)-guided percutaneous argon-helium cryoablation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and determine appropriate indications.Methods:We reviewed outcomes of 300 HCC patients who underwent US-guided percutaneous cryoablation.Results:Overall, 223 tumors (mean diameter 7.2 ± 2.8 cm) in 165 patients were incompletely ablated, while 185 tumors (mean diameter 5.6 ± 0.8 cm, P = 0.0001 vs. incomplete ablation) in 135 patients were completely ablated. Nineteen patients (6.3%) developed serious complications while in hospital, including cryoshock syndrome in six patients, hepatic bleeding in five, stress-induced gastric bleeding in four, liver abscess in one and intestinal fistulas in one. Two patients died because of liver failure. The median follow-up was 36.7 months (range 6-63 months). The local tumor recurrence rate was 31%, and was related to tumor size (P = 0.029) and tumor location (P = 0.037). The mean survival duration of patients with early, intermediate and advanced HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system) was 45.7 ± 3.8, 28.4 ± 1.2 and 17.7 ± 0.6 months, respectively.Conclusions:US-guided percutaneous cryoablation is a relatively safe and effective therapy for selected HCC patients.
