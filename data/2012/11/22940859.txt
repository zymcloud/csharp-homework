Background:Hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) chemotherapy is being explored for treatment of malignant liver tumors. Maintenance of HAI systems is important for effective treatment.Purpose:To prospectively evaluate the efficacy of dual-phase CT angiography through the port-catheter system for HAI chemotherapy.Material and methods:This study enrolled 47 patients receiving HAI chemotherapy for malignant liver tumors who underwent dual-phase CT angiography through the port-catheter system using multislice CT. Using maximum intensity projection images reconstructed from vascular-phase CT imaging, hepatic arterial patency and catheter location were assessed. Using a combination of vascular- and perfusion-phase CT imaging, system dysfunction and clinical problems were evaluated.Results:Dual-phase CT angiography was conducted 156 times. Stenosis and obstruction of the hepatic artery and catheter dislodgment were observed seven times in four patients and four times in three patients, respectively. Diagnostic accuracy using vascular-phase CT imaging was 100%. In addition, development of collateral blood supply to the liver and extrahepatic perfusion to the stomach were observed three times in three patients and twice in two patients, respectively. Overall, system dysfunction occurred 16 times in 12 patients, and system correction and treatment modification were required 11 times in 10 patients. In assessing system dysfunction and predicting clinical problems, the accuracy of dual-phase CT imaging was 100%.Conclusion:Dual-phase CT angiography through the port-catheter system is helpful for assessing catheter system dysfunction and predicting clinical problems in HAI chemotherapy.
