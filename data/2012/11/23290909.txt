Objective:To study the achievements and safety of Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) associated Portal Vein Chemo-therapy (PVC) per-drug delivery system (DDS) program in preventing the recurrence of hepatic cell cancer (HCC) and Portal Vein Tumor Thrombus (PVTT).Methods:97 cases with HCC and PVTT were treated from January 2009 to January 2011. Patients with tumor or tumor thrombus were resected on all the cases and randomly divided into 3 groups. TACE, PVC per-DDS TACE and PVC per-DDS were given to group A, group B, and group C, respectively. Patients in the 3 groups were followed and compared on the Disease Free Survivals (DFS) and the accumulative survival rates, at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after the operation.Results:After the surgery was completed in June, the 1-year, 2-year, 3-year survival rates and cumulative survival rate in group C was higher than in group A or group. Significant differences did not appear in June but did show in 1 year after the surgery (P > 0.05) as well as in both 2 and 3 years, after the surgery (P Conclusion:Patients with HCC and PVTT, the TACE chemotherapy in association with PVC per-DDS could increase both the DFSs and accumulative survival rates, when compared to the either single TACE or PVC per-DDS, after the tumor or tumor thrombus were resected.
