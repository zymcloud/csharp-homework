Aim:To evaluate the initial safety and efficacy of combination therapy using miriplatin plus low-dose epirubicin for transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:Patients who underwent TACE using miriplatin plus epirubicin (n=48) and control patients who underwent TACE using miriplatin-alone (n=51) were included in this study.Results:The objective response rate in the miriplatin plus epirubicin group (91%) was significantly higher than that in the miriplatin group (74%, p=0.024). Concomitant use of miriplatin and epirubicin was an independent factor associated with higher objective response rate (hazard ratio=0.18; p=0.012). Overall incidence adverse events was not significantly different between the miriplatin plus epirubicin group (50%) and the miriplatin group (49%, p=0.575).Conclusion:TACE using miriplatin plus low-dose epirubicin was associated with an increased objective response rate and comparable adverse effects compared to TACE using miriplatin-alone.
