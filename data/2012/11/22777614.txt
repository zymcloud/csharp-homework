Background/aim:Overexpression of metastatic tumor antigen-1 (MTA-1) is suggested to be associated with frequent postoperative recurrence and poor survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. In this study, we intended to determine clinical factors predisposing the overexpression of MTA-1 in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCC and also examine whether MTA-1 overexpression affects the survival periods of these patients treated with curative surgical resection.Methods:A total of 303 patients with HBV-associated HCC who underwent curative surgical resection were subjected. The expressions of MTA-1 in HCC and surrounding non-tumor liver tissues were evaluated using the immunohistochemical method. The clinical, radiological and histological characteristics of the patients were analyzed in relation to the expression of MTA-1 to find predisposing factors of MTA-1 overexpression.Results:MTA-1 was overexpressed in 104 HCC tissues (34.3 %) and none of the surrounding non-tumor tissues. Clinically, MTA-1 overexpression was significantly associated with younger age, female gender, higher serum alpha-fetoprotein level, and Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A. Also, portal vein thrombosis, microvascular invasion, capsular invasion and poorly histological differentiation were associated with overexpression of MTA-1. The cumulative survival rates were significantly lower in patients with MTA-1 overexpression compared with those in the MTA-1 negative group (P = 0.03). In addition to the overexpression of MTA-1, the presence of microvascular or capsular invasion was a significant factor determining the poor survival of the patients with HBV-associated HCC after curative resection.Conclusions:MTA-1 is overexpressed in patients with HBV-associated HCC of invasive nature. MTA-1 overexpression is associated with shorter survival periods of patients with HBV-associated HCC after curative resection.
