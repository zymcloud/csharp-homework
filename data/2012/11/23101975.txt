Alcoholic liver disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among people who drink excessive amounts of alcohol. There is a spectrum of liver injury that ranges from steatosis to varying stages of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, with subsequent risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. Steatohepatitis can occur at any stage of disease.
