Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide and mortality due to cancer continues to rise. Cancer cell resistance to chemoradiotherapy is hindering treatment efforts in clinics. Prevention strategies and early detection thus may reduce mortality. In this study, we have proposed the concept of using precancerous cells and their progeny in cancer therapy, which could provide unique insights for early cancer diagnosis, treatment, and preventive therapy. In addition to discussing the nature and characteristics of precancerous cells and their progeny, we have also introduced an effective precancerous cell-targeted therapy based on an animal model of hepatocellular carcinoma. Anti-precancerous cell drug development should be a major target during cancer elimination and it may lead to preventive therapies for individuals with a high risk of developing cancer.
