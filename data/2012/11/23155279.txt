Aim:To compare the overall survival (OS) in patients without recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after initial radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and in those with recurrence, treated with repeat-RFA.Patients and methods:We compared OS between patients without recurrence (group A; n=150) and those with recurrence treated with repeat-RFA (group B; n=130).Results:One-, 3- and 5-year OS after initial RFA was 92.6%, 84.1% and 81.0%, respectively, in group A, and 99.0%, 84.1% and 61.8% in group B (p=0.296). There was no significant difference in OS between group A patients and patients with a single recurrent HCC (p=0.834). On multivariate analysis, serum albumin >3.5 g/dl and first HCC recurrence, comprising of two or three nodules were significant predicting factors of poorer OS.Conclusion:Even if HCC recurs after initial RFA, survival comparable to that of patients without recurrence can be achieved in patients with a single recurrent tumor treated with repeat-RFA.
