We report the long-term survival in two cases of colon cancer through multidisciplinary treatment, including surgery. Case 1: A 67-year-old male patient underwent anterior rectal resection, partial hepatectomy(S4, S5, S5/8) and cholecystectomy for rectal cancer with liver metastasis in July 2006(pSS, pN0, sH1, sP0, sM0, Stage IV, Cur B). Liver metastasis, lung metastasis, and metastatic colon cancer occurred 5 times during the 59 months following the first operation. We performed surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy to treat each recurrence. Case 2: A 42-year-old male patient underwent sigmoidectomy for sigmoid colon cancer with multiple liver metastasis in May 2007 (pSS, pN0, sH2, sP0, sM0, Stage IV, Cur C). Recurrence occurred 7 times at the liver and lung during the 58 months after the first operation. We performed surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy to treat each recurrence.
