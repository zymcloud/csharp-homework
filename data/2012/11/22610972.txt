Deregulation of cellular-signaling pathways by the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes is one of the major causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we identified Tax1 binding protein 2 (TAX1BP2) as a novel tumor-suppressor gene in HCC. TAX1BP2 transcript was frequently underexpressed (42.2% with T/NT Conclusion:Taken together, our data provide the first evidence that TAX1BP2 is a CDK2-regulated tumor-suppressor gene in HCC and is a novel activator of the p38/p53/p21 pathway.
