Objectives:This study aimed at exploring the role of curcumin and taurine alone or in combination against cultured human hepatoma cells (Huh-7 cells).Design and methods:Huh-7 cells were plated and treated with various concentrations of curcumin and/or taurine. Hemocytometer cell count, cell viability, quantification of γ-IFN concentrations, and flow cytometric analyses for CD4, CD8, and CD25 were carried out.Results:There were significant increases in the levels of cell density, γ-IFN, and CD8, accompanied with significant decrease in the level of CD4, when comparing cultured cells treated with curcumin and taurine with control cultured cells.Conclusion:Curcumin/taurine in combination formula is better treatment than single therapy, with respect to cell density and γ-IFN. Moreover, curcumin/taurine combined therapy enhances immunity by stimulating the CD4(+) T-helper cells with consequent induction of CD8 T-cell responses to lyse tumor cells.
