A 69-year-old man with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in S7/8 after radiofrequency ablation therapy (RFA)was admitted to our hospital. Serum alpha-fetoprotein and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonists (PIVKA-II) were elevated to 367 ng/mL and 18,973 mAU/mL, respectively. Abdominal computed tomography scan revealed that the size of the tumor was 56 mm and a portal vein tumor thrombus progressed from the right anterior branch to the left main branch(Vp3). The clinical stage was cT3N0M0, cStage III(JPS). He received 3 courses of intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy with cisplatin(CDDP IA-call)into the right hepatic artery at a dose of 65 mg/m2 every 2 months. Elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein(AFP)and PIVKA-II markedly decreased and returned to normal levels after the second course of treatment. The liver tumor and portal vein tumor thrombus disappeared, and only arterioportal shunting remained. The response to treatment was partial response (PR) and complete response (CR), according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors and the modified version, respectively. He has been alive for more than 1 year without recurrence. CDDP is an effective treatment for advanced HCC with portal vein tumor thrombus.
