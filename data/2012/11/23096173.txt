Objective:The purpose of this study was to elucidate the clinicoradiologic characteristics of pseudolesions of the liver in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) as observed on gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MR images. A particular interest was correlation between the pseudolesion characteristics and TACE-MRI interval, during which sequential changes in pseudolesions may be revealed after TACE.Materials and methods:Forty-eight patients with HCC who underwent gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI after TACE were retrospectively recruited. Pseudolesions were defined as areas of decreased signal intensity in treated areas on hepatocellular phase images that were confirmed to be nontumorous areas at follow-up. The prevalence and MRI features of pseudolesions were correlated with various clinical parameters, including TACE-MRI interval.Results:Pseudolesions were found in 14 patients (29%). Within 1 month of TACE, the prevalence of pseudolesions was 83%. All of the pseudolesions had arterial enhancement, mimicking residual HCC. After 1 month, the prevalence of pseudolesions decreased, and these pseudolesions tended to exhibit no abnormality in any sequence other than the hepatocellular phase. Results of multivariate analysis suggested that size of HCC (p Conclusion:The prevalence and appearance of pseudolesions differ at different intervals from TACE. Radiologists need to recognize the clinicoradiologic characteristics to differentiate pseudolesions from true residual or recurrent HCC.
