We present the case of a liver transplant recipient with alcoholic liver cirrhosis and early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma who developed biopsy-proven acute steroid-resistant rejection 3 months after liver transplantation. After the failure of immunosuppressive therapy with intravenous boluses of 6-methyl-prednisolone and switching of the immunosuppressive regimen to tacrolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil, two doses of intravenous basiliximab were administered four days apart. Clinical, analytical, and biopsy-proven histological response was complete. No basiliximab-related adverse events were detected. Basiliximab may represent an alternative in liver transplantation immunosuppression to treat acute steroid-resistant rejection, without increasing the incidence of infections, neoplasms, or other adverse events, as shown by this case.
