The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of extracorporeal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in treatment of hypersplenism. Fifteen adult dogs, weighing 13-18 kg were divided into three groups: sham group, SVL group undergoing splenic vein ligation (SVL) after laparotomy, and SVL + HIFU group receiving SVL followed by extracorporeal HIFU. Pathologic and hematologic analyses were performed. We also reviewed the clinical data of 19 patients with secondary hypersplenism caused by liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent extracorporeal HIFU. Extracorporeal HIFU significantly diminished the volume of the spleen of animals, coupled with occurrence of coagulation necrosis and fibrosis in the target area. Both platelet and red blood cell counts were significantly restored by HIFU intervention. Similarly, HIFU treatment improved the hematologic parameters in patients with hypersplenism, and no major complications were encountered. Extracorporeal HIFU intervention is effective and safe in managing secondary hypersplenism.
