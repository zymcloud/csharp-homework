Purpose:Laparoscopic hepatic resection (LHR) is still a challenging and developing surgical modality because of technical difficulty and a lack of training opportunities and experience. In this study, we present the results of our initial experiences of LHR, focusing on technical evolution in the management of LHR.Methods:Between April 2011 and March 2012, a total of 12 LHRs were performed. The first 5 of these LHRs were performed under laparoscopic assistance (hybrid-LHR), while the last 7 LHRs were performed totally laparoscopically (pure-LHR). Indications for LHR were hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 9) and metastatic liver cancer (n = 3). LHR procedures consisted of partial resection (n = 2), left lateral segmentectomy (n = 2), and left lobectomy (n = 1) in the hybrid-LHR group, and partial resection (n = 4), left lateral segmentectomy (n = 2), and right lobectomy (n = 1) in the pure-LHR group. Operative outcomes were compared between the groups and technical modifications were evaluated.Results:The mean operative time, blood loss, and length of hospital stay in the hybrid- and pure-LHR groups were 3.8 and 6.1 hours, 220 and 611 ml, and 9.4 and 7.4 days, respectively. There were no postoperative complications in both groups. Tumor margins were negative in all cases.Conclusions:LHR is a feasible and effective procedure for patients with various types of liver tumors, although technical challenges still need to be overcome.
