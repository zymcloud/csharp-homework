Carcinogenicity and chronic toxicity of 2,4-dichloro-1-nitrobenzene (2,4-DCNB) were examined by dietary administration to F344/DuCrj rats and Crj:BDF(1) mice of both sexes for 2 years. Dietary administration commenced when the animals were 6 weeks old. The dietary concentration of 2,4-DCNB was 0 (control), 750, 1,500 and 3,000 ppm (w/w) for male and female rats; 0, 750, 1,500 and 3,000 ppm for male mice; and 0, 1,500, 3,000 and 6,000 ppm for female mice. In rats, there was a dose-dependent and significant induction of renal cell adenomas and carcinomas in both sexes and of preputial glands adenomas in males. In all the 2,4-DCNB-fed groups of both sexes, the incidence of atypical tubular hyperplasia, a pre-neoplastic lesion in the kidney, in the proximal tubule was significantly increased. In mice, there was a dose-dependent and significant induction of hepatocellular adenomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, hepatoblastomas and peritoneal hemangiosarcomas in both sexes. The incidence of acidophilic hepatocellular foci was also significantly increased in female mice. Thus, clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 2,4-DCNB by 2-year feeding was demonstrated in both rats and mice.
