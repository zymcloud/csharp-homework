Background:Through data mining the Stanford Microarray Database, the stathmin 1 (STMN1) transcript was found to be frequently upregulated in the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with low alpha-fetoprotein level. The molecular mechanism of STMN1 upregulation in HCCs remained unclear.Methods:Quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and transfection of expression or small hairpin RNA interference plasmids, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and quantitative ChIP assays were performed in HCC specimens or 2 distinct HCC-derived cell lines. Dual luciferase assay and site-directed mutagenesis were applied to analyze the activities of STMN1 proximal promoter region.Results:STMN1 mRNA and proteins were significantly associated with several clinicopathological features. High STMN1 or E2F1 immunoexpression was predictive of poor overall survival (OS) rate (P Conclusions:Upregulation of E2F1 and STMN1 proteins associate with worse outcomes in patients with HCC. E2F1 significantly correlates with STMN1 protein level in HCC lesions and in vitro transactivation assays, suggesting that STMN1 gene is transactivated by the E2F1 protein.
