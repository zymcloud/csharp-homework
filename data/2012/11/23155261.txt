Background:We evaluated the clinical efficacy of transarterial infusion chemotherapy using a cisplatin-lipiodol emulsion for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:Fifty-seven patients with advanced HCC, with no indications for surgical resection or local ablative therapy, such as percutaneous ethanol injection and radiofrequency ablation, were enrolled in this retrospective study.Results:Twelve patients were treated with cisplatin-alone at a dose of 65 mg/m(2) by infusion into the artery. Forty-two patients were treated with the same dose of cisplatin suspended in 1-10 ml of lipiodol (C/LPD). Cumulative survival rates in the cisplatin-treated group were 46.2% at one year, and 18.5% at two years, whereas these in the C/LPD group were 81.6% and 44.4%, respectively, with a significant difference between the two groups (pConclusion:C/LPD produced superior effects compared to cisplatin-alone for unresectable HCC, causing no major side-effects, and increasing the survival rate.
