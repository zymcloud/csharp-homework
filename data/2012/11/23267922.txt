We encountered 2 cases of endocrine cell carcinoma of the stomach. One patient had a type 3 tumor in the cardia, and the other patient had a submucosal tumor in the posterior wall of the gastric angle, both of which were detected by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The first patient underwent total gastrectomy(D1+No.7, 19) with cholecystectomy. Microscopic histological examination fortuitously revealed a tumor thrombus in the vessel of the gallbladder. Eight months after the operation, a paraaortic lymph node recurrence was detected, and the patient died 28 months after the operation. The second patient underwent distal gastrectomy, cholecystectomy, S5 subsegmental hepatectomy, and S8 radiofrequency ablation(RFA). Despite undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy[irinotecan(CPT-11)/cisplatin(CDDP)], multiple liver recurrences were detected 6 months after the operation. Consequently, systemic chemotherapy (S-1/CDDP) was performed.
