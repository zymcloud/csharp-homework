We report a case of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) with tumor thrombosis in the main trunk of the portal vein successfully treated by multidisciplinary therapies. This case is that of a 61-year-old man with loss of appetite and weight loss. The abdominal computed tomography revealed an early enhanced and late wash-out lesion in the right hepatic lobe and tumor thrombosis in the major trunk of the portal vein. We diagnosed advanced HCC related to chronic hepatitis C [T4 (Vp4) N0M0, Stage IVA] and performed extended right lobectomy and extraction of the tumor thrombosis. The patient then underwent hepatic arterial infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) combined with systemic administration of interferon (IFN)-α therapy as an adjuvant therapy. Two years have passed since these therapies were performed with no recurrence of the disease. We expected that the patient would achieve long-term survival. Therefore, we administered IFN/ribavirin (RBV) therapy for chronic hepatitis C for 48 weeks. The patient is still alive, 44 months after the initial treatment. This case suggests that some patients with advanced HCC and a tumor thrombosis can achieve long-term survival by multidisciplinary therapies, including IFN-α/5-FU combination therapy.
