Hepatoid carcinoma of the ovary is a type of tumor resembling hepatocellular carcinoma that arises from the ovary. Hepatoid carcinoma patients are predominantly elderly females ranging between 35 and 78 years of age, with an average age of 56 years. It was suggested that, microscopically, bile canalicular structures are rare, but among nine cases examined for bile canalicular structures, four demonstrated a positive result. Here, we report a case of a 55-year-old female who presented to the Second Xiangya Hospital, Changsha, China, with lower abdominal pain, abdominal distention and increasing abdominal girth. The patient underwent total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, tumor debulking and postoperative chemotherapy. A mass in the left ovary measuring approximately 11 cm in diameter was identified. Microscopic and immunohistochemical results suggested that it was a hepatoid carcinoma of the left ovary.
