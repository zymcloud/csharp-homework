Background:Alpha-fetoprotein detection is currently mainly used in clinic for diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its sensitivity and specificity are not satisfying. Approximately 60-80 % of patients with HCC have an established background of chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV).Aims:To investigate the potential of serum microRNAs (miRNAs) as biomarkers for HBV-related HCC.Methods:This study was divided into two phases: firstly, marker (miR-95, miR-18a, miR-10b, miR125a, and miR-378) detection by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in sera from HBV patients with HCC (n = 15) and health subject (n = 15); and, secondly, marker validation by real-time qRT-PCR on HBV patients with HCC (n = 86) or hepatitis or cirrhosis (n = 30), and healthy subject (n = 45).Results:Serum miR-18a was significantly higher in HBV patients with HCC than healthy controls (p Conclusions:Our results suggest that serum miR-18a might serve as a novel and potential noninvasive biomarker for HBV-related HCC screening.
