We report a resected case of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) with a cholangiolocellular carcinoma (CoCC) component. A 77-year-old man had been followed up regularly for chronic hepatitis C for 20 years. In April 2008, a hepatic tumor of 30-mm diameter was detected in segment 2 by computed tomography scan. The tumor was enhanced in the early phase and the enhancement was prolonged. He was treated with transcatheter arterial embolization following the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). He had a local recurrence in the same segment (S2) in March 2009, and transcatheter arterial embolization and radiofrequency ablation were performed. In March 2011, abdominal dynamic computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a sectoral lesion in S2/4 with early and prolonged enhancement. Following the preoperative diagnosis of local recurrence of HCC, he underwent left lobectomy of the liver. Histopathologically, strongly atypical glandular epithelial cells and mucin production were observed, and these cells grew invasively into the liver parenchyma. Furthermore, tumor cells in the peripheral area grew and replaced adjacent hepatic cells, and anastomosing cavities of glands were found on the gitter stein. For these reasons, the histopathological diagnosis was ICC with a CoCC component.
