Background:Hepatocarcinoma cancer (HCC) occurs more often in men than in women, and little is known about its underlying molecular mechanisms.Results:We identify that 17β-estradiol (E2) could suppress tumor growth via regulating the polarization of macrophages.Conclusion:Estrogen functions as a suppressor for macrophage alternative activation.Significance:These studies introduce a novel mechanism for suppressing male-predominant HCC. Hepatocarcinoma cancer (HCC), one of the most malignant cancers, occurs significantly more often in men than in women; however, little is known about its underlying molecular mechanisms. Here we identified that 17β-estradiol (E2) could suppress tumor growth via regulating the polarization of macrophages. We showed that E2 re-administration reduced tumor growth in orthotopic and ectopic mice HCC models. E2 functioned as a suppressor for macrophage alternative activation and tumor progression by keeping estrogen receptor β (ERβ) away from interacting with ATP5J (also known as ATPase-coupling factor 6), a part of ATPase, thus inhibiting the JAK1-STAT6 signaling pathway. These studies introduce a novel mechanism for suppressing male-predominant HCC.
