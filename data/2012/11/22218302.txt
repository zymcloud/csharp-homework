The high frequency of recurrence and poor survival rate of bladder cancer demand exploration of novel strategies. Gene therapy via adenovirus has shown promising potential for the treatment of tumors. We constructed a bladder cancer-specific adenovirus carrying E1A-androgen receptor (AR) under the control of UPII promoter and prostate stem cell antigen enhancer (PSCAE), designated as Ad/PSCAE/UPII/E1A-AR, and investigated its antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that Ad/PSCAE/UPII/E1A-AR could be selectively replicated in bladder tumor cell lines (5637, BIU87, EJ and T24) when compared with control adenovirus Ad/PSCAE/UPII/Luc. However, there was no evidence of cytotoxicity for normal human bladder cell line SV-HUC-1 and hepatoma cell line SMMC7721. AR agonist R1881 could strengthen the oncolytic effect of Ad/PSCAE/UPII/E1A-AR in bladder cancer cells. In addition, we demonstrated that intratumoral injection of Ad/PSCAE/UPII/E1A-AR into established subcutaneous human EJ tumors in nude mice could significantly regress the growth of tumor and markedly prolong survival for tumor-bearing mice; on the other hand, saline-treated tumors continued to grow rapidly. Our studies indicate that Ad/PSCAE/UPII/E1A-AR could effectively treat bladder cancer in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, our findings provide a promising therapeutic modality for the treatment of bladder cancer.
