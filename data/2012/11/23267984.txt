We report a case of a 41-year-old woman who underwent mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection for right breast cancer(T3N3cM0) in 2004. She was treated with chemotherapy for multiple bone metastases and recurrence in the iliopsoas from January 2008. Right chest wall recurrence was observed in May 2010 and it progressed to ulcer. She was admitted to our hospital complaining of dyspnea on December 2, 2011. We diagnosed open pneumothorax and inserted a chest tube, and then packed the ulcer. No recurrence was observed in the liver and lungs. After stabilization of her general condition, we performed chest wall resection and reconstruction with a latissimus dorsi flap. She was discharged 2 weeks after surgery without severe complications. Although there were distant metastases, this surgical procedure may be effective for patients with open pneumothorax from recurrent breast cancer in order to maintain quality of life.
