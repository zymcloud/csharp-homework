Objective:Transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) plays a central role in a cellular immune response against HBV. Polymorphisms exist at the coding region of TAP and alter its structure and function. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential relationship between polymorphisms of TAP and different outcomes of persistent HBV infection in a Han population in northeastern China.Material and methods:189 HBV spontaneously recovered (SR) subjects, 571 HBV-infected patients including 180 chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 196 liver cirrhosis (LC) and 195 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) individuals were included in this study. TAP1-333 Ile/Val and -637 Asp/Gly, TAP2-651 Arg/Cys and -687 Stop/Gln were genotyped in all the samples by using a PCR-RFLP method.Results:The frequency of TAP1-637-Gly (allele G) was significantly higher in persistently HBV-infected individuals (CHB and LC) than that of SR subjects (OR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.12-2.45, p = 0.024; OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.27-2.68, p = 0.002) by a logistic regression analysis. In addition, the statistically significant difference in the distribution of TAP2-651-Cys (allele T) was observed between HCC cases and SR controls (OR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.51-3.72, p Conclusion:These results suggested that TAP variants were likely to play a substantial role in different outcomes of persistent HBV infection in the studied population.
