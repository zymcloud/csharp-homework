Omega-3 fatty acid supplemented total parenteral nutrition improves the clinical outcome of patients undergoing certain operations; however, its benefits for patients with hepatitis type B virus (HBV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have undergone hepatectomy are still not clear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplemented total parenteral nutrition on the clinical outcome of patients with HBV-associated HCC who underwent hepatectomy at our institution. A total of 63 patients with HBV-associated HCC who underwent hepatectomy were included in this study. These patients were randomly assigned to receive standard total parenteral nutrition (the control group, n = 31) or omega-3 fatty acid supplemented total parenteral nutrition (the omega-3 fatty acid group, n = 32) for at least 5 d. The study endpoints were the occurrence of infection-related complications, recovery of liver function and length of hospital stay. The results showed that the omega-3 fatty acid group had a lower infection rate (omega-3 fatty acid, 19.4% vs control, 43.8%, P
