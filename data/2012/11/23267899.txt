We report a case of bilobar multiple hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) successfully treated by preoperative percutaneous isolated hepatic perfusion(PIHP) and subsequent hepatectomy. A 77-year-old man with elevated serum PIVKA-II level and hepatomas was referred to our hospital. Abdominal dynamic computed tomography and gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated advanced HCCs: 11 tumors with a maximum tumor size of 4.8 cm diameter in the right lobe, and 1 tumor of 3.6 cm diameter in the left lobe. Curative resection was impossible due to insufficient liver function and due to the locations of the tumors. Therefore, we performed preoperative PIHP in order to control the multiple HCCs in the right lobe. This resulted in normalization of serum PIVKA-II level and complete necrosis of all tumors in the right lobe, as observed on dynamic computed tomography after 4 weeks of PIHP. Then, at 7 weeks after PIHP, we performed extended left lobectomy for residual tumor in the left lobe. Finally, complete remission was thought to have been achieved. The patient is alive 6 months after PIHP, without recurrence.
