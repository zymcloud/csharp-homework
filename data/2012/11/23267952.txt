Treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) including surgical resection, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), percutaneous local therapy, and systemic chemotherapy are decided upon according to tumor progression and liver function. However, it is difficult to choose a treatment after biliary tract reconstruction. Here we report a case of successful treatment for HCC and its recurrence where there had also been subtotal stomach preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy(SSPPD) for duodenal cancer. A 65-year-old female patient who had undergone SSPPD for duodenal cancer was found to have HCC in segment 8 (S8) 12 months later. Three months after super selective TACE, S8 partial resection was performed approaching through right thoracotomy and laparotomy. 2 years after the first hepatectomy, HCC was found to have reoccurred in S7/8 and S8. Right hepatic lobectomy was then performed without blocking the hepatic hilum. Liver resection was carried out with the aim of achieving A-P point. In this case then, several radical treatments have been completed without any biliary complication.
