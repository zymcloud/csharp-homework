Background:Adherence to surveillance recommendations for patients at risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is influenced by several factors, including the etiology of chronic liver disease.Aim:The aim of this study was to analyze whether tumor stage at diagnosis and prognosis differ in patients with alcohol-related HCC compared to those with chronic viral hepatitis-related HCC.Patients and methods:Medical records of 650 patients diagnosed with HCC between 1994 and 2011 were analyzed retrospectively. Groups were formed from patients having either alcohol abuse or viral hepatitis (chronic hepatitis B or C virus infection) as the only known HCC risk factors. Demographic data (age and gender), tumor stage at diagnosis, survival, liver function [Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) score] in patients with liver cirrhosis, complications of liver cirrhosis, and serologic parameters were compared between the two groups.Results:A total of 393 HCC cases (male 84%, median age 65 years) were identified, with alcohol abuse as the causative factor in 76.8% and chronic viral hepatitis in 23.2%. In patients with alcohol abuse, 278 (92.1%) were diagnosed with liver cirrhosis (CPT A 49.3%, CPT B 31.1%, CPT C 9.6%), while in patients with viral hepatitis, 84 (92.3%) suffered from liver cirrhosis (CPT A 59.3%, CPT B 23.1%, CPT C 8.8%). Tumor stage in patients with alcohol abuse was Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) C in 43.7%, BCLC B in 30.5%, and BCLC A in 14.6%. Patients with viral hepatitis showed a trend toward diagnosis at an earlier tumor stage (BCLC B 35.2%, BCLC C 34.1%, BCLC A 22.2%). Etiology of liver cirrhosis did not significantly influence survival in intermediate and advanced tumor stages, but BCLC-A patients with alcohol-related disease demonstrated prolonged survival compared to patients with viral hepatitis.Conclusion:Tumor stage at diagnosis of HCC is influenced by the etiology of underlying chronic liver disease and is more progressed in patients having a disease with alcoholic etiology. Majority of HCC patients are not diagnosed at a curable stage, which underlines the need for specialized care for all patients with chronic liver disease, independent of etiology and consequent adherence to current surveillance guidelines.
