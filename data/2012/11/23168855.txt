The development of malignancies after solid organ transplants is a well-known complication. Cancer is associated with significant consequences for the organ transplant patient. It is expected that cancer will surpass cardiovascular complications as the leading cause of death in transplant patients within the next few years. We report on a 36-year-old male patient who developed mixed germ-cell testicular tumor seven years after liver transplantation for alcoholic cirrhosis. He was treated with orchiectomy, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and post-operative chemotherapy.
