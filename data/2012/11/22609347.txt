Objective:To describe the etiology, symptoms and management of portal vein thrombosis associated with biliary tract infection and to compare our findings with classical causes of pylephlebitis.Material and methods:We performed a retrospective descriptive study of 10 patients in a tertiary hospital.Results:Portal vein thrombosis was associated with biliary tract infection in seven patients and with classical causes of pylephlebitis in three. In both groups, symptoms consisted of fever and abdominal pain accompanied by leukocytosis and increased liver enzymes. Blood cultures were positive in most patients and the main complication was liver abscess. The therapeutic management and outcomes were similar in both groups.Conclusions:Portal vein thrombosis can be associated with biliary tract infection. Clinical presentation and outcomes are highly similar to those in classical causes of pylephlebitis.
