Objective:The purpose of this article is to illustrate various focal hepatic lesions that may show hyperintensity on hepatobiliary phase images on gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI.Conclusion:Hyperintense lesions on gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI include focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) or FNH-like nodules, hepatocellular adenoma, dysplastic nodules, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Understanding the contrast enhancement patterns on hepatobiliary phase images and other imaging findings is important to ensure correct diagnosis.
