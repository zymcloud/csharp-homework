Tyroservatide (YSV) is an active, low-molecular-weight peptide shown to have antimetastasic effects on experimental melanoma and lung carcinoma. This study was carried out to evaluate the therapeutic effects of YSV on tumor invasion and metastasis of ovarian carcinoma and colon carcinoma and explore its antitumor mechanism of action. In vivo, three metastasis models were established, and YSV inhibited abdominal cavity metastasis of human ovarian carcinoma, and liver metastasis after spleen implantation of human colon carcinoma, in mice. In vitro, YSV inhibited the proliferation, promoted the death of SKOV-3, HT-29, and SW620 cells, and inhibited the adhesion and invasion of these three types of cells. Through zymography, western blot, and reverse transcription-PCR methods, YSV was found to reduce the activity, expression, and mRNA level of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. The results showed that YSV can inhibit tumor growth and metastasis of human ovarian carcinoma SKOV-3 and human colon carcinoma HT-29 and SW620. The mechanism of action of YSV may involve the inhibition of proliferation, promotion of death, inhibition of the adhesion and invasion of SKOV-3, HT-29, and SW620 cells by downregulating the expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9.
