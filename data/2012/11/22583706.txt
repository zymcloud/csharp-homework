Aim:We surveyed multiple centers to identify types and frequency of complications and mortality rate associated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We distributed a questionnaire developed by members of the Chugoku-Shikoku Society for the Local Ablation Therapy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma to 20 centers and analyzed types and frequency of complications and mortality rate.Results:In total, 16 346 nodules were treated in 13 283 patients between January 1999 and November 2010. Five patients (0.038%) died: two from intraperitoneal hemorrhage, and one each from hemothorax, severe acute pancreatitis and perforation of the colon. In 16 346 treated nodules, 579 complications (3.54%) were observed, including 78 hemorrhages (0.477%), 276 hepatic injuries (1.69%), 113 extrahepatic organ injuries (0.691%) and 27 tumor progressions (0.17%). The centers that treated a large number of nodules and performed RFA modifications, such as use of artificial ascites, artificial pleural effusion and bile duct cooling, had low complication rates.Conclusion:This study confirmed that RFA is a low-risk treatment for HCC and that sufficient experience and technical skill can reduce complications.
