A 76-year-old man, who had been treated with interferon-α(IFN-α) for hepatitis C, was diagnosed with multiple hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC; S7/8, S8, S5, S2) with right hepatic vein tumor thrombus (Vv2). He initially underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(TACE). One month after TACE, the hepatic vein tumor thrombi extended into the inferior vena cava(Vv3). No distant metastasis was observed, and his liver function was well-preserved. Therefore, we performed a posterior segmentectomy, partial hepatectomy(S8, S5, S2), inferior vena cava tumor thrombus excision, and cholecystectomy. Four months after the operation, intrahepatic recurrences were detected, and these lesions were controlled via TACE. Four years and 2 months after the initial treatment, the patient survived and presently, is in a good condition. This case suggested that long-term survival is possible by surgery and repeated TACE in case of good liver function by a sustained virologic response (SVR) via treatment with IFN-α for hepatitis C virus.
