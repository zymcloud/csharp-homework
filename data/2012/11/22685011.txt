We investigated circumscribed cell proliferations in healthy livers in comparison to non-cirrhotic livers bearing hepatocellular carcinoma. Using histochemical staining for cytochrome c oxidase, the fourth complex of the respiratory chain, we visualized patch-forming descendents of regeneratively active liver cells. The clonal nature of these patches was verified by laser-capture microdissection and Sanger sequencing of the enzyme's core subunits in patches carrying marker mutations on the mtDNA. We demonstrate a highly significant increase of the patch size and also a highly significant increase in the number of patches carrying marker mutations between hepatocellular carcinoma-free and -bearing livers. Thus, the carcinoma-bearing livers accumulated more genetic damage on mtDNA than the control group. Furthermore, for the first time, we present evidence in hepatocellular carcinoma-bearing non-cirrhotic livers of a significantly reduced pool of regeneratively active liver cells that are genetically and functionally altered. The analogy to ageing-related changes is suggestive of premature ageing of stem cells in non-cirrhotic hepatocellular carcinoma-bearing liver as an early step to hepatocarcinogenesis.
