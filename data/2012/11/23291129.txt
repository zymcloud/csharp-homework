Objective:To investigate the inhibitory effect of compound cantharides capsules on the proliferation of xenografts of human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG(2215) in mice and their mechanism of action.Methods:One hundred healthy Balb/c mice (5-week old, male:female 1:1) were used in this study. Mouse models of human HepG(2215) hepatocarcinoma were established. The tumor-bearing mice were divided into five groups randomly. The control group A received daily intragastric administration of physiologic saline. The intervention groups B1, B2 and B3 were treated with compound cantharides capsule in a dose of 12.5 mg×kg(-1)×d(-1), 25 mg×kg(-1)×d(-1) and 37.5 mg×kg(-1)×d(-1), respectively, for 10 consecutive days. The group C had intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide (25 mg×kg(-1)×d(-1)) for 10 consecutive days. The mice were sacrificed after the completion of administration. The tumors were taken out, the tumor volume was measured, the inhibitory rate of body weight was calculated, and the serum AFP concentration and the level of HBV DNA were determined. The survival of each group mice was analyzed. The levels of mRNA expression of apoptosis-related genes were assayed by quantitative RT-PCR. Apoptosis in the tumor cells was assayed with TUNEL staining. Flow cytometry was used to detect the levels of CD3(+), CD19(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+), and microvessel density (MVD) of the tumors was assessed by immunohistochemistry.Results:After completion of the treatment, the inhibition rate of tumor growth of the groups B1, B2 and B3 was 29.8%, 38.7% and 48.1%, respectively, and that of the group C was 52.4%, with a significant difference among the groups (P Conclusion:Compound cantharides capsules may inhibit the replication of HBV DNA in HepG(2215) cells, inducing apoptosis in the tumor cells, enhancing the immune function to inhibit the growth of liver cancer cells in mice, and significantly prolong the median survival time of tumor-bearing mice.
