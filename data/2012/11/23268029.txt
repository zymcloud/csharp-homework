Familial adenomatous polyposis(FAP) is characterized by colonic polyps that undergo malignant change, and benign and malignant extracolonic lesions such as upper gastrointestinal polyps, osteoma, desmoids tumor, and papillary cancer of thyroid. We found a case of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) in a 23-year-old male patient after an ileal J pouch-anal anastomosis for FAP. He also had fundic gland polyposis at the fundus and upper corpus in his stomach. Genetic counseling was rejected by his mother. The patient's condition was followed up routinely in the surgical outpatient clinic. Liver dysfunction was detected by blood examination 5 years after surgery. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography also showed a single nodular type of the HCC at S8 in his liver. Partial hepatectomy at S8 was performed and the postoperative course has been uneventful.
