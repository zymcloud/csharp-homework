A 36-year-old man was found to have Hurthle cell carcinoma, as diagnosed with surgical pathology after a lobectomy of the thyroid. A post-operative magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a small mass in the lower pole of the right thyroid and a computed tomography scan showed bilateral nodules in the lungs and the neck, and multi-focal disease in the liver. He was treated with a docetaxel and cisplatin chemotherapy regimen. After six cycles of the docetaxel and cisplatin regimen, we could hardly find the lesions in the lungs and the liver, and the patient presented a complete tumor response lasting 17 months and has not shown any tumor recurrence till now. The docetaxel and cisplatin regimen may be an effective chemotherapy regimen for multi-metastases of Hurthle cell cancer.
