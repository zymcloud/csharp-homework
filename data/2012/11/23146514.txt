Background:With an increasing number of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing liver transplantation (OLT), HCC recurrence remains the main limiting factor for long-term survival. We herein report our experience with sorafenib treatment for HCC recurrence post-OLT.Patients and methods:We reviewed data on transplanted HCC patients receiving sorafenib for HCC recurrence.Results:Fourteen patients were included for the period November 2006 to February 2011. There were 9 men and 5 women of median age of 57 years. Twelve patients (86%) received rescue grafts through Eurotransplant allocation. Median values for alpha fetoprotein levels, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, sorafenib daily dose, and length of treatment were 97 ng/mL, 10, 400 mg, and 6.5 months, respectively. Sorafenib side effects led to discontinuation (n = 4) or reduction (n = 2) of the daily dose. Four patients experienced tumor progression during treatment. Seven patients are currently alive, 3 patients died of tumor progression, and 4 patients of non-tumor-related causes of death. Median survival was 25 months.Conclusion:Sorafenib treatment for HCC recurrence in transplant recipients represents a challenging oncologic approach that requires further validation in prospective, multicenter studies.
