Aim:To investigate the characteristics and diagnostic value of annexin A2 (ANXA2) expression in cancerous tissues and sera of patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Levels of liver ANXA2 gene transcription or protein expression were analyzed in HCC-, their self-controlled precancerous-, and distant cancerous- tissues from 30 HCC. Serum levels of ANXA2 expression in 115 patients with HCC, 25 with metastatic liver cancer, 35 with chronic hepatitis, 28 with acute hepatitis, 38 with cirrhosis, and 30 healthy controls were determined. Clinicopathological characteristics of circulating ANXA2 expression were analyzed, and its diagnostic efficiency and clinical values in HCC were evaluated.Results:ANXA2 expression was localized in both cell membrane and cytoplasm in HCC tissue, mainly in the cytoplasm of matched adjacent cancerous tissue, and there was almost no positive staining in matched distant cancerous tissue. Abnormal expression of liver ANXA2 was present in HCC tissues compared with self-controlled adjacent- and distant-cancerous tissues at protein or mRNA level. Circulating ANXA2 in HCC patients was significantly higher than that of other liver diseases (P Conclusion:The characteristics and distribution of ANXA2 expression has good diagnostic potential for HCC diagnosis.
