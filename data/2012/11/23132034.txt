A 71-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of dysphagia, and primary endocrine cell carcinoma of the esophagus with multiple liver metastases was diagnosed. After 6 courses of CPT-11+CDDP combination chemotherapy, the liver metastases disappeared, although the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma component remained. Radiation therapy was added to treat the residual esophageal tumor, and a complete response was obtained. This case seems to suggest that multidisciplinary therapy, including chemotherapy, may be effective for treating esophageal endocrine cell carcinoma with other types of organ metastasis.
