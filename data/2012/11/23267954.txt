A 57-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). He underwent right hepatectomy with preoperative adjuvant transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. A follow-up computed tomography scan revealed a single pulmonary metastasis. After 2 courses of S-1 administration, he underwent left lower lobectomy, and a pathological specimen taken at the time was diagnosed as pulmonary metastasis of HCC. Although adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 resulted in relapse-free survival for 2 years after pulmonary resection, he was found to have recurrence of liver cancer and underwent partial hepatectomy. This case report suggests that surgical resection and S-1 administration would be a useful treatment option for hepatocellular carcinoma with distant metastasis.
