Objective:To explore the clinical application of laparoscopic anatomical right hemihepatectomy in the treatment of liver tumor.Methods:From October 2007 to October 2011, 16 cases of laparoscopic anatomical right hemihepatectomy were performed. The data of operative duration, blood loss volume and postoperative complications, etc, were analyzed retrospectively. Parenchyma was transected with a laparoscopic ultrasonic scalpel and ligature and accomplished with an endoscopic linear stapler.Results:Among them, postoperative pathologic examinations revealed primary liver carcinoma (n = 7), liver hemangioma (n = 6), colon carcinoma with liver metastasis (n = 2) and pancreatic non-function neuroendocrine carcinoma with liver metastasis (n = 1). The mean volume of blood loss was 550 (200 - 1550) ml, mean surgical time 310 (260 - 450) minutes and mean postoperative hospital stay 7 (5 - 14) days. Postoperative complications included 3 cases of bile leakage recovered after 2 - 3 weeks by appropriate draining. The patients with malignant tumor were followed up for 15 (12 - 52) months. Recurrence occurred in 4 cases and another 2 died of recurrence and metastasis.Conclusions:Laparoscopic anatomical right hemihepatectomy is a safe, feasible and effective procedure for the treatment of benign liver disease and malignant liver neoplasms in properly selected patients. It should be recommended for radical resection of hepatocellular carcinoma.
