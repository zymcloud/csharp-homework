The human glycoprotein, stanniocalcin 2 (STC2) plays multiple roles in several tumor types, however, its function and clinical significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. In this study, we detected STC2 expression by quantitative real-time PCR and found STC2 was upregulated in HCC tissues, correlated with tumor size and multiplicity of HCC. Ectopic expression of STC2 markedly promoted HCC cell proliferation and colony formation, while silencing of endogenous STC2 resulted in a reduced cell growth by cell cycle delay in G0/G1 phase. Western blot analysis demonstrated that STC2 could regulate the expression of cyclin D1 and activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in a dominant-positive manner. Transwell chamber assay also indicated altered patterns of STC2 expression had an important effect on cell migration. Our findings suggest that STC2 functions as a potential oncoprotein in the development and progression of HCC as well as a promising molecular target for HCC therapy.
