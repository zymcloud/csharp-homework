Background:Dysregulation of minichromosome maintenance protein 7 (MCM7) was previously identified in multiple human malignancies. The clinical significance of MCM7 expression is yet to be delineated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Paired cancerous and non-cancerous specimens from 87 patients with HCC who underwent resection were used for the immunohistochemical evaluation of MCM7 expression. Effect of sorafenib on the expression of MCM7 was tested in two human HCC cell lines SMMC-7721 and PLC/PRF/5.Results:Non-cancerous tissues were negative for immunohistochemical staining for MCM7 expression. Nuclear MCM7 was expressed in 42 of 87 HCC (48.2%) and was correlated with hepatitis B virus infection (P = 0.020), intrahepatic metastasis (P = 0.022) and vascular invasion (P = 0.013). Moreover, its expression was correlated with shorter overall survival (P = 0.033). Multivariate analysis showed that MCM7 expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival(P = 0.041). Sorafenib inhibited the expression of MCM7 in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro.Conclusions:The current findings suggested that MCM7 expression may be a useful predictor of prognosis in patients with HCC after resection. Adjuvant therapy with sorafenib might be a valuable therapeutic strategy for MCM7-positive HCC patients.
