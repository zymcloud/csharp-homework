Background:Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage liver disease; however, it is associated with a multitude of postoperative complications. Herein we have presented our experience with the application of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in the follow-up of liver transplant recipients.Patients and methods:Twenty-four liver transplantation patients were examined with triphasic hepatic computed tomography. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were included in the study. Examinations were performed using a multidetector scanner.Results:We documented seven cases of thrombosis, three stenosis, and two hepatic artery (HA) aneurysms. Portal vein (PV) stenosis and PV thrombosis were observed in two cases each. We observed one case of synchronous HA and PV stenosis; one inferior vena cava (IVC) and left renal vein thrombosis, and one IVC thrombosis. In three cases of HA obstruction we observed transplant neovascularization. One HA obstruction and one HA stenosis were accompanied by bilomas. Finally, we discovered three cases of hepatocellular carcinoma.Conclusion:In our experience MDCT as a single noninvasive examination, was a sensitive means to detect and evaluate vascular complications after liver transplantation, offering adequate information concerning the liver parenchyma, the rest of the abdomen, and to a lesser extent the biliary tract.
