The patient was a 39-year-old man with type 3 gastric cancer with synchronous multiple liver and lung metastases, who was diagnosed as cStage IV(cT4aN1M1H1). He received induction chemotherapy with S-1 and CDDP. After chemotherapy, the liver and lung metastases had disappeared completely. He underwent total gastrectomy and splenectomy, with D2 nodal dissection. Anastomotic leakage occurred on postoperative day 6, and substantial inflammatory conditions continued for 2 weeks. He died 6 weeks after surgery with multiple liver metastases. This case suggests that elevated inflammatory conditions may cause tumor progression.
