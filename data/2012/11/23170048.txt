Functional disorders of various immune cells have been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Recently, distinct subsets of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes, PMN) have been identified in hosts with enhanced or impaired cell-mediated immunity. In this study, therefore, plasma factors and PMN from HCC patients were immunobiologically investigated. Plasma neopterin and CCL17 levels were measured by ELISA in 95 HCC patients. Peripheral PMN were isolated from each HCC patient and tested for CCL2 or CCL3 production by ELISA and flow cytometry. The results showed elevated plasma neopterin levels in HCC patients, while CCL17 levels decreased in correlation with tumor size. PMN from HCC patients produced CCL2, while PMN from healthy subjects did not. Moreover, CCL2 production by PMN was significantly increased in proportion to tumor load. When HCC patients were divided into two groups based on CCL2 produced by PMN, the survival rate of the CCL2 high group was significantly lower than that for other patients. While CCL3 production by PMN was also significantly increased in HCC patients, their CCL3 production did not correlate with tumor load and survival. The CCL2/CCL3 ratio in culture fluids of each PMN was also increased in proportion to tumor size. These results suggest that cell-mediated immunity may be impaired in advanced HCC patients. Moreover, distinct PMN subsets may exist in the peripheral blood of HCC patients. These PMN subsets, especially CCL2-producing PMN, may be involved in tumor extension and the survival outcomes for HCC patients.
