Purpose:The purpose of this study was to elucidate the incidence and risk factors for the progression of hypointense nodules observed in the hepatobiliary phase of gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI) of hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Hypovascular nodules (112) showing hypointensity in the hepatobiliary phase of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI were examined in 54 patients. All patients underwent computed tomography during hepatic arteriography and computed tomography during arterial portography (CTAP) within a month after Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. According to the tumor size, 112 nodules were divided into two groups: those >10 mm in diameter (group A, n = 39) and those â‰¤10 mm in diameter (group B, n = 73). The incidence of progression to hypervascular HCC was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:The incidence of hypervascularization was significantly higher in group A nodules than in group B nodules (p Conclusion:Hypointense nodules observed in the hepatobiliary phase of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI with diameters of >10 mm had a high probability of hypervascularization.
