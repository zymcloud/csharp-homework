Objective:Miriplatin(MP) is a promising newly developed anticancer agent for transcatheter arterial chemoinfusion in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC), particularly those previously not treated with chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of transarterial chemolipiodolization with MP for recurrent HCC in patients previously treated with chemotherapy.Materials and methods:From January 2010 to March 2011, 17 patients with recurrent HCC were treated with MP via a transcatheter arterial approach. The dose of MP per treatment session was up to 140 mg. We repeated this treatment protocol until tumor progression occurred. We assessed the therapeutic results and the adverse events.Results:MP was infused at a dose of 60-140 mg in the initial treatment session; the mean treatment session number was 1.8; and the total dose of MP was 60-400 mg (median, 120 mg). Response rate and disease control rate after the initial treatment were 17.6% and 47.1%,respectively. Response rate and disease control rate after the total treatment session were 17.6% and 29.4%,respectively. Median tumor-free survival was 86 days. We encountered a severe adverse event in 1 patient who died due to his concomitant disease( diabetic nephropathy and radiation hepatitis) 38 days after this protocol.Conclusion:The therapeutic result of MP was unsatisfactory, but adverse events due to MP infusion, including renal and/or liver damage, were minor.
