Backgrounds/aims:Gallbladder carcinoma (GBCa) T2 lesions are considered to be advanced tumors showing diverse features in tumor extent. When this T2 lesion does not involve the cystic duct and there is no evidence of lymph node metastasis, we have to consider what is the most reasonable extent of resection - that is, whether to perform concurrent extra-hepatic bile duct resection (EHBD) resection or not. This study intends to evaluate the adequacy of EHBD resection in patients undergoing resection for T2N0 GBCa.Methods:From our institutional database of GBCa, 48 cases of T2N0 GBCa who underwent R0 resection during November 1995 and August 2008 were selected. Patients who underwent prior laparoscopic cholecystectomy were excluded. Their medical records were reviewed retrospectively.Results:Their mean age was 63.2±83.3 years and females were 25. The mean serum CA19-9 level was 37.3±89.3 ng/ml. The extents of liver resection were wedge resection (n=36) and segment 4a+5 resection (n=12). Concurrent EHBD resection was performed in 16 (33.3%) patients. No fatal surgical complication occurred. The majority of tumor pathology was adenocarcinoma (n=42), with additional unusual types as papillary (n=3), saromatoid (n=1), signet ring cell (n=1) and adenosquamous (n=1) cancers. The overall survival rate was 87.1% at 1 year, 69.5% at 3 years and 61.7% at 5 years. After exclusion of mortalities not related to cancer, the overall patient survival rate was 89.6% at 1 year, 72.9% at 3 years and 64.7% at 5 years, with 3-year survival rates of 72% in the EHBD resection group and 69.2% in the non-resection group (p=0.661).Conclusions:The results of this study indicate that concurrent EHBD resection did not improve patient survival when R0 resection was achieved in patients with T2N0 GBCa. Therefore, routine EHBD resection may not be indicated for T2N0 GBCa unless the tumor is close to the cystic duct.
