Background:Due to the possibility of lymph node metastasis, surgical resection is indicated for superficial oesophageal cancer with invasion to a depth greater than the muscularis mucosa. Although two magnifying endoscopy classifications are currently used to diagnose the depth of invasion, which classification is more suitable remains controversial.Aims:To compare and evaluate the clinical outcomes of two classifications for superficial oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.Methods:This cross-sectional study consists of 44 superficial oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma lesions with magnification image-enhanced endoscopy images. Only magnifying endoscopic images were displayed to two experienced endoscopists who independently diagnosed the depth of invasion according to both classifications.Results:The sensitivity of invasion greater than the muscularis mucosa tended to be higher in Inoue's classification than Arima's classification (78.3±6.2% vs. 50.0±3.0%; P=0.144), whereas the specificity was significantly lower in Inoue's classification than in Arima's classification (61.9±0.0% vs. 97.6±3.4%; P=0.043). For both classifications, rates of concordance were 90.9% and 84.4%, and κ statistics were 0.81 and 0.66, respectively.Conclusions:Our results suggest that Arima's classification is suitable for general screening before treatment to avoid unnecessary surgery. Inoue's classification is appropriate for assessing wide lesion.
