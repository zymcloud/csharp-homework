β-catenin is a multifunctional protein that is involved in cellular structure and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is believed to be an inducer of cell proliferation in different tumors. However, in certain physiological contexts β-catenin also promotes apoptosis. High levels of β-catenin are found in a number of cancer cell types. Recent studies have shown that β-catenin may be correlated with carcinogenesis. Its effects and interaction with interferon (IFN)γ signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells remains unknown. In the present study, high levels of β-catenin did not induce antiproliferative effects or apoptosis and did not lead to changes in the levels of caspases or activated STATs. However, high levels of β-catenin did cause positive p53 accumulation and Bcl-XL downregulation in HepG2 cells, a HCC cell line. When treated with IFNγ, apoptosis was induced more rapidly compared with cells with low β-catenin levels (P
