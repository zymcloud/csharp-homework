Cancer is a disease of genetic and epigenetic alterations, which are emphasized as the central mechanisms of tumor progression in the multi-stepwise model. Discovery of rare subpopulations of cancer stem cells (CSCs) has created a new focus in cancer research. The heterogeneity of tumors can be explained with the help of CSCs supported by anti-apoptotic signaling. CSCs mimic normal adult stem cells by demonstrating unique characteristics of self-renewal and pluripotency, and the critical role for tumor growth and resistance to anti-cancer therapy. We found that CD13 was a surface marker for CSCs in human liver cancer cell lines and clinical samples, and that CD13+ CSCs were associated with a hypoxic marker in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) sample, suggesting that CD13+ CSCs have the critical role in tumor growth and resistance to anti-cancer therapy in liver cancers. In this review article, we update recent findings regarding the involvement of CSCs, especially in HCC.
