Background:Intravenous injection of the indocyanine green (ICG) reagent was performed as a liver function test 1 to 2 weeks prior to surgery. ICG fluorescent imaging was performed using the Photodynamic Eye (PDE) infrared camera (Hamamatsu Photonics k. k., Shizuoka, Japan).Methods:Intravenous injection of the ICG reagent was performed as a liver function test 1 to 2 weeks before surgery. ICG fluorescent imaging was performed using the PDE infrared camera.Results:ICG fluorescent imaging was useful for liver surgical navigation as follows: three cases of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization or thermal ablation therapy; three cases of colorectal metastatic liver tumors after chemotherapy as conversion therapy; two cases of intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma (ICC); and two cases of surface HCC that were not detected by preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan. In the ICC cases, although dilatation of the bile duct could be detected, the tumor margins were ambiguous by ultrasonography(US). ICG fluorescent imaging clearly described the dilatation of the bile duct including the tumor.Conclusions:ICG fluorescent imaging was useful for liver surgical navigation including selection of the mode of hepatic resection.
