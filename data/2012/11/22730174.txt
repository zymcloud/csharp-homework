Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)), an effective agent against acute promyelocytic leukemia, has been reported to inhibit the viability of solid tumors cell lines recently. The detailed molecular mechanism underlying the As(2)O(3)-induced inactivation of the cdc2 and possible functional role of PTEN in the observed G2/M arrest has yet to be elucidated. Here, we assessed the role of PTEN in regulation of As(2)O(3)-mediated G2/M cell cycle arrest in Hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2 and SMMC7721). After 24 h following treatment, As(2)O(3) induced a concentration-dependent accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. The sustained G2/M arrest by As(2)O(3) is associated with decreased cdc2 protein and increased phospho-cdc2(Tyr15). As(2)O(3) treatment increased Wee1 levels and decreased phospho-Wee1(642). Moreover, As(2)O(3) substantially decreased the Ser473 and Thr308 phosphorylation of Akt and upregulated PTEN expression. Downregulation of PTEN by siRNA in As(2)O(3) -treated cells increased phospho-Wee1(Ser642) while decreased phospho-cdc2(Tyr15), resulting in decreased the G2/M cell cycle arrest. Therefore, induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest by As(2)O(3) involved upregulation of PTEN.
