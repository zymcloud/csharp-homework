Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an enzyme responsible for generating hypochlorous acid and reactive oxidants that may lead to liver injury and cancer in hepatitis C (HCV) infection. MPO expression level is regulated by a polymorphism in the promoter region -463 of MPO gene. In the current study, MPO plasma levels and the G-463A MPO polymorphism were determined in 158 chronically HCV infected patients with and without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MPO plasma levels were determined using a commercially ELISA kit. The G-463A MPO polymorphism was accessed by real time PCR using TaqMan probes. The MPO plasma levels of patients with HCV-HCC were higher in comparison to patients with chronic hepatitis or with those patients with severe fibrosis (p=0.01 and p=0.04, respectively). The MPO G-463A polymorphism was not associated with HCV outcome. These findings suggest MPO levels monitoring may be a potential biological marker to HCC screening in patients with HCV.
