Objective:To explore the changes of metastatic potential of residual hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after in vivo chemotherapy and its mechanism.Methods:Nude mouse models of orthotopic HCC in the nude mouse livers was established using human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line MHCC97L cells. Oxaliplatin (10 mg/kg, once per week) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to mice in the trial group. Mice in the control group received 0.2 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride on the same days. On day 7 after the third injection, all mice were sacrificed and tumor fragments of equal volume (2 mm×2 mm×2 mm) from each mouse of the oxaliplatin-treated and untreated groups were reinoculated into the livers of each new recipient mouse correspondingly. The growth, metastasis and molecular phenotype of the reinoculated tumors in both groups were determined.Results:In the new recipient mice, compared with untreated tumors, oxaliplatin pre-treated tumors grew significantly slower [(2624.59 ± 491.60) mm(3) vs. (3849.72 ± 827.09) mm(3), P Conclusion:Residual hepatocellular carcinomas after in vivo chemotherapy grow slower but gain enhanced metastatic potential to the lung, associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition.
