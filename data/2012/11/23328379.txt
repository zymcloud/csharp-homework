Objective:To assess the long-term efficacy and investigate the prognostic factors of cytokine-induced killer (CIK) combined with the sequential transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Method:A total of 95 HCC patients with the informed consents received TACE combined with RFA, 48 cases of which accepted the CIK via intravenous drop infusion for more than 6 times (study group) while the other 47 cases were enrolled in control group. The following-up duration was more than 3 years. Primary endpoint was the overall survival (OS) and the secondary endpoint was the disease-free survival (DFS).Results:76 patients in all (38 in study group, 38 in control group) complied with the study and follow-up (44 months in median, 10-88 months). No mortality and serve complications were observed in both groups. The ratio for patients with DFS over 1-year, 3-year and 5-year were 79%, 26% and 16% (28 months in median and 32.3 months in mean) while 71%, 21% and 8% (22 months in median and 23.1 months in mean) for the control group. There was significant difference between the two groups (P=0.001). For the OS, the ratio for 1-year, 3-year and 5-year in the study group were 92%, 53% and 26% (38 months in median and 42.5 in mean) and 89%, 42% and 24% (35 months in median and 37 in mean). No significant difference was observed in both groups. ECOG performance status, Hepatitis B virus infection and treatment were the prognostic factors for DFS while ECOG performance status was the only prognosis for OS.Conclusion:CIK infusion basing on the TACE combined with RFA can control the recurrence of HCC, decrease the times of TACE or RFA.
