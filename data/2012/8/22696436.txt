Background:Anatomical resection of segment VIII (SVIII) is technically demanding. Only two small studies have published short-term outcomes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate short- and long-term outcomes after anatomical resection involving SVIII for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to compare long-term outcomes with those after non-anatomical resection of SVIII.Methods:Outcomes after anatomical resection of SVIII or its subsegments for HCC were compared with those in patients who underwent primary non-anatomical resection of SVIII during the same period.Results:A total of 154 patients underwent anatomical resection involving SVIII and 122 had non-anatomical resection. In patients undergoing anatomical resection, the preoperative indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min ranged from 2·9 to 32·2 (median 13·6) per cent, and was 10 per cent or more in 109 patients (70·8 per cent). Median duration of operation and blood loss were 378 min and 705 ml respectively. There were no postoperative deaths, but major adverse events occurred in ten patients (6·5 per cent). The cumulative 5-year recurrence-free and overall survival rates were 28·5 and 79·6 per cent, which were significantly better than rates of 19·4 and 64·8 per cent respectively after non-anatomical resection (P = 0·036 and P Conclusion:Complete resection of SVIII or its subsegments can be performed safely and the long-term outcomes seem acceptable. This can be a curative procedure for HCC, especially in patients with limited liver function reserve, in whom right hepatectomy or right paramedian sectorectomy might otherwise be needed.
