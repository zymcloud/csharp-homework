Background:The extent to which potentially curative therapies are used in patients with hepatocellular cancer (HCC) and their related outcomes are unknown in the US.Aim:To determine the rate and outcomes of potentially curative treatment in patients with HCC.Methods:Eleven US centers followed patients with HCC between 2001 and 2007. We determined rates of liver transplantation, surgical resection, or tumour ablation during follow-up, examined differences in adjusted survival of patients receiving these treatments, and determined the factors associated with receipt of potentially curative treatment.Results:Of the 267 patients, 76 (28%) patients had early HCC, defined as Child A or B cirrhosis, with a solitary HCC or ≤ 3 nodules, each ≤ 3 cm. Of these, 53 (69.7%) received curative treatment. Thirty six percent of patients with non-early HCC received curative treatment. Compared to patients with non-early HCC who did not receive curative treatment, patients with early HCC and curative treatment had the best survival [hazard ratio, HR = 0.19 (95% CI, 0.08-0.42)] followed by patients with advanced HCC who received curative treatment [HR = 0.37 (95% CI, 0.22-0.64)]. Baseline performance status was significantly associated with receipt of curative treatment as well as survival after adjusting for demographics, clinical characteristics, and HCC stage.Conclusions:In this multicenter database, most of the patients with early HCC received potentially curative treatment. However, only 28% of patients had early HCC. One-third of patients with non-early HCC also underwent curative therapy. Potentially curative treatment improved survival and this effect was seen in patients with early as well as non-early HCC.
