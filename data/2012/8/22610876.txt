Purpose:We retrospectively evaluated whether combined use of chemoembolization expands ablative zone sizes created by radiofrequency (RF) ablation in patients with small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).Materials and methods:Fifty-seven patients treated with single RF ablation for solitary HCC measuring ≤2 cm were assessed. RF ablation alone was done in nine patients and in 48 patients following chemoembolization, with an interval of 0 days in 6, 1-14 days in 27, 15-28 days in 6, and ≥4 weeks in 9. Ablative zone sizes, disappearance of tumor enhancement, and creation of sufficient ablative margins (>5 mm) were evaluated on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images.Results:Both mean long-axis (4.2-4.7 vs. 3.6 ± 0.4 cm, p Conclusion:Ablative zones created by RF ablation with chemoembolization become larger than RF ablation alone, leading to secure ablative margins.
