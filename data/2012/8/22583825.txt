Background:Recent studies have suggested that common genetic polymorphisms alter the processing of microRNA (miRNA) and may be associated with the development and progression of cancer.Patients and methods:The association of miRNA polymorphisms with HCC survival was analyzed in 159 HCC patients and 201 controls by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.Results:The risk of HCC was significantly lower for the miR-499A>G, AG+GG in HCC patients (AOR=0.603, 95% CI=0.370-0.984) and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients (AOR=0.561, 95% CI 0.331-0.950). In addition, the risk of HCC was significantly lower for the miR-149C>T, CT and CT+CC in HCC patients (CT; AOR=0.542, 95% CI=0.332-0.886, CT+CC; AOR=0.536, 95% CI=0.335-0.858) and HBV-related HCC patients (CT: AOR=0.510, 95% CI 0.305-0.854, CT+CC: AOR=0.496, 95% CI 0.302-0.813). The miR-149C>T polymorphism was also associated with survival rate of HCC patients in OKUDA II stage.Conclusions:miR-149C>T and miR-499A>G were associated with HBV-related HCC. Further studies on larger populations will need to be conducted to confirm these results.
