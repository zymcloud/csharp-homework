Background:Recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative resection usually originates from intrahepatic metastasis (IM) or multicentric occurrence (MO). The long-term outcomes of repeat hepatic resection in patients with different types of recurrence have not been evaluated in a large number of patients. The surgical indications for recurrent HCC remain controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate long-term outcomes of repeat hepatic resection and clinicopathologic factors associated with different types of recurrent HCC, and to single out principle differentiating factors between IM and MO.Methods:82 patients who underwent repeat hepatic resection for recurrent HCC were retrospectively studied. The recurrent type was evaluated by histopathologic analysis of primary and recurrent HCC. The recurrence and survival rates as well as clinicopathologic factors associated with different types of recurrence were analyzed.Results:45 patients (54.9%) had confirmed with IM, and 37 patients (45.1%) had with MO. The recurrence rates in the MO patients after initial or repeat resection were significantly lower than those in the IM patients (p Conclusions:Repeat hepatic resection resulted in much higher survival rates in the MO patients than in the IM patients. Repeat hepatic resection could be recommended for those patients in whom the recurrent HCC occurs more than 18 months after initial resection.
