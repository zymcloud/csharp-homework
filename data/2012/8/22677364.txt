Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the preferred treatment for unresectable, intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, survival after TACE can be highly variable, suggesting the need for more accurate patient selection to improve therapeutic outcome. We have explored the prognostic ability of the blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a biomarker of systemic inflammation, as a predictor of survival after TACE. Fifty-four patients with a diagnosis of HCC eligible for TACE were selected. Clinicopathologic variables were collected, including demographics, tumor staging, liver functional reserve, and laboratory variables. Dynamic changes in the NLR before and after TACE were studied as predictors of survival using both a univariate and multivariate Cox regression model. Patients in whom the NLR remained stable or normalized after TACE showed a significant improvement in overall survival of 26 months compared with patients showing a persistently abnormal index (P = 0.006). Other predictors of survival on univariate analysis were Cancer of the Liver Italian Program score (P = 0.05), intrahepatic spread (P = 0.01), tumor diameter > 5 cm (P = 0.02), > 1 TACE (P = 0.01), alpha-fetoprotein â‰¥ 400 (P = 0.002), and radiologic response to TACE (P
