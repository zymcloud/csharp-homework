The evaluated article assesses the effectiveness in clinical practice of surveillance with ultrasound (US) and Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) in patients at risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. After a median follow-up of 3.5 years, among the 442 enrolled patients with cirrhosis, 41 developed tumor (annual incidence, 2.8%). Twenty-three hepatocellular carcinomas were diagnosed at Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer early stage (single tumor 20 ng/ml. Specificity was 91.5% for US and 90.5% for AFP. The combination of the tests increased the sensitivity to 90.2%, with a small decrease in specificity (83.3%). In a real-world setting, the combination of US and AFP would be the most effective for hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance.
