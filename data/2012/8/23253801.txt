Objective:To explore the prognostic factors for the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation (LT) through analyzing the clinical and imaging characteristics of HCC.Methods:The preoperative data of 230 consecutive HCC cases undergoing LT were retrospectively collected from our hospital from October 2003 to July 2009. There were 210 males and 20 females with a median age of 50 years. Their survival rates were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. The disease-free survival curves of different prognostic factors were plotted by Kaplan-Meier method. The prognostic factors were analyzed by Log-rank test and Forward Conditional Cox regression respectively to yield the related risk factors and independent risk factors for the recurrence of HCC after LT.Results:The median follow-up period was 29 months (range: 3 - 68). The outcomes included recurrence (n = 77), no recurrence (n = 153) and mortality (n = 63). Their 1-, 3- and 5-year cumulative survival rates and cumulative disease-free survival rates were 84%, 75%, 69% and 73%, 65%, 63% respectively. Univariate analysis with Log-rank test revealed that the following prognostic factors were significant (P 5 cm, the post-intervention diameter of viable tumor ≥ 30% of entire tumor diameter, tumor distribution > 1 lobe, indistinct boundary of tumor, histological differentiation, serum α-fetoprotein level > 400 ng/ml, the sum of viable tumor diameters ≥ 7.7 cm and intrahepatic portal venous thrombosis. Multivariate analysis with a forward conditional Cox hazard model revealed that the following prognostic factors were independently statistically significant (P 400 ng/ml, the sum of viable tumor diameters ≥ 7.7 cm and intrahepatic portal venous thrombosis.Conclusions:Poor histological differentiation, serum α-fetoprotein level > 400 ng/ml, the sum of viable tumor diameters ≥ 7.7 cm and intrahepatic portal venous thrombosis are significant risk factors. Preoperative aggressive interventional therapy may prolong the disease-free survival period of HCC after LT.
