Purpose:The purpose of this study was to describe imaging appearances of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) supplied exclusively by the hepatic falciform artery (HFA) and safety of chemoembolization via the HFA.Methods:During the past 6 years, we have performed chemoembolization for the treatment of 12 patients with HCCs supplied exclusively by the HFA. Computed tomography (CT) scans, digital subtraction angiograms, and medical records were retrospectively reviewed by consensus.Results:Tumors were located in Couinaud segments IV (n = 7) and III (n = 5) and in subcapsular areas around the falciform ligaments. Tumor size ranged from 1.0 to 1.8 cm (mean, 1.3 cm; median, 1.3 cm). HFAs originated from A4 (n = 7), A3 (n = 4), and the left hepatic artery near the umbilical point (n = 1). All tumors were supplied exclusively by the HFA. Prophylactic embolization of the distal HFA before chemoembolization was performed using gelatin sponge particles in only one patient, and selective chemoembolization via the HFA was achieved in all patients. One patient suffered from a skin rash after chemoembolization and recovered after conservative management. Individual responses of tumors supplied exclusively by the HFA were complete response (n = 8), partial response (n = 1), and stable disease (n = 2) at the first follow-up enhanced CT scan.Conclusions:The HFA can supply HCC located in subcapsular areas around the falciform ligament, and the tumors can be safely chemoembolized without significant complications.
