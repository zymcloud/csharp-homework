This report describes an 8.8-year-old Simmental cow with squamous cell carcinoma of the reticulum and liver. The cow had calved recently and was referred to our clinic because of intractable fever, anorexia and progressive indigestion. The general condition and mental status were moderately affected and rectal temperature and respiratory rate were significantly elevated. There were no ruminal sounds and pinching of the withers consistently elicited a grunt. Serum activities of gamma glutamyl transferase, glutamate dehydrogenase and sorbitol dehydrogenase were elevated. Radiographic examination of the reticulum and ultrasonographic examination of the reticulum, liver and abdominal cavity revealed multifocal, poorly demarcated, heterogeneous and echogenic changes in the liver. Biopsy of these lesions yielded a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. The cow was euthanized and a postmortem examination confirmed the diagnosis. A 15 by 15 cm neoplasm was found in the reticular wall, and histological examination showed squamous cell carcinoma. It was assumed that the reticular mass was the primary tumour, which metastasized to the liver via the portal vein.
