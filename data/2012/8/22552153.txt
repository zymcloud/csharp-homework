Tumor recurrence-related microRNAs (miRNAs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) are not clear yet. This study was designed to determine whether altered miRNA expression is associated with HCC recurrence and prognosis following OLT. 18 miRNAs, including 6 up-regulated and 12 down-regulated miRNAs were identified by microarray in primary HCC samples of patients who had developed HCC recurrence (n = 5) compared to those with non-recurrence (n = 5) following OLT by using p
