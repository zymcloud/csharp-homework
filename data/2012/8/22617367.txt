Objective:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects 170 million patients worldwide and is the leading cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of the current study is to examine the burden of HCV in the European Union (EU) from a patient perspective.Methods:Using data from the 2010 EU National Health and Wellness Survey, patients who reported a diagnosis of HCV (n=332) were compared with a propensity-score-matched non-HCV control group (n=332) on measures of quality of life (using the SF-12v2), work productivity, and healthcare resource utilization in the past 6 months. All analyses applied sampling weights to project to the respective country populations.Results:Projected prevalence estimates of HCV were 0.59% in France, 0.44% in Germany, 1.42% in Italy, 0.82% in Spain, and 0.35% in the UK. HCV patients reported significantly lower levels of emotional role limitations (means=66.4 vs. 70.6, P=0.040), physical functioning (means=63.8 vs. 71.9, P=0.001), general health (means=48.3 vs. 54.4, P=0.004), bodily pain (means=64.3 vs. 70.8, P=0.002), and physical component summary scores (means=42.9 vs. 45.3, P=0.002) than the matched controls. Patients with HCV also reported significantly higher levels of presenteeism (means=27.1 vs. 21.0%, P=0.044) and a greater number of physician visits in the past 6 months (means=9.9 vs. 6.7, PConclusion:Using a population-based survey methodology and a propensity-score matching analysis, these results add to the literature by documenting the significant effect that HCV has on a variety of both humanistic and economic outcomes in the EU.
