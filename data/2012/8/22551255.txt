Expression of PRL3 (phosphatase of regenerating liver 3) protein was examined with immunohistochemistry in 60 cases of ESCC (oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma) with matched lymph node metastasis (n = 40) and 6 cases of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Its associations with PRL1 and clinicopathological parameters were analysed. The results showed the frequency of PRL3 protein expression was significantly higher in ESCC (39/60, 65%) than in normal oesophageal mucosa (0/20, P < 0.001); higher in ESCC with lymph node metastasis (30/40, 75%) than in ESCC without lymph node metastasis (9/20, P = 0.022), as well as higher in metastatic ESCC in lymph node (38/40, 95%) than in the primary ESCC (39/60, 65%, P < 0.001). PRL3 was expressed in 1 out of 6 oesophageal adenocarcinomas, but showed no nuclear staining of PRL1. Expression of PRL3 protein was positively associated with the grade and partially with the stage of ESCC. These results suggest that expression of PRL3 protein may be involved in the metastasis of ESCC and serve as a biomarker for prediction of ESCC metastasis.
