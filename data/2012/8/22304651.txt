Background:Activin-A is a molecule of the TGF superfamily, implicated in liver fibrosis, regeneration and stem cell differentiation. However, data on activins in liver diseases are few. We therefore studied serum levels of activin-A in chronic liver diseases. To identify the origin of activin-A, levels in the hepatic vein were also estimated.Materials and methods:Nineteen controls and 162 patients participated in the study: 39 with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC: 19 viral associated and 20 alcohol associated), 18 with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), 47 with primary biliary cirrhosis (26 PBC stage I-II and 21 stage IV), 22 with alcoholic cirrhosis (AC, hepatic vein blood available in 16), 20 with HCV cirrhosis (hepatic vein blood available in 18) and 16 patients with alcoholic fatty liver with mild to moderate fibrosis but no cirrhosis.Results:Activin-A levels were significantly increased (P Conclusions:Increased serum levels of activin-A only in patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis or HCC suggest a possible role of this molecule in the pathophysiology of AC. Further research is warranted to elucidate its role during the profibrotic process and its possible clinical applications.
