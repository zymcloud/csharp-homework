An 84-year-old woman with hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and atrial fibrillation, who presented with hematemesis, was initially treated with endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) for an esophageal varix hemorrhage. However, computed tomography (CT) upon admission had revealed portal vein thrombosis, despite having received warfarin for existing atrial fibrillation. We subsequently initiated a 2-week treatment with danaparoid;warfarin being discontinued in order to reduce the risk of re-hemorrhage. A follow-up CT after treatment revealed complete reduction of the portal vein thrombosis. This is the first successful report of danaparoid use in the treatment of portal vein thrombosis that developed in a patient who had received warfarin.
