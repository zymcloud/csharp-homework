The incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is increasing at an astonishing rate in the US population. Although only a small proportion of these patients develop steatohepatitis (NASH), those who do have a greater likelihood of developing end-stage liver disease and complications. Research on liver fibrosis and NASH progression shows that hedgehog (Hh) is reactivated after liver injury to assist in liver repair and regeneration. When the process of tissue repair and regeneration is prolonged or when Hh ligand and related genes are aberrantly regulated and excessive, tissue repair goes awry and NASH progresses to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
