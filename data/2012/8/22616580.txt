Introduction:Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor with anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative activity that is indicated for use in hepatocellular and renal cell carcinomas. Sorafenib is being developed in a number of solid tumors, including breast cancer (BC).Areas covered:A series of four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIb screening Trials were developed to Investigate the Efficacy of Sorafenib (TIES) when added to select chemotherapies for patients with HER2-negative advanced BC with a primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS). Results have been varied. SOLTI-0701 reported significant PFS benefit for sorafenib plus capecitabine as first- or second-line treatment, and AC01B07 reported a modest but significant PFS benefit when sorafenib was combined with gemcitabine or capecitabine for patients whose disease had progressed during or after bevacizumab. Sorafenib plus first-line paclitaxel did not significantly improve PFS (NU07B1 study), nor did its addition to first-line docetaxel and/or letrozole (FM-B07-01 study). A Phase III trial of sorafenib plus capecitabine has been initiated.Expert opinion:Phase IIb data indicate a potential role for sorafenib in combination with select chemotherapies for HER2-negative advanced BC, but Phase III confirmatory trials are necessary. The variability in results across studies with sorafenib may be related to the chemotherapy combination and/or patient population.
