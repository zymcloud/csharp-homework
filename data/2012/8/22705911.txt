Ethnopharmacological relevance:Anthocephalus cadamba (Roxb.) Miq. (Family: Rubiaceae) is commonly known as "Kadamba" in Sanskrit and Hindi in India. Various parts of this plant have been used as a folk medicine for the treatment of tumor, wound healing, inflammation and as a hypoglycemic agent.Aim of study:The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the antitumor activity and antioxidant status of defatted methanol extract of A. cadamba (MEAC) on Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) treated mice.Materials and methods:In vitro cytotoxicity assay has been evaluated by using the trypan blue method. The determination of in vivo antitumor activity was performed by using different EAC cells (2 Ã— 10(6) cells, i.p.) inoculated mice groups (n=12). The groups were treated for 9 consecutive days with MEAC at the doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg b.w. respectively. After 24h of last dose and 18 h of fasting, half of the mice were sacrificed and the rest were kept alive for assessment of increase in life span. The antitumor potential of MEAC was assessed by evaluating tumor volume, viable and nonviable tumor cell count, tumor weight, hematological parameters and biochemical estimations. Furthermore, antioxidant parameters were assayed by estimating liver and kidney tissue enzymes.Results:MEAC showed direct cytotoxicity on EAC cell line in a dose dependant manner. MEAC exhibited significant (P<0.01) decrease in the tumor volume, viable cell count, tumor weight and elevated the life span of EAC tumor bearing mice. The hematological profile, biochemical estimations and tissue antioxidant assay were reverted to normal level in MEAC treated mice.Conclusion:Experimental results revealed that MEAC possesses potent antitumor and antioxidant properties. Further research is going on to find out the active principle(s) of MEAC for better understanding of mechanism of its antitumor and antioxidant activity.
