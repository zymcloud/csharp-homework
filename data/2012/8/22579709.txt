Avian reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) infection can induce a runting syndrome, immunosuppression, acute reticulum cell neoplasia and lymphomas in a variety of domestic and wild birds. To evaluate the pathogenicity and oncogenicity of REV-JX0927 that isolated from Chinese partridge, experimental inoculated day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) White Leghorn chickens were examined at regular intervals. The examination procedures included hematology, serology and histopathology; also including immunohistochemistry and apoptosis assay. Body weight, relative immune organs weight and apoptosis assay results revealed that the immunosuppression of infected birds is associated with apoptosis of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues, especially in thymus induced by REV-JX0927. Hematology and apoptosis assay results showed that the 7th week of post-infection is a critical time point for lymphocytes to be transformed into tumor cells. Histopathology evidences demonstrated that REV-JX0927 induced reticuloendotheliosis at early stage (1 week), and lymphosarcomas at middle stage (after 7 weeks). In addition, squamous-cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and aneurysm were found in infected birds. Arteritis was associated with concentration of serum protein and fat. REV antigen expression was observed in infected birds through the experimental period. REV has high tropism for proventriculus, kidney, liver, lymphoid tissues, pancreas, lymphosarcoma cells and blood vessels. Data from this study showed that several new pathogenitic characters caused by REV-JX0927 were observed. It indicated that REV-JX0927 is a multipotential oncogenic retrovirus.
