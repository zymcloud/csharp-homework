Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in cases of orthotopic liver transplantation is gaining acceptance for intraoperative hemodynamic monitoring. The timepoint of TEE probe insertion varies and is based on the fear of bleeding complications in the setting of portal hypertension with esophageal varices. In this case, early insertion of the TEE probe and examination resulted in the early detection of a large intracardiac thrombus, and thus the cancellation of the planned procedure. This case highlights the potential value of early TEE examination in orthotopic liver transplantation.
