Previous studies have shown that high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation can enhance host antitumor immune response, though the mechanism is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated whether HIFU ablation could activate tumor-specific T lymphocytes and then induce antitumor cellular immunity. We studied 70 C57BL/6J mice bearing the H(22) tumor; they were randomly divided into a HIFU group and a sham-HIFU group. Of the mice, 35 in the HIFU group underwent HIFU ablation of the H(22) hepatic tumor, and the remaining 35 received a sham-HIFU procedure. In addition, 35 female, na√Øve syngeneic C57BL/6J mice were used as controls. All mice were sacrificed 14 days after HIFU, and the spleens were harvested. The function of T lymphocytes was determined. As a valuable tool for detecting and characterizing peptide-specific cells, the frequency of MHC class I tetramer/CD8-positive cells was quantified, which could help to determine the response and number of T lymphocytes. The therapeutic effect of the HIFU-activated lymphocytes on tumor-bearing mice was investigated after adoptive transfer of the lymphocytes. The results showed that compared to sham-HIFU and control groups, HIFU ablation significantly increased the cytotoxicity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (p
