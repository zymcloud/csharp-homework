Twenty-two quinazoline derivatives have been synthesised and examined for their anti-tumour activity against three tumour cell lines, namely human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) and human hepatoma cell line (HepG2). Twelve of the tested compounds have shown promising anti-tumour activity with an IC(50) range of 5.0-9.7 Âµg/mL. Regarding the spectrum of activity, five compounds exhibited interesting anti-proliferative properties against the three tested cell lines comparable to the reference drug (dasatinib).
