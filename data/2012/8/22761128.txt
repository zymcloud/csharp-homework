Background:The in vivo molecular imaging method is a useful tool for monitoring carcinogenesis in various hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) models, such as xenografted-, chemical induced- and transgenic mice. The tumor-specific gene expression strategy, such as transcriptional targeting, is essential for achieving a lower toxicity for normal liver tissue in therapy and the monitoring of tumor progression in diagnosis, respectively. The present study aimed to visualize spontaneously developing Î±-fetoprotein (AFP)-producing HCC through targeted gene expression in tumors using recombinant adenoviral vector.Methods:The recombinant adenovirus vector, AdAFPfLuc (containing firefly luciferase gene driven by human AFP enhancer/promoter) was prepared. After in vitro infection by adenovirus, gene expression was confirmed using the luciferase assay, semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting in AFP-producing and nonproducing cells. Tumor-bearing mice were intravenously injected with adenovirus, and bioluminescent images were obtained.Results:The expression of fLuc was efficiently demonstrated by the luciferase assay in AFP-producing cells but not in AFP-nonproducing cells. AFP-producing HCC targeted gene expression was confirmed at the mRNA and protein levels. After being injected intravenously in HuH-7 xenografts and HCC-bearing diethylnitrosamine-treated mice using adenovirus, functional reporter gene expression was confirmed in tumors by in vivo bioluminescent imaging (BLI).Conclusions:The recombinant adenovirus vector system can be used to monitor spontaneously developing AFP-producing HCC and to evaluate targeted gene expression in tumors by in vivo BLI in a small animal model.
