Introduction:We investigated the role of operative therapy in non-cirrhotic patients who developed metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:This retrospective cohort study included consecutive non-cirrhotic patients with metastatic HCC after a prior hepatectomy treated between 1990 and 2009. Patients were stratified by operative therapy (resection, ablation, transcatheter therapy). Kaplan-Meier analyses with log-rank comparisons tested effects of operative therapy on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).Results:Of 195 non-cirrhotic patients treated for HCC during the study period, 98 [median age 65, interquartile range (IQR) 53-71; 55 % male] subsequently developed metastatic HCC (55 intrahepatic only). Median time to development of metastases after the index operation was 10 months (IQR 5-20 months); median number of metastases was 3 (IQR 2-7). Half of these patients (n = 50) underwent operative treatment of metastases; 20 (40 %) underwent metastasectomy, 18 (36 %) ablation, and 12 (24 %) transcatheter therapy. Operative therapy was associated with improved OS (p Conclusions:Resection and ablation are associated with an improved PFS and long-term OS and should be considered in select patients with metastatic HCC.
