Spontaneous hemoperitoneum (SP) is defined as the presence of blood within the peritoneal cavity that is unrelated to trauma. Although there is a vast array of etiologies for SP, primary hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic adenoma are considered to be the most common causes. Hepatic metastatic tumor associated with spontaneous rupture is rare. SP from hepatic metastatic trophoblastic tumor may initially present with a sudden onset of abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in establishing the diagnosis of SP, indicating its origin and etiology, and determining subsequent management. Herein, we report an uncommon case of hemoperitoneum from spontaneous rupture of a hepatic metastatic trophoblastic tumor in a young female patient. Interestingly, the contrast-enhanced CT findings demonstrated hypervascular hepatic masses with persistent enhancement at all phases, which were completely different from the common appearances of hepatic metastases. For SP resulting from hepatic metastatic tumors, surgical intervention is still the predominant therapeutic method, but the prognosis is very poor.
