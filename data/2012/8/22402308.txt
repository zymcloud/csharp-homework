Background:studies investigating the associations between UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A7 (UGT1A7) gene polymorphisms and various carcinomas risk reported conflicting results. To derive a more precise estimation of the association, we have conducted a meta-analysis.Methods:data were collected from the following electronic databases: PubMed, Medline and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, with the last report up to September 2011. Case-control studies containing available genotype frequencies of UGT1A7 were chose. The odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were used to assess the strength of association.Results:a total of 22 separate case-control studies including 3852 cases and 5604 controls based on the search criteria were involved in this meta-analysis. The combined results based on all studies showed that there was a statistically significant link between UGT1A7*3 allele and cancer risk (OR = 1.31, 95%CI = 1.14-1.50, P = 0.0001). In the stratified analysis by racial descent, significant increased risk was found in Asian population for UGT1A7*3 allele (OR = 1.41, 95%CI = 1.22-1.63, P Conclusions:This meta-analysis suggests that the UGT1A7*3 allele is a risk factor for cancer among Asians, especially for hepatocellular carcinoma.
