Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization are widely used palliative treatments for patients with nonsurgical hepatocellular carcinoma. TAE has been shown to increase levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) in tumors. In this study, we investigated whether RNA interference (RNAi) of HIF-1α could improve the efficacy of TAE to treat HCC. Four treatment groups were assessed using a rat allograft model of HCC: RNAi of HIF-1α combined with TAE, RNAi of HIF-1α only, TAE only, and a control group. Rats were treated by TAE by retrograde placement of a microcatheter into the gastroduodenal artery. The results demonstrated that the RNAi of HIF-1α visibly reduced the expression of HIF-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor, suppressed tumor angiogenesis, and attenuated metastasis, which were all enhanced by TAE. The RNAi of HIF-1α synergized with TAE to significantly inhibit tumor growth. In conclusion, RNAi of HIF-1α augmented the therapeutic effects of TAE and diminished its undesirable effects.
