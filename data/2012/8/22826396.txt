Objective:The purpose of this article is to assess CT enhancement patterns of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within 1 month after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) using drug-eluting beads and to determine whether enhancement patterns may be useful for predicting local tumor progression.Materials and methods:Forty-one patients with 50 HCCs underwent CT within 1 month after TACE with drug-eluting beads. Two blinded readers independently reviewed the arterial phase images and classified enhancement patterns as follows: no enhancement, peripheral ring enhancement, and peripheral nodulelike enhancement. Enhancement patterns were correlated with time to tumor progression of enhancing tissue by log-rank test.Results:In the group with no enhancement, 92.3% (24/26) had not progressed and 7.7% (2/26) showed progression; for peripheral ring enhancement, 83.3% (10/12) had not progressed and 16.7% (2/12) showed progression; and for peripheral nodulelike enhancement, 16.7% (2/12) had not progressed and 83.3% (10/12) showed progression. The time to progression of enhancing tissue was significantly different between the group with no enhancement plus peripheral ring enhancement and the group with peripheral nodulelike enhancement (p Conclusion:Analysis of enhancement patterns at the arterial phase of the first follow-up CT after TACE with drug-eluting beads is helpful for predicting progression of treated HCC.
