Olfactory communication is an important aspect of the biology of ground squirrels; accordingly, some of their integumentary glands are associated with scent-marking behavior. Although reports of neoplasms in ground squirrels are limited, the literature on tumors in this family of rodents is extensive, with hepatocellular carcinomas in woodchucks and fibromas in squirrels being the 2 most common neoplasms. Apocrine gland tumors occur frequently in domestic animals such as cats and dogs but to our knowledge have not previously been reported in squirrels. Here we describe 2 cases of adenocarcinoma of the dorsal glands in privately owned European ground squirrels (Spermophilus citellus). The skin nodules were characterized histologically by proliferation of epithelial cells, which were arranged in a tubuloacinar pattern with neoplastic emboli within the blood vessels. Adenocarcinoma of the dorsal glands was diagnosed in light of the anatomic localization, immunohistochemistry results, and histochemistry findings.
