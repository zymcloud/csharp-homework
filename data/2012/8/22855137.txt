Angiogenesis is a cornerstone in the process of hepatocarcinogenesis. In the sorafenib era, other antiangiogenic targeted drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies and a new generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have been shown in phase II trials to be safe and effective in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Several currently active phase III trials are testing these drugs, both in first- and second-line settings. Strategies to overcome primary and acquired resistance to antiangiogenic therapy are urgently needed. Novel biomarkers may help in improving the efficacy of drugs targeting angiogenesis.
