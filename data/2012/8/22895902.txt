The costs of guideline-based treatment are unknown for most diseases. This also applies for economically significant infectious diseases like viral hepatitis and HIV. On the basis of the "German Guidelines for the Management of HBV Infection" from 2011 patients were grouped into HBsAg-positive, immuntolerant and chronic hepatitis patients with and without cirrhosis. Costs were divided in baseline diagnostics, monitoring and medical treatment according to the guideline. The calculation was modelled for a period of five years. Costs for virological diagnostics and imaging account for a large proportion of diagnostic costs. The main cost factors are expenses for pharmaceutical treatment with interferon or HBV polymerase inhibitors. On the assumption that only 25 % of the infected patients are diagnosed, 5-year total costs in Germany account for more than 2.5 billion Euros. Therefore, chronic hepatitis B is a disease with a very high economic burden. The aim of a guideline treatment is to prevent the development of cirrhosis with all its complications as well as the development of liver-cell carcinoma. Prophylactic vaccination against hepatitis B should be advised also considering the potential economic impact.
