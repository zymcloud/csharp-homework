Aim:In spite of numerous studies on the association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the results are inconsistent and whether and how the effect of DM on the risk for HCC is modified or synergistically exerted by hepatitis virus infection are still unclear. We aimed to elucidate and quantify the effect modification and synergism between hepatitis B and C virus (HBV and HCV, respectively) and DM leading to the risk for HCC and also assess the independent contribution of DM to the risk for HCC at population level (population attributable fraction) in a high prevalence area of hepatitis virus infection.Methods:A hospital-based case-control study was conducted from one medical center. Information on hepatitis B and C virus infection and DM status (defined by 8-h fasting blood glucose level â‰¥126 mg/dL, current use of oral hyperglycemic agent or insulin injection) was collected to assess interaction of hepatitis virus infection with DM on the risk for HCC.Results:The association between DM and the risk for HCC was significant regardless of the presence of HBV infection, whereas a significant positive association was noted for HCV negativity. Synergistic interactions between DM and HBV infection were significant. In the absence of both hepatitis virus infections, the independent effect of DM accounted for 7.5% risk for HCC from the underlying population.Conclusion:The effect of DM on the risk for developing HCC is higher in HCV negative patients and synergistic with HBV infection. The independent effect of DM provides a new insight to the prevention of HCC other than virus-related mechanism.
