The incidence of bone metastasis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has reportedly been increasing. The hyoid bone is rarely a target of metastatic HCC. We present a unique case of HCC which showed a single distant metastasis to the hyoid bone. An 81-year-old Japanese man was referred to us from the Department of Gastroenterology complaining of a 1-month history of a painful left neck mass when swallowing. He had a serial history of non-surgical treatments for HCC in the previous six years. Ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration cytology yielded a diagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinoma. PET-CT demonstrated a mass (SUV 3.8) which had destroyed the left side of the hyoid body. Based on these cytological and radiological findings of the mass in addition to his medical history of having recurrent HCC, we strongly suspected that the mass was a solitary metastatic HCC of the hyoid bone. The mass was completely resected combined with the hyoid bone under general anesthesia. Postoperative pathologic findings were consistent with metastatic HCC. The patient was relieved from pain in swallowing just after surgery. Minimally invasive surgery can be an effective treatment modality for pain relief even in patients with bone metastasis from HCC.
