HLE, a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line was transiently transfected with normal human MnSOD and MnSOD without a mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS). Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and apoptosis were examined as a function of time following 18.8 Gy X-ray irradiation. Our results showed that the level of mitochondrial ROS increased and reached a maximum level 2 hours after X-ray irradiation. Authentic MnSOD, but not MnSOD lacking MTS, protected against mitochondrial ROS, lipid peroxidation and apoptosis. In addition, the levels of mitochondrial ROS were consistently found to always correlate with the levels of authentic MnSOD in mitochondria. These results suggest that only when MnSOD is located in mitochondria is it efficient in protecting against cellular injuries by X-ray irradiation and that mitochondria are the critical sites of X-ray-induced cellular oxidative injuries.
