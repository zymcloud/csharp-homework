Igf2 gene specific hypomethylation has been demonstrated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and in non-tumoral liver samples from patients with HCV-related cirrhosis who further developed HCC. In patients with colorectal cancers, Igf2 hypomethylation is found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) even prior to the occurrence of cancer.Aim:To compare Igf2 methylation in PBMC from healthy donors and patients with HCV-related cirrhosis without or with history of HCC.Patients and methods:After DNA extraction from frozen PBMC samples of 52 healthy blood donors and 121 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis either without (n=59) or with past or present HCC (n=62), and sodium bisulfite treatment, unbiased PCR amplification and Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC) analysis were used for methylation analysis at the differentially methylated region 2 of Igf2. Methylation profiles were classified in three groups (unmethylated, U; methylated, M; and intermediate, UM) according to the proportions of M and U alleles, blindly to clinical data. In addition, 677C-T mutation of Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (MTHFR) was investigated by fluorescent probes.Results:Prevalences of U, UM and M Igf2 profiles were: 8%, 65% and 27% in blood donors, 0%, 81% and 19% in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis without HCC, 71%, 29% and 0% in patients with HCC (PConclusion:These observations suggest a decrease of Igf2 methylation from cirrhosis to HCC in patients with HCV infection, which may be an additional risk factor for HCC.
