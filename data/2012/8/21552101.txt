Objectives:To evaluate the impact of long-term outcomes of transarterial embolization (TAE) therapy in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on the waiting list for liver transplantation (LT).Methods:We retrospectively evaluated the post-LT patients with HCV-related HCC who received TAE intervention (n=33) and those who had no treatment (n=47) while on the waiting list to determine long-term outcomes.Results:Over a 10-year period, of the 424 patients transplanted with HCV, 80 patients had HCC with a tumor burden within Milan criteria. For the entire study cohort, the mean duration of post-LT follow-up was 3.5 years; mean time of transplant waiting list was 120 days; and median post-LT survival was 8.9 years. The survival rates at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years were 82%, 70%, 55%, and 35%, respectively. From the study cohort, 33 patients received TAE and 47 patients did not while on the waiting list. The 2 groups were well matched, except, that the intervention patients received post-LT interferon more often and had a shorter time on the waiting list (56.2 d) when compared with the no treatment group (164.6 d, PConclusions:Pre-LT transarterial therapy has no benefit on post-LT survival and tumor recurrence in patients with HCV-related HCC who underwent a mean waiting period of
