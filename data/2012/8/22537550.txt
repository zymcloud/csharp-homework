To investigate the role of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases V (GnT-V) in the malignancy of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the GnT-V stably suppressed cell line HepG2 GnT-V/1564 was constructed from HepG2. The proliferation, migration, invasion, metastasis of HepG2 GnT-V/1564 was investigated both in vitro and in vivo. The clinical pathological significance of GnT-V expression was also studied in 140 cases of HCC tissues. This study showed that down-regulation of GnT-V inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of the HepG2 cells. In addition, GnT-V expression was shown in 138 cases of 140 (98.6%) HCC samples, in 3 cases of 31 (9.7%) in liver cirrhosis cases and in 1 cases of 20 (5.0%) in normal liver tissues. Besides, a higher level of GnT-V was observed more frequently in the advanced tumors with higher T stage and histological grade. These data suggested that GnT-V expression was positively related with malignancy in HCC and GnT-V may be both a differentiation marker and a potential target for the treatment of HCC.
