Significant intraoperative bleeding and injuries to vital structures in the liver remnant can occur during liver parenchymal transection using the conventional clamp-crushing technique. We performed liver resection on 242 patients using a mosquito clamp-crushing technique combined with a self-assembled saline-linked diathermy for liver parenchymal transection. The mean blood loss was 215 mL (range 20-1100). There was no damage to the vital structures in the liver remnant. The mean liver transection time was 53 minutes (range 15-125). Our technique has the advantages of reducing blood loss, exposing vessles clearly and being simple, cheap and efficacious.
