Situs inversus totalis is a rare congenital anomaly in which the major abdominal organs are located as a mirror image of their normal positions. This poses much difficulty for surgeons. We describe how we performed the liver-hanging maneuver (LHM) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a 59-year-old man with situs inversus totalis, to resolve the difficulty of the mirror-image location of his liver. The HCC was located in the right lateral sector. Although segmentectomy of segment 7 would normally be considered minimal for a curative treatment of HCC, this was relatively complicated in this patient. Thus, we performed an extended right lateral sectionectomy using the LHM to achieve a simple transection. The hepatic hilum was dissected using the Glissonean pedicle transection method. The operation time and intraoperative blood loss were 6 h 45 min and 471 ml, respectively. No blood product transfusion was required. The LHM and the hilar Glissonean pedicle approach proved effective for resolving the difficulties of performing surgery in a mirror image for HCC in a patient with situs inversus totalis.
