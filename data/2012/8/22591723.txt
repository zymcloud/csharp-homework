Rationale and objectives:To retrospectively evaluate effectiveness and safety of radiofrequency (RF) ablation with retroperitoneal metastatic lymph nodes from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Thirty-two patients with retroperitoneal metastatic lymph node recurrence from HCC were enrolled in our study and the patients stratified into two groups based on the treatment. Nineteen patients in Group A were percutaneously treated and each metastatic lymph node was ablated with computed tomographic (CT) guidance. Thirteen patients in Group B only underwent RF ablation for hematogenous metastases, but did not undergo RF ablation or any other treatment for metastatic lymph nodes. Follow-up contrast material-enhanced CT or positron emission tomographic scans were reviewed and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were analyzed.Results:There were no significant differences between characteristics of the two groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated the patients of Group A had an overall survival of 26.3% at 1 year compared with 7.7% for those of Group B. Mantel-Cox log rank test showed the 1-year survival rate of Group A was significantly higher than that of Group B (P = .029). In Group A, the local control rate of 3, 6, 10, and 15 months was 78.9%, 73.3%, 41.7%, and 25.0%, respectively. Sixteen, 12, 6, and 2 patients showed no evidence of local progression for 3, 6, 10, and 15 months, respectively. There was no thermal injury of gastrointestinal tract or bile duct during RF ablation in all the 19 patients of Group A.Conclusion:RF ablation is effective and may be safely applied to retroperitoneal metastatic lymph nodes from HCC.
