Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary liver cancer with a huge challenge in terms of its complex etiology and its management. The fact that the most common site of early tumor recurrence in liver transplantation for HCC is the transplanted allograft strongly suggests that circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are really an active source of HCC metastasis or recurrence. In the past decade, with the tremendous progress in the technology of CTC detection, there is convincing evidence that CTCs have great potential as a marker for metastatic disease and poor prognosis in patients with a malignancy. Currently some interesting and encouraging results have been achieved in HCC CTC detection, although the knowledge about its clinical relevance in HCC is lagging behind other major tumor types. Here we will review existing and developing methodologies for CTC detection, discuss future perspectives, and describe the potential clinical impact of the identification and molecular characterization of CTC subset or circulating cancer stem cells in HCC patients. Particular attention is given to the results based on the HCC CTC study.
