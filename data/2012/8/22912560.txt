We report a case of cerebral lipiodol embolism (CLE) after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for unresectable hepatic carcinoma (HCC). A 54-year-old man with unresectable HCC underwent TACE via the right hepatic artery and right inferior phrenic artery using a mixture of 40 mg pirarubicin and 30 mL lipiodol. His level of consciousness deteriorated after TACE, and non-contrast computed tomography revealed a CLE. The cerebral conditions improved after supportive therapy. The complication might have been due to hepatic arterio-pulmonary vein shunt caused by direct invasion of the tumor. Even though CLE is an uncommon complication of TACE, we should be aware of these rare complications in patients with high risk factors.
