To explore the impact of the differences in baseline characteristics between immigrants with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and native-born patients on the prognosis of advanced fibrosis. A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 318 patients (including 128 immigrants) with CHC and advanced fibrosis attending a tertiary referral clinic. Patients' medical records were reviewed to collect data describing immigrant status, baseline characteristics, and liver-related clinical outcomes. Kaplan-Meier (KM) analyses and Cox proportional-hazards regression analyses were performed to explore the differences between the two groups with respect to clinical outcomes. Relative to native-born patients, immigrant patients were older, more likely to be female, and more likely to be Asian. Immigrants were less likely to be heavy drinkers, heavy smokers, injection drug users, and more likely to have type 2 diabetes. KM analyses indicated that immigrant patients had a significantly higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than Canadian-born patients (P = 0.005). Univariate Cox proportional-hazards analyses indicated that immigrant status (hazard ratio (HR) 2.22; P = 0.006), age (HR 1.07; P
