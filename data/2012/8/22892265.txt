Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common urological tumor known for its potential to metastasize. Common sites of metastasis include the lungs, lymph nodes, liver and bones but rare sites of metastasis are described. Gallbladder metastasis from RCC is very rare and occurs mostly in men. It is admitted that most cases are asymptomatic. Cholecystectomy has been performed as the treatment for solitary lesion. We describe a case of RCC metastasis diagnosed after lithiasic pancreatitis in a 68-year-old male. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a metachronous RCC metastasis to the gallbladder presenting concurrently with lithiasic pancreatitis.
