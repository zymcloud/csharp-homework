Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the gold standard of treatment for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and involves the administration of cytotoxic drugs, with or without lipiodol, by means of a catheter directly to the hepatic artery followed by the administration of embolizing agents such as spherical gelatin or polyvinyl alcohol particles. There are currently no global guidelines regarding the dose, choice or combination of cytotoxic agents for TACE; therefore it is difficult to compare data from different TACE studies. Superselective TACE with lipiodol is the primary TACE procedure that offers satisfactory levels of local control with a lower risk of complications. Approximately 40-70% of patients with HCC with tumours sized 4-5 cm or less attained complete tumour necrosis or remained local recurrence free for 3 years or longer following TACE. The early identification of unresponsiveness to TACE is important to allow for a timely switch to alternative therapies. The use of novel embolizing materials in TACE such as drug-eluting beads and radioembolization is likely to have beneficial effects. Indeed, the increase in angiogenic activity following TACE emphasizes the potential of TACE in combination with targeted molecular therapies such as the anti-angiogenesis inhibitor, sorafenib.
