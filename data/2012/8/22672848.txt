Background:The aim was to evaluate activity and toxicity of hepatic arterial infusion of oxaliplatin in combination with capecitabine in patients with metastatic breast cancer with liver metastases and limited extrahepatic disease.Patients and methods:Sixteen consecutive patients received capecitabine 13 00mg/m(2) daily combined with oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) every two weeks. Seven patients alternated between intrahepatic and systemic oxaliplatin, and in 9 oxaliplatin was primarily given intrahepatic. Five patients had liver-only metastases and 11 had additionally bone metastases. The patients had received median two previous chemotherapeutic regimens for metastatic disease.Results:The response rate was 50% and the stable disease (â‰¥6 months) rate 44%. Median progression free and overall survival was 7.9 and 19.2 months, respectively. The toxicity was moderate with abdominal pain, neuropathy, and hand foot syndrome as the most common adverse events.Conclusion:The combination of capecitabine and intrahepatic/systemic therapy with oxaliplatin was active in pretreated patients with liver metastasis from breast cancer.
