Background:En bloc resection of adjacent pelvic organ(s) may be needed to achieve clear surgical margins in rectal cancer surgery. An institutional experience is reported with perioperative morbidity and oncological outcomes.Methods:Patients were identified retrospectively from a prospectively collected institutional database (1992-2010). Outcomes, and clinical and pathological factors were determined from medical records. Estimated overall survival, overall recurrence and local recurrence were compared using the log rank method and Cox regression analysis.Results:Among 1831 patients with rectal cancer, 124 (6路8 per cent) underwent en bloc resection of part or all of an adjacent organ (vagina/uterus/ovary 90, prostate/seminal vesicle 23, bladder/ureter 15, small bowel/appendix 7). Five-year overall survival and local recurrence rates were 53路3 and 18路8 per cent respectively. There was one postoperative death, from multiple organ failure in a patient with liver cirrhosis. Fifty-two patients underwent sphincter-preserving surgery and three (6 per cent) developed an anastomotic leak. On univariable analysis, the only factor associated with local recurrence was completeness of resection (local recurrence rate 15 per cent versus 69 per cent for R0 versus R1 resection; P < 0路001). On multivariable analysis, factors associated with overall survival were sphincter-preserving surgery, absence of metastatic disease and R0 resection.Conclusion:Multiple organ resection for locally advanced primary rectal cancer had good oncological outcomes when clear resection margins were achieved.
