Eriodictyol [2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydrochromen-4-one] is a flavonoid with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Because inflammation and oxidative stress play critical roles in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus, the present study was designed to explore whether eriodictyol has therapeutic potential for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The results show that eriodictyol increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in both human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cells (HepG2) and differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes under high-glucose conditions. Eriodictyol also up-regulated the mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 (PPARγ2) and adipocyte-specific fatty acid-binding protein (aP2) as well as the protein levels of PPARγ2 in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, it reactivated Akt in HepG2 cells with high-glucose-induced insulin resistance. This response was strongly inhibited by pretreatment with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002, indicating that eriodictyol increased Akt phosphorylation by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway. These results imply that eriodictyol can increase glucose uptake and improve insulin resistance, suggesting that it may possess antidiabetic properties.
