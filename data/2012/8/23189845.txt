Objective:To study the gene copy number, mRNA transcription and protien expression of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) gene in primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC) patients and normal control individuals (NC) who are anti-HBs positive, and to investigate the variations in PD-1 gene copy numbers and its relationship with PHC.Methods:Real-time PCR was adopted to detect the PD-1 gene copy numbers and their mRNA expressions in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 24 samples of PHC patients and 26 of NC. Protein expression level of PD-1 on CD8+ T was analyzed by flow cytometry.Results:In terms of number of PD-1 gene copy numbers, the percentage of cases of haploid (single) was 34.62% and 4.17% in PHC group and control group respectively while the percentage of cases of diploid (double) was 61.54% and 95.83% respectively. The difference between the two was statistically significant (chi2 = 7.639, P = 0.006). The rate of cases with double PD-1 gene copy numbers was found to be higher in patients with PHC than in control group. It was also found that the average expression of PD-1 mRNA was 2.35E-03 in control group and 1.23E-03 in PHC group. The expression level was significant lower in PHC group than that in control group when compared by using Mann-whitey technic (U = 153, P = 0.009). Furthermore, the frequency of PD-1 protein expression on CD8+ T cells was 3.72 +/- 0.32 in control group and 16.13 +/- 1.68 in PHC group. The level of PD-1 mRNA expression was higher in PHC and significant differences was shown between two groups (t = -7.073, P = 0.000).Conclusions:Our study suggests that the variation in PD-1 gene copy number may trigger primary hepatocellular carcinoma to HBV carriers. The relationship between the variation of PD-1 gene copy numbers and its association with primary hepatocellular carcinoma is worth further focus.
