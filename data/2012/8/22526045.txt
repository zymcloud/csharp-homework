Background:Surgical strategies for the treatment of multiple hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) remain controversial. This study compared the prognostic power of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) criteria with the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) early-stage criteria.Methods:Clinical and survival data of 162 multiple-HCC patients in Child-Pugh class A who underwent curative resection were retrospectively reviewed. Prognostic risk factors were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:UCSF criteria were shown to independently predict overall and disease-free survival. In patients within the UCSF criteria, 3-year overall and disease-free survivals were significantly better than in those exceeding the UCSF criteria (68 vs. 34 % and 54 vs. 26 %, respectively; both p Conclusions:Multiple HCC patients within the UCSF criteria benefit from curative resection. Expansion of curative treatment is justified.
