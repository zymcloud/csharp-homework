Objective:To assess the value of abdominal three-dimensional medical image visualization system (MI-3DVS) in assisting complicated hepatectomy.Methods:Twenty-four patients undergoing complicated hepatectomy for hepatic carcinoma or hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia were enrolled in this study. Three-dimensional models of the organs, vessels and tumors were reconstructed with MI-3DVS, and virtual operations were carried out to assess the feasibility of hepatectomy. The diameter of the liver tumors, intraoperative blood loss and transfusion, complications, in-hospital mortality rate, and one-year survival rate were analyzed in these cases.Results:The operations were safely completed in all the cases without perioperative deaths. The mean diameter of liver tumor was 9.8âˆ“4.3 cm, and the median volumes of intraoperative blood loss and transfusion were 800 ml and 600 ml, respectively, with a blood transfusion rate of 91.7% (22/24). The incidence of complications was 29.2% (7/24), and the one-year survival rate was 37.5%.Conclusion:Three-dimensional techniques such as volumetric analysis and risk evaluation of residual liver blood supply and drainage can increase the accuracy of surgical planning and improve the safety of complicated hepatectomy.
