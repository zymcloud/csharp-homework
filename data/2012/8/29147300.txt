Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignant tumor of the liver that represents a serious public health problem all over the world, corresponding to the third cause of cancer death worldwide. The object was to present the clinical characteristics and follow-up of patients with HCC attended at the University Hospital of the Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto-USP (HCFMRP-USP), Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.Methods:Epidemiological and clinical data were revised from medical records.Results:A total of 130 patients participated in the study, 81.5% of them being males. Mean (± SD) age at the time of HCC diagnosis was 55.6 ± 11.2 years. Cirrhosis was present in 89.2% of cases, with 53.4% of the patients being Child-Pugh A; chronic hepatitis B or C without cirrhosis was detected in 3.2%, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in 3.8%, and a normal liver in 3.8%. Orthotopic liver transplantation was performed in 26.2% of the subjects, 16.9% of the patients were submitted to surgical resection, and 6.2% to percutaneous ethanol infusion (PEI). Transarterial embolization and transarterial chemoembolization were performed in 9.2% of the patients. Systemic chemotherapy was applied to 4.6% of cases and 24.6% of the patients received symptomatic treatment.Conclusion:Thus, in the present series cirrhosis was the main risk factor for HCC, with 53.4% of the patients being Child-Pugh A. Liver transplantation or surgical resection of the tumor, potentially curative techniques, were possible in only 43.1% of cases.
