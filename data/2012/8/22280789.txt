Gallbladder perforation with bile leak can result from thermal injury during radiofrequency ablation of liver tumours. Two case studies demonstrate a technique for preventing gallbladder injury to the peritoneal surface of a distended gallbladder adjacent to the anticipated hepatic ablation zone. The use of percutaneous gallbladder needle decompression can safely separate or retract the peritoneal surface of the gallbladder from a contiguous hepatic radiofrequency ablation zone.
