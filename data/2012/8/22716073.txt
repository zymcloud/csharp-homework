Liver transplantation (LT) is a validated treatment for selected cirrhotics with hepatocellular cancer (HCC). A retrospective single center study including 137 recipients having proven HCC was done to refine inclusion criteria for LT as well as to look at impact of locoregional treatment (LRT) on outcome. At pre-LT imaging, 42 (30.6%) patients were Milan criteria (MC)-OUT; 28 (20.4%) were University of California San Francisco criteria (UCSFC)-OUT. Pre-LT LRT was performed in 109 (79.6%) patients. Multivariate analysis identified four factors to be independently predictive of recurrence: tumour number >3, AFP level ≥400 ng/ml, microvascular invasion and rejection needing anti-lymphocytic antibodies. When considering pre-transplant variables only, AFP level ≥400 ng/ml (HR = 5.13; P < 0.0001) was the unique risk factor for recurrence; conversely, application of LRT was protective (HR = 0.42; P = 0.04). MC-IN patients having LRT (n = 79) had the best 5-year tumour-free survival (TFS) (91.6%). MC-IN patients without LRT (n = 16) and MC-OUT patients with LRT (n = 30) had similar good TFS (72.7% vs.77.5%); finally MC-OUT patients without LRT (n = 12) had the worst results (45.0%; vs. 1st group: P < 0.0001). Immediate pre-LT AFP and aggressive pre-transplant LRT strategy, especially in MC-OUT patients, are both important elements to further expand inclusion criteria without compromising long-term results of HCC liver recipients.
