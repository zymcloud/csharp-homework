Background & aims:Beyond 5 years, poorer survival, related to alcohol relapse, is observed in patients with liver transplant for alcohol-related liver disease (ALD). However, alcohol consumption has been significantly understudied in non-ALD transplant recipients. We aimed at analyzing the impact of alcohol consumption on long-term survival irrespective of the indication for transplantation.Methods:This observational study included consecutive adult recipients of a primary liver graft between 1991 and 2007 in our hospital, who survived >6 months. Patients without ALD as primary indication, but with a history of excessive alcohol consumption before transplantation, were classified as secondary indication ALD. We studied the impact on survival of excessive consumption of alcohol after transplantation and several other variables.Results:The 441 patients had mean follow-up of 81.7 months. Among the 281 patients with excessive alcohol consumption before transplantation, 206 had ALD as primary indication. After transplantation, alcohol consumption was reported by 32.3% of the study population, 43.7% in primary indication ALD, and 24.3% in non-ALD patients. Survival was 82% at 5 years and 49% at 10 years for patients with excessive alcohol relapse, compared with 86% and 75%, respectively, for patients without persistent excessive alcohol relapse. By multivariable analysis, the independent risk factors of death were: excessive alcohol relapse, age >51 years, post-transplantation diabetes mellitus, cyclosporine-based immunosuppression, and non-hepatic cancer.Conclusions:Excessive alcohol consumption has a negative impact on long-term survival after liver transplant, irrespective of the primary indication. Death is mainly due to recurrence of liver disease and non-hepatic cancer.
