Approximately 170 million people are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) worldwide. Sustained virological response (SVR) is equivalent to viral eradication and associated with a reduction in the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The treatment for genotype 1 HCV chronic infection is the addition of a protease inhibitor (telaprevir or boceprevir) to the pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) regimen. Treatment of genotype 1 na√Øve chronic hepatitis C with PEG-IFN and ribavirin (RBV) for 48 weeks results in SVR in approximately 40% of patients. Retreatment of previous relapsers to PEG-IFN/RBV therapy with triple therapy, a protease inhibitor (telaprevir or boceprevir), plus PEG-IFN and RBV results in SVR in more than 70% of cases. However, retreatment of previous non-responders to PEG-IFN/RBV therapy with these triple therapies, results in SVR in less than 30% of cases. The aim of this review is to summarize results obtained with Boceprevir or Telaprevir triple therapy for prior HCV experienced patients (non-responders and relapsers).
