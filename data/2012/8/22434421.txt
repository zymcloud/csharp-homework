Objectives:To investigate the effectiveness of qualitative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), subtraction of unenhanced from arterial phase images, and hepatobiliary phase (HBP) images in estimating the histopathological grade of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We retrospectively reviewed gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance images of 175 patients with 201 surgically resected HCCs. The signal intensity and its relationship with histopathological grade were assessed for each sequence and a combination of sequences.Results:There was a tendency towards higher grades in tumours showing restricted diffusion on DWI (P Conclusions:DWI and subtraction imaging are helpful for predicting the histopathological grade of HCC, especially when the two sequences are considered together.Key points:• Predicting the histopathological grade of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) preoperatively is important. • Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and subtraction imaging are recently developed MR techniques. • Retrospective study showed DWI and subtraction imaging helps predict HCC grades. • Management of patients with HCC becomes more appropriate.
