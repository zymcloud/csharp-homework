A 41-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of multiple liver tumors. Colonoscopy showed a mass lesion in the cecum. He was given a diagnosis of endocrine cell carcinoma by immunostaining technique, and received chemotherapy of CAPOX regimen for 3 courses. After that, he underwent second-line chemotherapy of EP(CDDP/VP-16)regimen due to deterioration of his performance status(PS), and his tumor marker NSE. He then showed dramatically improved PS, and improvement in the size of liver mets and NSE(4. 3mg/mL).
