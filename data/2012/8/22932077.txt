Background:Loss of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) expression is an adverse prognostic factor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of CEACAM1 and its effect on relapse-free survival (RFS) following liver transplantation (LT) for HCC.Methods:Expression of CEACAM1 was immunohistochemically detected in HCC specimens from 48 patients. The relationship between CEACAM1 expression and clinicopathologic variables, as well as tumor recurrence, was further analyzed.Results:Of the 48 HCC specimens, membranous CEACAM1 expression was detected in 25 specimens and cytoplasmic CEACAM1 expression was detected in 19 specimens. Four specimens had loss of CEACAM1 expression. Loss of membranous CEACAM1 expression was significantly associated with tumor size, tumor number, and serum Î±-fetoprotein levels (all P Conclusion:Loss of membranous CEACAM1 expression in HCC was closely associated with aggressive tumor biology and might be a relapsing biomarker of HCC treated with LT.
