Pirh2 is a Ring-H2 domain containing E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets several important tumor suppressor genes for proteasomal degradation. Overexpression of Pirh2 is frequently detected in many clinical tumor tissues including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular mechanism of Pirh2 activation in tumorigenesis still remains poorly understood. In this study, we find a Pirh2-binding protein, SCYL1 binding protein 1 (SCYL1BP1), that can promote the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Pirh2. SCYL1BP1 colocalized with Pirh2 in the cytoplasm and prevented its localization to the nucleus. Ectopic expression of SCYL1BP1 increased the expression of p53 and further inhibited the G(1)/S transition of HCC cell lines. Conversely, knock down of SCYL1BP1 restored the expression of Pirh2 and inhibited p53 at protein level. Functional assays found that reintroduction of SCYL1BP1 into HCC cell lines significantly inhibited cell proliferation, foci formation, colony formation in soft agar and tumor formation in nude mice, suggesting the strong tumor-suppressive function of SCYL1BP1 in HCC progression. Furthermore, SCYL1BP1 was found to be frequently downregulated in HCC clinical specimens compared to their paired non-tumor tissues by immunohistochemical staining. Taken together, our data suggested that the interaction of SCYL1BP1/Pirh2 could accelerate Pirh2 degradation through an ubiquitin-dependent pathway. SCYL1BP1 may function as an important tumor suppressor gene in HCC development.
