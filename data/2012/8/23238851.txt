Purpose:To retrospectively elucidate the preliminary clinical impact of warmed miriplatin-lipiodol suspension (MPT-LPD) when used as a chemotherapeutic agent for transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Between June and December 2010, TACE was performed with MPT-LPD at room temperature (RT group), and after January 2011, TACE with MPT-LPD warmed to 40 Â°C was performed (W group). The intraarterial appearance of MPT-LPD immediately after injection through microcatheters at the second-order branches was compared between the two groups with a 5-point grading system. Local therapeutic effects of HCCs as assessed by follow-up computed tomography (CT) obtained 1-3 months after TACE were compared between the groups with a 4-point grading system (TE1-TE4). After April 2011, angiography-assisted CT was routinely performed at TACE, and HCCs that revealed apparent corona enhancement (CE) were retrospectively selected. The degree of concordance between CE and MPT-LPD accumulation as assessed by CT immediately after TACE was assessed with a 3-point grading scale.Results:MPT-LPD therapy resulted in a smooth and continuous appearance in the W group (grades 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were, respectively, 1, 2, 11, 18, and 4) compared to the RT group (4, 0, 1, 2, and 0). The W group (TE1, TE2, TE3, and TE4 were 1, 9, 11, and 12) revealed better local therapeutic effects than the RT group (6, 3, 9, and 0) (p Conclusion:Warmed MPT-LPD flowed more smoothly within vascular lumen, passed through tumor sinusoid of HCC, and had better local therapeutic effects at short-term observation than MPT-LPD at room temperature.
