Aim:To compare clinical and radiological findings of newly diagnosed hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections.Materials and methods:Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT images in 532 patients with newly diagnosed HCC were retrospectively reviewed. Of these patients, 418 had chronic HBV infections and 114 had chronic HCV infections. The number, size, shape (nodular vs. non-nodular) and enhancement pattern (typical vs. atypical) of hepatic lesions were assessed. The presence of portal vein thrombosis and bile duct invasion were determined.Results:The mean age of the HBV group (54.31 [range 27-85], median 54) was younger than that of the HCV group (64.21 [range 30-86], median 64) (P 5; P Conclusions:Clinical and radiological findings of HCC differ between patients with HBV and HCV infections.
