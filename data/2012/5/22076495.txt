Little is known about effects of alcohol consumption on dendritic cell (DC) function and resultant immune response. However, quantitative and qualitative disturbances of DCs are speculated to be involved in alcohol-related as well as in other liver pathology. The present study aimed to evaluate changes in circulating DC subsets in alcoholic liver disease (N = 43), autoimmune hepatitis (N = 26) and primary biliary cirrhosis (N = 20). DCs isolated from the peripheral blood of recruited participants were stained with monoclonal antibodies against blood dendritic cell antigens (BDCAs) and estimated using the flow cytometry. Myeloid DCs were defined as BDCA-1(+)/CD19(-) cells, and lymphoid DCs as BDCA-2(+)/CD123(+) cells. Total numbers of circulating DCs in subjects with some liver diseases were markedly lower than in the healthy participants (p = 0.03). There was a significantly lower percentage of circulating BDCA-2(+)/CD123(+) (p = 0.02), and a tendency for the percentage of circulating BDCA-1(+)/CD19(-) cells to decrease in patients with liver diseases compared to the controls (p = 0.09). These results may suggest that decreased numbers of DCs may be responsible for reduced adaptive immune responses and increased susceptibility to infections and cancer development observed in patients exposed to alcohol. Moreover, numerical abnormalities of DCs may contribute to the breakdown of self-tolerance, a feature of autoimmune diseases.
