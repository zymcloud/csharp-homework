Background/purpose:Miriplatin is a platinum complex developed to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through administration into the hepatic artery as a sustained-release formulation suspended in lipiodol. A single-institute pilot study was conducted to investigate the antitumor efficacy of miriplatin infusion therapy for small and multiple HCCs.Materials and methods:Small HCCs sized 2 cm or less, judged to be inadequate for curative treatment, were indicated for transcatheter arterial miriplatin infusion therapy. We prospectively investigated the course of patients treated with miriplatin between March 2010 and September 2010. Efficacy was evaluated by computed tomography at 4-8 weeks and the overall evaluation was carried out more than 3 months after treatment.Results:The study included 14 patients, of whom 13 were evaluable for efficacy. Of the 13 patients, one (8%) showed a complete response and three (23%) showed a partial response, with an overall response rate of 31%. Grade 3/4 hematological toxicity including thrombocytopenia was not seen. Increases to grade 3/4 in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were observed for nonhematological toxicity. Irreversible deleterious changes in hepatic function were not seen.Conclusion:Miriplatin infusion therapy showed safe and moderate effects on small HCCs. However, transarterial chemoembolization as a standard therapy cannot be replaced. We await the results of an ongoing study of transarterial chemoembolization with miriplatin.
