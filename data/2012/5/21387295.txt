The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of liver transplantation in patients with cholangiocarcinoma. According to the requirements of Cochrane systematic review, a thorough literature search was performed in PubMed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane electronic databases between 1995 and 2009 in terms of the key words "liver transplantation" and "cholangiocarcinoma," "cholangiocellular carcinoma" or "bile duct cancer," with restricted articles for the English language. Data were processed for a meta-analysis by Stata 10 software. Altogether 14 clinical trials containing 605 transplanted patients of bile duct cancers were finally enrolled in our study. The overall 1-, 3- and 5-year pooled survival rates were 0.73 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.65-0.80], 0.42 (95% CI = 0.33-0.51) and 0.39 (95% CI = 0.28-0.51), respectively. Of note, preoperative adjuvant therapies [orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT)-PAT group] rendered the transplanted individuals with comparably favorable outcomes with 1-, 3- and 5-year pooled survival rates of 0.83 (95% CI = 0.57-0.98), 0.57 (95% CI = 0.18-0.92) and 0.65 (95% CI = 0.40-0.87). In addition, the overall pooled incidence of complications was 0.62 (95% CI = 0.44-0.78), among which that of OLT-PAT group (0.58; 95% CI = 0.20-0.92) was relatively acceptable compared to those of liver transplantation alone (0.61; 95% CI = 0.33-0.85) and liver transplantation with extended bile duct resection (0.78; 95% CI = 0.55-0.94). In comparison to curative resection of cholangiocarcinoma with the 5-year survival rate reported from 20 to 40%, the role of liver transplantation alone is so limited. In the future, attention will be focused on liver transplantation following neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy, which requires a well-designed, prospective randomized controlled study.
