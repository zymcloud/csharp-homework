Renal cell carcinoma is an aggressive disease with a high rate of mortality. It is known to metastasize to the lung, liver, bone and brain. However, manifestation through lymphatic spread to the lungs is rare. Lymphangitic carcinomatosis is commonly observed in malignancies of the breast, lung, pancreas, colon and cervix. It is unusual to observe lymphangitic carcinomatosis of the lungs due to renal cell carcinoma. Lymphangitic carcinomatosis of the lungs may result in severe respiratory distress and may be the direct cause of death. Currently, there are no known modalities of preventing or slowing lymphangitic carcinomatosis besides treating the primary tumor. However, early detection may change the course of the disease and may prolong survival. This is compounded by the difficulty involved in diagnosing lymphangitic carcinomatosis of the lung which frequently involves lung biopsy. Immunohistochemical studies are often used in conjunction with regular histochemistry in ascertaining the primary tumor and in differentiating it from pulmonary metastasis. In this case report, we describe the presentation and clinical course of renal cell carcinoma in a patient which manifested as lymphangitis carcinomatosa of the lungs. The patient underwent surgical resection of the primary tumor with lymph node resection but presented with a fulminant lymphangitic carcinomatosis of the lungs within two weeks. Immunohistochemistry of the tissue obtained by the biopsy confirmed the diagnosis which was subsequently corroborated during his autopsy. This case illustrates the necessity of an urgent follow-up of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in such patients.
