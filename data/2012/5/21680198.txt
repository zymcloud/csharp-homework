With increased understanding of cancer biology, a multitude of pathological, genetic, and molecular events that drive hepatocarcinogenesis, including angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis, has been identified. Lately, they are being aggressively evaluated due to challenges involved in establishing early diagnosis, optimizing therapy for cancer inducing hepatotrophic viruses, minimizing the emergence of new tumors, and preventing recurrence after surgical resection or liver transplantation. This comprehensive review examines and critiques the evidence from published manuscripts reporting various tissue and serum biomarkers involved in hepatocellular carcinoma. These markers not only help in prediction of prognosis or recurrence, but may also assist in deciding appropriate modality of therapy and represent novel targets for potential therapeutic agents.
