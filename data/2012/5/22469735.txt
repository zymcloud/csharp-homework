For resection of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in which tumor thrombus (TT) extends into inferior vena cava (IVC) or right atrium (RA) surgery is challenging and requires skillful techniques. Here, we report a case of recurrent HCC with TT extending to the RA, who underwent successful resection with tumor thrombectomy without concomitant cardiopulmonary bypass. A 71-year-old man, who had been followed- up for hepatitis C by a local hospital, was diagnosed as having HCC in segment 6 for which he had undergone segmentectomy of segment 6 in May 2009. During follow-up, he developed severe leg edema and ascites with investigations revealing recurrent HCC in segment 7 with TT extending to the right atrium via IVC. After transarterial embolization the patient underwent extended resection of the segment 7 with tumor thrombectomy of the IVC and the right atrium and partial resection of the IVC wall using total hepatic vascular exclusion, without concomitant cardiopulmonary bypass. Total ischemic time was 23 minutes, operation time was 6 hours and blood loss was 2,474mL. The postoperative course was uneventful. Histopathology was recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma with hepatic venous invasion. We report the case of resected recurrent HCC with TT extending to right atrium without concomitant cardiopulmonary bypass.
