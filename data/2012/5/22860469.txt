Objective:To study in vitro anti-tumor activity of phaseoloideside E (PE) with human hepatoma HepG2 cells as the objective.Method:MTT assay was adopted to detect the cytotoxic effect of PE of different concentrations on HepG2 cells after being processed for 48 h. Changes in morphology of PE-processed cells were observed under an optical microscope and fluorescence microscope. DNA agrose gel electrophoresis was used to detect the DNA ladder, an important characteristic of cell apoptosis. The expression levels of Bax and Bcl-2 were determined by western blot assay.Result:PE dramatically repressed the viability of HepG2 cells. Typical morphological changes of apoptosis had been detected by both direct microscopic observation and Hoechst 33,258 staining. Typical DNA Ladder was also observed by agarose gel electrophoresis in the administration group, but it did not exist in the control group. Western blot showed that the expression of Bax was up-regulated and Bcl-2 was down-regulated.Conclusion:Above data demonstrates that PE can induce apoptosis in human hepatoma HepG2 cells, and indicate that PE-induced expression level changes of Bax and Bcl2 may be related to the apoptosis-induction effect.
