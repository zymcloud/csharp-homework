Objective:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in the prevention and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) relapse after liver transplantation.Methods:A retrospective cohort study was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of sorafenib for HCC. Forty-four patients who underwent liver transplant for HCC beyond Milan criteria form July 2007 to May 2010 were included study group (sorafenib, n = 22) and control group (without sorafenib, n = 22). The primary endpoints of the study were disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes included the rates of acute rejection and graft survival.Results:The clinical data of 44 patients were completely collected. There were significantly differences between sorafenib group and control group in 1-year DFS (81.8% (n = 18) vs 63.6% (n = 14), P Conclusion:Patients with HCC undergoing liver transplantation could get the benefits of Sorafenib in reducing the incidence of tumor recurrence and extending disease-free and overall survival time.
