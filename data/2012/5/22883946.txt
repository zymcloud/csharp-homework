Objective:To study the clinical characteristics and summary diagnostic and therapeutical experience of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.Methods:von Hippel-Lindau syndrome genealogy and clinical characteristics was investigated. Then a dendrogram was drawn and a genetic analysis was performed. Last the diagnostic and therapeutical experience of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome was investigated according to literatures.Results:There are 6 members attacked by the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome of 5 generations which includes 42 members. Three patients underwent operation. Two of the three patients who suffered operation had been removed of right lobe of liver tumor and one cerebellar hemangioblastomas independently. The third patient sustained three operations for removal of three cerebellar hemangioblastomas and left renal clear cell carcinoma. Three patients died of this syndrome.Conclusions:The characteristic of this kindred is according with that of autosomal dominant inheritance disease. Until now, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome involves in multisystem, the prognosis of this syndrome is not very well. However, patients and their family members may get much benefit from genetic testing, periodic surveillance, early diagnosis and prompt treatment.
