PCDH10 is a key tumor suppressive gene for nasopharyngeal, esophageal, and other carcinomas with frequent methylation. In this study, we investigated the potential epigenetic modification of the PCDH10 gene by hepatitis B virus Ã— protein (HBx), a pivotal factor in the progression of HBV replication and potential carcinogenesis. PCDH10 expression was found to be down-regulated in 9/13 (69.2 %) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. Decreased PCDH10 expression was correlated with the methylation status of the PCDH10 promoter. Treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza) was sufficient to restore PCDH10 mRNA expression by suppressing PCDH10 promoter methylation in HepG2 cells. Treatment with Trichostatin A alone had no significant effect on PCDH10 expression but enhanced the effect of Aza. PCDH10 methylation was further detected in 76 % (38 of 50) of HCC tissues compared with 40 % (20 of 50) of paired adjacent tissues, with no methylation detected in normal human liver tissues. There were significant correlations between methylation status of PCDH10 and tumor size, serum AFP levels, metastasis or TNM staging (P
