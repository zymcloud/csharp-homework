Objective:To study the scientific theory on detoxification (attenuation) of Stellera chamaejasme (ScL) by processing and the impact on drug effect of ScL before and after being processed with vinegar.Method:The difference in ingredients of ScL before and after being processed vinegar was compared by using PHLC-MS technique. A subcutaneously transplanted tumor model of H22 hepatoma was established to compare the lethal effect and weight change between tumor-loaded mice and normal mice. After consecutive oral administration in tumor-loaded mice, the impacts on tumors and immune organs were compared before and after being processed with vinegar. Luciferase Report Gene was employed to investigate the target genes TGF-beta, AP1 and NF-kappaB.Result:The LD50 (median fatal dose) of extract Zp1102 exhibited higher than that of the processed one Zp1103, that is 9. 89 g x kg(-1) vs. 16.85 g x kg(-1). According to the test, Zp1102 showed more effective anti-tumor activities in vivo than that of Zp1103 in a same dosage, with the tumor inhibitory rate 36.24% (P < 0.01) at the dosage of2 g x kg(-1) and 34.40% (P < 0.05) at the dosage of 1 g x kg(-1). At the dosage of 1 g x kg(-1), Zp1102 showed a tumor inhibitory rate of 34.52% (P < 0.05), much higher from 21.55% in Zp1103. Both Zp1102 and Zp1103 had basically no impact on the report gene NF-kappaB, besides that Zp1102 up-regulated the report gene after increase in NF-kappaB concentration and down-regulated TGF-beta, but Zp1103 can only up-regulate NF-kappaB expression without any impact on TGF-beta.Conclusion:Processed ScL extracts show less toxic than unprocessed extracts and slight reduction in anti-tumor activity, which may be related to the regulation of transforming growth factor TGF-beta.
