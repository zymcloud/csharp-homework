MicroRNAs are noncoding RNA molecules of 18-25 nucleotides that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. The aim of this study was to investigate whether pri-miR-218 rs11134527 A/G polymorphism influences the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or not. pri-miR-218 rs11134527 A/G was genotyped in 302 HCC patients and 513 control subjects using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. The AG genotype of pri-miR-218 rs11134527 A/G was associated with family history (p=0.018, odds ratio [OR]=2.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-7.56) and elevated serum α-fetoprotein (serum alpha-fetoprotein [AFP]) levels (≥20 ng/mL; p=0.009, OR=1.92, 95% CI: 1.17-3.14) in HCC patients. These findings suggested that the AG genotype of pri-miR-218 rs11134527 might relate to genetic predisposition and be involved in regulating the expression of AFP in Chinese HCC patients.
