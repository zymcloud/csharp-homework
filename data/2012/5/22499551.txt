Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) never exists in the environment as a single compound but always coexists with other chemicals. These chemicals may affect the toxicity of BaP. Our previous study confirmed that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which were recently found coexisting with BaP in various environmental media, dramatically enhanced the genotoxicity of BaP. But the known mechanisms associated with this phenomenon are limited. Because BaP's genotoxicity is highly associated with its ability to induce the oxidative stress, we propose that the coexistence of PCBs may enhance BaP's genotoxicity by affecting BaP-induced oxidative stress. In this study, the HepG2 cells were treated with either BaP (50 Î¼M), 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126) (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 nM), or pretreated with PCB126 followed by a coexposure to BaP and PCB126. We found that the exposure to BaP alone effectively increased the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase, but decreased the percentage of S-phase cells. Compared to BaP alone, coexposure to both BaP and PCB126 effectively enhanced the levels of ROS and MDA as well as the percentage of cells in S phase, but decreased the levels of GSH and percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase. Our findings suggest that increasing oxidative stress and impairing the normal cell-cycle control may be mechanisms by which PCB126 enhances the genotoxity of BaP exposure.
