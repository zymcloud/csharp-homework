Compared with surgery, endoscopic treatment is safe and highly effective for a postoperative hilar benign bile duct stricture (BDS). However, the long-term outcome of conventional placement of a single biliary stent for hilar benign BDS is generally poor. Although the placement of multiple biliary stents is preferred, multiple stenting in a BDS is difficult. Alternatively, single or multiple stent placement above the papilla ('inside stent') or fully-covered self-expandable metallic stents (SEMS) are feasible approaches for benign BDS. Nevertheless, controversy remains regarding whether and how to perform endoscopic biliary drainage for a hilar benign BDS. In patients with hilar benign BDS, endoscopic biliary drainage can be performed by placing conventional plastic stents across the papilla, plastic stents above the papilla or fully-covered SEMS. Individualized treatment should be considered. We report the placement of a fully-covered SEMS for a hilar benign biliary stricture after extended left hepatectomy.
