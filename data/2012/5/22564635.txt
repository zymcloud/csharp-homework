Introduction:Although Islet cell isolation and culture have been well developed, there has been little progress to prolong transplanted islet survival. Hepatic ischemia and insufficient neovascularization of islets are considered to be the barriers to long-term survival, Hepatocytes that survive ischemic injury have been reported to protect themeslves and regenerate using the IL-6 interleukin 6 and STAT3 pathways.Materials and methods:The hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep-G2) cell line preconditioned for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours in a hypoxic chamber, was cocultured with rat insulin-secreting celline (RIN-5F) cells. We measured cell viabilities, insulin secretion, and p-STAT3, IL-6, and NF-κB levels.Results:Cocultured Hep-G2 and RIN-5F cells aggregated to form spheroids. Viabilities of Hep-G2 cells were no different after various ischemic preconditioning times, but insulin secretion increased in a time-dependent fashion with preconditioning. Western blotting showed p-STAT3, NF-κB, and IL-6 levels to increase with preconditioning time.Conclusion:The IL-6/STAT3 pathway of Hep-G2 cells after ischemic injury showed beneficial effects on insulin secretion of RIN-5f cells cocultured with themselves.
