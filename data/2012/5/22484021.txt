Background and aim:The genetic basis of Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is largely unknown but a link with salt sensitivity is recognized. The cytochrome P450 isoform 4F2 (CYP4F2) is involved in renal production of 20-hydroxyeicosatethraenoic acid (20-HETE), a natriuretic substance associated with salt sensitivity. The same enzyme is implicated in ω-hydroxylation of very long and medium chain fatty acids in the liver suggesting its possible influence on gluco-metabolic components of MetS. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of CYP4F2 V433M, a functional polymorphism previously associated with hypertension via renal salt reabsorption, on the individual components of MetS and MetS itself.Methods:The polymorphism was genotyped in the cardiovascular cohort of the Malmö Diet and Cancer (MDC-CVA) study and successively in the Malmö Preventive Project (MPP) cohort. Different definitions of the MetS were applied.Results:In the MDC-CVA, male, but not female, CYP4F2 M433 carriers had significantly higher levels of waist, triglycerides, BP and a composite sum of MetS phenotypes (MetS score) beside lower HDL-cholesterol respect to V-homozygotes. MetS, as defined in the ATPIII and the AHA/NHLBI definitions, was more prevalent in M-carriers with respect to V-homozygotes. In the MPP cohort, significant association was detectable only for triglycerides at baseline and for Diastolic BP at reinvestigation in male M-carriers.Conclusion:The initial positive association of the CYP4F2 V433M polymorphism with components of MetS and MetS itself, found in MDC-CVA, was partially denied in another large cohort. The first association either could be due to a false positive result or alternatively, different genetic background or population stratification could have hidden the effect of the polymorphism in the replication cohort.
