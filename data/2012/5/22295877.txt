Aim:The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of super-elderly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients aged 80 years or more who underwent hepatectomy and to clarify whether elderly patients with HCC benefit from hepatectomy.Methods:Between March 1992 and December 2008, 278 patients who underwent curative hepatectomy for HCC were investigated. Super-elderly patients were defined as those aged 80 years or more. Clinicopathological data and outcomes after hepatectomy were compared between super-elderly and non-super-elderly groups.Results:Preoperative parameters, such as biochemical examinations, and liver function tests in the non-super-elderly group were comparable with those of the super-elderly group (n = 11). Exceptionally, albumin level in the super-elderly group was lower than that in the non-super-elderly group (P = 0.03). Surgical data and the prevalence of postoperative complications did not differ significantly between the two groups. No mortality was observed in the super-elderly and non-super-elderly group.Conclusions:Hepatectomy for HCC was a feasible option even in super elderly patients aged 80 years or older with accurate selection.
