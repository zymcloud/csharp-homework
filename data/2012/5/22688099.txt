We examined the compliance with, and efficacy of, the clinical guideline for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We classified 74 patients with HCC into 3 categories;23 surveillance cases, 18 non-surveillance cases, and 33 incidental cases. Patients from affiliated hospitals included more non-surveillance and incidental cases than in university hospital-treated cases. HCC was diagnosed at an earlier stage in the surveillance group than the incidental group, and the surveillance group had a better outcome than the incidental group. There was no significant difference in HCC stage or outcome between surveillance and non-surveillance groups. The guidelines appeared to be useful for early diagnosis of HCC except for the fact that some in the surveillance group were diagnosed at an advanced stage and around 30% of the incidental group had some risk factors of HCC. Those conducting surveillance must improve their skills for early diagnosis of HCC and both doctors and patients must increase compliance with the guidelines.
