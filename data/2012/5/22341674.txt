Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver malignancy and the third cause of death related to cancer. Through the application of surveillance programs the percentage of early diagnosis has increased but the diagnosis is still made at advanced stages in some patients. The presentation of HCC as progressive jaundice secondary to bile duct tumor thrombi is uncommon. In such cases it is extremely difficult to distinguish such biliary lesions from cholangiocarcinoma or even common bile stones. We report a case of a 34-year-old male patient with common bile duct invasion secondary to HCC that mimicked choledocholithiasis. The diagnosis of HCC was confirmed after thrombi extraction during ERCP.
