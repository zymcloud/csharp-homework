Objectives:To elucidate the antibacterial efficacy of chemically synthesized and custom-made sulphur nanoparticles (SNPs) of two different sizes and surface modifications against a number of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) harbouring the New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase 1 enzyme (NDM-1).Methods:Antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was determined. The strains were evaluated for the presence of carbapenemases, β-lactamases, 16S rRNA methylases and integrons. Chemically synthesized, polyethylene-glycol (PEG)-stabilized SNPs of 10 nm and custom-made non-capped SNPs of 60 nm were physicochemically characterized and evaluated for their antibacterial efficacy against multidrug-resistant GNB using the agar dilution method (ADM) and the broth microdilution method (BMD). The cytotoxicity of the chemically synthesized SNPs was evaluated with a human-derived hepatoma (HepG2) cell line using a WST-1 assay kit.Results:All isolates were multidrug-resistant and possessed NDM-1 along with other β-lactamases, 16S rRNA methylases and integron 1. Chemically synthesized PEGylated SNPs showed a bactericidal effect against all tested strains at a concentration between 9.41 and 18.82 mg/L using BMD. The ADM data revealed that SNPs had uniform MICs (18.82 mg/L) for all tested strains. On the other hand, custom-made SNPs failed to impart any antibacterial effect at the equivalent concentrations of chemically synthesized SNPs. The WST-1 assay revealed no significant cytotoxicity of the PEGylated SNPs even at the highest concentration (94.08 mg/L).Conclusions:To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempted study to show the effectiveness of nanoparticles against multidrug-resistant GNB harbouring NDM-1.
