Aim:To investigate the methylation status of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and evaluate its clinical implication.Methods:The methylation status of SPARC was analyzed in one HCC cell line (SMMC-7721) and 60 pairs of HCC and corresponding nontumorous tissues by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and bisulfite sequencing. The expression of SPARC mRNA and protein were examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The correlations between the methylation status and the gene expression, the clinicopathological parameters, as well as the prognosis after surgery were analyzed.Results:In the SMMC-7721 cell line, the loss of SPARC expression was correlated with the aberrant methylation and could be reactivated by the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Methylation frequency of SPARC in HCC was significantly higher than that in the corresponding nontumorous tissues (45/60 vs 7/60, P Conclusion:Aberrant methylation is an important mechanism for SPARC inactivation in HCC and SPARC methylation may be a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC.
