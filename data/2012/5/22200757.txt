Purpose:We reviewed a series of patients who underwent hepatic resection at our institution, to investigate the risk factors for postoperative complications after hepatic resection of liver tumors and for procurement of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) grafts.Methods:Between April 2004 and August 2007, we performed 304 hepatic resections for liver tumors or to procure grafts for LDLT. Preoperative volumetric analysis was done using 3-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) prior to major hepatic resection. We compared the clinicopathological factors between patients with and without postoperative complications.Results:There was no operative mortality. According to the 3D-CT volumetry, the mean error ratio between the actual and the estimated remnant liver volume was 13.4%. Postoperative complications developed in 96 (31.6%) patients. According to logistic regression analysis, histological liver cirrhosis and intraoperative blood loss >850 mL were significant risk factors of postoperative complications after hepatic resection.Conclusions:Meticulous preoperative evaluation based on volumetric analysis, together with sophisticated surgical techniques, achieved zero mortality and minimized intraoperative blood loss, which was classified as one of the most significant predictors of postoperative complications after major hepatic resection.
