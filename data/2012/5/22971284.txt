To explain biological function of protein CCL15 in HCC cell lines. The different expression level of CCL15 among HCC cell lines was validated by RT-PCR and Western blot. The expression recombinant plasmid of siRNA-CCL15 was constructed successfully and transfected into high metastasis cell lines HCCML3 to observe the alteration of biological function of HCCML3. The overexpression of CCL15 in high metastasis HCC cell lines was confirmed by validation tests. After transfected with siRNA-CCL15, the average amounts of invaded cells in cell invasion assay were 657.9 (HCCML3) and 148.4(HCCML3-siCCL15) (t=19.34, P less than 0.05). And in the scratch assay, the migrating distance were (0.35+/-0.02) mm (HCCML3) and (0.82+/-0.03)mm (HCCML3-siCCL15) (t=15.67, P less than 0.05). The expression of MMP-9 in HCCML3 was higher than HCCML3-siCCL15 through Western blot. Some biological properties (migration, invasion, MMP-9) of HCCML3 transfected with siRNA-CCL15 were decreased. The results suggest CCL15 might play an important role in HCC cell invasion and metastasis through two paths of MMPs regulation and invasion potential strengthening.
