Aim:The purpose of this study was the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile assessment in the serum of patients affected by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with drug-eluting beads.Patients and methods:This study included 20 patients, 12 treated with DC Bead® and 8 with HepaSphere Microsphere®, preloaded with epirubicin. No patient randomization was used for the inclusion in one group or in the other. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from all patients after the treatment, until 24 hours past the procedure.Results:The pharmacokinetic study showed low peak serum epirubicin concentrations with greater drug exposure for the DC Bead® group (pConclusion:A persistent and sustained drug elution for both types of microparticles was found.
