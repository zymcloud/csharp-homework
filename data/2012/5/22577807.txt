Background:The caudate lobe, because of its location and its highly unpredictable vascular anatomy, is one of the most surgical challenging segment of the liver. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of the caudate lobe in cirrhotic patients is not easily amenable to surgical resection. In order to treat HCC and to down-stage these patients within accepted criteria for liver transplantation (LT), laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) can be performed.Subjects and results:We present three cases of laparoscopic RFA for caudate lobe HCC. All three patients were successfully treated with laparoscopic RFA. The computed tomography scans 1 month postsurgery revealed complete necrosis of the lesion. No postoperative complications occurred, and all patients had a short postoperative stay. All three patients underwent, thereafter, LT from a deceased donor.Conclusions:Laparoscopic RFA is the treatment of choice in patients with HCC who could be scheduled for LT. Furthermore, a laparoscopic technique with an accurate ultrasound examination of liver parenchyma can allow for a complete exclusion of hepatic lesions undetectable at the preoperative imaging and provides the minimal onset of adhesions, both approaches that are extremely useful in patients undergoing liver transplantation.
