Objective:To study the effects of Yupingfeng Powder (YPFP) on cisplatin (DDP) induced oxidative damage of organs in hepatocellular carcinoma mice.Methods:A total of 2 x10(6) Hepa1 -6 cells were inoculated subcutaneously into the right flank of 15 C57BL/6 mice to establish a mice model of hepatocellular carcinoma. Then the mice were randomly divided into three groups, i.e., the model group, the DDP group, and the DDP + YPFP group, 5 in each group. Mice in the DDP group and the DDP + YPFP group were intraperitoneally injected with DDP (2. 5 mg/kg), once every three day for 2 weeks. Physiological saline was intraperitoneally injected to mice in the model group. Meanwhile, YPFP water decoction (25 g/kg) was given to mice in the DDP + YPFP group by gastrogavage once daily for 2 weeks. Corresponding distilled water was given by gastrogavage to mice in the DDP group and the model group. Fourteen days later, mice were sacrificed and the tumor inhibition ratio was calculated. The weights of kidneys, livers, and lungs were weighed and the organ coefficient calculated. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the tissue were detected. The pathologic changes were observed.Results:The tumor weight obviously decreased in the DDP group and the DDP + YPFP group when compared with the model group (P Conclusions:YPFP could protect the organs (kidney, liver, lung) from the oxidative damage induced by DDP. Anti-oxidation is one of its mechanisms.
