Animal studies have demonstrated that liver function parameters affect the degree of liver enhancement by gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA). The present study prospectively investigated whether liver function parameters and liver damage scores similarly correlate with the degree of liver enhancement by Gd-EOB-DTPA in humans with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 41 patients (32 males, 9 females; mean age, 71.9 years; range, 38-86 years) with suspected HCC provided written, informed consent to undergo a Gd-EOB-DTPA (30 Î¼mol/kg of body weight)-enhanced T1-gradient-echo (GRE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. The signal intensity of the liver parenchyma was quantified at various time points following injection of Gd-EOB-DTPA. We investigated the correlations between maximal relative enhancement (RE) values and liver function parameters, and liver damage scores. Correlations between parameters and maximum RE values were determined using the Student's t-test and univariate regression analyses. The effect of potential confounding factors was controlled by multiple stepwise regression analysis. Two-tailed values of p
