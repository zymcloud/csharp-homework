Background:Peritoneal metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma are common; they are found in as many as 18% of autopsy cases. Effective treatment for peritoneal metastases, however, has not yet been established.Methods:We resected peritoneal metastases 12 times in 9 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. We assessed the clinical course and outcome of these patients to determine the effectiveness of resecting peritoneal metastases and the factors related to survival.Results:The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 58%, 52%, and 42%, respectively. Four patients survived for longer than 2 years without recurrence or with controlled recurrence confined to the liver. Three patients receiving palliative resection had a poor prognosis, with survivals of only 4, 9, and 12 months.Conclusion:Operative resection should be an option for selected patients with peritoneal metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma. Resection of peritoneal metastases should be considered in patients whose primary liver neoplasm is under control and who have no metastases in other organs.
