To develop a therapeutic vaccine against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg)-expressing liver cancer, we tried to prepare a vaccine by formulating recombinant HBsAg with BW006, a B type CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) with Th1-biasing activity, and examined its potency of inducing therapeutic immunity against HBsAg-expressing liver cancer cells in mice. When applied therapeutically, BW006 could assist HBsAg to induce vigorous immune responses capable of inhibiting the growth of HBsAg-expressing liver cancer cells and prolonging the survival of mice bearing HBsAg-expressing liver cancer cells. In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that the BW006-adjuvanted HBsAg enhanced the production of IgG2a antibodies, interferon-Î³, and interleukin-12 and facilitated the generation of specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte that killed the HBsAg-expressing liver cancer cells. These results suggest that the BW006-adjuvanted HBsAg might be developed into a candidate tumor vaccine for the treatment of HBsAg-expressing liver cancer.
