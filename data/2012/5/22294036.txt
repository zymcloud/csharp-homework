Chemoembolization with lipiodol (TACE) improves survival of selected patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but results in substantial toxicity. To improve treatment tolerance, we conducted this phase II study using doxorubicin-loaded beads (DC BeadsÂ®) delivered by selective transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE). We compared the results with those obtained with TACE in our historical controls. Thirty-five patients were recruited with diagnoses of HCC. Patients received DEB-TACE with doxorubicin loaded on DC Beads. Computed tomography of the upper abdomen was performed one month after DEB-TACE. Historical controls were a group of 70 patients with matched characteristics treated with TACE. After a median follow-up of 14.1 months (range, 6-36 months), 22 patients (63%) had an objective response. There was a statistically significant decrease in liver enzymes (p
