Objective:To investigate the therapeutic effects of Jiedu granules, a Chinese medicine (CM) compound, plus cinobufacini injection, which was extracted from skin of Bufo bufo gargarizans Cantor, to prevent the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after surgical resection.Methods:In this case-control trial, a total of 120 patients who stayed in Changhai Hospital were enrolled from December 2001 to December 2006. Sixty patients were treated with Jiedu granules plus cinobufacini injection to prevent tumor recurrence after operation (CM group) and 60 patients were treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) after operation (TACE group). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were determined to evaluate the therapeutic effects of post-operative management of patients with HCC.Results:PFS in the CM group was 18.07 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 12.49-23.65] and the 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year PFS rates were 61%, 39%, 26%, 22% and 12%, respectively. PFS in the TACE group was 8.03 months (95% CI: 6.63-9.44) and the 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year PFS rates were 34%, 11%, 7%, 2% and 0%, respectively. There was significant difference in survival rate between the two groups (PConclusions:Jiedu granules plus cinobufacini injection, a combination that is commonly used for post-operation management of HCC, can postpone tumor recurrence and metastasis, prolong the survival time and increase the survival rate of post-surgical patients with HCC. However, these findings need to be confirmed in a prospective, randomized controlled trial.
