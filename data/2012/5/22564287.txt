Cytomegalovirus infection related changes frequently remain masked by local symptoms of tumor invasion or therapeutic side effects in cancer patients. The spectrum of cytomegalovirus manifestations, however, can be highly varied and may contribute to the failure of different organs with fatal outcome. The case of a 29-year-old female patient is presented who obtained polychemotherapy and allogenic stem cell transplantation following the diagnosis of classical Hodgkin's disease. Despite intensified treatment, only partial response could be achieved and the outcome of the disease was death. Postmortem examination revealed regressive lymph node infiltration as well as nodular liver and spleen manifestations of classical Hodgkin's disease. In addition, parenchymal tissues (lung, kidneys, small intestine, liver, pancreas and ovaries) showed the classical morphology of widespread cytomegalovirus infection. Bilateral enlargement of the ovaries was caused by a partially necrotic giant cell proliferation in the subepithelial cortex. CD30-negativity and cytomegalovirus antigen positivity of the large atypical cell infiltrate supported the diagnosis of cytomegalia oophoritis with morphological overlap between cytomegalovirus-infected giant cells and residual Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg cells. Further to the cytopathic effect in multiple organs, significant hemophagocytosis was also observed in the spleen, liver and bone marrow. In summary, active cytomegalovirus infection may be a major cause of multi-organ failure in the immunosuppressed oncohematological patient. Careful postmortem analysis demonstrated both the activity of the viral infection and the efficacy of the anti-viral treatment, when applied.
