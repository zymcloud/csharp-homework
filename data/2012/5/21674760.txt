Background:Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) is a major complication following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Its diagnosis is based on clinical criteria, which have a limited sensitivity. Increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels have been suggested as a marker of VOD. We aimed to prospectively evaluate how the fibrinolytic parameters behaved to discriminate VOD from other liver disorders occurring after HSCT in a pediatric population.Procedures:A total of 195 HSCT were performed on 161 children and VOD complicated 11 cases (6.8%). Alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, PAI-1 antigen (PAI-1:Ag) and activity, t-PA antigen, D-dimer, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, antithrombin, fibrinogen, and platelet counts were measured in 105 HSCT before and then weekly for 1 month after HSCT.Results:An early, significant increase in the fibrinolytic parameters was seen in patients who developed VOD, even before VOD was diagnosed clinically, by comparison with patients without complications or those with non-VOD liver disorders. The combined increase in bilirubin, D-dimer, and PAI-1:Ag levels beyond the normal range distinguished VOD cases from other liver complications with a high sensitivity and specificity.Conclusions:Our study demonstrates that fibrinolytic tests can help diagnose VOD after HSCT in the pediatric population.
