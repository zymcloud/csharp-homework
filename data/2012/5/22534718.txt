Background:To assess the detection rate of liver lesions in patients with advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas (GEP-NETs) using echo planar (EP) DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) as compared to standard FSE T2 wi and FFE T1 wi with i.v. (Gd-EOB)-DTPA.Material/methods:This prospective single-institution study included 55 patients with liver involvement confirmed by GEP-NETs 1.5T MRI system, using FSE T2, EP DWI and FFE T1 with i.v. (Gd-EOB)-DTPA. The potential differences between detection rates of liver deposits using 3 different MR approaches and between groups of patients were compared.Results:Mean number of liver deposits: FSE T2=20.7, FFE T1=25.7 and tested EP DWI=24.0. No significant difference was found in overall detection rate of liver deposits seen in 3 different techniques. A significant difference in detection rate of liver deposits was noted between male vs. female and secreting vs. non-secreting cancers. There was nearly perfect agreement between both observers, and each of the tested MRI approaches in regards to number of detected liver lesions (Cohen's kappa=0.848-1).Conclusions:There were no significant differences among the 3 different MRI approaches in detection rates of liver deposits. Perfect agreement with high detection rate of liver deposits provides a rationale for the use of EP DWI in follow-up studies in GEP-NET patients.
