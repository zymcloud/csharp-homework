Background/aim:Factors predicting the appearance of neutropenia were evaluated in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer undergoing gemcitabine hydrochloride (GEM) therapy.Methodology:The subjects were 92 patients who were diagnosed with unresectable advanced pancreatic cancer and underwent GEM therapy. Mono- and multivariate analyses were performed concerning each evaluated factor. The toxicity index (TI) was also prepared by combining the extracted predictive factors.Results:Severe neutropenia occurred in 26 patients (28.2%). As a result of multivariate analysis, the white blood cell count (WBC), CA19-9 and liver metastasis were extracted as factors independently and significantly contributing to the appearance of severe neutropenia (p<0.05). The TI was prepared by combining these 3 factors and their regression coefficients: TI = 4.777-0.605xWBC (x103/microL)-0.511xlog (CA19-9)-1.285xliver metastasis.Conclusions:The WBC, CA19-9 and liver metastasis before treatment were shown to be related to the appearance of severe neutropenia after GEM therapy.
