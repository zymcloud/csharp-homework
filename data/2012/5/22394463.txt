Aim:The tumor suppressor gene Ras association domain family 1 isoform A (RASSF1A) regulates cell cycle regulation, apoptosis and microtubule stability and is inactivated by promoter hypermethylation at a high frequency in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A guanine (G)/thymine (T) common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at first position of codon 133 in RASSF1A gene determines an alanine (Ala) to serine (Ser) (Ala133Ser) amino acidic substitution which may alter cancer risk by influencing the function of RASSF1A protein.Methods:To determine the association of the RASSF1A Ala133Ser polymorphism with the risk of HCC development in a Turkish population, a hospital-based case-control study was designed consisting of 236 subjects with HCC and 236 cancer-free control subjects matched for age, gender, smoking and alcohol status. The genotype frequency of the RASSF1A Ala133Ser polymorphism was determined by using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay.Results:Allele and genotype associations of RASSF1A Ala133Ser polymorphism with HCC susceptibility were observed in comparisons between the patient and control samples (PConclusion:Because our results suggest for the first time that the Ser133 allele of RASSF1A Ala133Ser polymorphism may be a genetic susceptibility factor for HCC in the Turkish population, further independent studies are required to validate our findings in a larger series, as well as in patients of different ethnic origins.
