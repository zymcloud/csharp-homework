Following the encouraging results of sorafenib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), targeted therapy has become a new direction of research in the treatment of HCC. Emerging data provide evidence that the pathogenesis and progression of HCC are mediated by a number of molecular defects and dysregulated pathways. Novel targeted therapies are designed to inhibit the aberrant pathways at a molecular level with an aim to improve the clinical outcome. For the past few years, an increasing number of targeted agents have been tested in HCC in the clinical setting. This review aims to summarize the current status of clinical development of targeted therapy in HCC, with focus on novel agents targeting angiogenesis, signal transduction and epigenetic dysregulation of tumors. The review also discusses the lessons learned from outcomes of completed clinical trials and provides perspectives on future clinical trials in HCC.
