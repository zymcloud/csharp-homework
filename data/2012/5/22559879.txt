Introduction:Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is an oncofetal protein produced by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). AFP level can also be elevated in other neoplastic or non-neoplastic conditions. An elevated AFP level has high diagnostic significance for HCC; at a level of >200 ng/mL, the probability of HCC is >90%. The aim of the present paper is to report a patient who underwent curative resection of HCC, who had a persistently elevated AFP level postoperatively but did not develop recurrence during a 2-year follow-up period. A review of the literature is also presented.Case report:An 82-year-old male was referred following a computed tomography scan showing a 160 mm diameter mass in the left lobe of the liver. This huge mass was diagnosed as HCC, arising in the absence of cirrhosis or viral hepatitis. After tumor removal, the patient's high AFP level persisted for 2 years.Conclusion:As steatosis was the only pathological change in the remnant liver, this may have caused the persistently elevated AFP level in this patient.
