Aim:To investigate the diagnostic value of glypican-3 (GPC3) and its relationship with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after liver transplantation.Methods:HCC tissue samples (n = 31) obtained from patients who had undergone liver transplantation were analyzed. GPC3 mRNA and protein expression were analyzed by TaqMan real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Correlation between the GPC3 expression and clinicopathological features was analyzed. The potential prognostic value of GPC3 was investigated by comparing recurrence-free survival between HCC patients with and without GPC3 expression.Results:Using a cutoff value of 3.5 × 10⁻², 20 of 31 cancerous tissues had expression values of > 3.5 × 10⁻², whereas 3 of 31 adjacent non-neoplastic parenchyma and 0 of 20 control liver tissues had expression values of > 3.5 × 10⁻² (P 3.5 × 10⁻²) and those without vascular invasion (P Conclusion:GPC3 expression may serve as a valuable diagnostic marker for HCC. GPC3 mRNA overexpression may be an adverse indicator for HCC patients after liver transplantation.
