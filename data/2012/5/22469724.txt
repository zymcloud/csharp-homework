Background/aims:Repeat hepatectomy is widely accepted as a treatment for primary or metastatic liver malignancy. However, it entails a longer operative time and is associated with additional operative risks. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the impact of previous hepatectomy on the short-term outcomes of repeat hepatectomy, especially in operative time.Methodology:A retrospective review of prospectively collected data from patients who underwent primary hepatectomy (n=166) and repeat hepatectomy (n=65) in a single institution.Results:Operative time was significantly longer for repeat hepatectomy than for primary hepatectomy (284min vs. 250min, p=0.04). There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative blood transfusion, morbidity, mortality and length of hospital stay. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that third or subsequent hepatectomy and tumor location in the caudate lobe at the repeat hepatectomy significantly prolonged operative time.Conclusions:Repeat hepatectomy has similar short-term outcomes to primary liver resection. However, repeat hepatectomy is a time-consuming operation, especially in patients with tumors in the caudate lobe or for those undergoing their third or subsequent hepatectomy.
