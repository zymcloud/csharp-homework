In the present study, we evaluated the prognostic value of intratumoral and peritumoral expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), and interleukin-11 (IL-11) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative resection. Expression of CTGF, TGF-β1, and IL-11 was assessed by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays containing paired tumor and peritumoral liver tissue from 290 patients who had undergone hepatectomy for histologically proven HCC. The prognostic value of these and other clinicopathologic factors were evaluated. The median follow-up time was 54.3 months (range, 4.3-118.3 months). High intratumoral CTGF expression was associated with vascular invasion (P = 0.015), intratumoral IL-11 expression correlated with higher tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage (P = 0.009), and peritumoral CTGF overexpression correlated with lack of tumor encapsulation (P = 0.031). Correlation analysis of these proteins revealed that intratumoral CTGF and IL-11 correlated with high intratumoral TGF-β1 expression (r = 0.325, P
