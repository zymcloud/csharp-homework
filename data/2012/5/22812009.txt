This study is to evaluate the sustained-release effect of the thermosensitive in situ gel for injection of boanmycin hydrochloride (BAM) by bioluminescence imaging in nude mice. BAM was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). The FITC-labeled BAM (FITC-BAM) was purified by dialysis and Sephadex G25 gel column, and then was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight (MALDI-TOF). The model of experimental hepatoma HepG-2 nude mice was established, and the optical imaging system was applied to evaluate the distribution of FITC-BAM in vivo. Results of MALDI-TOF proved that the major molecular ratio of BAM : FITC was 1 : 1 or 1 : 2. Bioluminescence imaging showed that the diffusion of FITC-BAM in situ gel group was significantly delayed compared with the negative control group. This study demonstrated that the thermosensitive in situ gel can effectively delay the release of boanmycin hydrochloride, and extend the retention time in vivo.
