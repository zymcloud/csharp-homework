Purpose:The aim of this retrospective study (from January 2007 to December 2011) was to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of mDCF schedule for chemotherapy-na√Øve AGC patients.Patients:Patients (n = 54) with locally inoperable or distant metastasis and performance status of 0-2 were eligible. The triplet combination chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) on day 1, cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) on day 1, and 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m(2) for 5 days of continuous infusion were administered every 21 days, up to nine cycles. Prophylactic G-CSF was not allowed.Results:In all, 36 (67 %) patients were male and 18 (33 %) were female; median age was 59 years. The majority of patients (n = 46, 85 %) had metastatic disease and 8 (15 %) of them had locally advanced disease. Liver metastasis and peritonitis carcinomatosa were found in 20 (43 %) and 18 (39 %) of the 46 cases, respectively. The median cycle of chemotherapy was 6. In assessing 50 patients for response evaluation, one had complete response. Partial response was achieved in 27 (54 %) patients. Seventeen patients (34 %) had stable disease and 5 (10 %) had progressive disease, while 4 % (n = 2) and 11 % (n = 6) of the patients developed severe (grade 3-4) neutropenia and anemia, respectively. During the median follow-up time (6.9 months, range 0.4-24), 28 (52 %) patients died. The overall and progression-free survival were 10.7 [95 % CI 8.9-12.4] and 6.8 [95 % CI 5.8-7.8] months, respectively.Conclusions:Although this was not a prospective comparative study, the mDCF regimen seems to be as effective as the original DCF in AGC with acceptable and manageable side effects.
