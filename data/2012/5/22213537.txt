Kinetic analysis of PFK-1 from rodent AS-30D, and human HeLa and MCF-7 carcinomas revealed sigmoidal [fructose 6-phosphate, Fru6P]-rate curves with different V(m) values when varying the allosteric activator fructose 2,6 bisphosphate (Fru2,6BP), AMP, Pi, NH(4)(+), or K(+). The rate equation that accurately predicted this behavior was the exclusive ligand binding concerted transition model together with non-essential hyperbolic activation. PFK-1 from rat liver and heart also exhibited the mixed cooperative-hyperbolic kinetic behavior regarding activators. Lowering pH induced decreased affinity for Fru6P, Fru2,6BP, citrate, and ATP (as inhibitor); as well as decreased V(m) and increased content of inactive (T) enzyme forms. High K(+) prompted increased (Fru6P) or decreased (activators) affinities; increased V(m); and increased content of active (R) enzyme forms. mRNA expression analysis and nucleotide sequencing showed that the three PFK-1 isoforms L, M, and C are transcribed in the three carcinomas. However, proteomic analysis indicated the predominant expression of L in liver, of M in heart and MCF-7 cells, of L>M in AS-30D cells, and of C in HeLa cells. PFK-1M showed the highest affinities for F6P and citrate and the lowest for ATP (substrate) and F2,6BP; PFK-1L showed the lowest affinity for F6P and the highest for F2,6BP; and PFK-1C exhibited the highest affinity for ATP (substrate) and the lowest for citrate. Thus, the present work documents the kinetic signature of each PFK-1 isoform, and facilitates the understanding of why this enzyme exerts significant or negligible glycolysis flux-control in normal or cancer cells, respectively, and how it regulates the onset of the Pasteur effect.
