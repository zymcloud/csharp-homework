Objectives:Evaluate the clinical outcome of CT-guided high-dose-rate-brachytherapy (CT-HDRBT) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) larger than 5 cm in diameter with the goal of local tumour control (LTC).Methods:Thirty-five patients with 35 unresectable HCCs ranging in size from 5 to 12 cm (mean: 7.1 cm) were treated with CT-HDRBT. Tumours were classified into two groups according to diameter: "large lesions" (5-7 cm) and "very large lesions" (>7 cm). Tumour response was evaluated by Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed before, 6 weeks after, and then every 3 months after treatment. Endpoints included local tumour control (LTC), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).Results:Nineteen tumours were classified as "large" and 16 as "very large". Complete tumour enclosure was achieved in all patients after the first CT-HDRBT session. Five patients were lost to follow-up. At a mean follow-up of 12.8 months, two patients had local progression (6.7%), one in each group. Nine patients (30%) experienced distant progression, five (26.3%) in the "large" and four (25%) in the "very large" group. No patients died during the follow-up period. No major complications were recorded.Conclusions:CT-HDRBT is a promising therapy for HCCs that exceed indications for thermal ablation.Key points:• Computed Tomography guided high-dose-rate brachytherapy offers new therapeutic options for hepatocellular carcinoma • CT-HDRBT can be safely practised in HCCs exceeding 5 cm in diameter • CT-HDRBT offers high rate of local control where thermal ablation is impossible • CT-HDRBT could be a valid alternative to TACE for intermediate stage HCC.
