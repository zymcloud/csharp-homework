It is important to examine the effectiveness of current therapies for chronic hepatitis B in clinical practice, given the therapeutic advances over the past 15 years. A 2010 Institute of Medicine report on hepatitis and liver cancer stated that the public and health care providers have a lack of knowledge and awareness about viral hepatitis, and that there is a gap between medical innovation and community care. We review the efficacy of hepatitis B treatment, based on results from clinical trials, and discuss the effectiveness of these treatments in clinical practice. We also discuss why having efficacious treatments alone would have a small impact on the global health burden of hepatitis B, and highlight the importance of educating the public and the medical community and coordination of care.
