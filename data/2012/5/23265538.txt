Ischemic stroke is caused by brain injury due to prolonged ischemia by occlusion of cerebral arteries. In this study, we isolated active compounds from an ethanol extract of Aurantii Immatri Pericarpium (HY5356). We first showed by DNA fragmentation assay that HY5356 improved human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) under hypoxic conditions by inhibiting apoptosis. When HY5356 was fractionated with dichloromethane (MC), ethyl acetate (EA) and n-butanol (BU), the MC fraction improved cell viability at the lowest concentration (100 Î¼g/ml). Intraperitoneal injection of HY5356 (200 mg/kg) or the MC fraction (200 mg/kg) to rats prior to occlusion attenuated brain injury significantly in a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion. Adopting cell viability under hypoxic conditions as an activity screening system, we isolated nobiletin and tangeretin as active compounds. The results suggest that intake of Aurantii Immatri Pericarpium containing nobiletin and tangeretin as active compounds might be beneficial for preventing ischemic stroke.
