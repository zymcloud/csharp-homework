The differential diagnosis of a liver mass is large and requires understanding of the clinical and imaging features of liver lesions.

Decisions regarding specific imaging modalities for diagnoses, the use of liver biopsy, therapeutic options, and appropriate follow-up are all determined by the presentation of the lesion and associated patient characteristics.
