Background:hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a very frequent tumor. Screening for the disease is effective, but the prognostic factors are difficult to evaluate.Objectives:1. To determine epidemiological data and the clinical course of HCC in our setting. 2. To compare patient survival according to whether screening is performed or not. 3. To evaluate survival prognostic factors.Patients and methods:data on the epidemiology and clinical course of patients diagnosed with HCC were collected on a prospective basis (January 2004-December 2006). Two groups were considered according to whether screening had been performed (group A) or not (group B).Results:a total of 110 patients were diagnosed with HCC (70% males). The most common etiology of cirrhosis was hepatitis C (56.1%), and 69% presented mild liver failure (Child-Pugh grade A). The median follow-up was 1.8 years. Fifty-one percent had been subjected to screening. The diagnosis of HCC was established by imaging techniques in 48.2% of the cases, and by histological criteria in 51.8%. The median tumor size was 23 mm in group A and 28 mm in group B (p = 0.005). Treatment with curative intent was provided in 72% of the cases in group A and in 48% in group B (p = 0.011). The median overall survival was 1.99 years -2.67 years in group A and 1.75 years in group B (p = 0.05). The multivariate analysis of overall survival showed the type of treatment (OR = 2.82 95%CI: 1.3-6.12, p = 0.009) and liver function (OR = 1.71 95%CI: 1.1-2.68, p = 0.020) to be independent predictors of survival.Conclusions:screening allows the diagnosis of smaller lesions and a higher percentage of curative treatments. The degree of liver function and the provision of curative treatment are independent predictors of survival.
