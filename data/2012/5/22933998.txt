Goblet cell carcinoid tumours are often considered a subset of appendiceal neuroendocrine tumours which behave more aggressively. They usually metastasize through transcoelomic/peritoneal invasion and common sites include the ovaries, peritoneum, and liver. Metastases may have goblet cell carcinoid, signet ring cell carcinoma or classic carcinoid histology. We report the first case in the literature of a patient with a goblet cell carcinoid with lung metastasis, which was associated with unfavourable outcome.
