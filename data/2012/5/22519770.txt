Introduction:With growing knowledge of the molecular pathway of carcinogenesis, targeted therapies have become the 'blue ocean' of cancer treatment. sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that targets Raf/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (Raf/MEK/ERK) and several tyrosine kinases (VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, PDGFR-Î²) that has shown efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Areas covered:An updated summary of the preclinical and clinical experience with sorafenib in HCC is presented in this paper. Data are based on abstracts from international conferences and journal articles found in a PubMed search of literature published up to December 2011.Expert opinion:Based on favorable data from preclinical and clinical trials, sorafenib has been approved as a standard therapy in advanced HCC. However, further efforts to understand the additional roles of sorafenib in the treatment of HCC are still necessary. Data for sorafenib will guide the development of new drugs for the treatment of HCC.
