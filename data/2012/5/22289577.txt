Hepatocellular carcinoma is a common type of cancer with poor prognosis. This study examines the in vitro and in vivo mechanisms of diosmin on human hepato-cellular carcinoma HA22T cell proliferation inhibition. HA22T cells were treated with different diosmin concentrations and analyzed with Western blot analysis, MTT assay, wound healing, flow cytometry, siRNA transfection assays and co-immuno-precipitation assay. The HA22T-implanted xeno-graft nude mice model was applied to confirm the cellular effects. Diosmin showed strong HA22T cell viability inhibition in a dose dependent manner and significantly reduced the cell proliferative proteins as well as inducing cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase through p53 activation and PI3K-Akt-MDM2 signaling pathway inhibition. However, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) siRNA or PP2A inhibitor totally reversed the diosmin effects. The HA22T-implanted nude mice model further confirmed that diosmin inhibited HA22T tumor cell growth and down regulated the PI3K-Akt-MDM2 signaling and cell cycle regulating proteins, as well as activating PP2A and p53 proteins. Our findings indicate that HA22T cell proliferation inhibition and tumor growth suppression by diosmin are mediated through PP2A activation.
