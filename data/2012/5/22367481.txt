Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecule is an integral component of the immune response on which the majority of host genetic studies have concentrated. Many different HLA-II alleles have been demonstrated to play roles in HBV infection. PCR-SSOP methods were applied to determine the HLA-DRB1 genotypes of 769 unrelated healthy individuals from Han Chinese of Northeast China. The frequencies of HLA-DRB1*09 in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected subjects were higher compared to those in the control group. Frequencies of HLA-DRB1*04 and *13 in the HBV-infected group were significantly lower compared to those in the healthy control group. Frequencies of HLA-DRB1*12 in the cirrhosis and liver cancer groups were significantly higher than those in the chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. The frequency of LA-DRB1*03 in the CHB patient group was significantly higher compared to that in the asymptomatic hepatitis B carrier patients. The above results suggest that the host HLA-II gene is an important factor in the determination of the outcome of HBV infection.
