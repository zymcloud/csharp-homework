Aim:To investigate the expression of the activating and inhibitory receptors on the surface of NK cells of primary hepatocellular carcinoma and its adjacent tissues, and the relationship between these two receptors and occurrence and development of primary liver cancer was analyzed.Methods:The number and activity of the NK cells, the expression of the activating and the inhibitory receptors on the surface of those cells were detected flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, which were obtained from 52 cases of primary hepatocellular carcinoma and its adjacent tissues. The relative analysis was done between those results and clinical relative factors.Results:In the tissues of primary hepacellular carcinoma, the number of NK cells is lower than that in the adjacent tissues obviously (P0.05).Conclusion:The decrease of NK cell numbers and the activating NK cell receptors and the increase of the inhibitory receptors would be relevant to the incidence of primary hepacellular carcinoma.
