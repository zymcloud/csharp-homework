Aims:To validate whether the anti-cancer effect of microRNA-122 (miR-122) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is mediated through regulating Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathways.Methods:The expression levels of miR-122 in HCC tissues and varied hepatoma cells were quantified by real-time PCR. MiR-122 agomir was transfected into HepG2, Hep3B cells to over-express miR-122. The effect of over-expression miR-122 on proliferation and apoptosis of HepG2 and Hep3B cells was evaluated using CCK-8 kit and flow cytometer respectively. The 3'-UTR segments of Wnt1 containing the miR-122 binding sites were amplified by PCR and the luciferase activity in the transfected cells was assayed. Wnt1 mRNA level was quantified using RT-PCR. Protein levels of Wnt1, β-catenin and TCF-4 were detected using Western blotting.Results:In comparison with the expression level of miR-122 in para-cancerous tissues or Chang liver cell, the expression level in HCC tissues or varied hepatoma cells was significantly decreased (P Conclusions:MiR-122 expression is down-regulated in human HCC. Over-expression of miR-122 inhibits HCC cell growth and promotes the cell apoptosis by affecting Wnt/β-catenin-TCF signalling pathway.
