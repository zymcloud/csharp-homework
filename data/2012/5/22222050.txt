Background:Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging is a new non-invasive, ultrasound-based method for the evaluation of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.Aim:To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ARFI imaging, transient elastography (TE) and Fibrotest for the evaluation of complications in patients with cirrhosis.Methods:A total of 166 patients (109 male, mean age: 54 Â± 11 years) with chronic liver disease and established cirrhosis were included in this study. ARFI-imaging of the liver and spleen, TE and Fibrotest were performed in all patients. In addition, clinical, laboratory and morphological parameters, including MELD/Child-Pugh scores, presence of oesophageal varices and hepatocellular carcinoma, history of variceal bleeding and history of hepatic encephalopathy were recorded.Results:Acoustic radiation force impulse liver was significantly correlated with ARFI spleen (r = 0.48, P 0.20). The AUROC for the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was 0.54 (0.39-0.70), 0.58 (0.44-0.73), 0.56 (0.40-0.73) and 0.72 (0.60-0.84) respectively (P > 0.20). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that ARFI spleen better predicted the presence of large oesophageal varices and HCC compared with ARFI liver.Conclusions:The diagnostic accuracy of ARFI liver and spleen was comparable to TE and Fibrotest for the detection of complications in patients with cirrhosis.
