Aim:To investigate the role of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway in the invasion and metastasis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Eighty six HCC tissues samples and HCC cell line Bel-7402 were examined. The protein expression of sonic hedgehog (Shh), nuclear glioma-associated oncogene-1 (Gli1), MMP-9 and p-ERK1/2 in HCC was analyzed using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Boyden chamber assay and wound-healing assay were used to quantify the invasion and metastasis of Bel-7402 cells.Results:In 86 HCC tissue samples, the positive ratio of Shh and nucleus Gli1 was 67.44% (58/86) and 60.47% (52/86), respectively; the expression of nucleus Gli1 was correlated with the tumor pathological grade (P=0.034), and with the ability of the tumor to invade and metastasize (P=0.001); the expression of nucleus Gli1 was also correlated with p-ERK1/2 (P=0.031) and with MMP-9 (P=0.034). Neither Shh, nor nucleus Gli1 was observed in normal liver tissue. KAAD-cyclopamine (KAAD-cyc), a specific inhibitor of the Hh pathway, at the concentrations of 1 and 4 μmol/L inhibited the invasion and migration of Bel-7402 cells and decreased the expression of Gli1 in nucleus and MMP-9, p-ERK1/2 proteins in Bel-7402 cells. On the other hand, Shh, a ligand of the Hh pathway, at the concentration of 0.5 μg/mL produced opposite effects. The MAPK pathway inhibitors U0126 and PD98059 at the concentrations of 5 and 10 μmol/L inhibited invasion and metastasis of Bel-7402 cells induced by Shh, and decreased the expression of p-ERK1/2 and MMP-9. However, U0126 and PD98059 had no effect on the expression of Gli1.Conclusion:Hh signaling pathway mediates invasion and metastasis of human HCC by up-regulating the protein expression of MMP-9 via ERK pathway.
