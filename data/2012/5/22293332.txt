Objective:Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presenting with nonmicronodular or micronodular cirrhosis are usually treated by hepatectomy. The value of resection for patients with hepatitis B virus-related macronodular cirrhosis, however, remains unknown because of potentially fatal complications of this procedure.Methods:Clinicopathological data were analyzed for 85 resected HCC patients with hepatitis B virus-related macronodular cirrhosis. An additional 255 patients with nonmicronodular and micronodular cirrhosis were randomly selected during the same period as the control group.Results:Compared with nonmicronodular and micronodular cirrhosis patients, macronodular cirrhotic patients exhibited elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and Î³-glutamyltransferase levels, higher Child-Pugh classification, higher indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (ICG R15), and more number of total complications. No significant differences were observed between the two groups with regard to major complications, mortality, overall survival, and recurrence-free survival. The morbidity rate was relatively low in patients exhibiting low ICG R15 (Conclusion:Resection is safe for macronodular cirrhotic HCC patients, and radical resection provides a positive outcome. Small-sized patients are good candidates for hepatectomy. Macronodular cirrhosis should not rule out hepatectomy in patients with low ICG R15.
