Liver cirrhosis patients generally progress to liver failure. To cure this progressive disease, we developed a novel cell therapy using bone marrow cells; autologous bone marrow cell infusion (ABMi) therapy. We previously described the possible action mechanism of ABMi therapy in the cirrhotic liver, and showed the timeline and results of clinical studies of ABMi therapy. We have also carried out other clinical studies using bone marrow cells and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Here, we report a new randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effects of ABMi therapy. However, ABMi therapy may not be possible in patients who are unable to undergo general anesthesia; therefore, we have started to develop a next-generation stem cell therapy using cultured mesenchymal stem cells.
