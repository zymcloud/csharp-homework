Vibrio cholerae is known as a common etiology of epidemic diarrheal disease and rarely causes extra-intestinal infections. In this report, we described a cirrhotic patient with hepatocellular carcinoma who developed spontaneous bacterial empyema due to non-O1, non-O139 V. cholerae. The patient was successfully treated with antimicrobial agents and percutaneous drainage.
