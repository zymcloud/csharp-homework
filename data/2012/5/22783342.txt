Context:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the most common disease commuted through blood transfusion. Occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) is a form of the disease which does not present Hepatitis B surface antigens (HBsAg) in the serum of patients; however, HBV-DNA is detectable in the serum and hepatocytes of patients. OBI is an important risk factor to induce post transfusion hepatitis (PTH), cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and reactivation of the HBV. Recently, several reports from various regions of the world have been published regarding PTH among blood recipients as well as HCC, and cirrhosis among patients who require permanent blood transfusion, including diseases such as hemophilia, hemodialysis and thalassemia. This form of the hepatitis also creates problems for individuals that are co-infected with other viruses such as HCV and HIV. To determine the prevalence of OBI among hemophilia, hemodialysis and thalassemia patients is important because it is a high risk factor for PTH, HCC and cirrhosis therefore, its detection is a critical strategy for most health care services. This review addresses recent information regarding prevalence of OBI in relation to the mentioned diseases.Evidence acquisition:The data presented here was collected by searching the key words in Pubmed and Scopous databases.Results:Our searching in the published papers revealed that OBI prevalence is frequent in patients receiving frequent blood transfusions.Conclusions:it seems that one of the main mechanisms for OBI transmission is most likely through infected blood and its component and evaluation of the prevalence of OBI in donors and patients, especially those with hemophilia and thalassemia should be foul considered.
