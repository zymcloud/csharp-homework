Aim:To evaluate survival and recurrence after salvage liver transplantation (SLT) for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared with primary liver transplantation (PLT) using a meta-analysis.Methods:Literature on SLT versus PLT for the treatment of HCC published between 1966 and July 2011 was retrieved. A meta-analysis was conducted to estimate pooled survival and disease-free rates. A fixed or random-effect model was established to collect the data.Results:The differences in overall survival and disease-free survival rates at 1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival rates were not statistically significant between SLT group and PLT group (P > 0.05). After stratifying the various studies by donor source and Milan criteria, we found that: (1) Living donor liver transplantation recipients had significantly higher 1-year survival rate, lower 3-year and 5-year survival rates compared with deceased-donor liver transplantation (DDLT) recipients. And in DDLT recipients they had better 1-year and 5-year disease-free survival rate in SLT group; and (2) No difference was seen in 1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival rates between two groups who beyond Milan criteria at the time of liver transplantation.Conclusion:SLT can be effectively performed for patients with recurrence or deterioration of liver function after hepatectomy for HCC. It does not increase the perioperative mortality and has a similar long-term survival rates compared to PLT.
