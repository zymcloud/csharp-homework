Objective:We have previously reported the clinical efficacy of water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) emulsions, particularly for non-selective transcatheter arterial infusion (TAI) therapy. W/O/W emulsions limit damage to normal hepatic parenchyma, because of their minimal embolic effect on peripheral arteries and slow release of anticancer agent. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ultraselective TAI (UTI) of a W/O/W emulsion for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:11 patients with Stage I-III small HCCs (Results:All 10 patients, excluding a patient who underwent a hepatectomy after UTI, achieved complete response. The 6, 12 and 30 month cumulative disease-free survival rates for the 10 patients were 100%, 90% and 60%, respectively. The patient who underwent hepatectomy after UTI developed complete necrosis of the HCC and peritumoral non-tumorous liver parenchyma.Conclusion:UTI therapy using a W/O/W emulsion for patients with small HCCs results in a good local response.
