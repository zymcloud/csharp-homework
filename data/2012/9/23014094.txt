Purpose:The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and toxicity of SBRT for treatment of unresectable hepatic or lung metastases regardless of their primary tumor site for patients who received prior systemic chemotherapy.Methods and materials:Between July 2007 and June 2010, 90 patients were treated with the CyberKnifeÂ® SBRT system for hepatic or pulmonary metastatic lesions. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed. The endpoints of this study were local control, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local relapse free-survival (LRFS), and treatment toxicity.Results:A total of 113 liver and 26 lung metastatic lesions in 52 men (58%) and 38 women (42%) were treated. Median follow-up was 17 months. Median age at treatment was 65 years (range, 23-84 years). Primary cancers were 63 GI, three lung, eight breast, four melanoma, three neuro-endocrine tumors, and three sarcomas. Median diameter of the lesions was 28 mm (range, 7-110 mm) for liver and 12.5 mm (range, 5-63.5 mm) for lung. Local control rates at 1 and 2 years were 84.5% and 66.1%, respectively. Two-year overall survival rate was 70% (95% CI: 55-81%). The 1 and 2-year disease-free survival rates were 27% (95% CI: 18-37%) and 10% (95% CI: 4-20%), respectively. Median duration of disease-free survival was 6.7 months (95% CI: 5.1-9.5 months). Observed toxicities included grade 1-3 acute toxicities. One grade 3 and no grade 4 toxicity were reported.Conclusion:High-dose SBRT for metastatic lesions is both feasible and effective with high local control rates. Overall survival is comparable with other available techniques. Treatment is well tolerated with low toxicity rates. It could represent an interesting treatment option for oligometastatic patients not amenable to surgery, even when patients had been pre-treated with chemotherapy.Summary:Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has previously been successfully used in the treatment of metastatic lesions. It could be considered as a curative option for oligometastatic patients. This retrospective study involved 90 patients, designed to test potential effectiveness of SBRT in the treatment of oligometastases irrespective of primary. Results suggest SBRT could be an effective treatment extending patients' life span. This treatment appears to be more effective when used prior to multiple systemic treatment regimens.
