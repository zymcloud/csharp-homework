Robust clinical and epidemiologic data support the role of inflammation as a key player in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Our previous data showed that gut-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) promote HCC development by activating Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expressed on myeloid-derived cells. However, the effects of gut-derived LPS on other types of liver injury models are yet to be studied. The purpose of this study was to determine the importance of gut-derived LPS and TLR4 signaling in a T-cell-mediated hepatitis-Con A-induced hepatitis model, which mimic the viral hepatitis. Reduction of endotoxin using antibiotics regimen or genetic ablation of TLR4 in mice significantly alleviate Con A-induced liver injury by inhibiting the infiltration of T lymphocytes into the liver and the activation of CD4(+) T lymphocytes as well as the production of T helper 1 cytokines; in contrast, exogenous LPS can promote Con A-induced hepatitis and CD4(+) T cells activation in vivo and in vitro. Reconstitution of TLR4-expressing myeloid cells in TLR4-deficient mice restored Con A-induced liver injury and inflammation, indicating the major cell target of LPS. In addition, TLR4 may positively regulate the target hepatocellular apoptosis via the perforin/granzyme B pathway. These data suggest that gut-derived LPS and TLR4 play important positive roles in Con A-induced hepatitis and modulation of the gut microbiotia may represent a new avenue for therapeutic intervention to treat acute hepatitis induced by hepatitis virus infection, thus to prevent hepatocellular carcinoma.
