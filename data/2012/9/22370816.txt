Background:Despite its status as a potential biomarker of hepatitis B virus (HBV) response to interferon treatment, the changes in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels over the natural course of HBV carriers have not been analyzed sufficiently.Methods:A total of 101 HBV carriers were followed prospectively from 1999 to 2009. HBsAg level was measured yearly during the followed period.Results:HBsAg levels at baseline ranged from -1.4 to 5.32 log IU/ml, with a median value of 3.2 log IU/ml. Lower HBsAg levels were significantly associated with higher age and lower HBV replication status. The rate of change of HBsAg levels showed two peaks, with a cut-off value of -0.4 log IU/year. Based on this, patients were tentatively classified into rapid decrease (rate of change Conclusions:Lower baseline HBsAg levels were significantly associated with older age and lower viral activity. Both a loss of HBeAg detection as well as inactive replication of HBV are suggested to be fundamental factors contributing to a rapid decrease in HBsAg over the natural course of HBV infection.
