Background/aims:To search for a new regenerative marker to estimate the prognosis of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF).Methodology:The CCl4 induced liver regeneration models were prepared and observed the change of ALR, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and pathology. Meanwhile the sera of patients with HBV related liver disease were collected to examine the changes of ALR level and the prognosis of patients with ACLF was followed up.Results:After CCl4 injection, serum ALR level rose firstly and then declined in the ensuing 12 hours to near-basal level (F=30.495, pConclusions:ALR level in serum may indicate hepatocyte proliferation or liver regeneration. High ALR level in serum in early stage of ACLF may mean a good prognosis.
