Introduction:Obstructive jaundice due to hepatocellular carcinoma is rare. We present a case of hepatocellular carcinoma presenting as an intraductal tumor, which was clinically and radiologically diagnosed as cholangiocarcinoma.Clinical presentation:A 59-year-old male was admitted with recurrent episodes of jaundice. He was found to have a tumor in the right hepatic duct extending into intrahepatic ducts, which was clinically and radiologically diagnosed as cholangiocarcinoma.Results:The patient underwent right hepatectomy with excision of the bile duct and left hepaticojejunostomy. Histological examination revealed an intraductal moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. The rest of the liver parenchyma showed features secondary to biliary obstruction but no tumor.Conclusion:A case of hepatocellular carcinoma presenting as an intraductal tumor with obstructive jaundice and no evidence of parenchymal tumor is presented.
