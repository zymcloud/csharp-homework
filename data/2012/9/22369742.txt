Background/aims:The present study analyzed postoperative outcomes for patients who underwent hepatectomy accompanied by resection of other organs, to clarify operative safety.Methodology:We examined perioperative parameters in 95 patients who underwent hepatectomy and other organ resections (colorectal resection, n=46; gastrectomy or duodenectomy, n=13; splenectomy, n=17; resection of diaphragm, n=9; pulmonary resection, n=4; others, n=6).Results:Prevalence of chronic liver dysfunction (100%) or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (100%) was significantly higher in patients who underwent splenectomy than in other groups (17% and 21%, respectively; pConclusions:Good postoperative outcomes in multi-organ resections with hepatectomy were observed by careful perioperative management based on adequate indications for hepatectomy.
