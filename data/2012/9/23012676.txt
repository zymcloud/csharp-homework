Squamous cell carcinoma of the pancreas is a rare pancreatic malignancy. We describe the case of a female who presented with abdominal pain and was found to have a pancreatic mass on imaging. The diagnosis of pancreatic squamous cell carcinoma was established by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of the mass. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the second case report in the medical literature in which endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration was used for a cell-type specific diagnosis of primary pancreatic squamous cell carcinoma.
