The treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic patients is challenging: the incidence is increasing, the cirrhosis dramatically limits the tolerance to treatment possibilities, there are many therapeutic modalities but resources are limited, namely in the context of organ shortage for transplantation. Liver transplantation (LT) is the optimal treatment as it combines the largest tumor resection possible and the correction of the underlying liver disease. Due to organ shortage however, LT is reserved for early-stages HCC. Surgical resection and radiofrequency destruction represent potentially curative options in highly selected patients. Arterial embolizations, chemo- or radio-embolizations, allow local tumor control but are not curative. These techniques could be performed before surgical resection or LT, to downstage the tumor and/or to control tumor progression while waiting for a graft. Finally, sorafenib is the only systemic treatment which has shown a survival benefit in advanced HCC. The benefit of combination of sorafenib and surgical treatments remains undetermined. The challenge in the management of HCC in cirrhotic patients is to integrate both individual (age, comorbidities, cirrhosis stage, tumor stage, specific contraindications to LT, etc.) and collective variables (expected waiting time before LT) to determine the best therapeutic option for each patient. In this process, multidisciplinarity is a key for success.
