Objective:To investigate effects of Saikosaponin D (SSd) on syndecan-2, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) in livers of rat with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Male SD rats were divided into control (n=10), model (n=20) and SSd (n=20) groups, and model and SSd groups given intragastric 0.2% (w/v) N-diethylnitrosamine to induce HCC. SSd group received 0.03% (w/v) SSd in saline. Liver samples were analysed immunohistochemically for syndecan-2, MMP-2, MMP-13 and TIMP-2 at 16 weeks.Results:The model group had more malignant nodules than the SSd group; all model-group HCC cells were grade III; SSd-group HCC cells were grades I-II. Controls showed normal hepatic cell phenotypes and no syndecan-2+ staining. Syndecan-2+ staining was greater in the model group (35.2%, P Conclusion:SSd inhibited HCC development, and downregulated expression of syndecan-2, MMP-2, MMP-13 and TIMP-2 in rat HCC liver tissue.
