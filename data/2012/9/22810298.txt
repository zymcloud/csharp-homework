Purpose:The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical outcomes after surgical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the elderly patients compared with younger patients.Methods:Clinicopathological data and treatment outcomes in 61 elderly (≥70 years old) and 90 younger (≤40 years old) patients with HCC who underwent curative liver resection between 2000 and 2010 were retrospectively collected and compared using various parameters.Results:The older HCC group was more likely to have hepatitis C virus and non-B non-C hepatitis virus infection, higher values of indocyanine green retention at 15 min (ICGR)(15), more preoperative comorbidities, and more postoperative complications. There were no significant differences in intraoperative parameters and pathologic features. The recurrence rate, overall survival and disease-free survival rates were similar amongst the two groups. The only independent prognostic factor of overall survival was postoperative complications.Conclusion:Our findings suggest that age by itself does not have an adverse effect on operative outcomes, including long-term prognosis. For young and elderly HCC patients, hepatic resection is a safe and effective treatment.
