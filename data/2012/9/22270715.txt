Photodynamic therapy (PDT)-generated cancer vaccines have shown promising results in preclinical studies and are being introduced in the clinics. Using an SCCVII mouse squamous cell carcinoma-based whole-cell autologous PDT vaccine model developed in our previous work, we have examined systemic effects in vaccinated mice that could be related to the induction of acute phase response. The upregulation of gene encoding serum amyloid P component (prototypic mouse acute phase reactant) was detected in the liver and to a lesser degree in the tumor of vaccinated mice at 24 h post-PDT vaccine treatment. A strong upregulation of gene for heat shock protein 70 was found in both the liver and tumor of mice at 4 h after their PDT vaccine treatment. Changes in the expression of genes for glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper and serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 that are highly responsive to glucocorticoid modulation were uncovered in both the tumor and liver of vaccinated mice. A rise in the levels of serum corticosterone was detected in mice at 24 h after PDT vaccine treatment. The results indicate that a sudden appearance of a large number of PDT vaccine cells elicits host responses for securing their optimized clearance, which in addition to producing seminal acute phase reactants includes the engagement of glucocorticoid hormones. It is becoming increasingly clear that a consummate execution of this process of PDT vaccine cell removal is critical for tumor antigen recognition and the attainment of potent antitumor immune response.
