Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy worldwide and has poor prognosis. Existing treatment modalities, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiofrequency ablation, which target tumor bulk, have demonstrated limited therapeutic efficacy. In the past 10years, accumulating evidence has supported the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor initiating cells (T-ICs) within tumors including HCC. Identification of liver T-ICs and the signaling pathways that they are involved in may shed light on novel therapeutic strategies against this deadly disease. In this review, we will discuss recent progresses made in the research of liver T-ICs with regard to identification, functional characterization, regulation and therapeutic implications.
