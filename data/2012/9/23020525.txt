Background:Our recent studies suggested that the chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1-like (CHD1L) gene plays an oncogenic role in human hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the status of CHD1L protein expression in ovarian cancer and its clinical/prognostic significance are obscure.Methods:In this study, immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CHD1L was performed on a tissue microarray (TMA) containing 102 primary ovarian carcinomas and 44 metastatic lesions (omental metastasis). Receiver-operator curve (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate patients' survival status.Results:There is an augmented tendency of CHD1L expression in ovarian carcinoma metastasis than in primary lesions (PConclusions:These findings provide evidence that positive expression of CHD1L protein is significantly correlated with the metastasis proceeding of ovarian carcinoma, and CHD1L protein expression, as examined by IHC, may act as a novel prognostic biomarker for patients with ovarian carcinoma.
