Background/aims:To evaluate the health related quality of life (HRQOL) of liver transplant recipients and to identify risk factors influencing post-operative HRQOL.Methodology:Adult patients who underwent primary liver transplantation from 2009 to 2010 were asked to complete a HRQOL survey at pre-operation and one year postoperatively. We compared the HRQOL of liver transplant recipients at pre-transplantation and one year postoperatively to the general population. Pre-transplant variables were analyzed to identify the risk factors influencing postoperative HRQOL.Results:Pre-transplant HRQOL was significantly lower than that of the general population and significantly improved at one year postoperatively. Multivariate analyses suggested hepatocellular carcinoma, pre-transplant hypertension and high model for end-stage liver disease score were independent risk factors for postoperative physical component summary (PCS); and higher education level, marital status and lower income level negatively impacted on the postoperative mental component summary (MCS).Conclusions:Factors influencing postoperative HRQOL were identified in the present study. Transplant centers should pay more attention to patients with above-mentioned risk factors and strive to improve the HRQOL.
