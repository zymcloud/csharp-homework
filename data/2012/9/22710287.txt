Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a typical hypervascular tumor. Our previous studies have demonstrated that hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) was able to inhibit the growth of HCC cells via inducing apoptosis and inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a disulfide-linked heterodimeric cytokine with potent immunostimulatory activity and anti-angiogenic properties. In this study, to further investigate the regulatory effect of IL-12 on HBx-mediated intervention of hepatoma microenvironment especially on intervention of neovessels and immune microenvironment, we constructed the recombinant adenovirus expressing HBx and mouse IL-12 named Ad-HBx-mIL-12. HBx-mIL-12 could effectively suppress tumor growth and induce apoptosis in vivo. Moreover, treatment with Ad-HBx-mIL-12 not only induced a massive accumulation of immune cells (CD8(+) T leukocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells) in tumors in situ, also apparently reduced the number of angiogenic blood vessels within tumor tissues. These results suggest that HBx-mIL-12 can not only induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HCC cells, but also effectively shift the tumor microenvironment from pro-oncogenic to antitumor through recruitment of immune cells and inhibiting stromal cell growth, such as vascular endothelial cells.
