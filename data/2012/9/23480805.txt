Introduction:Despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection continues to be a global health concern with an estimated 350 - 400 million people infected worldwide. Globally, HBV is the leading cause of chronic liver disease that may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, accurate diagnosis and classification of the disease are important to determine whether therapy is needed.Areas covered:The review contains an overview of recent data on the existing and emerging developments in the molecular diagnostic and monitoring tools for chronic liver disease.Expert opinion:Monitoring of HBV viral load is the most widely used method in assessing liver disease severity, predicting development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, deciding initiation of antiviral therapy, assessing treatment response as well as early detection of emergence of drug resistance. Some recent studies have downplayed the importance of viral load in HBV management. Phenotyping/genotyping methods can establish emergent resistance to antivirals. Increasing number of reports suggest that clinical outcome and efficacy of antiviral treatment might vary with HBV genotype and precore/core promoter mutants. The importance of covalently closed circular DNA is also becoming apparent in this regard. Further studies on the development of newer molecular methods for a better management of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) will minimize morbidity in CHB.
