Pediatric renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is rare and different from adult RCC. Although target agents have recently been introduced, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation exploiting graft-versus-tumor effect still remains an important treatment option for metastatic RCC. A 2-year-old male with RCC developed hepatic metastases 6 months following radical nephrectomy and subsequent cytokine therapy. Allogeneic reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation (RIST) with early withdrawal of immunosuppression and delayed donor lymphocyte infusions was performed. A second transplantation was undertaken following marrow aplasia. Now he remains progression-free with regression of hepatic metastases 5.7 years after RIST, along with complete donor chimerism.
