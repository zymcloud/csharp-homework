Aims:Activation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR-1) promotes invasiveness in some cancer cells. However, VEGFR-1 expression and its relationship with clinical features and prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the expression pattern of VEGFR-1 in HCC cell lines and tissue specimens in order to evaluate the role of VEGFR-1 in prognosis of HCC.Methods:Expression and localisation of VEGFR-1 in cell lines were determined by western blot and immunofluorescence, respectively. Expression of VEGFR-1 in tissue specimens from 135 HCC patients with curative resections was determined by immunohistochemistry. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis and a Cox regression model. The relationships between VEGFR-1 expression and clinicopathological features were also analysed.Results:VEGFR-1 expression in more invasive HCC cell lines is higher than that in less invasive cell lines. VEGFR-1 expression in HCC tissues was significantly higher than that in peritumoral tissues (pConclusions:High expression and distinctive cytomembrane localisation of VEGFR-1 in HCC cells is associated with HCC progression and worse outcome; it may serve as a novel prognostic marker for patients with HCC.
