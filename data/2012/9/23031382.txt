Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that binds to and inhibits the biologic activity of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This antibody, in combination with other antineoplastic agents, is currently used to treat various neoplasms, including colorectal, lung, breast, kidney cancer, and glioblastoma. It is also being used as an off-label intravitreal agent in the treatment of proliferative (neovascular) eye diseases. We report the development of a skin rash with two different patterns in a patient with a hemangiopericytoma of the meninges, a rare aggressive sarcoma, who was treated with repeated intravenous injections of bevacizumab.
