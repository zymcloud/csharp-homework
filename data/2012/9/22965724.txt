A dual-LIF (dLIF) setup combined with CE for microRNA (miRNA) detection is proposed in this study. An argon ion laser (488 nm) and a solid state laser (640 nm) were chosen to excite the fluorescent dye-labeled DNA probe after splinted ligation of miRNA. The crosstalk of emission spectrum of Alex Fluor 488 and Alex Fluor 647 is minimized with a zero crosstalk matrix for Alex Fluor 647 to 488 channels. The linear ranges of the device for the fluorescent dye-labeled DNA probe were both from 1.0 nM to 0.1 pM. The limits of detection for Alexa Fluor 488-labeled DNA and Alex Fluor 647-labeled DNA were 9.3 and 31 fM, respectively. The detection of specific miRNA has been accomplished by combining splinted ligation with the fluorescent dye-labeled oligonucleotides. The linear range for the synthetic miRNA is from 1.0 nM to 1.0 pM. Without PCR amplification, CE-dLIF was applied to discriminate a pre-miR-10b*-transfected cells (contains precursor miR-10b*) from hepatocellular carcinoma cell (control cells). Therefore, this result indicates CE-dLIF has great potential to provide a rapid comparative assay for miRNAs detection.
