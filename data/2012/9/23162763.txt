Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) commonly arises in chronically inflamed livers, but may also provoke (anti-tumoral) immune responses. Using non-inflammatory diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced liver cancer in mice, we demonstrate that distinct axes of the adaptive immune system, which are also prognostic in human HCC, actively suppress hepatocarcinogenesis by controlling tumor formation and progression.
