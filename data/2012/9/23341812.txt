Hemobilia represents gastrointestinal bleeding that develops as a result of communication between blood vessels and the biliary tract, which causes the blood to reach the duodenal papilla. It is characterized by biliary colic as the initial symptom, and the complications of cholangitis, obstructive jaundice and/or anemia. In general, definitive diagnosis is made by esophagogastroduodenoscopy which confirms bleeding from the duodenal papilla. Abdominal US and abdominal enhanced CT are performed to identify the source of the bleeding, as well as ERCP for biliary drainage to control the comorbid cholangitis. If active hemorrhage accompanied by worsening of the anemia is suspected, abdominal angiography is performed to selectively image the hepatic artery. Then, embolization of the culprit vessel is recommended. In our patients with difficult hemostasis, because of the direct compression hemostasis to the tumor site achieved with the fully covered metallic stent and secondary compression hemostasis due to blood clots, the bleeding could be controlled.
