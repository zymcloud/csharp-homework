Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often develops in association with liver cirrhosis, and its high recurrence rate leads to poor patient prognosis. Although recent evidence suggests that peretinoin, a member of the acyclic retinoid family, may be an effective chemopreventive drug for HCC, published data about its effects on hepatic mesenchymal cells, such as stellate cells and endothelial cells, remain limited. Using a mouse model in which platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-C is overexpressed (Pdgf-c Tg), resulting in hepatic fibrosis, steatosis, and eventually, HCC development, we show that peretinoin significantly represses the development of hepatic fibrosis and tumors. Peretinoin inhibited the signaling pathways of fibrogenesis, angiogenesis, and Wnt/β-catenin in Pdgf-c transgenic mice. In vitro, peretinoin repressed the expression of PDGF receptors α/β in primary mouse hepatic stellate cells (HSC), hepatoma cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Peretinoin also inhibited PDGF-C-activated transformation of HSCs into myofibroblasts. Together, our findings show that PDGF signaling is a target of peretinoin in preventing the development of hepatic fibrosis and HCC.
