Background:The effects of preoperative lipiodolization (LPD) for large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are controversial.Methods:A retrospective review was undertaken for 137 patients with initial solitary resectable HCC ≥ 5 cm who underwent hepatic resection between 1995 and 2008. Forty-two patients underwent preoperative LPD, and clinical data and prognosis were compared to those of patients without preoperative LPD (n=95).Results:Surgical results of the LPD group, such as surgical time, surgical blood loss, and the mortality and morbidity rate were statistically equal to those of the nonLPD group. The disease-free and overall survival of the LPD group were significantly better than those of the nonLPD group, and early tumor recurrence within 1-year of the LPD group was significantly lower than that of the nonLPD group. According to the multivariate analysis, the absence of preoperative LPD was an independent poor prognostic factor of patients with hepatic resection for HCC ≥ 5 cm.Conclusion:Preoperative LPD suppressed early tumor recurrence and improved patient survival after hepatic resection for HCC ≥ 5 cm.
