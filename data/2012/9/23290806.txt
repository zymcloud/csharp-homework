Objective:To study the trend of mortality changes on lung cancer during the period 1972 to 2011 in Qidong.Methods:Cancer registration data from 1972 - 2011 in Qidong was used to analyze the following information as: crude mortality rate (CR) of lung cancer, the age-standardized rates by China population (CASR) and the World population (WASR), the truncated mortality rate of 35 - 64, the accumulative rate of age from 0 to 74 years old, the accumulative risk, and the total percentage over all sites of cancers. The changes on the trend of mortality by gender, age and period were analyzed.Results:The CR of lung cancer was 31.15 per 100 000 (males: 45.68, females: 16.95). While CASR and WASR were 14.04, and 22.95 per 100 000, respectively. The truncated rate was 31.82 per 100 000. Accumulative rate, accumulative risk, and total percentage were 2.93%, 2.89%, and 20.50% respectively. The mortality rate of lung cancer in males was significantly higher than that in females, with a sex ratio of 2.69:1. CRs increased remarkably with age among those 30-year-olds, with P value being 0.000. When compared with 9 periods of 1972, 1973 - 1977, 1978 - 1982, 1983 - 1987, 1988 - 1992, 1993 - 1997, 1998 - 2002, 2003 - 2007, and 2008 - 2011, the CRs, CASRs and WASRs increased 6.78-folds, 1.60-folds and 1.92-folds, respectively, with the average annual percentage changes (APC) as 4.78%, 1.86% and 2.04%, respectively.Conclusion:The mortality rate of lung cancer among residents during the last four decades in Qidong had been increasing remarkably, suggesting that special attention on lung cancer trend should be highly paid.
