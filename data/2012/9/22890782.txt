A 92-year-old Japanese woman with moderate liver fibrosis, schistosomiasis and steatohepatitis-like lesion, was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by dynamic CT and elevated serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein and des-gamma-carboxyprothrombin. During follow up, the levels of tumor markers became normal without any treatment, and dynamic CT showed disappearance of the tumor and progression of hepatic steatosis. The mechanism of this spontaneous regression of HCC is unclear although massive necrosis due to rapid tumor growth or cancer immunity may have played a role.
