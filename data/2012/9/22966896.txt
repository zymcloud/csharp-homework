In this study, we report label-free detection of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which has been used as a biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma, by a microfluidic reflectometric interference spectroscopy (RIfS) system adopting a simple halogen light source and an inexpensive silicon-based sensor chip. Introduction of carboxy groups on a silicon nitride sensor chip to immobilize anti-AFP monoclonal antibody (anti-AFP) was carried out simply by immersion in aqueous solution containing triethoxysilylpropylmaleamic acid bearing a carboxy group and a silanol group. The RIfS system with the anti-AFP-immobilized sensor chip was found to give a reversible response through 100 on/off cycles using a regeneration buffer with high reproducibility (coefficient of variation (CV) = 5.7%). The limit of detection (LOD) of AFP was 100 ng mL(-1), and the measurement range spanned 3 orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the sensor chip showed no cross-reactivity with human serum albumin, Immunoglobulin G, transferrin, or fibrinogen at 100 Î¼g mL(-1) without the use of blocking reagents such as bovine serum albumin. Consequently, the proposed RIfS system is a potentially effective tool for biomarker detection and in vitro diagnostics.
