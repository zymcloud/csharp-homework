Purpose:To determine if the combination of gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging helps to increase accuracy and sensitivity in the diagnosis of small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) compared with those achieved by using each MR imaging technique alone.Materials and methods:The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived the requirement for informed consent. The study included 130 patients (95 men, 35 women) with 179 surgically confirmed small HCCs (≤2.0 cm) and 130 patients with cirrhosis (90 men, 40 women) without HCC who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging and DW imaging at 3.0 T between May 2009 and July 2010. Three sets of images were analyzed independently by three observers to detect HCC: a gadoxetic acid set (unenhanced, early dynamic, and hepatobiliary phases), a DW imaging set, and a combined set. Data were analyzed by using alternative-free response receiver operating characteristic analysis. Diagnostic accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [A(z)]), sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were calculated.Results:The mean A(z) values for the combined set (0.952) were significantly higher than those for the gadoxetic acid set (A(z) = 0.902) or the DW imaging set alone (A(z) = 0.871) (P ≤ .008). On a per-lesion basis, observers showed higher sensitivity in their analyses of the combined set (range, 91.1%-93.3% [163-167 of 179]) than in those of the gadoxetic acid set (range, 80.5%-82.1% [144-147 of 179]) or the DW imaging set alone (range, 77.7%-79.9% [139-143 of 179]) (P ≤ .003). Positive predictive values and specificity for all observers were equivalent for the three imaging sets.Conclusion:The combination of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging and DW imaging yielded better diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity in the detection of small HCCs than each MR imaging technique alone.
