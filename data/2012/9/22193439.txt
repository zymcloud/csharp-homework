Background/aims:The mean age of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients has increased (=65 years old). We want to identify the recent trend of the clinical features of HCC patients due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) (HCV-HCC).Methodology:From 2000 to 2009, 855 naive HCC patients were admitted. HCV-HCC patients were divided into two groups, first period group (2000-04, n=270) and second period group (2005-09, n=343) and the clinical features of HCV-HCC were investigated.Results:There was no difference in gender, TNM stage and percentages of HCV-HCC between the periods. On the other hand, the ratio of HCV-HCC patients with worse liver function (Child-Pugh B or C), elderly (=75 years old) and the population of patients treated with low invasive radiofrequency ablation were increased (30.0% to 42.0%, 17.2% to 35.8% and 25.1% to 36.2%, respectively; pConclusions:The ratio of aged HCV-HCC as well as HCV-HCC patients with worse liver function was increased. The less invasive treatment for HCC in these patients and the quick anti-viral treatment for HCV patients should be considered to avoid occurrence of HCC in Japan.
