Introduction:Conventional chemotherapy has reached a plateau of effectiveness for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with EGFR mutation or ALK translocations will benefit significantly from agents targeting these pathways, however, only 20% of western NSCLC patients have these mutations. Anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab was approved for advanced NSCLC, but the clinical benefits are modest and all patients eventually develop resistance. Multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) may offer more efficient inhibition of angiogenesis by blocking overlapping pathways and they may also have direct anti-tumor effects. Sorafenib is approved in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma and is now under investigation in the treatment of NSCLC.Areas covered:This review summarizes recent studies evaluating sorafenib in the treatment of NSCLC.Expert opinion:Sorafenib has shown anti-tumor activity in NSCLC. However, because NSCLC is complex and molecularly heterogeneous, it is very likely that only a subset of NSCLC patients will benefit from sorafenib, and so it is imperative to discover biomarkers to select patients who will probably benefit from sorafenib. Combination with other agents targeting parallel and compensatory pathways, such as EGFR inhibitors, may offer broader coverage and better disease control.
