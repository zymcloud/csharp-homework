Background:Targeted therapy options in HER2-negative breast cancer are limited. This open-label, multicenter phase IB dose-escalation trial was conducted to determine safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity of a combination of docetaxel (Taxotere) and increasing doses of adecatumumab, a human IgG1 antibody targeting epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), in EpCAM-positive relapsed or primary refractory advanced-stage breast cancer.Patients and methods:Patients pretreated with up to four prior chemotherapy regimens received increasing adecatumumab doses either every 3 weeks (q3w) or weekly (qw) combined with docetaxel (100 mg/m(2) q3w). Primary end points were safety and tolerability. Antitumor activity was evaluated according to RECIST. Clinical benefit was defined as complete or partial response or stable disease for â‰¥24 weeks.Results:Thirty-one evaluable patients were treated. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. Neutropenia, leukocytopenia, lymphopenia, and diarrhea (dose-limiting) were the most frequent toxic effects. Maximum tolerated doses of adecatumumab given in combination with docetaxel were 550 mg/m(2) q3w and 360 mg/m(2) qw. Clinical benefit was observed in 44% of patients treated with q3w adecatumumab and docetaxel, increasing to 63% in patients with high EpCAM-expressing tumors.Conclusion:Combination therapy of adecatumumab and docetaxel is safe, feasible, and potentially active in heavily pretreated advanced-stage breast cancer.
