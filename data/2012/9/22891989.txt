Context:Mimusops elengi (M. elengi) Linn. (Sapotaceae) has been used as a folk medicine in wound healing, and the treatment of pain, and inflammation in many parts of India.Objective:The purpose of this investigation was to explore the antitumor activity of methanol extract of M. elengi (MEME) in Swiss albino mice against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cell line.Materials and methods:Twenty-four hours after intraperitoneal (i.p.) inoculation of tumor (EAC) cells in mice (n = 12), MEME was administered at 200 and 300 mg/kg body weight daily for 9 consecutive days. On day 10, half of the mice were dissected and the rest were kept alive for assessment of increase in life span. The antitumor effect of MEME was assessed by evaluating tumor volume, viable and nonviable tumor cell count, tumor weight, hematological parameter, and biochemical estimations. In vivo antioxidant parameters were assayed by estimating liver tissue enzyme. In vitro cytotoxicity assay of MEME was measured by using trypan blue exclusion method.Results and discussion:MEME showed significant (p < .001) decrease in tumor volume, packed cell volume, and viable cell count, and increased the life span of EAC bearing mice. Hematological, biochemical profile, and in vivo antioxidant parameters were significantly restored toward normal levels in MEME-treated mice as compared to EAC control. MEME also showed direct cytotoxicity on EAC cell line in a dose-dependent manner.Conclusions:The present study demonstrates that M. elengi leaves exhibited antitumor activity in Swiss mice, which may be due to its cytotoxic effect and antioxidant properties.
