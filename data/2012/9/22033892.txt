Purpose:The incidence of gastrointestinal metastases from lung cancer is higher than previously thought as they have been reported in 2-14% of the cases in autopsy studies. However, clinically significant metastases are rare. Small bowel perforation secondary to metastatic non-small cell lung cancer is a very rare clinical entity. The aim of this study is to describe a case of ileal perforation in a patient with intestinal metastases of a non-small cell lung cancer, along with a review of the literature.Methods:A 57-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer was referred to our emergency department with signs and symptoms of acute surgical abdomen. A computed tomography scan demonstrated dilated small bowel loops, liver deposits, and signs of perforation of an intra-abdominal hollow viscus.Results:Emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed diffuse purulent peritonitis and a perforated ileal tumor. A segmental small bowel resection and primary anastomosis were performed. Histological and immunohistochemical findings were consistent with a metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma. Additional evaluation revealed widespread metastatic disease. Unfortunately, despite adjuvant treatment, the patient died of progressive disease 2 months after surgery.Conclusions:Small bowel perforation due to metastatic non-small cell lung cancer is a very rare clinical entity. The possibility of small bowel metastases should be kept in mind in patients with lung cancer presenting with an acute abdomen. Intestinal perforation occurs in advanced stages and is usually a sign of widespread disease. Aggressive surgery can provide effective palliation and may improve short-term survival. The prognosis is however dismal.
