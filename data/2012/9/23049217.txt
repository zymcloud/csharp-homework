Aim:To identify the risk factors in predicting the outcome of acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure patients.Methods:We retrospectively divided 113 patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure-hepatitis B virus (ACLF-HBV) and without concurrent hepatitis C or D virus infection and hepatocellular carcinoma into two groups according to their outcomes after anti-HBV therapy. Their demographic, clinical, and biochemical data on the day of diagnosis and after the first week of treatment were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher's exact test, and a multiple logistic regression analysis.Results:The study included 113 patients (87 men and 26 women) with a mean age of 49.84 years. Fifty-two patients survived, and 61 patients died. Liver failure (85.2%), sepsis (34.4%), and multiple organ failure (39.3%) were the main causes of death. Multivariate analyses showed that Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores â‰¥ 12 [odds ratio (OR) = 7.160, 95% CI: 2.834-18.092, P Conclusion:APACHE II scores on the day of diagnosis and MELD scores after the first week of anti-HBV therapy are feasible predictors of outcome in ACLF-HBV patients.
