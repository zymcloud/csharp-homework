A series of oral prodrugs based on the structure of gemcitabine (2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine) were synthesised by introducing an amide group at the N4-position of the cytidine ring. A total of 16 compounds were obtained, and their chemical and biological characteristics were evaluated. The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) for most of these compounds were higher than that of gemcitabine in vitro. Compounds 5d and 5m, the representative compounds, were examined in terms of their physiological stabilities and pharmacokinetics. Compound 5d showed good stability in PBS and simulated intestinal fluid, and an analysis of its pharmacokinetics in mice suggested that the introduction of an amide group to gemcitabine could greatly improve its bioavailability. Further evaluation of compound 5d in vivo showed that this compound possesses higher activity than gemcitabine against the growth of HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and HCT-116 colon adenocarcinoma cells with less toxicity to animals. These results suggest that compound 5d could be further developed as a potential oral anticancer agent for clinical applications in which gemcitabine is currently used.
