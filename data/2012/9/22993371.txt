Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) combined with sorafenib is considered to be a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. However, this combination therapy carries the risk of hepatic arterial thrombosis (HAT), which interrupts the continuation of HAIC, due to the side-effects of sorafenib. This case demonstrates a complication of HAT which occurred during HAIC combined with sorafenib. HAT was detected early by angiography via an implantable port-catheter system and was successfully treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis.
