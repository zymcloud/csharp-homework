This case series describes and illustrates three cases of sclerotic osseous metastases from untreated renal cell carcinoma (RCC). RCC is commonly metastatic to the skeleton but almost always produces lytic metastases, with only three prior reports of sclerotic metastases identified in the literature. Sclerotic metastasis causing low back pain was the initial disease presentation in two of the three patients in this case series and the first manifestation of metastatic disease in one. The most common metastatic sites of RCC, i.e., retroperitoneal lymph nodes, lung, and liver, were not identified in any of the cases, and skeletal involvement with epidural extension was the only site of metastasis in two. Pathologic specimens from all three cases revealed RCC of high nuclear grade.
