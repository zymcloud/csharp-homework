Small-molecule cell-permeable Bcl-2/Bcl-xL antagonist ABT-737 has recently emerged as a novel cancer therapeutic agent because it potently induces apoptosis in certain cancer cells. However, since ABT-737 binds to Mcl-1 with low affinity, ABT-737-mediated apoptosis signaling is inhibited in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and other solid cancer cells due to the elevated expression of Mcl-1. Accordingly, strategies that target Mcl-1 are explored for overcoming ABT-737-resistance. In this study, we reported that Norcantharidin (NCTD), a small-molecule anticancer drug derived from Chinese traditional medicine blister beetle (Mylabris), induced transcriptional repression of Mcl-1 and considerably enhanced ABT-737-triggered cell viability inhibition and apoptosis in multiple HCC cell lines. Moreover, we observed that the enhancement of ABT-737-mediated apoptosis by NCTD was associated with activation of mitochondrial apoptosis signaling pathway, which involved cytosolic release of cytochrome c, cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Additionally, knockdown of Bax/Bak, the key effectors permeabilizing mitochondrial outer membrane significantly attenuated the enhancement, indicating mitochondrial apoptosis pathway played an essential role in the execution of the apoptosis. Finally, knockdown of Mcl-1 substantially potentiated ABT-737-mediated apoptotic cell death, confirming the potency of Mcl-1 repression by NCTD in enhancing ABT-737-induced apoptosis. These results therefore suggest that combination treatment with NCTD can overcome ABT-737 resistance and enhance ABT-737 therapeutic efficacy in treating human HCC.
