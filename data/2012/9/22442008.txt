Background and objectives:For small asymptomatic hepatic adenomas (HA), available data are insufficient to establish the superiority of either observation or surgery. We sought to investigate the cost-effectiveness of two initial management strategies.Methods:We performed a comparative analysis of two theoretical cohorts of 100 patients with small (Results:The NPV for immediate surgery was $1,733,955. The NPV for observation varied between $2,065,315-$2,745,631 for computed tomography (CT), $2,264,575-$2,929,541 for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and $802,837-$1,580,413 for ultrasound (US). The BE point was between 6 and 8 years for CT and 5-7 years for MRI. The BE point for US was not reached except in the highest progression rate scenario (12 years).Conclusions:This study highlights the importance of the underlying progression rate and the cost of imaging when following patients with asymptomatic HA. Overall, US surveillance is the most cost-efficient approach to observing small asymptomatic HA. If cross-sectional imaging is utilized, then immediate surgery is the most cost-effective decision at 5-8 years.
