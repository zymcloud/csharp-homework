Background:Combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) is an uncommon subtype of primary liver cancer that has rarely been reported in large-scale clinical studies. The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical features, treatment modalities, and prognosis of cHCC-CC.Methods:Included in this study were 113 patients who were histologically diagnosed as having Allen type C cHCC-CC, 103 of whom received liver resection, 6 transarterial chemoembolization treatment, 3 radiofrequency ablation, and 1 palliative supportive treatment. Clinicopathologic features and prognosis of 103 cHCC-CC patients after liver resection were compared with those of 6,679 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 386 patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) who underwent liver resection during the same period.Results:The proportion of cHCC-CC in primary liver cancers was 1.5 %. The 103 cases of cHCC-CC were characterized by male predominance, infection with hepatitis virus or presence of liver cirrhosis, and elevated alfa-fetoprotein-findings similar to HCC. However, serum CA19-9 elevation, incomplete capsules, and lymph node involvement were similar to ICC. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates after liver resection were 73.9, 41.4, and 36.4 %, respectively, for patients with cHCC-CC versus 77.5, 53.3, and 41.4 % for HCC patients, and 58.0, 29.1, and 22.3 % for ICC patients (Ï‡(2) = 137.5, P Conclusions:cHCC-CC has biological behavior and prognosis that are intermediate between HCC and ICC. Radical liver resection can provide a better outcome for this uncommon malignancy.
