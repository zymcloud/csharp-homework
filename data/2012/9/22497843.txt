We have previously identified Neighbor of Punc E 11 (Nope) as a specific cell surface marker of stem/progenitor cells in the murine fetal liver that is also expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, we focus on the differential expression pattern of Nope during murine fetal and postnatal liver development as well as in a normal and regenerating adult liver including oval cell activation. In the fetal liver, Nope shows a constantly high expression level and is a useful surface marker for the identification of Dlk, E-cadherin, and CD133-positive hepatoblasts by flow cytometry. Postnatally, Nope expression declines rapidly and remains barely detectable in the adult liver as shown by quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. Immunohistochemically, costainings for Nope- and epithelial-specific markers (E-cadherin), markers of early hepatoblasts (alpha-fetoprotein), and biliary marker proteins (CK19) demonstrate that Nope is initially expressed on bipotent hepatoblasts and persists thereafter on commited hepatocytic as well as cholangiocytic progenitor cells during late fetal liver development. Postnatally, Nope loses its circular expression pattern and is specifically directed to the sinusoidal membrane of early hepatocytes. While Nope is only weakly expressed on cholangiocytes in the normal adult liver, activated stem/progenitor (oval) cells clearly coexpress Nope together with the common markers A6, EpCAM, and CD24 in the 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine mouse model. In conclusion, Nope should be most useful in future research to define the differentiation stage of hepatic-specified cells of various sources and is a promising candidate to identify and isolate hepatic stem cells from the adult liver.
