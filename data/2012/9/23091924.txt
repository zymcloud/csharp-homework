Hepatitis B virus infection is more prevalent than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and hepatitis C virus infection. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a serious disease that can lead to severe complications as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The vast majority of people with chronic HBV infection are asymptomatic and as many as 2 in 3 people do not know they are infected. This is an indication of under screening by healthcare professionals. However, early treatment and intervention can prevent progression of liver disease. HBV infection is a vaccine-preventable disease. Until recently, there were few treatment options for patients with CHB, but now there are a number of antiviral agents available that are both effective against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and tolerable for the patient. This review paper attempts to provide some answers regarding the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis B.
