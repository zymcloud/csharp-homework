Background & aims:Histone deacetylation regulates chromatin remodeling and transcriptional down-regulation of specific genomic regions; it is altered in many types of cancer cells. We searched for microRNAs (miRs) that are affected by histone deacetylation and investigated the effects in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.Methods:HCC cell lines (HepG2, HLE, HLF, and Huh7) and immortalized liver cell lines (THLE-2 and THLE-3) were incubated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. Differentially expressed messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and miRs were identified by expression profiling. Small interfering RNAs were used to reduce levels of histone deacetylases (HDAC)1-3, and HCC cell lines were transfected with miR-449. We evaluated growth of xenograft tumors from modified cells in nude mice. Cells were analyzed by immunoblot and luciferase reporter assays. We analyzed HCC samples from 23 patients.Results:HDAC1-3 were up-regulated in HCC samples from patients. In cell lines, inhibition of HDAC significantly increased levels of hsa-miR-449a. c-MET mRNA, which encodes the receptor tyrosine kinase for hepatocyte growth factor, is a target of miR-449. Incubation of HCC cells with trichostatin A or transfection with miR-449 reduced expression of c-MET and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (downstream effectors of c-MET), increased apoptosis, and reduced proliferation. Huh-7 cells transfected with miR-449 formed tumors more slowly in mice than cells expressing control miRs. HCC samples from patients had lower levels of miR-449 and higher levels of c-MET than human reference.Conclusions:In HCC cells, up-regulation of HDAC1-3 reduces expression of miR-449. miR-449 binds c-MET mRNA to reduce its levels, promoting apoptosis and reducing proliferation of liver cells. Expression of miR-449 slows growth of HCC xenograft tumors in mice; this miR might function as a tumor suppressor.
