Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death in the world. Despite many diagnostic and therapeutic tools are now available to improve survival and reduce its recurrence, prognosis is closely conditioned by the time of diagnosis. Surveillance and early diagnosis are crucial for a successful therapy. We report a clinical case from the HCC archive of the Hepatocatt meetings held in Ge-melli Hospital (Catholic University of Rome). The case describes a tumor progression in a multistep process from a small liver nodule to overt HCC and its management by a multidisciplinary team.
