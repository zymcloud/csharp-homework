Introduction:The reported incidences of de novo malignancy following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) are significantly greater than those in the general population. We have analyzed the efficacy of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTORi) as immunosuppressant therapy in patients with de novo malignancies or those engrafted because of a primary liver cancer.Methods:We performed a case-control study of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; n = 119), cholangiocarcinoma (n = 1) or de novo malignancies (n = 73). Thirty-seven patients with these tumors were treated with mTORi, and 167, with calcineurin inhibitors (CNI). Switching to mTORi was performed progressively, withdrawing the CNI over 15 days, until obtaining levels of 5-10 ng/dL.Results:No incidence of rejection, serious adverse events, or death was observed with an overall actuarial survival of 68.5% in the mTORi group versus 45.7% among the CNI group. Overall rates of tumor recurrence were 15.2% and 36.8%, respectively (P Discussion:Surprising differences in survival and tumor recurrence rates were observed among the mTORi-treated group compared with controls. Switching from CNI to mTORi immunosuppressant therapy appeared to be safe. It seems to be reasonable to employ this strategy in liver transplant patients with primary hepatic or "de novo" neoplasms.
