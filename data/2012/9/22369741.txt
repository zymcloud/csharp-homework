Background/aims:The objective of this study is to evaluate the factors effective on mortality and morbidity of the patients operated for liver tumor.Methodology:Thirty-four patients who were operated for liver tumor between January 1st 2008 and December 31st 2009 in Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty have been included in this study. Patient preoperative, perioperative and postoperative characteristics and the effects of these characteristics on mortality, morbidity and the length of hospital stay were evaluated.Results:Most common postoperative complications during the study were fever and surgical site infection. Nineteen of the patients with blood loss over 1, 000 mL had the need for postoperative ICU treatment. The presence of concomitant disease, especially diabetes mellitus, liver disease and cardiovascular diseases and more than 2 units transfusion of erythrocyte suspension and fresh frozen plasma were considered related to mortality and morbidity.Conclusions:Patient preoperative, perioperative and postoperative characteristics affect patient morbidity and mortality in liver resection surgery. Diagnosing liver tumors early and thus reducing surgical site blood loss and use of blood products will decrease mortality and morbidity ratios after liver surgeries.
