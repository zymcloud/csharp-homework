Chronic infections with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are frequently pronounced in the etiology of malignancies especially in hepatocellular carcinoma. The association between HCV and risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) development has been stated recently. The authors retrospectively evaluated hepatitis serology for HCV and HBV in patients who had RCC diagnosis between 2005 and 2010 in six oncology centers. Control group was also included from the three different published studies that hepatitis serology studied in healthy people that has been living in the same geographic regions. Histologically confirmed 903 RCC cases and 5,267 healthy subjects were included the study. Median age at diagnosis of RCC was 58 (range: 26-89). There was no increase in HCV positivity in RCC patients compared to healthy control group (1.7 vs. 1.5%; P = 0.77). Frequency of HBsAg positivity was 4.4 and 4.1% in RCC and control groups, respectively (P = 0.65). There is no increase in frequency of HCV and HBsAg positivity in RCC patients. HCV positivity in RCC patients were not different from the healthy people.
