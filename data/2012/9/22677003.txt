Background:Coeliac disease is often undiagnosed, early diagnosis and treatment could be relevant to avoid fearful complications as intestinal lymphoma. Our aim is to estimate the risk of intestinal lymphoma in undiagnosed coeliac patients, evaluating the real incidences and applying different theoretical settings of coeliac prevalence.Methods:We collected cases of intestinal lymphomas from the Lombardy Cancer Registry and coeliac patients through computerized search of all Pathology Departments; duodenal pathological reports compatible with a Marsh 3 grade were included. The lymphoproliferative risk was calculated for theoretical different settings of coeliac prevalence (from 1:50 to 1:200), relative risks for intestinal lymphomas and compared to the real incidence of the lymphomas in this population.Results:Population consisted in 815,362 inhabitants; during the investigated period of time, 237 intestinal lymphomas and 326 coeliac patients were diagnosed. None of the coeliac patients had lymphoma. In the different scenarios calculated and compared with the real lymphoma incidence the relative risks of undiagnosed celiac disease for gastrointestinal B- and T-cell lymphomas ranges from 1.0 to 2.0 for 1:100 coeliac disease prevalence.Conclusions:Undiagnosed coeliac patients have no increased risk of developing intestinal lymphoma; population screening programmes, aimed at early diagnosis of lymphoma may not be useful in this setting.
