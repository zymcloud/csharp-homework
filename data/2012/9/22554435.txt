Two cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO(2) NPs) and one micro-sized CeO(2) particle were thoroughly characterized in their pristine form, in water and in cell culture medium. The particles were tested for cytotoxicity to the H4IIE rat hepatoma cell line or the RTG-2 rainbow trout gonadal cell line by means of four standard cytotoxicity assays. Nominal concentrations were verified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and methods were assessed for their suitability to detect reliably adverse effects due to particle exposure. All three particles showed aggregation in water and media. In the H4IIE cell line, the MTT cytotoxicity test revealed that negative effects could be observed for the CeO(2) NPs after 24h and for all particles after 72h of exposure, making the effects size, concentration and time dependent. No negative effect for the concentrations tested was detected for the remaining three assays and the RTG-2 cell line, making the MTT assay and the H4IIE cell line an appropriate system to assess adverse effects of CeO(2) NPs. A verification of the nominal concentration through ICP-MS revealed that there was a discrepancy between nominal and measured concentration depending on concentration and particle tested. Interferences of particles with assays were found to be present and need to be taken into consideration.
