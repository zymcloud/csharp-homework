Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a type of cancer with a very poor prognosis. Although Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) is the most effective marker available to detect HCC, the sensitivity and specificity are not optimal. Therefore, there is a need for the development of more sensitive and specific methods that can supplement AFP in the early detection of this cancer. In this study, autoantibody responses to glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence assay in sera from patients with HCC, liver cirrhosis (LC) and chronic hepatitis (CH), as well as from normal human individuals. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with tissue array slides was also preformed to analyze protein expression profiles of GRP78 in HCC and control tissues. The prevalence of autoantibodies against GRP78 was 35.5% (27/76) in HCC, which was significantly higher than that in LC, CH and normal human sera (NHS; P
