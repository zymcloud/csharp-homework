Aim:Surgical options for familiar adenomatous polyposis (FAP) have been standardized in developed countries but are still controversial in China. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the results of patients with FAP treated in a university hospital.Methods:In all 42 consecutive patients with FAP were operated on between May 1988 and June 2008. Median follow up was 7.2 years (2.2-20 years). Of these 33 patients were treated by proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis. A total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis was undertaken in six and a proctocolectomy with ileostomy in three patients who had invasive rectal cancer.Results:Postoperative morbidity was insignificant. There were five wound infections, one intestinal obstruction, one anastomotic leakage, one anastomotic stenosis and one refractory pouchitis. One patient died from stroke. Five died from FAP-related disorders, namely, abdominal desmoids, liver metastases and advanced rectal cancer. Desmoid tumor occurred in five patients. Periampullary adenoma and carcinoma developed in four patients. In those with pouch procedure the 24-h bowel movement was 7.14 Â± 1.28 (range 5-11) and their 10-year overall survival was 87.5%.Conclusion:A proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis maybe the best choice for FAP patients in China. Surgical expertise, good teamwork and careful long-term follow up are mandatory.
