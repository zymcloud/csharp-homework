Objective:To explore the association between polymorphisms in the DNA repair gene, xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD), and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the Chinese population by performing a systematic review of the previously published clinical data.Method:A comprehensive literature search of the BIOSIS Previews and PubMed databases was carried out to identify all case-control studies of XPD polymorphisms and HCC risk. Meta-analysis was conducted to calculate the pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of developing HCC for carriers of the various XPD polymorphisms.Results:Six case-control studies were selected for this meta-analysis, and comprised a total of 3424 HCC cases and 3636 controls. The pooled ORs (95% CIs) of XPD codon 751 and 312 allelomorphs were 1.25 (0.70 to 2.24) and 0.85 (0.58 to 1.25), respectively. Compared with the XPD wild-type homozygote Lys/Lys genotype of codon 751, the pooled OR (95% CI) of Lys/G1n + Gln/Gln genotypes for HCC risk was 1.31 (0.71 to 2.42). Compared with the XPD wild-type homozygote Asp/Asp genotype of codon 312, the pooled OR (95% CI) of Asp/Asn + Asn/Asn genotypes for HCC risk was 1.19 (0.73 to 1.95).Conclusion:Polymorphisms in the XPD codons 751 and 312 are not associated with HCC risk in the Chinese population.
