The fruit of Docynia delavayi (Franch.) Schneid is a kind of popular food in southwestern areas of China. Additionally, its rhizome has been long used as a folk medicine in the treatment of liver cancer by local people. Chrysin is a kind of flavonoid which induces cancer cell death in vitro. However, its anti-tumor activity in vivo and toxicological effects on the tumor-bearing animals still remain poorly understood. In this study, we obtained four flavonoids from this herb. Among them, chrysin showed the strongest cytotoxic effect on an array of cultured tumor cells. Further investigations revealed that it significantly repressed transplanted H22 ascitic hepatic tumor cell growth in vivo. Moreover, this compound displayed little toxic effects. Additionally, we demonstrated that in transplanted tumor tissues, chrysin not only activated caspase-3 and induced apoptosis, but also inhibited the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and suppressed angiogenesis. These data showed that chrysin exhibited prominent anti-tumor activities and low toxic effects in vivo.
