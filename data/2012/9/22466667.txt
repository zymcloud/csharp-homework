Background:Although several studies have shown that serum antithrombin III (ATIII) has anti-inflammatory effects, the prognostic value of ATIII in HCC is unknown. We investigated the influence of preoperative ATIII levels on the outcome of patients who underwent hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Data from 440 patients (314 patients with ATIII ≥ 70 % and 126 patients with ATIII Results:The propensity score analysis revealed that 65 patients with ATIII of ≥ 70 % (group 1) and 65 patients with ATIII of Conclusions:The prognosis of patients with HCC was found to be associated with preoperative antithrombin III levels. ATIII may be useful for predicting outcomes of patients with HCC after curative hepatectomy.
