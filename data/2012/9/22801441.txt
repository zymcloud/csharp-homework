Aim:The aim of this study was to compare small size aspiration needles with large size cutting needles in focal liver lesions for using small needles instead of large ones without on-site cytopathologist.Methods:Percutaneous ultrasonography-guided liver biopsy was evaluated retrospectively in a biopsy cohort study of 1300 patients. In this series, 690 patients were biopsied with large size (Results:We had diagnostic accuracy rate of 85.0% in small needle group vs. 96.9% in large needle group with metastasis (PConclusion:In uncertain diagnosis with modern imaging, we propose that large size cutting needles should be used in suspected liver metastasis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and regenerative nodules if cytopathologist was not present. Small needles can be successfully used as well as large ones in focal steatosis, infection-inflammation, and hemangioma of liver in unclear diagnosis.
