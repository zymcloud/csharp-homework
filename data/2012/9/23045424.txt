The occurrence of malignancies in thalassaemic patients is an emerging concern for physicians. In the last five years, in a single Thalassaemia Unit following 195 thalassaemic patients, eleven cases of carcinoma were diagnosed: 4 cases of liver, 1 of lung, 1 of adrenal gland and 5 cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma (patient mean age 42.6 years).Therefore, we decided to perform a thyroid ultrasonography (US) in addition to the periodic (6-12 months) assessment of FT4 and TSH in all adult patients with thalassaemia followed at the Thalassaemia Unit of Siracusa and at the Outpatient Clinic of Quisisana Hospital of Ferrara. Thyroid nodules were found in 8.6% of 58 examined thalassaemia major or intermedia patients. To exclude thyroid malignancy, fine needle biopsy (FNAC) under US guidance was performed. A diagnosis of incidental papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) was made in 3 female patients with iron overload. According to the World Health Organization, PTMC is defined as papillary thyroid carcinoma measuring < or = 10 mm in the greatest dimension. Two patients were HCV positive. All underwent a total or subtotal thyroidectomy with histological confirmation of the FNAC cytology diagnosis. In conclusion, it seems that patients with thalassaemia have a substantial risk for malignancies. Further studies are needed in these patients to clarify the possible link between cellular iron content, hepatitis C virus infection and cancer development. A thyroid ultrasonography is recommended for all adult thalassaemic patients in addition to the annual FT4 and TSH assessment.
