Background/aims:We investigated the clinicopathological findings and outcome after surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients without hepatitis B or C virus infection.Methodology:Among 562 patients who underwent curative resection for hepatocellular carcinoma, the sera from 97 patients (B group) were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen alone, sera from 355 patients (C group) were positive for anti-hepatitis C virus antibody alone and sera from 104 patients (NBNC group) were negative for both hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody. We compared the clinicopathological findings and postoperative outcomes in the 3 groups.Results:The prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and alcohol abuse were higher in the NBNC group than in the other groups. The prevalence of obesity was higher in the NBNC group than in the B group. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis was detected in 16 NBNC patients. The tumor- free survival rate was higher in the NBNC group than in the C group.Conclusions:Obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, alcohol abuse and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis were the possible risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in the NBNC group. The patients in the NBNC group are expected to show a better outcome as compared to patients in the C group.
