The common genes responsible for the characteristics of primary cultured invasive phenotype hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells were investigated. Primary cultured HCC cells from three patients were separated by Matrigel invasion into parent and invasive cells. Whole human genome oligo microarray was applied to detect the differentially expressed genes in invasive cells. A purchased HCC cell line (HA 22T/VGH) was studied for comparison. Forty genes were consistently up-regulated and 14 genes were consistently down-regulated among primary cultured invasive cells. Among these genes, only three up-regulated genes (CNN1, PLAT, SPARC) and one down-regulated tumor suppressor gene (MDFI) had same expressions in invasive cells originated from purchased cell line. For primary cultured invasive cells, differential expressions of several groups of common genes are known to have capacities to promote proliferation (CAV1, IL6, PLAT, RRAD, SRPX), remodeling of extracellular matrix (COL1A1, COL1A2, NID2, TNC, RELN, SPARC), migration (ACTG2, CAV1, CCL2, CCL26, CDC42EP3, CNN1, PHLDB2, PLAT, RRAD, SRPX), implantation (IL6), immune escape (CD70) and angiogenesis (CCL2, IL6, IL18, PLAT, SLIT3). Two genes related to signal transduction (AXL, RASL10B) and one related to metabolism (PTGS2) also showed consistent expressions. Differential expressions of these genes are capable for tumor invasiveness. In conclusion, the characteristics of invasive phenotype HCC cells are originated from differential expressions of several groups of genes rather than few target genes. This information may give us a new insight to design new stratagems in HCC treatment. Analysis of the results from a purchased cell line may have bias due to long-term repeated in vitro cultures.
