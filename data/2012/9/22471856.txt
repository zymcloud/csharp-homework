Background & aims:Previous studies have indicated that telomere length is associated with altered risk of various tumours including hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the association between telomere length and the risk of cirrhosis has not been reported.Methods:In this nested case-control study, we used real-time quantitative PCR to determine the relative telomere length (RTL) in serum DNA samples from 100 HBV-related cirrhosis cases and 100 frequency-matched HBV controls, and evaluated the associations between RTL and cirrhosis risk by logistic regression analyses.Results:We found that cirrhotic cases had a significantly longer RTL (median, 0.36; range, 0.08-1.87) than non-cirrhotic controls (median, 0.20; range, 0.05-1.11) (P Conclusions:Our study presents the first epidemiological evidence that RTL in serum DNA could potentially be used as a simple, inexpensive and non-invasive marker of cirrhosis risk, a finding that warrants further investigations in independent retrospective and prospective populations.
