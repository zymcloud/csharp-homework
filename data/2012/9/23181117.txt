Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAI) using an implanted port system is the standard regimen for primary and metastatic liver cancers (MLCs). However, there have been few studies concerning HAI-induced oxidative stress and damage to the liver or other organs. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of green tea polyphenols (GTPs) to reduce the oxidative stress or increase the biological antioxidative potential in HAI-treated patients. A total of 19 patients with inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or MLC from colorectal malignancy were eligible for HAI with cisplatin (CDDP) and 5-fluorouracil (5FU). The study subjects were randomly assigned to either a 3 or a 6 oral GTP tablets per day group. Each tablet had a GTP content equivalent to 79 mg of epigallocatechin-3-gallate. The oxidative stress was assessed by measuring the levels of derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs) and the biological antioxidative potential (BAP) values in patient plasma using the Free Radical Analytical System 4 (FRAS4), and correlating the results with clinical laboratory data for the patients. The levels of d-ROMs were significantly reduced by the oral intake of 6 GTP tablets for 6-9 months (P=0.0463) but were not significantly reduced by the oral intake of 3 GTP tablets daily. BAP values remained constant in the 3 and 6 tablet groups for 6-9 months during the follow-up study. The total serum bilirubin (T-bil) levels increased significantly at 3 (P=0.028) and 9 (P=0.0151) months and the red blood cell (RBC) count decreased at 6 months (P=0.0458) after intake for the 6 GTP tablet group. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels increased significantly at 9 months (P=0.0298). Cholinesterase (ChE) decreased significantly at 9 (P= 0.0127) and 12 (P= 0.0207) months after intake for the 3 GTP tablet group. The results indicate that the daily intake of 6 GTP tablets containing 474 mg polyphenols significantly reduces HAI-induced oxidative stress in HCC or MLC patients while the antioxidative potentials of the patients remain constant.
