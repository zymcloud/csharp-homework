Although peptide vaccines have been actively studied in various animal models, their efficacy in treatment is limited. To improve the efficacy of peptide vaccines, we previously formulated an efficacious peptide vaccine without carriers using the natural phosphodiester bond CpG-DNA and a special liposome complex (Lipoplex(O)). Here, we show that immunization of mice with a complex consisting of peptide and Lipoplex(O) without carriers significantly induces peptide-specific IgG2a production in a CD4(+) cells- and Th1 differentiation-dependent manner. The transmembrane 4 superfamily member 5 protein (TM4SF5) has gained attention as a target for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy because it induces uncontrolled growth of human HCC cells via the loss of contact inhibition. Monoclonal antibodies specific to an epitope of human TM4SF5 (hTM4SF5R2-3) can recognize native mouse TM4SF5 and induce functional effects on mouse cancer cells. Pre-immunization with a complex of the hTM4SF5R2-3 epitope and Lipoplex(O) had prophylactic effects against tumor formation by HCC cells implanted in an mouse tumor model. Furthermore, therapeutic effects were revealed regarding the growth of HCC when the vaccine was injected into mice after tumor formation. These results suggest that our improved peptide vaccine technology provides a novel prophylaxis measure as well as therapy for HCC patients with TM4SF5-positive tumors.
