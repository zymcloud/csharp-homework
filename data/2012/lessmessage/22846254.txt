Background/aims:Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with its progressive form nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most common chronic liver disease in western countries which is associated with end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This entity is a consistently increasing indication for transplantation. However, data about postsurgery outcome and complications are still limited.Patients and methods:Records of 432 consecutive transplanted patients between October 2007 and January 2011 were investigated retrospectively. Forty transplants were performed due to NASH-induced cirrhosis. Perioperative courses and short- and long-term outcomes were analyzed.Results:The NAFLD population consisted of 16 women and 24 men with a mean age of 55 years. The median MELD score was 27 at the time of liver transplantion. BMI before surgery ranged from 21 to 45 (mean 31). Sixteen of the initial 40 patients are still alive. Patients with sustained obesity and features of the metabolic syndrome had a worse 1-year mortality rate of 42%.Conclusions:A significant number of liver transplantations in our center was performed due to NASH; transplantation in this cohort was associated with high mortality and postoperative complications, most likely due to associated obesity and diabetes. Weight reduction prior to surgery may lead to a better outcome.
