Background/aims:Multiple hepatic vessels and portal vessels are distributed in the central segments of the liver (segments IV, V and VIII). Due to its anatomical complexity, in centrally-located hepatocellular carcinoma (cHCC) it is theoretically not easy to reach a wide margin, as it is in non-central hepatocellular carcinoma (ncHCC) (segments II, III, VII and VIII). We compared their outcomes to see if cHCC has an inferior result than ncHCC.Methodology:From August 2000 to July 2008, 213 HCC patients received curative-intended resection. Sixty-nine cHCC (group A) and 64 ncHCC (group B) received trisegmentectomy (include mesohepatectomy), bi-segmentectomy, mono-segmentectomy or subsegmentectomy. The outcomes were retrospectively analyzed.Results:The in-hospital mortality was 0% and 3.12% in groups A and B, respectively (p=0.55). The morbidity was 27.5% and 28.1% in groups A and B, respectively (p=0.23). The 1- and 3-year disease-free survival were 68%, 50% and 62%, 33% in groups A and B, respectively (p=0.39). The 1- and 3-year overall survival rates were 83%, 75% and 89%, 70% in groups A and B, respectively (p=0.91). Tumor size and numbers were significant factors for disease-free and overall survival.Conclusions:cHCC treated by partial hepatectomy and mesohepatectomy has a comparable result to ncHCC. Mesohepatectomy is needed only in some selected patients.
