We herein report a rare case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with sarcomatous changes. A 66-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a high fever and upper abdominal pain. Initially, he was diagnosed as having a liver abscess; however, antibiotic treatment and drainage were ineffective. Further imaging studies revealed the typical appearance of HCC: the tumor had invaded the hepatic and portal veins. Surgical resection of the tumor was performed. A pathological examination demonstrated the presence of a sarcomatous hepatocellular carcinoma. Sarcomatous hepatocellular carcinoma with remittent fever is a rare disease entity.
