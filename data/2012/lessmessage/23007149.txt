Background:Although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are widely used in the management of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gefitinib-induced hepatotoxicity has been underappreciated and rarely reported.Case report:The medical records of 92 NSCLC patients, who were admitted to our cancer center in the past 5 years, were reviewed retrospectively. All patients received treatment with gefitinib (250 mg/day), during which liver function was monitored. Of the 92 NSCLC patients, 6 (6.5%) developed mild to moderate hepatotoxicity during gefitinib treatment. The time of onset of hepatotoxicity ranged from 7 days to 6 months after gefitinib administration. 1 patient (1.1%) suffered from grade 2 hepatotoxicity, and gradually recovered her normal liver function after reduction of the gefitinib dose. The other 5 patients with grade 1 hepatic impairment tolerated gefitinib well without requiring dose reductions or drug cessation.Conclusion:Gefitinib-induced hepatotoxicity is not uncommon. Although the extent of this toxicity is generally mild in nature and most patients tolerate gefitinib well, meticulous monitoring is mandatory to avoid severe hepatic impairment.
