Background/aims:Surgical resection is a radical treatment option for hilar bile duct carcinoma (HBDC); however, it is still difficult to cure and postoperative morbidity is high at this stage.Methodology:We examined the demographics, surgical records and outcome in 38 patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma undergoing operation.Results:Five patients (13%) underwent probe laparotomy because of peritoneal dissemination or liver metastasis. Of 33 patients, extended hemi-hepatectomy was performed in 32 patients. Postoperative complications were observed in 46% including hepatic failure in 3 and hospital death was observed in 4 patients. Advanced tumor stage more than stage III was observed in 23 patients. Curability of operation was A in 5 patients, B in 17 and C in 11 and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was administered in 24% including photodynamic therapy in 3. Tumor recurrence was observed in 41% of HBDC patients. The 3- and 5-year tumor-free survival was 38% and 10%, respectively and 3- and 5-year overall survival was 48% and 32%, respectively. By comparison with tumor stage or final curability, survival rates were not significantly different between groups.Conclusions:Surgical resection is still the only curative treatment option to improve patient survival even in advanced stage HBDC.
