The term "carcinoma of unknown primary" (CUP) defines a malignant condition in which a metastatic cancer is documented in absence of a detectable primary site. It occurs in about 2รท6 % of cancer patients, according to various literature reports. The primary tumor site results indefinable because of several either single or associated factors, even remaining occult at autopsy in 15รท25% of CUP patients. The metastatic spread pattern of CUP is quite unlike that expected for analogous known primary malignancy. For instance, the unknown prostate cancer often metastasizes to the lungs and liver while the its known analogous usually spreads to the bone. Whether certain genetic abnormalities might play a role in determining a CUP condition, it remains undefined. Most CUP are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, either undifferentiated or differentiated carcinoma, whereas less frequently may be sarcoma, melanoma or neuroendocrine tumor. As CUP diagnostic management is concerned, two opposite approach modalities may be adopted, one, named "shotgun modality", consisting in a multiplicity of examinations aimed at achieving the identification of the primary tumor and the other, a nihilistic modality, by adopting tout court a palliative therapy of the metastatic disease. A reasonable intermediate diagnostic strategy consists in undertaking some procedures with a specific target and low cost/benefit ratio. Selected imaging studies, serum tumor markers, immunohistochemical analyses and genetic- molecular examinations on biopsy material allow sometimes to reach the detection of primary malignancies that might be responsive to a potential treatments. Nevertheless, in spite of recent sophisticated -laboratory and imaging progress, CUP remains a strong challenge in clinical oncology.
