Objective:To investigate any association between renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS).Subjects and methods:The retrospective analysis included 1,028 patients of Chinese Han nationality with resectable RCC and PNS. The PNS included elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), hypertension, cachexia, anemia, pyrexia, abnormal liver function, hypercalcemia, polycythemia, varicocele and neuromyopathy. Staging was categorized as local (T1-2N0M0) and locally advanced (T3-4NxM0).Results:Among patients with at least one PNS, elevated ESR (p = 0.008), cachexia (p = 0.000), varicocele (p = 0.000) and pyrexia (p = 0.021) were related to advanced stage of RCC. Among patients with only one PNS, hypertension (p = 0.012) and hypercalcemia (p = 0.000) were related to advanced stage. The remaining PNS were not associated with tumor stage.Conclusion:Pyrexia, elevated ESR, cachexia and varicocele were related to advanced RCC. Hypertension and hypercalcemia occurring as single PNS, although also correlated with advanced stage, require further investigation.
