Aim of study:To investigate the trend of expression of liver function test enzymes and other biochemical changes during gallbladder carcinogenesis.Materials and methods:Eight hundred and seventy-eight gallbladder disease patients were selected to study the liver function test enzymes and routine blood biochemical changes in the last five years (2004-08). Statistical analysis was performed using Graph Pad prism 5.02 software.Results:The liver function test enzymes showed significant correlations among themselves, and with glucose in gallbladder cancer and gallstone disease patients (N = 878). Out of 878 gallbladder cases, 46 (5.24%) showed significantly higher glucose level of 216.66 mg/dL (P < 0.0001). All the three pathological conditions of gallbladder, gallbladder cancer with stones (GBCS), gallbladder cancer without stones (GBC) and calculus cholecystitis (CC), showed highly significant positive correlation (Pearson) between Serum Glutamic Oxaloactetic Transaminase (SGOT) and Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase (SGPT) [P < 0.0001, (GBCS); P < 0.0001, (GBC), and P < 0.0001, (CC)]. SGOT and SGPT also showed positive correlation with higher glucose level independently, in both GBCS and CC (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001), respectively.Conclusion:Simultaneous elevation of glucose and liver function test enzymes in GBC makes the diagnosis complex. Any patient of gallbladder diseases with higher level of glucose may have the possibility of developing gallbladder cancer.
