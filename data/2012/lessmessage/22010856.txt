The antioxidant and anticancer properties of a medicinal plant, Romulea tempskyana (R. tempskyana) (Iridaceae) were investigated. The fresh corm water extract of R. tempskyana significantly increased cell viability against H(2)O(2) cytotoxicity(.) The extract also showed high inhibition of the lipid peroxidation activity (78.20%), reducing power (IC(50) 64.99 µg mL(-1)) activity and hydroxyl (IC(50) 38.66 µg mL(-1)), superoxide (IC(50) 25.99 µg ml(-1)) and DPPH (IC(50) 19.88 µg mL(-1)) radical scavenging activity. On the other hand, treatment of the cells with higher extract concentration showed the anticancer activity inducing cytotoxicity. The extract significantly affected Hepatoma G2 and H1299 cell proliferation (IC(50); 103.79 and 88.15 µg mL(-1)). The amount of MDA (2-fold and 2.5-fold) and activities of several cellular antioxidant enzymes, including Se-GSPx (30%, 15%), non-Se-GSH-Px (11%, 16%) and GST (17%, 23%) increased in Hepatoma G2 and H1299 cells treated with IC(50) concentrations of extract, respectively. These findings suggest that R. tempskyana extract exhibits antioxidant and carcinogenesis-reducing potential.
