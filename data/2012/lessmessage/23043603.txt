Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) increased in Egypt in the past years, becoming the most common cancer among men. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are the known primary risk factors for HCC. This study describes the viral profile of HCC in a predominantly rural area in Egypt. We included 148 HCC cases and 148 controls from the Tanta Cancer Center and the Gharbiah Cancer Society in the Nile delta region. Serological (ELISA) and molecular (PCR) analysis for HBV and HCV infection were performed on plasma samples from each subject. Epidemiologic, environmental, and medical histories were collected by interviewing of subjects. Around 90.5% of cases and controls were from rural areas. HCV infection was high in both cases and controls (89.2% and 49.3%, for cases and controls respectively by serology). HCV was the most important HCC risk factor [OR 9.7 (95% CI: 3.3-28.0, P Keywords:hepatocellular carcinoma; hepatitis; rural; risk factors; Egypt.
