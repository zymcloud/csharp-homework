Background/aims:To elucidate the prognostic factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methodology:We studied 85 TACE-treated HCC patients, including 117 lesions, who fulfilled the Milan criteria. The area of iodized poppy-seed oil (lipiodol) accumulation on CT immediately after TACE was classified into three groups, by comparing with the area of HCC detected by CT during hepatic arteriography; accumulation surrounding the HCC lesion (group I), accumulation involving the entire area of the HCC lesion (group II), and accumulation that covered a portion of the HCC lesion (group III).Results:Among 85 patients, the 1- and 2-year disease free survival (DFS) rates were 67% and 50% in group I, 49% and 29% in group II and 29% and 15% in group III. DFS rate was higher in group I than in groups II and III (p=0.016 and pConclusions:Lipiodol accumulation pattern as evaluated by CT immediately after TACE may be a powerful indicator of the therapeutic efficacy of TACE in HCC patients.
