Objective:To assess the technical feasibility and local efficacy of biplane fluoroscopy plus US-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for viable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) around retained iodized oil after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).Materials and methods:Our prospective study was approved by our institutional review board and informed consent was obtained from all participating patients. For patients with viable HCC around retained iodized oil after TACE, biplane fluoroscopy plus US-guided RFA was performed. We evaluated the rate of technical success and major complications on a post-RFA CT examination and local tumor progression with a follow-up CT.Results:Among 40 consecutive patients, 19 were excluded due to one of the following reasons: poorly visible HCC on fluoroscopy (n = 13), high risk location (n = 2), RFA performed under monoplane fluoroscopy and US guidance (n = 2), and poorly identifiable new HCCs on US (n = 2). The remaining 21 patients with 21 viable HCCs were included. The size of total tumors ranged from 1.4 to 5.0 cm (mean: 3.2 cm) in the longest diameter. Technical success was achieved for all 21 HCCs, and major complications were observed in none of the patients. During the follow-up period (mean, 20.3 months; range, 6.5-29.9 months), local tumor progression was found in two patients (2/21, 9.5%). Distant intrahepatic metastasis developed in 76.2% (16/21) of patients.Conclusion:When retained iodized oil around the tumor after TACE hampers the targeting of the viable tumor for RFA, biplane fluoroscopy plus US-guided RFA may be performed owing to its technical feasibility and effective treatment for viable HCCs.
