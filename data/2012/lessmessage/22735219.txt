Objective:To investigate the association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and liver function/injury markers with components of metabolic syndrome (MS) in class III obese individuals.Methods:The study population consisted of 144 patients with class III obesity (body mass index [BMI] > 40 kg/m²). MS was diagnosed according to the National Cholesterol Education Program - Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) criteria, by determining the lipid profile, blood glucose and basal insulin. Liver function/injury markers were also quantified. Insulin resistance (IR) was measured by HOMA-IR and NAFLD diagnosis was established by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Statistical calculations were performed by SPSS version 13.0. The association was assessed by the Mann-Whitney and Chi-square tests, with a level of significance set at 5%.Results:There was a significant association between the diagnosis of MS and NAFLD (χ² = 6.84, p = 0.01). As for the diagnostic components of MS, there was a positive and significant association between HDL-C (p = 0.05), waist circumference (p < 0.05) and hypertension (χ² = 4.195, p = 0.041) with NAFLD. HOMA-IR (p < 0.001) also showed a positive association with liver disease.Conclusion:A positive and significant association between NAFLD and components of metabolic syndrome in class III obese individuals was observed, suggesting the need and importance of monitoring these components for NAFLD screening.
