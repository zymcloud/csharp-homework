Objective:To assess the ability to predict the local recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma by analyzing tissues adhering to the radiofrequency ablation probe after complete ablation.Methods:From May 2002 to March 2011, tissue specimens adhering to the radiofrequency ablation probe from 284 radiofrequency ablation sessions performed for hepatocellular carcinomas ≤3 cm in size were analyzed. The specimens were classified as either viable tumor tissue or complete necrosis, and the local recurrence rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:From the tumors ≤3 cm in size, viable tissue was present in 6 (2.1%) of 284 specimens, and the local recurrence rates after 1 and 2 years of follow-up were 6.7% and 11.2%, respectively. Local recurrence developed significantly earlier in the viable tissue group. The recurrence rate was not significantly different based on whether transcatheter arterial chemoembolization was performed.Conclusion:The histopathology of the tissue adhering to the radiofrequency ablation probes used for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment can predict local recurrence. Additional aggressive treatment for patients with viable tissue can therefore improve the overall survival.
