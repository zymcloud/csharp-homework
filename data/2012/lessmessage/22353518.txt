Background/aims:To assess the surgical safety of synchronous hepatic resection and splenectomy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hypersplenism.Methodology:Patients with HCC and hypersplenism who underwent surgical treatment were included in this study. According to the difference of operations, patients were divided into two groups (group A, patients who underwent hepatic resection; group B, patients who underwent synchronous hepatic resection and hypersplenism). Pre- and intra-operative parameters were statistically analyzed. Postoperative outcomes including white blood cell and platelet count changes, surgical complications and long-term survival rates were compared.Results:The pre- and intra-operative parameters of two groups were comparable except for preoperative white blood cell and platelet counts. The incidences of postoperative surgical complication were 53.33% for group A and 35.48% for group B (p=0.161). The 1- and 3-year survival rates of the two groups were 83%, 42% and 82%, 54%, respectively (p=0.313).Conclusions:Synchronous hepatic resection and splenectomy could increase the postoperative WBC and platelet level for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and hypersplenism without increasing surgical risks.
