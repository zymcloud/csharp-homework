Helicobacter species are important pathogens and previous studies in mice suggested a link between colonization by Helicobacter hepaticus (H. hepaticus) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed at corroborating this potential link in human patients. We used a sensitive and specific Helicobacter ssp PCR assay to screen stool samples from a collective of patients with viral-induced HCC (hepatitis B or hepatitis C) and a control group for presence of Helicobacter ssp DNA. Although retrieving DNA of H. pylori and H. canadensis from stool samples of non-HCC patients, we found no evidence indicating the presence of H. hepaticus in HCC-patients with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Interestingly we found H. canadensis in a stool sample of a patient presenting with diarrhea. Taken together, our data argue against a pathogenic role of H. hepaticus in viral-induced HCC. Yet, our results do not exclude a role of H. hepaticus in those HCC cases caused by other carcinogens, such as aflatoxin. Moreover, we speculate that H. canadensis might be a novel gastrointestinal pathogen.
