Various methods for the direct reprogramming of human somatic cells have been developed. However, a therapeutic method to reprogram and eliminate human solid tumor cells has not been developed. Here we show a novel therapeutic method to reprogram and eliminate human solid tumor cells with chemicals. This therapeutic method may be applicable to various human solid tumor cells that express aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs).
