A multimodality fusion imaging system has been introduced for the clinical practice of diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially for loco-regional treatment. An ultrasonography (US) fusion imaging system can provide a side-by-side display of real-time US images and any cross-sectional images of multiplanar reconstruction of CT or MRI that synchronize real-time US. The US fusion imaging system enables us to perform radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for HCCs difficult to detect on conventional US safely. Besides, we can evaluate the treatment effects of RFA easily at the bedside by combining the contrast-enhanced US and the US fusion imaging system. Fusion images of pre- and post-RFA CT have been utilized for the assessment of the treatment effects of RFA. Although the treatment effects of RFA have been conventionally evaluated, comparing pre- and post-RFA CT side-by-side, the evaluation tends to be inaccurate. On CT fusion images, the tumor and the ablation zone are overlaid and we can grasp the positional relation easily, leading to quantitative and more accurate evaluation. The multimodality fusion imaging system has become quite an important tool for loco-regional treatment of HCC because of its usefulness for both the guidance during the RFA procedure and the evaluation of its treatment effects.
