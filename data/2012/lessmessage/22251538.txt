Background/aims:The reasons for persistent HBV infection are unknown, but they are probably related to host immune factors. IL-1ß plays significant roles in inflammation and immune defense via IL-1RAcP. We investigated whether genetic polymorphisms of IL-1ß and IL-1RAcP genes are associated with persistent HBV infection and the presence of HCC.Methodology:We enrolled a total of 292 patients with chronic HBV infection (111 with chronic hepatitis, 95 with liver cirrhosis and 86 with HCC) and 107 healthy individuals who recovered from HBV infection. We assessed 28 SNPs in IL- 1ß and IL-1RAcP genes by using Illumina's Sentrix array matrix chip.Results:IL-1ß-2023 C allele, IL-1RAcP -8261 T allele and -8183 A allele were significantly associated with persistent HBV infection (OR=1.63, p=0.03, OR=0.64, pConclusions:The genetic polymorphisms of IL-1ß-2023 C allele, IL- 1RAcP -8261 T allele and -8183 A allele are probable host factors for persistent HBV infection.
