Background and objectives:The recipients of liver transplantation (LT) are subjected to lifelong immunosuppression with its many drawbacks. De novo and recurrent malignancy in transplant recipients are attributed to attenuation of immunosurveillance. In the present study, we present our experience with de novo malignancies encountered after both deceased and living donor liver transplantations.Design and setting:Retrospective study of patients referred to LT center between April 2001 and January 2010.Patients and methods:Various data were collected including type of malignancy and histopathologic features, immunosuppression regimen, and patient survival.Results:Of 248 LT procedures performed in 238 patients (10 retransplants), 8 patients (3.4%) developed de novo post-LT malignancies. De novo malignancies included post-LT lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) in 5 patients who were all Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive, and who were treated successfully with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy, reduction of immunosuppression, and control of EBV activity; urinary bladder cancer in 1 patient who was treated with radical surgical resection and chemotherapy but died of bone and lung metastasis within 1 year of diagnosis; endometrial carcinoma in 1 patient who was treated with radical surgical resection; and Kaposi sarcoma in 1 patient who was successfully treated with surgical excision and reduction of immunosuppression.Conclusion:EBV-associated PTLD is the most frequently encountered de novo malignancy after LT and is easily treatable by chemotherapy and reduction of immunosuppression.
