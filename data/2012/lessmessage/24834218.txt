Aim:This study was designed to evaluate the frequency of antibody against these viruses in individuals attending the endoscopy ward of Taleghani hospital Tehran, Iran.Background:Blood-borne viruses such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus and HTLV-1 virus are among the world's public health problems. Hepatitis viruses cause liver problems and HTLV-1 infection can lead to adult T-Cell lymphoma (ATL).Patients and methods:Blood samples of 219 individuals attending the endoscopy ward of Taleghani hospital between years 2009-2011 were collected. A questionnaire containing demographic data was completed for each subject. Blood samples were tested for antibody against HTLV-1, HCV and HBc by ELISA (Dia.pro Italy). In case of positive results for anti-HBc, samples were also tested for HBs Ag antigen.Results:Ninety two subjects were male and 127 were female. Mean age of the population was 39.87 Â± 16.47. None of the subjects had anti-HCV antibody, while 4 of them had anti-HTLV-1 antibody and 26 anti-HBc antibody; which only two of these individuals had HBs Antibody.Conclusion:The results of this study show that frequency of anti-HCV and anti-HTLV-1 antibodies are very low, while the frequency of anti-HBc was higher in the population. Since HTLV-1 is the causative agent of a type of blood cancer, it seems that screening of donated bloods in this region should be considered.
Frequency; HTLV-1; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis C virus.
