Background/aims:To investigate the effectiveness and safety of vascular exclusion by preserving tumor-contralateral branch of hepatic artery in hepatectomy in treatment liver cancer with cirrhosis.Methodology:The clinical data of 10 cases treated with hepatectomy for liver cancer were analyzed retrospectively. Vascular exclusion by preserving tumor-contralateral branch of hepatic artery was applied to control bleeding. Blood loss, operative time and postoperative hepatic function were observed.Results:The average blood loss was 515mL, the operative time was 191 minutes and the mean time of exclusion was 30.20 minutes. There is no significant difference between hepatic function (serum total bilirubin, alanine transaminase) of postoperative day 7 and that of pre-operation.Conclusions:Vascular exclusion by preserving tumor-contralateral branch of hepatic artery could effectively control bleeding and preserve hepatic function and is proved to be applicable to patients of liver cancer with cirrhosis.
