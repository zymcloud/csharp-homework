Diagnostic difficulties, serious prognosis and often insufficient response to treatment are all common features of pulmonary complications in solid organ recipients. Some of these complications need invasive diagnostic procedures and surgical treatment or prolonged pharmacological treatment. Tuberculosis, Pneumocystis and fungal infections are examples of infectious complications. Primary lung cancer or metastasis to the lungs developed shortly after solid organ transplantation are oncological complications. Infectious and noninfectious complications are connected with immunosuppression. Treatment of pulmonary complications in solid organ recipients and continuation of immunosuppression therapy can be challenge for therapeutic team. This article presents five cases (2 women and 3 men) of solid organ recipients treated in department of the authors due to lung neoplasms. Four of them were liver recipients and one was recipient of heart. Three patients were treated due to primary lung cancer, additionally in one of them metastasis of lung cancer occurred, two suffered from metastasis of liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) to the lungs. Four patients underwent 6 operation: 2 lobectomies with lymphadenectomy, 1 segmentectomy with lymphadenectomy, 1 bilateral metastasectomy of HCC and 1 metastasectomy of lung cancer. In all cases of primary lung cancer pathological examination revealed squamous cell carcinoma. Immunosuppression schedule, perioperative courses and infectious complications (tuberculosis, disseminated infection, infection of biliary tract, oesophageal candidiasis) in this group were described. All of them were smokers.
