Background/aims:The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the effect of age on the outcome of hepatic resection in octogenarian patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methodology:Data of 408 consecutive primary HCC patients who underwent curative hepatectomy were studied. The surgical results of the younger group (Results:Preoperative parameters, such as comorbid conditions and liver function tests, of the younger group (n=385) were comparable with those of the elderly group (n=23). Surgical data and the prevalence of postoperative complications did not differ significantly between the two groups. The long-term prognosis of the elderly group patients was almost identical to that of the younger group patients. Overall 3-year survival rates for the elderly group and the younger group were 95.7% vs. 84.8%, respectively (p=0.56). Disease-free three-year survival rates for the elderly group and the younger group were 47.2% vs. 47.7%, respectively (p=0.65).Conclusions:Hepatectomy is a viable treatment alternative with satisfactory surgical outcome for HCC even in patients aged 80 years or older.
