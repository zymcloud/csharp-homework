Background:Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays a crucial role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein-6 (LRP6) is one of the co-receptors of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and forms a signaling complex with Wnt ligand and Frizzled receptor to activate downstream signaling. However, the role of LRP6 in hepatocarcinogenesis is unclear. In this study, we examined its expression and roles in human HCC.Methodology/principal findings:Using real-time quantitative RT-PCR, we found that LRP6 was frequently (45%) overexpressed in human HCCs (P = 0.003). In vitro studies showed that ectopic expression of LRP6 increased the protein level of β-catenin. Moreover, overexpression of the full-length and constitutively active LRP6, respectively, activated the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, as shown by the TCF/β-catenin reporter assay. With regard to the effects of LRP6 overexpression in HCC cells, stable overexpression of the constitutively active LRP6 in BEL-7402 HCC cells enhanced cell proliferation, cell migration, and invasion in vitro as well as tumorigenicity in nude mice.Conclusions/significance:Our findings indicate that overexpression of LRP6 contributes to the hyperactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in human HCCs and suggest it may play a role in hepatocarcinogenesis.
