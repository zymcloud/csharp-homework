Background:A recent genome-wide association study has identified a new susceptibility locus, kinesin family member 1B gene (KIF1B), strongly associated with progression from chronic hepatitis B (CHB) to hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Chinese population, this study was carried out to explore the role of the genetic variants in KIF1B in the development of chronic hepatitis B.Methodology/principal findings:Three KIF1B polymorphisms (rs8019, rs17401924, and rs17401966) were selected and genotyped in 473 CHB patients and 580 controls with no history of CHB. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by logistic regression model. None of these three SNPs showed association with CHBs after adjusting for age and gender. Equivalence-based method analysis confirmed the absence of association. In the further haplotype analysis, three common haplotypes were observed in this study population, but no significant effect was also found for haplotypes in the progression to CHB.Conclusions/significance:This study showed the new locus identified for HCC, KIF1B, was not associated with progression to CHB, implying distinct genetic susceptibility factor contributes to the progression from hepatitis B virus infection to HCC. Nevertheless, further comprehensive analyses are warranted to dissect the mechanism.
