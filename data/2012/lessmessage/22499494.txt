Cholangiocarcinoma is the second most common primary hepatobiliary malignancy after hepatocellular carcinoma and remains among the most difficult management problems faced by surgeons. Curative surgery is achieved in only 25% to 30% of patients. Local tumor extent, such as portal vein invasion and hepatic lobar atrophy, does not preclude resection. Long-term survival has been seen only in patients who underwent extensive liver resections, suggesting that bile-duct excision alone is less effective. The majority of patients have unresectable disease, with 20% to 30% incidence of distant metastasis at presentation. Unresectable patients should be referred for nonsurgical biliary decompression, and in potential curative resection candidates the use of biliary stents should be reduced. Liver transplantation provides the option of wide resection margins, expanding the indication of surgical intervention for selected patients who otherwise are not surgical candidates due to lack of functional hepatic reserve.
