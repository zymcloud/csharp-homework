Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and the enzyme primarily responsible for its production, sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK-1), are thought to be dysregulated in multiple human diseases including cancer, multiple sclerosis (MS), diabetes, neurological diseases, fibrosis, and certain pathologies associated with impaired angiogenesis such as, age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Antibody-based techniques to identify and localize S1P and SphK-1 within cells and tissue specimens represent powerful tools not only to understand the biological role of these molecules but also to validate these unique in-class targets in multiple state diseases. Consequently, the potential applications of these molecules for therapy and diagnostic purposes are currently under investigation. Here, we describe two staining procedures for identification of S1P and SphK-1 in human frozen tissue samples and the challenges encountered in the process of localization in tissue samples of lipid molecules, such as S1P.
