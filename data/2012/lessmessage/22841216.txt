Background:Liver transplant recipients have a high risk of developing nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Some develop multiple NMSC.Methods:Patients with a follow-up of >1 year have been prospectively followed to detect NMSC. We studied the risk of developing >1 NMSC.Results:After a follow-up of 2658 patient-years (mean, 8.5 years per patient), 59/312 (19%) patients were diagnosed with NMSC. Twenty-five had >1 NMSC. The 5-year risk of developing 1 NMSC, >1 NMSC, and a subsequent NMSC (a new NMSC after a first one) were 15%, 5.5%, and 46.5%, respectively. Age >60 years and transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma were independently associated with a higher risk of developing >1 NMSC.Conclusion:NMSC are frequent complications after liver transplantation and they may show a high rate of recurrence. Older age and hepatocellular carcinoma were related to the development of multiple NMSC.
