The article discusses the practice of detoxication therapy to minimize undesirable toxic effects during chemo- and radiotherapy for locally advanced cancer of the oral mucosa in 88 patients treated with 1.5% solution of reamberine. There was a significant improvement in the parameters of liver function, as well as in the general wellbeing of patients. We analyzed the main symptoms of the toxicity of chemo- and radiotherapy in both groups. Inclusion of the reamberine solution as supportive therapy for cancer patients who were receiving chemo- and radiotherapy for cancer of the oral mucosa allowed reducing the number and severity of toxic complications.
