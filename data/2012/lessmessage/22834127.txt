The efficiency of using high-density lipoproteins (HDLPs) as the transport form of an antineoplastic drug daunorubicin (rubomycin hydrochloride, daunoxome) has been shown on the culture of HA-1 hepatoma cells of mice. The use of HDLPs in a complex with daunorubicin led to an increase in the efficiency of drug transport and cytotoxic action with respect to tumor cells in comparison with hepatocytes of healthy animals.
