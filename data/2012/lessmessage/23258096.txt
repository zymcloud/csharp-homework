Objectives:The aim of this study was to examine whether interferon-α (IFN-α) therapy may reduce the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and to determine its effect based on responsiveness to IFN-α therapy.Methods:A total of 641 biopsy-proven CHB patients were treated with IFN-α2b. They were followed by biochemistry and/or imaging studies at 3- to 6-month intervals for a median period of 113 months (range 6-222).Results:HCC was detected in 22 patients and 5- and 10-year cumulative occurrence rates were 0.4 and 3.2%, respectively. In univariate analysis, age (p Conclusion:The results suggest that the biochemical but not virologic response to IFN-α therapy reduces independently the occurrence of HCC in patients with CHB.
