Background:Centrally located large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a difficult issue in surgery. These HCCs can be treated by hemi-/extended or central hepatectomies. The aim of this study was to analyze the results of hemi-/extended and central hepatectomies.Methods:One hundred and four patients with centrally-located large tumors were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into group 1 (n = 41) with hemi-/extended hepatectomies, and group 2 (n = 63) with central hepatectomies. Characteristics were analyzed between groups and survival rates were calculated.Results:Parenchyma resection was limited in group 2. The resection margin in 92.6% of group 2 patients was Conclusion:Hemi-/extended and central hepatectomies have comparable complication rates and long-term survival rates for patients with centrally located large HCC. Cirrhosis, the AST level and resected liver weight were independent factors determining long-term survival.
