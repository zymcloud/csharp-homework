Antineoplastic effect of hydrogel dextran phosphate, hydrogel prospidin, and prospidin in an injectable preparation has been assessed using Seidel ascites hepatoma as a model. Injectable and hydrogel prospidin in doses from 250, 500 to 1000 mg/kg and hydrogel phosphate dextran in doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg were administered to rats intraperitoneally in a single dose in a volume of 1 or 2 ml per each 100 g of animal body weight. The study has shown that irrespective of rats with Seidel ascites hepatoma and significantly increase in the dosage of prospidin preparations and hydrogel dextran phosphate results in a longer average life expectancy of rats Compared with its injectable variant, hydrogel prospidin appears to produce more than twice as high antineoplastic effect, and is found to provide prolonged therapeutic effects, as well as cure of animals in more than 60 % of cases.
