We present a rare case of incidentally found mobile thoracolithiasis in a 76-year-old cirrhotic patient on serial computed tomography scans performed before and after transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma. Mobility and calcification are the important clue to diagnosing this benign condition and avoiding unnecessary surgery.
