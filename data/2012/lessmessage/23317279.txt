Aims:We aimed to analyze the phenotype of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and non-tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (NILs) in HCC and non-tumor tissues, and evaluate relationships between changes in these cells and the prognosis of HCC.Methods:Lymphocytes were isolated from HCC and corresponding non-tumor tissues and tested by flow cytometry. For comparison, clinical parameters were analyzed.Results:Compared with the non-tumor tissue, tumor tissue had a lower intensity of NK, NKT and CD8+T cell infiltration. TILs had higher intensity of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+regulatory T cell (Treg cells) infiltration compared with that in NILs. The prevalence of Treg cells was associated with fewer CD8 + T lymphocytes in the HCC immune microenvironment. The frequencies of NK cells and CD8+T cells in TILs of HCC patients with metastasis less than 12 months were lower than those without metastasis. However, the frequency of Treg cells was higher than those without metastasis.Conclusion:These results suggest that the frequencies of CD8+T, NK and NKT cells as well as Treg cells in the tumor tissue of HCC are significantly associated with patient survival, and could be applied as predictive indicators for HCC prognosis.
