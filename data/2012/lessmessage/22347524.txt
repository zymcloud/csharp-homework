The PRL-1 and PRL-2 phosphatases have been implicated as oncogenic, however the involvement of these molecules in human neoplasms is not well understood. To increase understanding of the role PRL-1 and PRL-2 play in the neoplastic process, in situ hybridization was used to examine PRL-1 and PRL-2 mRNA expression in 285 normal, benign, and malignant human tissues of diverse origin. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on a subset of these. PRL-1 and PRL-2 mRNA expression was also assessed in a small set of samples from a variety of diseases other than cancer. Where possible, associations with clinicopathological characteristics were evaluated. Alterations in PRL-1 or -2 expression were a frequent event, but the nature of those alterations was highly tumor type specific. PRL-1 was significantly overexpressed in 100% of hepatocellular and gastric carcinomas, but significantly under-expressed in 100% of ovarian, 80% of breast, and 75% of lung tumors. PRL-2 expression was significantly increased in 100% of hepatocellular carcinomas, yet significantly downregulated in 54% of kidney carcinomas. PRL-1 expression was correlated to patient gender in the bladder and to patient age in the brain and skeletal muscle. PRL-1 expression was also associated with tumor grade in the prostate, ovary, and uterus. These results suggest a pleiotropic role for PRL-1 and PRL-2 in the neoplastic process. These molecules may associate with tumor progression and serve as clinical markers of tumor aggressiveness in some tissues, but be involved in inhibition of tumor formation or growth in others.
