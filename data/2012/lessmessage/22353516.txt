Background/aims:LDLT may represent a valid therapeutic option allowing several advantages for patients affected by HCC and waiting for liver transplantation (LT). However, some reports show a worse long term survival and disease free survival among patients treated by LDLT for HCC than deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) recipients.Methodology:Among 1145 LT patients, 63 received LDLT. From January 2000 to December 2008, 179 patients underwent LT due to HCC, 30 (16.7%) received LDLT and 154 (86.0%) received DDLT. Patients were selected based on the Milan criteria. TACE, radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous alcoholization, or liver resection were applied as downstaging procedures, while on the waiting list.Results:Overall 3- and 5-year survival rate was 77.3% and 68.7% vs. 82.8% and 76.7%, respectively for LDLT and DDLT recipient with not significant differences. Moreover, 3- and 5- years of recurrence free survival rate was 95.5% (LDLT) vs. 90.5% and 89.4% (DDLT) and resulted not significantly different.Conclusions:LDLT guarantees same long term results than DDLT if the selection criteria of candidates are analogues. Milan criteria remains a valid candidate selection tool to obtain optimal long term results in LDLT. An aggressive downstaging policy seems to improve the long-term results in LDLT, thus LRT may be considered useful to prevent tumor progression waiting for transplantation as well as a neoadjuvant therapy for HCC. A literature detailed meta-analysis could definitely clarify if LDLT is an independent risk factor for HCC recurrence.
