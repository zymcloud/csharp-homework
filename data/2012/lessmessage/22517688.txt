Purpose:To evaluate clinical and pathological characteristics of patients with inflammatory breast carcinoma (IBC). Also, to evaluate the importance of achieved clinical and pathological responses to induction chemotherapy (iCT) and their role in the prognosis of IBC.Methods:The medical records of 81 female patients with stage IIIB IBC, diagnosed between January 2008 and December 2010 at the Institute for Oncology and Radiology of Serbia (IORS) were evaluated. Almost all of the patients received anthracycline-based iCT. After 3-4 cycles of iCT, the clinical response (defined as complete response/CR, partial response/PR, stable disease/SD and disease progression/ PD) was assessed. Also, pathological response to iCT (defined as pathological complete response/pCR, near complete response/pNCR, partial response/pPR and no change/ pNC) was estimated in patients who had undergone surgery. All first metastatic sites were recorded.Results:Clinical CR/PR was observed in 61.8% of the patients, while the pathological response (pCR, pNCR/near complete response, and pPR) rate in patients who had undergone surgery was 70%. During follow-up 22 (27.2%) patients developed PD (8 responders and 14 non-responders). Most common metastatic sites were the skeleton in non-responders and the liver in responders. Central nervous system (CNS) metastases developed in 24% of non-responders while no responder developed such metastases. Non-responders had shorter OS compared to responders, but without statistical significance.Conclusion:Although the number of the patients analysed in this study is relatively small, we believe that response to iCT could be used as a prognostic marker, since patients who initially failed to respond to iCT showed a higher risk for PD with development of distant metastases, primarily in bones and CNS, and shorter survival.
