Purpose:The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether image fusion with contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and CT is effective in the pre-, intra- and post-interventional management of liver lesions during microwave or radiofrequency ablation.Methods and materials:Fifteen patients with a single hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) up to 3 cm diameter, identified on both contrast-enhanced CT (Siemens Somatom Definition AS and Definition Edge, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) and ultrasound (Siemens ACUSON S2000™ or S3000™, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) were retrospectively enrolled between July 2011 and May 2012. Either automatic registration or plane match registration was chosen on CT and ultrasound for the pre-, intra- and postinterventional management of all treated liver lesions during microwave or radiofrequency ablation. Using conventional ultrasound B-mode, CEUS and image fusion including B-mode and CEUS the detectability of the liver lesions was evaluated semi-quantitatively by comparing the image sequences in a consensus reading. Eight patients underwent radiofrequency ablation and seven patients underwent microwave ablation.Results:All patients were examined using all diagnostic ultrasound tools of the study. The results show that the procedure is easy and convenient to perform, as well as efficient. The co-registration procedure took approximately 5 to 10 minutes depending on the amount of DICOM volume-data and the habitus of the patient. The results show that the use of image fusion with CT and contrast-enhanced ultrasound could improve the diagnostic assessment capabilities in comparison to the examination without image fusion in the pre-, intra- and postinterventional management of malignant liver lesions during thermal ablation.Conclusion:Percutaneous thermal ablation guided by contrast-enhanced ultrasound and image fusion seems to be an efficient approach for malignant liver lesions especially if these are not clearly demarcated by B-mode. The use of the image fusion technique in the pre-, intra- and postinterventional management can increase operator confidence, the accuracy of the procedure, and technical success in real time.
