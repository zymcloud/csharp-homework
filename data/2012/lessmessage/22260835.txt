We present the case of one 58-year-old man with advancd hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatitis-B virus-related liver cirrhosis who received hepatic cryoablation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple liver tumors and the diameter of the largest tumor was more than 10cm. The patient received 2 percutaneous cryoablations in December 2009 and January 2010. Ten months later, MRI showed that not only the treated areas underwent necrosis but also the non-treated area decreased. The a-fetoprotein (AFP) level and the frequency of circulated regulatory T cell (Treg) before treatment were 13,800ng/mL and 15.6%, respectively. Following the cryoablations they dropped to 436ng/mL and 7.6%, respectively, 10 months later. The patient remains in good condition until now.
