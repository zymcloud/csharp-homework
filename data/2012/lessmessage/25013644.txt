Background:Sox17 is a member of the Sry-related high mobility group (HMG) of transcription factors that is necessary for endodermal formation and liver development in multiple species. Sox17 gene expression is required for formation of definitive endoderm that gives rise to various tissues.Objective:To examine the expression of Sox17 in various human tissues and cells.Methods:Semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to evaluate the expression of Sox17 in adult liver, small intestine, spleen, placenta, fetal liver as well as embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and human HepG2 hepatoma cell line.Results:Low Sox17 gene expression was observed in ESCs. However, there was no expression of Sox17 in human placental tissue, small intestine, adult liver, spleen, and HepG2 cells. But its expression in human fetal liver was very high.Conclusion:The data presented in this study reflect the differential expression pattern of Sox17 in the fetal development during early mammalian endodermal formation which is temporal and tightly regulated.
