The effect of oral supplementation of α-lipoic (LA) on growth of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells (EACs) and hepatic antioxidant state in mice was investigated. The results revealed that α-lipoic (LA) acid at 50 mg/kg body wt reduced the viability and volume of EAC cells and increased the survival of the treated animals. In addition, LA normalized oxidative stress in liver of mice-bearing EAC cells evidenced by increasing the levels of total thiols, glutathione, glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalyse. On the other hand, significant decreases in the levels of malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl were demonstrated in liver indicating controlled oxidative stress in these animals. As a consequence, LA regulated liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase. The data also indicated the efficiency of LA as cancer inhibitor and therapeutic influence. In conclusion, the present data suggest LA as a potential therapeutic complement in the treatment or prevention of different pathologies that may be related to an imbalance of the cellular oxidoreductive status associated with malignancy.
