Objective:To investigate whether the low-tube-voltage (80-kVp), intermediate-tube-current (340-mAs) MDCT using the Iterative Reconstruction in Image Space (IRIS) algorithm improves lesion-to-liver contrast at reduced radiation dosage while maintaining acceptable image noise in the detection of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) in thin (mean body mass index, 24 Â± 0.4 kg/m(2)) adults.Subjects and methods:A phantom simulating the liver with HCC was scanned at 50-400 mAs for 80, 100, 120 and 140-kVp. In addition, fifty patients with HCC who underwent multiphasic liver CT using dual-energy (80-kVp and 140-kVp) arterial scans were enrolled. Virtual 120-kVP scans (protocol A) and 80-kVp scans (protocol B) of the late arterial phase were reconstructed with filtered back-projection (FBP), while corresponding 80-kVp scans were reconstructed with IRIS (protocol C). Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of HCCs and abdominal organs were assessed quantitatively, whereas lesion conspicuity, image noise, and overall image quality were assessed qualitatively.Results:IRIS effectively reduced image noise, and yielded 29% higher CNR than the FBP at equivalent tube voltage and current in the phantom study. In the quantitative patient study, protocol C helped improve CNR by 51% and 172% than protocols A and B (p Conclusion:CT using the low-tube-voltage, intermediate-tube-current and IRIS help improve lesion-to-liver CNR of HCC in thin adults during the arterial phase at a lower radiation dose when compared with the standard technique using 120-kVp and FBP.
