Objective:The objective of the study was to determine the value of addition of hepatobiliary phase to dynamic gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA)-enhanced imaging for the detection of focal liver lesions (nodules with diameter â‰¤3.0 cm).Methods:Routine nonenhanced magnetic resonance images were obtained in 25 patients with focal liver lesions suggested by ultrasonography and/or computed tomography.T1-weighted dynamic gradient-echo images were acquired immediately and 100 minutes after bolus injection of Gd-BOPTA. The number of the lesions detected by T1-weighted imaging, T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced, and delayed hepatobiliary-phase imaging was counted, respectively. Contrast-to-noise ratios were measured for all the sequences including delayed hepatobiliary-phase imaging. The signal intensity and morphologic features of liver parenchyma and lesions were recorded and analyzed.Results:There were 7 patients with hepatocellular carcinomas, 6 with hemangiomas, 7 with metastases, and 5 with cholangiocarcinomas. The delayed hepatobiliary-phase imaging showed a homogeneous enhancement of liver parenchyma and distinctive enhancement features of focal liver lesions. The delayed hepatobiliary-phase imaging was better than diffusion-weighted imaging for the detection of focal liver lesions (P Conclusion:The addition of hepatobiliary-phase imaging to Gd-BOPTA-enhanced dynamic imaging increased the sensitivity and accuracy for the detection of focal hepatic lesions.
