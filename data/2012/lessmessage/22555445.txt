Background/aims:Bile leakage is still a common cause of major morbidity after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of this study was to identify characteristics and risk factors for intractable bile leakage after hepatectomy for HCC.Methods:Risk factors for bile leakage were analyzed in 359 patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC between 2001 and 2010. The causes, management and outcomes of intractable bile leakage which needed endoscopic therapy or percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage were investigated.Results:A total of 296 patients (82.5%) underwent an anatomic hepatectomy, and a repeat hepatectomy was carried out in 59 patients (16.4%). The prevalence of bile leakage was 12.8%, and 8 patients had intractable bile leakage. An operative time â‰¥ 300 min was an independent risk factor for bile leakage after hepatectomy for HCC. The main causes of intractable bile leakage were a latent stricture of the biliary anatomy caused by previous treatments for HCC and intraoperative injury of the hepatic duct related to repeat hepatectomy.Conclusion:To help prevent intractable bile leakage, a preoperative assessment of the biliary anatomy and surgical procedures to decrease the incidence of major bile leakage should be considered for selected patients with a high risk for intractable bile leakage.
