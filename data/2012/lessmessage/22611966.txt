Objective:While gynaecological cancer patients who participate in Phase I clinical trials are not routinely considered for elective surgery because of a short life expectancy, this should not be overlooked in carefully selected responding patients.Methods/results:We describe two cases of patients with different gynaecological cancers, who received treatment within separate phase I trials, and who then proceeded to surgical resection of their cancers, resulting in complete remission.Conclusion:Surgery, when feasible, should be taken into consideration as a potential management option, even when patients are receiving treatment within a phase I trial.
