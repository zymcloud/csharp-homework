Family with sequence similarity 189, member B (FAM189B), alias COTE1, a putative oncogene selected by microarray, for the first time was here found to be significantly up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens and HCC cell lines. mRNA expression of COTE1 in HCC samples and cell lines was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR, while protein expression of COTE1 in HCC tissues was assessed by immunohistochemistry. In addition, invasion of HCC cells was observed after overexpressing or silencing COTE1. In the total of 48 paired HCC specimens, compared with the adjacent non-cancer tissues, the expression of COTE1 was up-regulated in 31 (p
