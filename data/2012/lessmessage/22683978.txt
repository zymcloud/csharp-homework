Hepatocellular carcinoma with tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium is rare and has an extremely poor prognosis. Surgery was once regarded as a contraindication, then as a palliative method to prevent emergencies such as pulmonary embolism or heart failure. With advances of imaging techniques, hepatectomy and widespread use of extracorporeal circulation, conventional viewpoint has gradually changed. For patients with adequate hepatic function reserve and no distant metastases, surgery is recommended. During the past four years, we experienced two such patients, for both of whom we simultaneously resected the hepatic tumor and tumor thrombus in the right atrium under cardiopulmonary circulation and total hepatic blood exclusion. Both of the patients survived the surgery. During the follow-up, one patient died 6 months later due to multiple lung metastases and tumor progression. The other patient experienced recurrence 4 months after surgery and underwent adjuvant treatment modalities including chemotherapy, radiofrequency ablation and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Thirty-eight months later, the patient died of multiple metastasis and hepatic failure.
