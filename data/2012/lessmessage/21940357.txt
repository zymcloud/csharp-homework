Background/aims:To identify risk factors of postoperative ascites after hepatectomy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatitis B virus associated-cirrhosis.Methodology:The data of 73 patients were reviewed in current study. Pre- and intra-operative variables were retrospectively analyzed using uni- and multi-variate analyses. The diagnostic accuracy of the predictors was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis.Results:Indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes (ICGR15) >10%, tumor size >10cm, splenectomy, middle hepatic vein (MHV) resection, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion were risk factors in univariate analysis. However, only ICGR15 >10%, tumor size >10cm and RBC transfusion showed prognostic power in multivariate analysis. ROC analysis suggested the best cut-off value of risk factors was 2.Conclusions:Our study indicated the postoperative ascites could be predicted by pre- and intra-operative variables. ICGR15 >10%, tumor size >10cm and RBC transfusion were independent risk factors for ascites after hepatectomy. Patients with two or more of the above-mentioned risk factors may suffer postoperative ascites after hepatectomy.
