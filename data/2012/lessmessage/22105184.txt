Goals:In this study the authors intended to investigate the relationship between intrahepatic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA concentrations and posthepatectomy recurrence of HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Background:High HBV-DNA level is strongly associated with HCC development in chronic HBV infection and considered to be a risk factor of HCC recurrence.Study:A total of 109 patients with HBV-associated HCC who underwent curative surgical resection were followed up every 3 to 6 months for a median of 82 months. Intrahepatic total HBV-DNA titer was measured in HCC and surrounding liver tissues using a TaqMan probe-based real-time polymerase chain reaction method. HBV-DNA titers in HCC and surrounding liver were compared in accordance with patients' clinical, radiologic, and histopathological characteristics. The relationships between HBV-DNA titers in HCC or surrounding liver tissues and cumulative HCC recurrence rates were determined.Results:Of the 109 patients, 67 (62%) showed posthepatectomy recurrence of HCC. In all patients, total HBV-DNA titers were significantly higher in HCCs than in surrounding liver tissues (P=0.019). HCC recurred more frequently in patients with higher than those with lower HBV-DNA titers in surrounding liver tissues (P=0.009). In contrast, the HCC recurrence rates were similar in patients with higher and those with lower HBV-DNA titers in HCC specimens (P=0.301). Multivariate analysis showed that tumor size >5 cm (P=0.008), the presence of portal vein thrombus (P=0.001), and high HBV-DNA titer in surrounding liver tissues (P=0.002) were independent risk factors for posthepatectomy HCC recurrence in patients with HBV-associated HCC.Conclusions:In patients with HBV-associated HCC, high HBV-DNA titer in surrounding liver rather than in the HCC itself is associated with posthepatectomy HCC recurrence after curative surgical resection.
