Background/aims:This prospective study aimed to estimate the usefulness of the hepatic extraction fraction (HEF) in the context of the pre- and postoperative evaluation of patients with hepatic tumours.Methodology:Seventy patients with colorectal metastases (n=25), hepatocellular carcinoma (n=25), cholangiocellular carcinoma (n=6), gastric cancer metastases (n=5), hemangioma (n=5) and others (n=4) were included. Thirty patients underwent hepatectomy. Child-Pugh score, prothrombin, albumin, ALT, AST, AF, LDH, total, direct and indirect bilirubin, platelet number as well as the HEF were evaluated in the preoperative period and one month after hepatectomy.Results:Preoperative evaluation of HEF values between Child-Pugh A (93.6±17.3%) and Child-Pugh B/C (n=13; 58.1±28.6%) demonstrated significant differences (p=0.001). We found a high negative correlation between the preoperative HEF and ALT (pConclusions:The HEF allows a dynamic evaluation of hepatocellular function, which is not possible with other clinical, biological and radiological methods.
