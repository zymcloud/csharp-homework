This differential diagnostic study included patients with the clinical picture of lower airwave infection and bilateral lung density. The difficulty of nosological verification of the diagnosis was due to the presence of neutropenia in a patient with liver cirrhosis and hypersplenism. Results of his clinical and X-ray examination were indicative of severe bacterial pneumonia. The absence of positive clinical effect of adequate antibiotic and antifungal therapy suggested the necessity to exclude not only common alternatives to pulmonary infiltrative changes (TB, lung cancer) but also interstitial diseases. Transthoracic lung biopsy permitted to identify one of the 7 morphological types of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, and perform its targeted corticosteroid therapy with a positive clinical result.
