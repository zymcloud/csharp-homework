The aim of this study was to evaluate the antiproliferative effect of Eucalyptus citriodora resin (ECR) on human hepatoma HepG2 cells. The results from MTT assay and LDH leakage analysis showed that water extracts of ECR (WEECR) in the dose range of 0-500 μg/ml displayed stronger cytotoxic effects on HepG2 cells than other organic solvent extracts of ECR. By flow cytometry analysis, WEECR slowed down the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase after 24 h of incubation. Moreover, WEECR treatment induced an apoptotic response in HepG2 cells. WEECR-induced apoptosis was in association with the attenuation of mitochondrial transmembrane potentials (ΔΨ(m)), increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and activation of caspase-3. In addition, WEECR contained high concentration of phenolics and flavonoids, which may be responsible for the potent cytotoxicity of WEECR on HepG2 cells. Taken together, WEECR may be a potent antihepatoma agent due to apoptosis in HepG2 cells.
