Background/aims:Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with artificial pleural effusion and/or artificial ascites has recently been recognized as a useful device for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the indication of this technique is unclear and its therapeutic efficacy is undetermined.Methodology:We decided the precise indication for the use of artificial infusion. Artificial pleural effusion was indicated for tumors located on the dorsal side of the liver surface in the right lobe. Artificial ascites were indicated for (i) tumors located on the ventral side of the liver surface in the right lobe; (ii) tumors that could not be completely visualized but located near the liver surface in the right lobe; and (iii) tumors on the liver surface and adjacent to organs.Results:The total local recurrence rates at 1 and 2 years were 4% and 22%, respectively. The estimated survival rates of 32 na√Øve patients at 1 and 3 years were 90% and 78%, respectively. The local recurrence rates of a tumor size of 3 cm at 2 years were 22% and 17%, respectively.Conclusions:RFA with artificial pleural effusion and/or ascites is effective for tumors located on the liver surface and in the hepatic dome.
