Objective:To determine whether survival outcomes of women with liver metastases from gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) have improved from the previous finding of 27% at 5 years.Study design:The Charing Cross GTN database was searched for patients with liver metastases treated between 1975 and 2007. Prognostic variables were recorded and analyzed for effect on survival.Results:Thirty-eight (1.8%) of 2,100 GTN patients had liver metastases. One patient with placental site trophoblastic tumor was excluded. In the remaining 37 cases the overall survival was 48% at 5 years. Seven patients with very advanced disease died <4 weeks after admission, and 12 late deaths occurred, 5 due to non-GTN causes (1 stroke and 4 second cancers). After exclusion of the early deaths and censoring for the non-GTN related deaths, the cause-specific survival was 68%. No prognostic variable was significant on univariate analysis. However, patients presenting >2.8 years and <2.8 years from the antecedent pregnancy had a 32% and 75% (p = 0.08) chance of long-term survival, respectively.Conclusion:The prognosis of patients with liver metastases from GTN has improved. Outcome may be best in those patients presenting within 2.8 years of the causative pregnancy and without very large volumes of disease.
