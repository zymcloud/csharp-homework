Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), previously named inflammatory pseudotumor, is a benign lesion, the exact etiology of which remains obscure; immunosuppression and infections have been speculated to be responsible for the development of pseudotumor. IMT associated with transplantation is rarely reported; we report the first case of IMT of the liver in a renal transplantation patient, who presented with symptoms of abdominal pain. The findings of computed tomography suggested hepatocellular carcinoma or liver abscess, and surgical resection was performed. The lesion was pathologically diagnosed as IMT.
