Therapeutic substances may reduce the risk of developing cancer by modulating the factors responsible for carcinogenesis. To evaluate these hypotheses, the present study was designed to investigate the modulatory effect of bioflavonoid "Hesperidin" against DMBA induced experimental breast cancer with reference to renal cell surface glycoproteins, nucleic acids, protein content, lipid profile and lysosomal enzymes. The female sprague-dawley rats were orally administered with single dose of 7, 12-DMBA to induce breast cancer and were treated with hesperidin [30 mg/kg/body weight] for a consecutive 45 days. The results revealed that there was a significant elevation in the levels of glycoproteins, nucleic acids, lysosomal enzymes and also significant alterations in macromolecules in renal tissues of cancer bearing animals. Interestingly, the altered levels of these parameters were remarkably reverted back to near normal in hesperidin treatment. The histopathological analysis of liver and kidney tissues were well supported the biochemical alterations and inevitably proves the protective role of hesperidin. It is proposed that, the effect of hesperidin during DMBA induced breast cancer could be due to the intervention strategies of hesperidin in the protein, nucleic acid biosynthesis, membrane stabilizing potentials on lysosomal compartment and inhibitory effect on cell surface glycoproteins and bio-fuel such as lipids.
