The burden of liver disease in Egypt is exceptionally high due to the highest prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) resulting in rising rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the current study was to determine the isoflavones in soy and to evaluate the protective role of soy against CCl(4)-induced liver damage in rats. Four experimental groups were treated for 8 weeks and included the control group, soy-supplemented diet (20% w/w) group, the group treated orally with CCl(4) (100 mg/kg bw) twice a week, and the group fed soy-supplemented diet and treated with CCl(4). Blood and liver tissue samples were collected for biochemical analyses and histological examination. The results indicated that protein content was 45.8% and the total isoflavones recorded 167.3 mg/100 g soy. Treatment with CCl(4) resulted in a significant biochemical changes in serum liver tissue accompanied with severe oxidative stress and histological changes. Supplementation with soy succeeded to restore the elevation of liver enzymes activities and improved serum biochemical parameters. Moreover, soy supplementation improved the antioxidant enzymes, decreased lipid peroxidation, and improved the histological picture of the liver tissue. It could be concluded that soy-protein-enriched isoflavones may be a promising agent against liver diseases.
