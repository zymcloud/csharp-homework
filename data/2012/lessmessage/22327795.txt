Objective:A phase II study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of bevacizumab and erlotinib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, and to investigate clinical and molecular predictors of outcome.Methods:59 patients with advanced HCC received 10 mg/kg i.v. of bevacizumab every 14 days and 150 mg p.o. of erlotinib daily. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) at 16 weeks. Clinical characteristics and plasma biomarkers expression levels were analyzed.Results:PFS at 16 weeks was 64% (95% CI 51-76): 14 patients achieved partial response (24%), 33 had stable disease (56%), 6 progressed (10%), and 6 were not evaluable (10%). Median overall survival was 13.7 months (95% CI 9.6-19.7), and median PFS was 7.2 months (95% CI 5.6-8.3). Grade 3-4 adverse events included fatigue (30%), diarrhea (17%), hypertension (14%), elevated transaminases (12%), and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (10%). High plasma angiopoietin-2, epidermal growth factor receptor, and endothelin-1, and lack of acneiform rash were associated with poor outcome.Conclusions:The combination of bevacizumab with erlotinib achieved encouraging results in patients with advanced HCC. Current correlatives may help to guide future HCC studies.
