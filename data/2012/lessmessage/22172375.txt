Background/aims:To evaluate the prognostic value of surgical operation-related factors in patients with primary liver cancer (PLC).Methodology:A retrospective study was carried out analyzing the data of 114 patients with PLC undergoing hepatic resection from January 2002 to December 2009. Survival rates were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank tests were employed to compare the survival rates observed in those patients with surgical operation-related factors (e.g. operation method, time, portal blockage, complications, resection margin, amount of intraoperative blood loss and amount of blood transfusion), and bivariate correlation analysis was used to examine the associations of these surgical operation-related factors.Results:Intraoperative blood loss, amount of blood transfusion and operation time were significant predictors for patients with PLC after hepatic resection (p0.05). There was a positive correlation between intraoperative blood loss, amount of blood transfusion, portal blockage time and operation time, in addition, a negative correlation was found between resection margin and the operation method.Conclusions:Hepatic surgery can improve the patients prognosis if the operation time is shortened, and the amount of intraoperative blood transfusion and blood loss lessened.
