Invasion by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been reported to occur via the up-regulation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB). Sorafenib can improve the overall survival in patients with HCC, however, the association of its inhibitory mechanisms with the inactivation of NF-κB remains unclear. Here, Huh7 cell line transfected with NF-κB-luc2 vector was used to study the effects of sorafenib on NF-κB activity, on expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which were induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). TPA increased the NF-κB activity and the expressions of MMP-9 and VEGF significantly, but its effects were suppressed by sorafenib in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results were found with PD98059, an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Furthermore, transfection of Huh7 cell with an inhibitor of kappaB-α mutant vector, led to reduced TPA-induced MMP-9 and VEGF mRNA expressions. Sorafenib inhibits TPA-induced MMP-9 and VEGF expressions via the suppression of ERK/NF-κB pathway in HCC cells.
