Serum markers are needed to be developed to specifically diagnose Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Des-Î³-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) is a promising tool with limited expense and widely accessibility, but the reported results have been controversial. In order to review the performance of DCP for the diagnosis of HCC, the meta-analysis was performed. After a systematic review of relevant studies, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios (PLR and NLR, respectively) were pooled using a bivariate meta-analysis. Potential between-study heterogeneity was explored by meta-regression model. The post-test probability and the likelihood ratio scattergram to evaluate clinical usefulness were calculated. Based on literature review of 20 publications, the overall sensitivity, specificity, PLR and NLR of DCP for the detection of HCC were 67% (95%CI, 58%-74%), 92% (95%CI, 88%-94%), 7.9 (95%CI, 5.6-11.2) and 0.36 (95%CI, 0.29-0.46), respectively. The area under the bivariate summary receiving operating characteristics curve was 0.89 (95%CI, 0.85-0.92). Significant heterogeneity was present. In conclusion, the major role of DCP is the moderate confirmation of HCC. More prospective studies of DCP are needed in future.
