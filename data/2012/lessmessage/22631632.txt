Objective:To determine the killing effects on extracorporeal HepG2 cells under different temperatures, pressures of permeability and lengths of treatment time.Method:According to different temperatures, pressures of permeability and lengths of treating time, extracorporeal HepG2 cells of human hepatoma cell-line were grouped to 80 groups. Cell index (CI) as the measurement of killing effect were calculated by monotetrazolium (MTT) methods, i.e., CI = 1 - (the OD value in treated group - the OD value in blank control group)/(mean of untreated control group - mean of blank control group). According to the factorial design, data were fed into SPSS 10.0 and analyzed by three-way ANOVA (analysis of variance).Result:Temperature, pressure of permeability and length of treating time all had effects on the CI (cell index) level. Length of treating time was the most influential factor of the three. Additionally, any two of them all had statistically significant interactive effects on the CI level. When treated for 5-30 min, destilled water at 46 degrees C stably generated the highest CI.Conclusion:The "46 degrees C-destilled water-60 min" was considered as the optimal combination of conditions which lead to highest CI. We suggest exerting celiac lavage for 15 min with stilled water at 40 degrees C-43 degrees C in surgical practice as a hyperthermia treatment to achieve ideal killing effects on free cancer cells, which is feasible, practical, and clinically effective.
