Two new lignans, named zuihonins E (1) and F (2), were isolated from the stems of Schisandra bicolor Cheng var. tuberculata Law. The structures of the new lignans were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis, including 1D, 2D NMR, and MS experiments, and their absolute stereochemistry was determined by circular dichroism spectrum. Compounds 1 and 2 did not inhibit the growth of hepatoma carcinoma cell (HepG2), lung carcinoma cell (A549), and human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) cell lines.
