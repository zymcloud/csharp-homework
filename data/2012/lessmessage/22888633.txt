Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most frequent malignancies in humans. HCC therapy is not efficient and the usual outcome is poor. In this regard, novel approaches to treat and prevent HCC are urgently needed. The Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a serological marker of HCC. Recently it has been shown, that the DNA vaccines expressing AFP are capable in generating immune response against AFP. However, both, the immunization procedures and DNA vaccines used before were complex and not always very effective. We have shown that DNA vaccine encoding HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) with fused ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) degradation signal induced a strong Th-1 immune response against RT in mice. Using this approach we designed a set of novel DNA vaccines bearing AFP and ODC degradation signal. Results obtained on transfected cells demonstrated efficient expression and fast proteasomal degradation of the recombinant AFP. The anti-tumor immune response stimulation was shown in immunized animals and most importantly a notable retardation of tumor growth was observed as a result of protective vaccination.
