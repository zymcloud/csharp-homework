Background:Diabetes mellitus (DM) is closely associated with hepatocarcinogenesis. This study explores the prognostic impact of DM in patients who received curative therapy for localized hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Patients who had been diagnosed with stage I or II HCC in 2003 and 2004 and received surgical resection or local ablation therapy were identified from the population-based Taiwan National Cancer Registry. Data pertaining to DM and other comorbidities were retrieved from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database. Liver cancer-specific survival (LCS), liver disease-related survival (LDS) and overall survival (OS) rates were compared between patients with and without DM. The presence of other comorbidities and tumor status were adjusted using multivariate analysis.Results:A total of 931 patients who fulfilled the study criteria were analyzed; 185 (20%) of them had DM (type 1 or type 2). The LCS, LDS, and OS rates were significantly worse for patients with DM than patients without DM (all p Conclusions:DM is an independent factor for poorer prognosis in patients who received curative therapy for localized HCC.
