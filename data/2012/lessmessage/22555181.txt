Background:The extent of the effect of antiviral therapy and its predictors in preventing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) or B (CHB) remain unclear.Methods:We conducted a systemic review and meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies (CSs) up to December 2010. Preventive efficacy was measured as absolute reduction in 3- and 5-year cumulative incidence of HCC with antiviral therapy. Predictors for efficacy were identified by using meta-regression.Results:Twenty-two studies (5 RCTs; 17 CSs) were included for analysis. Antiviral therapy reduced 5-year cumulative incidence of HCC by 7.8% (95% CI 4.6-11.1; p Conclusion:Antiviral therapy can reduce 3- and 5-year cumulative incidence of HCC in patients with CHC or CHB.
