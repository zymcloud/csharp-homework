Purpose:To evaluate therapeutic efficacy of degradable starch microsphere (DSM)-TACE in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasonography (DCE-US) based perfusion analysis.Materials and methods:A total of 60 DCE-US examinations were performed in 15 selected patients who underwent DSM-TACE with EmboCept®S for the treatment of advanced HCC. DCE-US was performed via i.v. application of ultrasound contrast media before and 24 hours post embolization. In addition DCE-US was performed with i.a. contrast application via the angiographic catheter right before and after the embolization. Microcirculation of embolized HCC lesions was quantified using a dedicated perfusion software by two experienced radiologists in consensus.Results:Significant reduction of microvascularization (PE, WiAUC and WiR) was seen right after DSM-TACE and during 24 hour follow-up. Mean PE was 342.22 ± 97.80 prior to embolization, 59.28 ± 29.74 post embolization (p = 0.019) and 18.83 ± 7.03 during follow-up (p ≤ 0.01). Mean WiAUC was 1103.21 ± 432.05 prior to embolization 267.69 ± 151.80 post embolization (p = 0.023) and 105.10 ± 44.43 during 24 hour follow-up (p ≤ 0.01). The corresponding values for WiR were 224.91 ± 57.97 prior-, 38.14 ± 18.80 post embolization (p = 0.034) and 6.97 ± 2.68 during follow up (p ≤ 0.01).Conclusion:In this study, therapeutic efficacy of DSM-TACE in HCC using DCE-US based perfusion analysis could be demonstrated.
