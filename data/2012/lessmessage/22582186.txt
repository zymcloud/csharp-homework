Aims:The aim of this study was to test whether liver diseases of alcoholic and non-alcoholic origin cause false-positive carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) results when the particle-enhanced immunonephelometry for CDT assays is used and to assess the effect of liver disease severity on N-Latex CDT results.Methods:Blood was sampled from 245 newly admitted patients suffering from liver diseases: alcoholic and non-alcoholic cirrhosis (AC), chronic viral (B and C) and non-viral hepatitis, toxic and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), hepatocellular carcinoma and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). CDT was determined by particle-enhanced imunononephelometry using the N-Latex CDT test.Results:There were significant differences in %CDT levels between liver diseases of various etiologies. The %CDT level in AC was higher than that in chronic hepatitis (non-viral and viral C). In turn, the %CDT level in chronic hepatitis C was lower than that in toxic hepatitis. The frequency of false-positive %CDT results in liver diseases of non-alcoholic origin was 13/146, and was highest in AIH (4/14). There were no CDT-positive results in PBC and chronic hepatitis B. The frequency of CDT-positive results in alcoholic liver diseases was 24/59 in cirrhosis and 10/34 in hepatitis. Serum levels of %CDT in cirrhotic patients are correlated with the severity of the disease assessed by the Child-Pugh score.Conclusion:We concluded that the liver diseases affect the relative but not absolute values of CDT when using the assay with the monoclonal antibodies directed against CDT. The CDT results from N-Latex CDT test reflect the severity of liver dysfunction.
