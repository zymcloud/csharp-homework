This study was conducted to retrospectively evaluate the pattern of contrast enhancement with SonoVue on gray-scale ultrasonography of hepatic angiomyolipoma (HAML). Imaging features of 33 pathologically proven HAML lesions in 33 patients who underwent baseline ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) were assessed retrospectively. All lesions were enhanced in the arterial phase and showed whole-tumor filling in. Thirty-two of 33 (97%) lesions showed early positive enhancement in the arterial phase. Twenty-three of these exhibited isoechoic or hyperechoic features in the portal phase. HAML demonstrate characteristic manifestations with SonoVue-enhanced real-time gray-scale ultrasonography.
