Design and development of novel targeted therapeutic strategies is an innovation in handling patients with solid malignancies including breast, colon, lung, head & neck or even pancreatic and hepatocellular carcinoma. For a long time, immunohistocytochemistry (IHC/ICC) has been performed as a routine method in almost all labs for evaluating protein expression. Modern molecular approaches show that identification of specific structural and numerical imbalances regarding genes involved in signal transduction pathways provide important data to the oncologists. Alterations in molecules such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER2/neu, PTEN or Topoisomerase IIa affect the response rates to specific chemotherapeutic agents modifying also patients' prognostic rates. In situ hybridization (ISH) techniques based on fluorescence and chromogenic variants (FISH/CISH) or silver in situ hybridization (SISH) are applicable in both tissue and cell substrates. Concerning cytological specimens, FISH/CISH analysis appears to be a fast and very accurate method in estimating gene/chromosome ratios. In this paper, we sought to evaluate the usefulness of FISH/ CISH analysis in cytological specimens, describing also the advantages and disadvantages of these methods from the technical point of view.
