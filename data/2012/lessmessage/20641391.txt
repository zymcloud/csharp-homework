One of the mechanisms cells use to escape the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents, such as Adriamycin, Vinca alkaloids, epipodophyllotoxins, actinomycin D, and Taxol, is to limit their presence inside the cells through the actions of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a protein encoded by the multidrug resistance (MDR-1) gene (1, 2). P-gp is an ATP-dependent transmembrane multidrug transporter that is capable of actively pumping a variety of agents out of cells. Overexpression of P-gp in tumor cells (such as renal carcinoma, hepatoma, pheochromocytoma, and colon carcinoma) leads to resistance to anticancer drugs (3). P-gp is also present in a variety of normal cells, such as intestinal mucosal cells, hepatocytes, renal proximal tubule epithelial cells, and endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (4, 5). Calcium channel blockers, cyclosporin A, and its non-immunosuppressive analog PSC 833 are MDR modulators that inhibit transport of P-gp substrates out of cells (6, 7).Sestamibi (MIBI) is a substrate for P-gp. 99mTc-MIBI has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a myocardial perfusion imaging agent for use in single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to assess the risk of future cardiac events. It is also approved as a tumor-imaging agent in breast, lung, thyroid, and brain cancers. 1-(9H-Carbazol-4-yloxy)-3-[2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)ethylamino]-propan-2-ol (carvedilol), a Î²-adrenoceptor antagonist, is also a transport substrate for P-gp with a log P of 2.0 (8). [11C]Carvedilol ([11C]CARV) was found to be not suitable as a tracer for imaging adrenoceptors in any target organ, such as the brain, heart, lungs, and spleen (9). Brain accumulation of [11C]CARV is reported to be highly sensitive to P-gp modulation by cyclosporin A (10). Therefore, [11C]CARV is being developed as a positron emission tomography (PET) agent to noninvasively study P-gp function.
