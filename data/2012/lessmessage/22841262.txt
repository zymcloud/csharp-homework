Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is a rare but significant complication, occurring in 1%-2% of cases with a mortality rate of 85%- 90%. It occurs when donor passenger lymphocytes mount an alloreactive response against the host's histocompatibility antigens. It presents as fever, rash, and diarrhea with or without pancytopenia. Between March 2002 and September 2011, among 656 OLT patients 1 (0.15%) had acute GVHD. A biopsy at the 7th posttransplantation month revealed chronic GVHD. Consequently, in the cases that had fever, rash, and/or desquamation of the any part of body after liver transplantation, GVHD must be considered and skin biopsies must be planned for the diagnosis.
