Despite, new diagnostic and treatment techniques, the wide majority of patients are still diagnosed too late and only from 5% to 10% of patients are qualified for tumour surgical resection. Up to date, treatment for advanced, inoperable liver tumors includes systemic chemotherapy, sorafenib therapy and selective, local arterial injection of chemotherapeutic drug into tumour vessels with simultaneous vessel closure - transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE). Beceause of recent development of palliative treatment techniques, the treatment guidelines are changed, especially in advanced stage disease with HCC. Unfortunately, too low percentage of patients is qualified for this type of treatment. We present a case of a patient suffering from advenced stage hepatocellular cancer treated with palliative chemoembolisation using microspheres. In whom, after treatment, regression of the tumor was observed and patient was referred to radical surgery.
