Background/aims:Our aim was to compare the postoperative outcomes of partial hepatectomy using Pringle maneuver and selective main portal vein clamping.Methodology:From January 2004 to December 2006, 169 consecutive patients received liver resection by the same surgical team. The surgical techniques were the same for all patients except for the hepatic vascular inflow occlusion techniques during liver parenchymal transection. Patients either received clamping of the portal triad (PTC group, n=118) or selective main portal vein clamping (PVC group, n=51).Results:Operative time to carry out PVC was significantly longer than PTC (110.6±21.8 vs. 129.6±29.8min), however intraoperative blood loss was the same. There was no significant difference in operative mortality or morbidity rates, although the liver function recovered quicker in the PVC group. Significantly more patients in the PTC group developed HCC recurrence at postoperative one year than the PVC group (60.2% vs. 33.3%). There was no significant difference in overall survival between the 2 groups. Univariate analysis showed that clamping method, tumor size and BCLC grade were risk factors for disease-free survival (DFS) at one year, and multivariate analyses demonstrated clamping method and AFP level as independent risk factors for DFS.Conclusions:Patients subjected to selective portal vein clamping did better than those to Pringle maneuver in the postoperative outcomes. The underlying mechanism may be I/R injury of the liver remnant which might also contribute to an increase in tumor recurrence after liver resection.
