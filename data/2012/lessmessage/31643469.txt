Axitinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor selective for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors -1, -2 and -3 that is used in the therapy of advanced renal cell carcinoma. Axitinib therapy is commonly associated with transient elevations in serum aminotransferase that are generally mild and asymptomatic. Axitinib has yet to be linked to instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury.
