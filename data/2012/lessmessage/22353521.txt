Background/aims:To clarify the clinical benefits of the maneuver in right-side hepatectomy.Methodology:Eighty-one patients with liver tumor (54 hepatocellular carcinoma, 17 metastatic liver tumor and 10 other tumors) treated with a right-side hepatectomy were prospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into the following three groups: a conventional approach (group A, n=21); liver dissection under the hanging maneuver after liver mobilization (group B, n=19) and liver dissection under the hanging maneuver prior to liver mobilization (group C, n=41).Results:The liver hanging maneuver was safely performed in all the patients in groups B and C. Tumor size had a significantly positive correlation with the amount of intraoperative blood loss (R=0.52, pConclusions:Liver hanging maneuver is a safe procedure, which can decrease intraoperative blood loss and administration of blood product in right-side hepatectomy.
