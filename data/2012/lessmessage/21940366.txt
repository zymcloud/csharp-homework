To dissect portal vein branches directly and encircle them separately is a common procedure that is performed to control back flow bleeding during operations for hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombosis. However, this technique has an increased risk of injuring contralateral portal branches and disseminating thrombosis fragments to the remnant liver. We present an alternative technique using right-sided glissonian pedicle occlusion for hepatocellular carcinoma with left portal vein tumor thrombosis due to complex anatomical vasculatures of the hepatic pedicle. This technique would be very useful for liver resection of hepatocellular carcinoma with the major type of portal vein tumor thrombosis.
