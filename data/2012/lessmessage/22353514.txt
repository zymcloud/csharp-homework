Background/aims:Portal vein embolization (PVE) extends the resecability of liver tumours.The issue of PVE is an insufficient growth of the liver parenchyma or a tumour progression in some patients. We evaluated the effect of the volume and the number of liver tumours on the effect of PVE.Methodology:PVE was performed in 40 patients with liver tumours due to an insufficient future remnant liver volume. The number and the volume of the tumours were evaluated and compared with the final PVE effect.Results:In patients without any increase of the liver volume after PVE (n=3) the number and the volume of the tumours before PVE were 2.7±2.1 and 2205.1±2432.7mm3, respectively. In patients with sufficient growth of the liver (n=22) it was 3.8±2.2 (NS) and 1164.9±1392.1mm3 (NS), respectively. In patients with tumour progression (n=11) it was 5.6±2.2 and 6971.4±5189.5mm3, respectively (p<0.04 and p<0.005, respectively). Four patients were treated by radiofrequency ablation only due to worsening of their health state. Patients with >4 foci (OR 4.7) and a tumour volume >400mm3 (OR=13.0) had a higher probability of cancer progression or insufficient growth of the liver tissue. Patients with <6 foci and a tumour volume <3100mm3 had an 87.5% probability of a successful liver hypertrophy after PVE.Conclusions:The tumour number and volume were crucial for progression of a malignant disease and growth of the liver parenchyma after PVE.
