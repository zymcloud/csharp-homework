We have reported here that the ameliorative potentials of D-Pinitol during 7, 12-Dimethylbenz [a] anthracene induced experimental breast carcinogenesis. DMBA is a potent organ specific carcinogen which is widely employed to induce mammary carcinoma in rats. D-Pinitol a natural inositol has been reported to found in soybean with many biological functions. The female sprague dawley rats were subjected to carcinogen 7, 12-DMBA and the ameliorative potentials of dietary compound D-Pinitol was investigated with reference to cell surface glycoproteins, lysosomal enzymes and adenosine triphosphatases. Interestingly, administration of D-Pinitol was found to be significantly down regulated the breast tissue glycoproteins and lysosomal enzymes and in contrast the levels of adenosine triphosphatases were remarkably up regulated. Further, the biochemical changes were well reflected and evidenced in the histology of breast and liver tissues. Thus, it can be concluded from the present study that D-Pinitol efficiently attenuates the hazardous consequences of the environmental carcinogen 7,12-DMBA through modulating cell surface glycoproteins, membrane protective role both in lysosomal and ATPase compartment via its antioxidant nature which ultimately results in the findings of future innovative remedies for genotoxin mediated hazards.
