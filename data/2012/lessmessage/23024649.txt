Peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated nuclear receptors that exert in the liver a transcriptional activity regulating a whole spectrum of physiological functions, including cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis, lipid/glucose metabolism, inflammatory responses, regenerative mechanisms, and cell differentiation/proliferation. Dysregulations of the expression, or activity, of specific PPAR isoforms in the liver are therefore believed to represent critical mechanisms contributing to the development of hepatic metabolic diseases, disorders induced by hepatic viral infections, and hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma. In this regard, specific PPAR agonists have proven to be useful to treat these metabolic diseases, but for cancer therapies, the use of PPAR agonists is still debated. Interestingly, in addition to previously described mechanisms regulating PPARs expression and activity, microRNAs are emerging as new important regulators of PPAR expression and activity in pathophysiological conditions and therefore may represent future therapeutic targets to treat hepatic metabolic disorders and cancers. Here, we reviewed the current knowledge about the general roles of the different PPAR isoforms in common chronic metabolic and infectious liver diseases, as well as in the development of hepatic cancers. Recent works highlighting the regulation of PPARs by microRNAs in both physiological and pathological situations with a focus on the liver are also discussed.
