Goals:We intended to analyze the relationship between specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 alleles and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients.Study:A database of 468 consecutive CHB patients who received lamivudine for more than 12 months between July 1996 and February 2011 was retrospectively analyzed. Sera and buffy coats samples were obtained between April 2008 and April 2010. Six-digit HLA-DRB1 genotyping was performed with sequence-based typing. Serum Î± fetoprotein levels and ultrasonography or computed tomography image studies were assessed every 3 to 6 months for surveillance of HCC.Results:At baseline, median age was 43 years (range, 16 to 71) [male: 359 (76.7%); HBeAg positivity: 385 (82.3%)]. Among the 27 HLA-DRB1 alleles identified, HLA-DRB1*090102, *080302, and *070101 were the most frequent (>10%). HCC was diagnosed in 36 (7.7%) patients during the median follow-up of 69 months. The frequency of the HLA-DRB1*140101 allele was 9.0% and significantly higher in patients of the HCC group than those of the non-HCC group (19.4 vs. 8.1%, P=0.014). The 2-year, 4-year, and 6-year cumulative rates of HCC development were markedly higher in patients with HLA-DRB1*140101 than those without HLA-DRB1*140101 (2.4, 8.2, and 25.1% vs. 1.9, 4.7, and 7.4%, respectively, P=0.011). No other HLA-DRB1 alleles were associated with HCC development. Baseline clinical characteristics did not differ between patients with and without HLA-DRB1*140101.Conclusions:The HLA-DRB1*140101 allele may be potentially associated with increased risk of HCC development in CHB patients, irrespective of the replicative activity of hepatitis B virus and antiviral responsiveness.
