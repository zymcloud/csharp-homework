Objectives:The study was aimed to investigate the relationship between plasma transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β(1)) expression and the characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Five hundred and seventy-one patients with HCC were subjected. Plasma TGF-β(1) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at diagnosis and compared in accordance with clinical and radiological characteristics.Results:Plasma TGF-β(1) levels were significantly higher in the diffuse infiltrative type (n = 159) than in the nodular type of HCC (n = 412; 3.94 ± 0.34 vs. 3.79 ± 0.29 log(10) pg/ml; p Conclusion:TGF-β(1) was overexpressed in invasive types of HCC and it may be involved in the rapid progression of HCC.
