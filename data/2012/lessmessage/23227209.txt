Objective:As a candidate gene association study, we investigated the genetic association of SNPs in IL-28B genes with different outcomes of HBV infection, including LC and HCC occurrence.Methods:Chinese Han subjects were categorized into two groups: 406 LC caused by CHB and 406 HCC caused by CHB. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood samples, SNPs were detected using high resolution melting curve (HRM) method. PCR amplification was carried out under the same conditions in a 96-well plate in Real-Time PCR System. Then 341 LC and 356 HCC patients caused by HBV infection were analyzed as a verification by independent sample. 393 CHB patients and 244 health subjects were included as control.Results:CHB patients who progress to LC or HCC showed a significant different frequency in rs12979860 (p = 0.046). Patients with HCC carried more frequently the T alleles in rs12979860 comparison to LC. Same results were found in the independent sample.Conclusion:IL-28B rs12979860 C/T polymorphism T allele appears to be more prevalent in patients with HCC than in LC. Carriage of this allele seems to enhance the risk for developing HCC. Gene polymorphism of IL-28B may confer symptomatic specificity in progress and extent of hepatitis B infection.
