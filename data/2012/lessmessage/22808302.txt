Malignant tumors in the tonsils are usually primary. Metastases to the tonsils are extremely rare, with nearly one hundred cases reported. Herein we present an unusual case of palatine tonsillar metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer during chemotherapy. The patient was a 39-year-old man who was diagnosed as non-small lung cancer with IIIA4 staging and poor differentiated histology. After two cycles of vinorelbine and cisplatin based chemotherapy, a big mass was developed in the right palatine tonsil which was pathologically confirmed as the metastasis from the lung. There was no hemorrhage and complains except moderate foreign body sensations. No cervical lymphadenopathy and distal metastases to other organs such as brain and liver was found. Because of poor overall performance status, no radiotherapy was given. The disease progressed after docetaxel treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case with palatine tonsillar metastasis from non-small lung cancer during induction chemotherapy.
