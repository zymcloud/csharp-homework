Some previous reports have already shown the characterizations of immunomagnetic reduction (IMR). The assay technology involves the utilities of biofunctionalized magnetic nanoparticles to label target biomolecules. However, the detection threshold and interference tests for IMR have not been investigated in detail. In this study, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was used as a target biomolecule. The signals for AFP solutions of various concentrations, or with interfering materials, were detected via IMR. These samples were also used for characterizing the detection threshold and interference with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results of assaying AFP level with IMR and ELISA were compared. The detection threshold for assaying AFP with IMR was found to be 3 ng/mL, which is 15 times lower than that of ELISA, and definitely suppresses false negative. For the interfering materials noted commonly in serum such as hemoglobin, bilirubin, triglyceride, and vascular endothelial growth factor, there was no detectable interfering effect when assaying AFP with IMR. Several serum samples from normal people and liver-tumor-bearing patients were used for the detections of AFP concentration via IMR. These results reveal the feasibilities of assaying AFP in blood using IMR, as well as achieving high-sensitive and high-specific assay for AFP.
