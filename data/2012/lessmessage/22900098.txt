Excessive hepatocyte apoptosis is a common event in acute and chronic liver diseases leading to loss of functional liver tissue. Approaches to prevent apoptosis have therefore high potential for the treatment of liver disease. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) play crucial roles in cell fate (proliferation, cell death) and act through heterotrimeric G-proteins. G(αi)PCRs have been shown to regulate lipoapoptosis in hepatocytes, but their role in inflammation- or bile acid-induced apoptosis is unknown. Here, we analyzed the effect of inhibiting G(αi)PCR function, using pertussis toxin (PT), on bile acid- and cytokine-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes. Primary rat hepatocytes, HepG2-rNtcp cells (human hepatocellular carcinoma cells) or H-4-II-E cells (rat hepatoma cells) were exposed to glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)/actinomycin D (ActD). PT (50-200 nmol/L) was added 30 minutes prior to the apoptotic stimulus. Apoptosis (caspase-3 activity, acridine orange staining) and necrosis (sytox green staining) were assessed. PT significantly reduced GCDCA- and TNFα/ActD-induced apoptosis in rat hepatocytes (-60%, pConclusion:Pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of G(αi)PCRs, protects hepatocytes, but not hepatocellular carcinoma cells, against bile acid- and cytokine-induced apoptosis and has therapeutic potential as primary hepatoprotective drug, as well as adjuvant in anti-cancer therapy.
