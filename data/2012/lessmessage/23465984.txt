Purpose:The purpose of the study was to detect the correlation between the time-intensity parameters of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and the clinical prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 73 HCC patients were analyzed with the time-intensity curve of CEUS. The expression of vascular endothelial factor (VEGF) and CD34 in different differentiation-staged HCC specimens was observed using immunohistochemistry.Results:A positive correlation was found between the VEGF expression and microvessel density. The time-intensity parameters were not correlated with the HCC size.Conclusions:CEUS time-intensity parameters are inducive for assessing the prognosis of HCC with revealed intratumoral microvessel perfusion in different differentiation stages.
