Background:New drugs are needed to combat HBV infection. We investigated the anti-HBV activity of the deoxycytidine analogue FNC, which has anticancer activity and has been found to inhibit HCV replication.Methods:In this study, a human hepatoma HepG2.2.15 cell culture system and duck HBV (DHBV) infection model were used as the in vitro and in vivo models to evaluate the anti-HBV activity of FNC.Results:In the cell model, FNC effectively suppressed the secretion of the HBV antigens in a dose-dependent manner, with 50% effective concentration values of 0.037 μM for hepatitis B surface antigen and 0.044 μM for hepatitis B e antigen on day 9. Consistent with the HBV antigen reduction, FNC also reduced the HBV DNA level by 92.31% and 93.90% intracellularly and extracellularly, respectively. DHBV DNA levels were markedly reduced after treatment with the FNC at 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg•day dosages. The inhibition rate of FNC at the dose of 2.0 mg/kg•day reached 91.68% and 81.96%, in duck serum and liver, respectively, on day 10. Furthermore, significant liver histology restoration after FNC treatment was observed, as evaluated by the histopathological analysis.Conclusions:FNC can evidently inhibit the replication of HBV in the HepG2.2.15 cell line in vitro and inhibits DHBV replication in ducks in vivo. It could be potentially developed into a new anti-HBV drug.
