Background:The hepatocellular carcinoma is very common in China. Our aim in this report was to investigate clinical and pathological factors based on the current decade data that could influence prognosis of HCC patients after hepatectomy.Methods:Between 2002 and 2009, all patients undergoing hepatectomy for HCC were followed up and reviewed retrospectively. Prognostic factors were studied by univariate and multivariate analysis, with Kaplan-Meier and Cox multivariate survival analyses.Results:Complete clinicopathologic and follow-up data were available for 114 patients. The estimated cumulative survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 yr were 84.6%, 60.2% and 51.8%, respectively. On univariate analysis, key prognostic factors were AFP level, GGT level, tumor size, number of tumors, portal vein invasion, liver cirrhosis status and TNM stage. In the multivariate analysis, tumor size, GGT level, liver cirrhosis status and portal vein invasion were significantly associated with patients' prognosis.Conclusion:Through follow-up of a relatively large cohort of Chinese patients, tumor size, GGT level, liver cirrhosis status, portal vein invasion were revealed as important factors for long-term survival after hepatectomy. Early diagnosis for tumor and the improvement of liver function before surgery are important ways to improve the prognosis.
