Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) is a transferase, which is of great importance in sustaining intracellular cysteine and glutathione levels. The abnormal expression of GGT is significantly associated with features of many metabolic syndromes (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma). Therefore, it is essential to develop methods to detect GGT so as to monitor the physiological or pathological phenomena related to this species. In this work, by making use of a complex formed by Cu(2+) and glutathione, which may exhibit excellent voltammetric response, we have proposed a novel potential electrochemical method for the detection of the enzyme. Results show that in the presence of GGT, the formation of Cu(2+)-glutathione complex on a working electrode will be disrupted, resulting in greatly depressed electrochemical signals. The primary method exhibits some advantages, such as it being fast, cost-efficient, and conveniently operated. It also has the potential to be further developed as an effective method in the quantitative detection of GGT in real samples.
