Aim:XRCC1 and XPD are two major repair genes involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER), which is reported to be associated with risk of several cancers. We explored the association of XRCC1 and XPD polymorphisms with the risk of HCC.Methods:A total of 410 cases with HCC and 410 health controls were collected. XRCC1 Arg194Trp, XRCC1 Arg399Gln, XPD Lys751Gln and XPD Asp312Asn genotyping was performed by duplex polymerase-chain-reaction with the confronting-two-pair primer (PCR-CTPP) method.Results:XRCC1 194Trp/Trp was strongly significantly associated with an increased risk of HCC cancer when compared with the wide-type genotype (OR=2.26, 95% CI=(1.23-5.38). Individuals carrying the XRCC1 399Gln/ Gln showed increased risk of HCC (OR=1.74, 95%CI=1.06-2.74). The XPD 751Gln/Gln and Gln allele genotype were associated with strong elevated susceptibility to HCC (OR=3.51 and 1.42, respectively).Conclusion:These results suggest that polymorphisms in XRCC1 and XPD may have functional significance in risk of HCC.
