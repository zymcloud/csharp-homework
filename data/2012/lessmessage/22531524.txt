T-cell lymphoma (TCL) is a biologically diverse and uncommon group of lymphoid malignant diseases. Compared with its B-cell counterparts, TCL is notably more difficult to diagnose and manage owing to its rarity and biologic heterogeneity. Hepatosplenic TCL is an extremely rare subtype of TCL. A 37-year-old Indian male presented to his physician with swelling and pain in left hypochondrium. Clinical examination revealed pallor, icterus and massive splenomegaly. His blood examination revealed pancytopenia. His bone marrow biopsy was suggestive of lymphoma. Whole body F-18 flourodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) scan revealed diffuse increased metabolic activity in massively enlarged spleen, liver and bone marrow. There was no evidence of metabolically active lymphadenopathy anywhere in the body. Guided by the FDG PET/CT findings, a liver biopsy was advised. Liver histopathology revealed the presence of hepatosplenic TCL. A final diagnosis of hepatosplenic TCL with liver, spleen and bone marrow involvement was made. Even though rare, hepatosplenic TCL should be considered as a possible diagnosis in patients presenting with similar clinical picture and FDG PET/CT scan findings.
