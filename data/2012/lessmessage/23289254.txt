Introduction:Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) includes 10-15% of primary lung tumors and it is very aggressive neoplasm. The aim of this study was to evaluate radiological and clinical features of SCLC and its spread.Material and methods:The retrospective analysis included 31 patients (18 women, 13 men, mean age: 68.2 +/- 8.34 years).The extensive disease (ED) in most patients was present. 25 patients (80,6%) reported habitual cigarette smoking. Localization of primary tumor, metastases, clinical symptoms and main blood abnormalities were assessed.Results:The most common locations of the primary tumor were: the lung hilus--15 (48.4%), the upper lobe of lung--6 (19.3%) and mediastinum--3 (9.7%). In most cases, mediastinal, subcarinal--both (41.9%) and hilus--(32.2%) lymph nodes were involved. Distant metastases were present in 20 patients (64.5%) at the moment of diagnosis. The most common locations of metastases were: liver--12 (60%), lungs--7 (35%), suprarenal glands--6 (30%), bones--3 (15%) and CNS--3 (15%). The most common symptoms were: cough (77.4%), weakness (51.6%), dyspnea (45.2%), chest pain (41.9%) and the weight loss (30%). Superior vena cava syndrome occurred in 4 patients (13%). The symptoms lasted an average 115 days, but the most persistent were: cough (216 days) and dyspnea (150 days). The main blood tests abnormalities were increased activities of: CRP (mean 63.4 mg/L), AspAT (65U), LDH (1852.7 U/l) and D-dimer (1892.5 microg/l).Conclusions:SCLC was mainly manifested in CT as central mass lung involving hilus or mediastinum. In most cases, distant metastases were present at the moment of diagnosis.
