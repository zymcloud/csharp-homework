Occult hepatitis B (OBI) is caused by a persistent low-level replication of HBV. Like overt HBV infection, OBI can be associated with the integration of HBV sequences into the host genome and has a substantial clinical relevance for patients who are severely immunosuppressed for long durations. We present the case of a patient with a diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and OBI who developed a hepatocellular carcinoma with a fulminant clinical course following the administration of rituximab plus CHOP.
