The objective of this study was to investigate the chemopreventive potential of (+)-catechin-rich extract of Acacia catechu heartwood (AQCE) against 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma in Balb/c mice. The levels of liver injury markers, tumor markers, and oxidative stress were measured in serum and liver tissues. Furthermore, the levels of transcription factors were measured by ELISA. Tumor incidence was found to be 100% in DMBA-treated animals (group 2), whereas, in AQCE-treated animals (group 3), it was 37.5%. AQCE treatment reduced liver injury and restored tumor-marker levels. AQCE also significantly reduced elevated levels of nitrite and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) in DMBA-treated animals. Additionally, AQCE modulated the activity of different antioxidant enzymes in liver tissues. Eventually, AQCE also significantly improved body weight, prevented the increase of relative liver weight, and maintained the liver cellular architecture within the normal range of the control. A significant increase in the protein levels of p53, c-jun, and NF-ÎºB (p65) were observed in DMBA-treated mice, whereas low levels of these markers were observed in DMBA+AQCE-treated animals. These findings strongly suggest (1) that (+)-catechin-rich AQCE exerts a chemopreventive effect by modulating the levels of lipid peroxidation and by promoting the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defense system and (2) that this effect is linked to the expression of transcription factors during hepatocarcinogenesis.
