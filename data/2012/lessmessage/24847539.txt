Objective:To present a clinical case of a 41 year-old woman, with a stage IV squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus.Methods and patients:We present a clinical case of 41 year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and resection of a haemosiderin plaque on the tongue. A space occupying lesion (SOL) was studied using ultrasound and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), detecting, but unable to differentiate, a gradually increasing haemangioma or hepatocarcinoma. She was seen at the clinic due to dysphagia and loss of weight. In oesophagogastroscopy with biopsy a squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus was diagnosed. The Computed Tomography (CT) of the neck, thorax and abdomen showed a stenosing tumour in the oesophagus with metastasis in the lungs and left adrenal gland, and a SOL in the liver compatible with a neo-formative process. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 55 mm. She was referred to Surgery and Oncology, who performed a gastrostomy for enteral feeding and started treatment with palliative chemotherapy.Conclusions:Squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus is very frequent. The two most important risk factors are alcoholism and nicotine poisoning. The dysphagia is the most common symptom (96% of the patients). The prognosis is a poor, with high mortality. Surgery is the standard treatment when the tumour is located. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are palliative treatments, but has not shown to be very effective.
