INTRODUCTION-AIM: Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) has become an important focus of patient care and clinical outcomes research with the improvement in patient and graft survival after liver transplantation (LT). The current study was designed to evaluate the post-transplant HRQOL profiles using the Liver Disease Quality of Life 1.0 (LDQOL 1.0) Questionnaire and demonstrate the possible effect of peri-transplant clinical covariates on these profiles.Material and methods:Participants included pre-transplant group (waiting-list patients n = 50) and post-transplant group (mean 5 ± 4 years after deceased or living donor LT n = 103) who were recruited from 3 specialized centers in Egypt. We applied the LDQOL 1.0 questionnaire; a 111-item containing the Short Form-36 version 2.0 (SF-36v2) as a generic component supplemented by 75 disease-specific items. The etiology of cirrhosis, co-morbidities, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), Child-Pugh class and post-operative complications were analyzed.Results:All recipients had significant higher HRQOL scores than patients in waiting-list using both questionnaire components. Recipients with pre-LT MELD ≥ 15, Child-Pugh class C, history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) demonstrated low HRQOL scores. Recipients without post-operative surgical complications had a statistically better HRQOL using the disease-specific, but not the SF-36v2 component. On the other hand, both components demonstrated non-significant lower scores in recipients with rejection episodes, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and hepatitis C recurrence had compared to those without medical complications.Conclusion:Generally HRQOL improves dramatically after LT as assessed by LDQOL questionnaire. Moreover, combined questionnaires can provide accurate information about the possible impaired HRQOL post-LT due to pre-transplant disease severity and post-operative complications.
