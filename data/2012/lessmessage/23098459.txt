This study evaluated the advantages and applications of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)-supported percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma after liver transplantation, based on clinical details. CEUS-supported percutaneous RFA was adopted to treat 12 patients with hepatic metastatic carcinomas after liver transplantation. The diameters of the metastatic carcinomas varied from 1 cm to 5 cm, and the foci were discovered after 3 months to 12 months. Each focus was diagnosed and localised by CEUS for RFA once or twice. Curative effects were evaluated by CEUS or contrast-enhanced CT after the treatment. The re-examination results at 2 weeks post-treatment showed that the foci of 11 patients were ablated completely, whereas one patient with the largest focus required retreatment by RFA because of a partial residue. No local recurrence was found one month later in the re-examination. CEUS-supported percutaneous RFA in the treatment of hepatic metastatic carcinoma after liver transplantation has the advantages of accurate localisation, good efficacy, easy operation, and minimal invasion without any complications. Therefore, it can be recommended as the preferred therapy for hepatic metastatic carcinoma after liver transplantation.
