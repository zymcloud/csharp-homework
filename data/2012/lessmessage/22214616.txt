Objective:Local recurrence after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a major problem that needs to resolved to increase the survival rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CE-US with Sonazoid(®), the second-generation contrast media, can detect smaller HCC lesions and the detection rate of ultrasonically unrecognized hypervascular HCC was improved by CE-US. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of CE-US with Sonazoid(®) in improving radicality and reducing local recurrence after RFA for HCC.Patients and methods:A total of 102 nodules treated by RFA at our hospital from January 2006 to October 2009 were enrolled: 31 nodules were treated without CE-US, since CE-US was not yet available (Group A), and 71 nodules were treated with a combination of RFA and CE-US with Sonazoid(®) (Group B).Results:The clinical characteristics (sex, virus marker, Child-Pugh grade, with or without transcatheter arterial infusion chemotherapy with lipiodol, and T factor) did not differ significantly between group A and group B. Mean age was significantly older and tumor size was significantly larger in group B. Group B had significantly better radicality compared with group A. The non-local recurrence rate was significantly higher in group B as compared with group A.Conclusion:CE-US with Sonazoid(®) greatly helps to improve RFA efficacy in HCC treatment. We suggest that the ability of CE-US with Sonazoid(®) to detect an accurate area of HCC before RFA and to immediately detect a residual tumor during RFA might contribute to an increase of the radicality and reduction of local recurrence after RFA.
