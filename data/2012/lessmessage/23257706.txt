Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary neoplasm of the liver. A major proportion of HCCs also present mutation of the gene that encodes p53, which confers chemoresistance. The main goal of this work is to investigate the effect of cisplatin, doxorubicin and 5-fluoruracil (5-FU) in three human HCC cell lines which differ in p53 expression.Methods:HepG2 (expressing normal p53), HuH7 (expressing mutated p53) and Hep3B2.1-7 (not expressing p53) cell lines were cultivated in the presence of cisplatin, doxorubicin and 5-FU. Cell proliferation was evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (MTT assay). The type of cell death and Bax and Bcl2 activation were assessed by flow cytometry.Results:It was found that for all of the cell lines studied, the agent that gave the most satisfactory results was doxorubicin. 5-FU demonstrated no activity in these cell lines.Conclusions:For all the cell lines studied, doxorubicin was the most satisfactory agent. In HepG2 and HuH7 cell lines, it can activate Bax with statistical significance.
