We conducted a case-control study in China to clarify the association between XRCC1-Arg399Gln polymorphism and HCC risk. A total of 150 cases and 158 controls were selected from the the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from May 2008 to May 2010. XRCC1-Arg399Gln polymorphism was based upon duplex polymerase-chain-reaction with the confronting-two-pair primer (PCR-CTPP) method. All analyses were performed using the STATA statistical package. A significantly increased risk was associated with the Arg/Gln genotype (adjusted OR 1.78, 95%CI=1.13-2.79) compared with genotype Arg/Arg. In contrast, the Gln/Gln genotype had non-significant increased risk of HCC with adjusted OR (95%CI) of 1.69 (0.93-2.66). A significant association was found between positive HBsAg and Arg/Gln, with an OR of 3.43 (95% CI=1.45-8.13). Patients carrying Gln/Gln genotypes showed significantly lower median survival than Arg/Arg genotypes (HR=1.38, 95% CI=1.04-1.84). Further Kaplan-Meier analysis showed decreased median survival in Arg/Gln+Gln/Gln genotype carriers in comparison to Arg/Arg carriers (HR=1.33, 95% CI=1.02-1.76). In conclusion, we observed that XRCC1-Arg399Cln polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to HCC, and XRCC1 Gln allele genotype showed significant prognostic associations.
