Background/aims:We analyzed the clinicopathological factors of patients with node-positive gastric cancer, evaluated the prognostic factors associated with long-term survival and clarified the effect of tumor size on long-term survival.Methodology:The study included 591 patients who underwent curative resection for node-positive gastric cancer. Clinicopathological prognostic variables were evaluated as predictors of long-term survival by univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:The 5-year survival rate was influenced by tumor size, tumor location, depth on invasion, level of lymph node metastasis, Borrmann classification, histological type, liver metastasis, peritoneal dissemination and disease stage. Of these, independent prognostic factors were depth on invasion and lymph node metastasis. Tumor size is an influence but not independent factor for the prediction of long-term survival in patients with node-positive gastric cancer.Conclusions:In patients with node-positive gastric cancer, two independent prognostic factors were depth on invasion and the status of lymph node metastasis.
