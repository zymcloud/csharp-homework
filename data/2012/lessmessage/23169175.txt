Background/aims:Hepatitis C is a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been widely performed as a curative treatment for small HCC. The knowledge of prognostic factors in hepatitis C patients with small HCC after RFA is therefore important.Methodology:One hundred consecutive hepatitis C patients with a single HCC3cm or less treated with RFA were enrolled. The cumulative recurrence and survival rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Prognostic factors were investigated using the Cox proportional hazard mod-el.Results:Five-year local and distant intra hepatic recurrence rates were 10.4% and 70.9%, respectively. Five-year overall survival and recurrence-free survival rates were 60.3% and 15.9%, respectively. Multivarlate analysis revealed that an age of 75 years or more[relative hazard (RH) 1.61, p=0.019] and a serum al-bumin level less than 3.5g/dL (RH 1.61, p=0.016)were significant factors for decreased overall survival. Furthermore, a serum albumin level less than 3.5g/dL (RH 1.50, p=0.003) was the only significant factor for decreased recurrence-free survival.Conclusions:This study suggests that host-related factors (age and serum albumin level) are important in predicting survival in hepatitis C patients with a single small HCC af-ter RFA.
