Background/aims:MiR-93 was observed in various types of cancers. This study is to investigate a role of miR-93 in the carcinogenesis of HCC.Methodology:The expression of miR-93 in HepG2 cells and prima-ry human hepatocytes (PHHC) was measured by RT-PCR. HepG2 cells were transfected with miR-93 inhibitor or negative control. The cell proliferation was determined by using the CellTiter 96Â® Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit. The migration and clonogenicity in vitro were measured by cell migration assay, colony formation analysis and anchorage-in-dependent growth assay. The apoptosis and cell cycle were detected by flow cytometry analysis. The mRNA and protein levels of transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor (TGFBR2) and integrin beta8 (ITGB8)were evaluated by RT-PCR and western blot analysis.Results:MiR-93 was upregulated in HepG2 cells compared with PHHC and inhibition of miR-93 significantly suppressed HepG2 cell proliferation, migration and col-ony formation. The expressions of TGFBR2 and ITGB8 were upregulated when miR-93 was inhibited.Conclusions:Our results reveal an important contribution for miR-93 in hepatocarcinogenesis and suggest a role for TGFBR2 and ITGB8 dysregulation in this process. Thus,the use of synthetic inhibitor of miR-93 may prove to bea promising approach to liver cancer treatment.
