Liver or lung biopsy for suspicious lesions has several disadvantages such as bleeding, bile leak or pneumothorax, needle track seeding, and time-consuming histopathological procedure. The ability to directly observe cellular and subcellular details and then perform "optical biopsy" is a major goal in the development of new interventional techniques. Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) enables real-time noninvasive visualization of tissue architecture and cell morphology in live tissue. We performed a study to evaluate whether MPMcan make real-time optical diagnosis for liver cancer and lung metastasis using an orthotopic rat model with Morris hepatoma. We found that real-time high-resolution MPMimaging could clearly show tissue architecture and cell morphology. In the normal liver tissue, MPMimaging clearly revealed the blood-filled sinusoids and cords of hepatocytes. In the cancerous tissue, MPMimaging clearly illustrated that cancer cells displayed marked cellular and nuclear pleomorphism. MPMimages were comparable to golden standard hematoxylin-eosin staining images. Moreover, MPMimaging had deep penetration with the capability of optical sectioning. In short, MPMcan make real-time optical diagnosis for liver cancer and lung metastasis. This study provides the groundwork for further using multiphoton endoscopy to perform real-time noninvasive "optical biopsy" for liver cancer and lung metastasis in the near future.
