Purpose:To calculate a modified heat capacity (mHC) of small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in vivo during radio frequency ablation (RFA) and to determine if mHC correlates with tumour vascularity, adjacent vessels or local recurrence.Patients and methods:This study was IRB approved and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Before formal RFA, ambient HCC temperature and temperature 1 min after heating at constant wattage were measured in 29 patients. From temperature change and wattage, individual mHCs (joules required to increase tumour temperature by 1Â° Celsius) were calculated. Pre-RFA, three-phase computerised tomography (CT) scans were reviewed blindly for hepatic arteries, hepatic veins and portal veins abutting or within 3 mm of tumour edge from which twelve vascular parameters were quantified. Tumour enhancement (homogeneous or heterogeneous on arterial phase) was also assessed. Multiple regression was used to correlate mHC with vascular parameters and tumour enhancement. Cox proportional hazard model was used to examine the relationship of mHC to local recurrence.Results:There was significant correlation of mHC with lesion enhancement (P = 0.0018), length of hepatic arteries (P Conclusion:Because the modified heat capacity of small HCCs in our study population correlated with HCC enhancement, abutting hepatic arteries, the volume of abutting hepatic veins and local recurrence, it may be an indicator of the heat sink effect (HSE) and supports the HSE as a risk factor for local recurrence.
