Background:Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in microRNA-coding genes may participate in the process of carcinogenesis by altering the expression of tumor-related microRNAs. It has been suggested that two common SNPs rs2910164 in miR-146a and rs11614913 in miR-196a2 are associated with susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, published results are inconsistent and inconclusive. In the present study, we performed a meta-analysis to systematically summarize the possible association between the two SNPs and the risk for HCC.Methodology/principal findings:We conducted a search of case-control studies on the associations of SNPs rs2910164 and/or rs11614913 with susceptibility to HCC in PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ScienceDirect, Wiley Online Library and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. Data from eligible studies were extracted for meta-analysis. HCC risk associated with the two polymorphisms was estimated by pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). 5 studies on rs2910164 and 4 studies on rs11614913 were included in our meta-analysis. Our results showed that neither allele frequency nor genotype distribution of the two polymorphisms was associated with risk for HCC in all genetic models. Similarly, subgroup analysis in Chinese population showed no association between the two SNPs and the susceptibility to HCC.Conclusions/significance:This meta-analysis suggests that two common SNPs rs2910164 and rs11614913 are not associated with the risk of HCC. Well-designed studies with larger sample size and more ethnic groups are required to further validate the results.
