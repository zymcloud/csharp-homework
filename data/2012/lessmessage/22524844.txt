The aim of the present research was to investigate clinicopathologic correlations of immunohistochemically- demonstrated axin (axis inhibition) and β-catenin expression in primary hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), in comparison with paraneoplastic, cirrhotic and normal liver tissues. Variation in Axin expression across groups were significant (P 0.05). Differences in cell membrane β-catenin expression were also statistically significant (P 0.05). Axin expression levels in tissues with reduced membrane β-catenin were low (P
