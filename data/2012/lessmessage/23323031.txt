Objective:To investigate the additional diagnostic value of color mapping of the hepatic arterial enhancement fraction (AEF) for detecting recurrent or residual hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).Materials and methods:Seventy-six patients with 126 HCCs, all of whom had undergone previous TACE, and subsequently, underwent follow-up multiphasic liver CT scans, were included in this study. Quantitative color maps of the AEF of the whole liver were created, by using prototype software with non-rigid registration. The AEF was defined as the ratio of the attenuation increment during the arterial phase to the attenuation increment during the portal phase. Two radiologists independently analyzed the two image sets at a two-week interval, i.e., the multiphasic CT image set and the second image set of the AEF color maps and the CT images. The additional diagnostic value of the AEF color mapping was determined, by the use of the jackknife-alternative free-response receiver-operating-characteristic analysis. The sensitivity and positive predictive values for detecting HCCs of each image set were also evaluated and compared.Results:The reader-averaged figures of merit were 0.699 on the initial interpretation of the MDCT image set, and 0.831 on the second interpretation of the combined image set; the difference between the two interpretations was significant (p value Conclusion:Quantitative color mapping of the hepatic AEF may have the possibility to increase the diagnostic performance of MDCT for the detection of recurrent or residual HCC without the potential risk of radiation-related hazards.
