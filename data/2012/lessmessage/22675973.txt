In this case report, the authors discuss clinical presentation, surgical procedure and early results of chemotherapy of pancreatic carcinoma with liver metastases diagnosed a few days after delivery. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma occurs infrequently in pregnant and childbearing women: only ten cases have been reported in the literature. The early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is difficult because symptoms appear when cancer is about to reach an advanced stage. In pregnancy, it is even more difficult because symptoms like dyspepsia, vomiting and epigastric pain may result confusing. The authors outline the difficulties in diagnosis and treatment of this kind of disease during pregnancy.
