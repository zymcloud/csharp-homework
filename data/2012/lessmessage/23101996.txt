We report a case of multiple primary hepatic cancers exhibiting different pathologic features coexisting in a patient with chronic hepatitis C. Computed tomography showed 2 tumors in segment 8, 20 mm (S8-A) and 5 mm (S8-B) in diameter, and a 10-mm tumor in segment 6 (S6). Based on the images, the S8-A lesion was diagnosed as cholangiocellular carcinoma or combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma (combined HCC-CC). The other 2 tumors were diagnosed as HCC. The patient underwent partial resections of segments 6 and 8. We found 2 more tumors (S8-C was 6 mm in diameter and S8-D was 4 mm) in the resected segment 8 specimen. Histopathologic examination revealed that the S8-A and S8-C tumors were combined HCC-CC, the S8-B and S6 lesions were scirrhous HCC, and the S8-D tumor was an early HCC. This is a very rare case in which different hepatic cancers with multiple pathologic features coexisted.
