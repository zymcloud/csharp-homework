Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the main malignant tumor of the liver, is very common and highly lethal. The aim of this study was to determine its clinicopathologic characteristics and risk factors in Turkey.Materials and methods:In this study, patients who were diagnosed as suffering from HCC in the period between August 2004 and December 2011 were evaluated retrospectively.Results:A total of 98 patients were included, with a median age 61 (range: 16 to 82). Seventy nine (80.6%) were male 59 (60.2%) were infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and 15 (15.3%) with HCV, another 15 (15.3%) being alcohol abusers. Seventy two (73.5%) were at advanced stage and 54 (55.1%) had elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Surgery, chemoembolization, systemic chemotherapy and application of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib were the major treatment options.Conclusions:According to our findings HCC is mostly diagnosed in advanced stage and age, being five times more common in males than females. Main risk factors of HCC are HBV infection, HCV infection and alcohol abuse. Elevation in AFP may facilitate early diagnosis of HCC in high risk groups.
