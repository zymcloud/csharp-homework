HCV is responsible for the development of chronic hepatitis C, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The Polish population is mainly dominated by genotype 1 infections, genotypes 3 and 4 are less common. Studies have shown that changes in SNPrs12979860 of human chromosome 19 affect their ability to eliminate infection both spontaneously and during the antiviral therapy. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY was to evaluate the frequency of different HCV genotype infections in the Podlasie region during the period from 2002 to 2011 and to determine the frequency of particular genes associated with rs12979860 polymorphism amongst patients both eligible for treatment and currently undergoing the treatment. METHODS. Research and evaluation of the genotypes was performed in 923 cases of HCV and in 126 cases genes rs 12.97986 were identified (97 patients infected with genotype 1, 17--genotype 3 and 12--genotype 4). HCV infection was confirmed by the detection of HCV-RNA and it's genotype in serum with RT-nested--PCR (Syngen Biotech, USA). Rs12979860 polymorphism was detected by sequencing, using PCR. The final scores were determined using 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA).Results:HCV infection was more frequent among men (60%). Genotype 1 was found in 66% of patients, genotype 3 in 27% and genotype 4 in 7% of patients. During period of 10 years slow increase of genotype 4 HCV infection prevalence was observed. Among patients infected with genotype 1 HCV waiting for the treatment and those who already completed antiviral therapy the presence of genotype C/C was found in 21%, C/T in 59% and T/T in 20%.Conclusions:The most common in Northeastern Poland is genotype 1 of HCV. There has been a slow increase of infections with genotype 4. In 79% of patients infected with genotype 1 ofHCV genotypes C/T or T/T have been found which is an adverse prognostic factor of the treatment.
