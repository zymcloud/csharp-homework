Background:The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of treatment with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization on the expression of chemokine receptors on memory T cells around tumor sites in vivo in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Blood samples from the hepatic artery and a peripheral vein were collected from 100 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma before and 4 weeks after treatment with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Mononuclear cells were isolated and examined for the expression of L-selectin (CD62L) and CXCR3 (CD183) on CD8+ T cells in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma during transcatheter arterial chemoembolization.Results:Both the frequency and number of L-selectin(low) CXCR3+ proinflammatory effector T cells in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma increased significantly following treatment versus pretreatment (61.92% ± 8.69% versus 24.45% ± 7.36%, P Conclusion:Treatment with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization may lead to an increase in L-selectin(low) CXCR3+ effector T cells in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
