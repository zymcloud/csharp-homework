Background:The chemotherapy for small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) has been adopted for advanced extrapulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas (EP-NECs). The aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy of standard SCLC regimens when used to treat EP-NECs and to compare the outcome with that for SCLC.Methods:We reviewed the medical records of 136 patients (41 with EP-NEC and 95 with SCLC) who were treated using a platinum-containing regimen for advanced disease between January 2000 and October 2008 at our hospital.Results:The primary site of the EP-NEC was the gastrointestinal tract in 18 patients (GI tract group); the liver, biliary tract or pancreas in 16 patients (HBP group), and other sites in 7 patients ('others' group). The response rate in the SCLC patients was 77.8%, and the response rate in the EP-NEC patients was 30.8% (37.5% in the GI tract group, 12.5% in the HBP group, and 57.1% in the 'others' group). The median survival time for the SCLC patients was 13.6 months, while that for the EP-NEC patients was 9.2 months (14.9 months in the GI tract group, 7.8 months in the HBP group, and 8.9 months in the 'others' group). A multivariate analysis demonstrated that a poor performance status, liver involvement, and the treatment regimen were independent unfavorable prognostic factors.Conclusion:The response rate and prognosis of the patients with advanced EP-NECs were worse than those of the patients with SCLC in this study. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, liver involvement, and treatment regimen had a larger impact on the prognosis than the primary tumor site, as demonstrated by multivariate analysis.
