Observation of 254 patients with CHC untreated by antiviral therapy during 5-10 years revealed spontaneous recovery in 60 (23.62%) cases. The clinico-biochemical parameters of CHC patients and reconvalescents from HCV infection were significantly different (e.g. anti-HCV IgM were detected in 85.52 and 5.71% respectively) which suggests seroconversion of anti-HCV antibodies in the phase of reconvalescence. The development of liver cirrhosis was documented in 27 of the 195 (13.92%) patients. Two of them had hepatocarcinoma (1.03%). There were 3 (1.55%) fatal cases due to hepatic disease. Irreversible changes in the liver developed within 18.85 years (on he average) after the onset of the disease at the age of 59 (mean 65.62) years.
