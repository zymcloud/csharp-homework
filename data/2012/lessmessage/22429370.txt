Objectives:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replicates in the liver and can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The B lymphocytes may provide a means for HBV to persist although the mechanism remains unknown. This study aimed to characterize B lymphocyte subset phenotypes and measure levels of B lymphocyte-related cytokines in HCC patients.Methods:The study population included 38 HCC patients and 30 healthy control subjects. Phenotyping of B lymphocytes was performed by flow cytometry. Serum cytokine levels were measured using a cytometric bead array immunoassay.Results:The ratio of na√Øve (CD29+CD27-) to memory (CD19+CD27+) B lymphocytes was significantly higher in HCC patients compared with healthy controls. The percentage of memory B lymphocytes decreased with the progression of HCC. Levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 were significantly increased in HCC patients compared with healthy controls.Conclusions:The depletion of memory B lymphocytes may contribute to unresponsiveness to HBV or to HCC. This humoral defect might be related to raised production of IL-6 and IL-10.
