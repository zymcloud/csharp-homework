Background and aim:Metabolic syndrome is recognised as a potential risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The association between metabolic factors and hepatitis C (HCV)-related HCC has not yet been well clarified. This study was conducted to elucidate the role of metabolic factors in HCV-related HCC.Material and methods:We recruited 147 HCC patients and compared them with 147 matched CHC patients and 320 controls. The plasma levels of homeostasis model assessment-IR (HOMA-IR), adiponectin and lipids for all participants were assessed.Results:The HCC group showed significantly higher levels of insulin, glucose, HOMA-IR and adiponectin as well as lower levels of total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglycerides compared with the matched CHC patients and controls. HOMA-IR did not correlate with pathologic features of HCC, whereas serum adiponectin levels correlated positively with the size of tumour nodules (P = 0.009). Based on stepwise logistic regression analysis, age (OR: 1.456, 95% CI: 1.072-1.979, P Conclusions:Metabolic abnormalities are closely associated with the occurrence and development of HCV-related HCC. Patients with CHC and high serum adiponectin levels face a higher risk of developing liver cancer. Insulin resistance, as measured by HOMA-IR, is significantly associated with HCV-related HCC.
