The artificial ascites technique is often used during radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment because it prevents visceral damage and improves visualization by minimizing interference of the lungs and mesentery. This study determined the efficacy and safety of RFA using the artificial ascites technique in HCC patients. We examined 188 HCC patients who were treated by RFA and fulfilled the Milan criteria. Treatment outcomes (complete ablation rate, local recurrence rate, complication rate, liver function including total bilirubin level, alanine aminotransferase level, albumin level, and prothrombin time) were compared among patients divided into 3 groups based on the volume of artificial ascites injected:Group I (n = 86), no artificial ascites injected;Group II (n = 35), 1,000 ml artificial ascites injected. No significant difference was observed in complete ablation or local recurrence rates among the 3 groups, or in the extent of liver function damage after RFA. Artificial ascites disappeared within 7 days; additional diuretics were needed only in 5 (all from Group III) of 102 patients. No serious complications such as intestinal perforation or intraperitoneal bleeding were observed. Thus, we found that artificial ascites injection during RFA is effective and safe, and can be used to prevent major procedural complications.
