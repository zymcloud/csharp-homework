Development of successful formulations for poorly water-soluble drugs remains a longstanding critical and challenging issue in cancer therapy. The stearic acid-g-chitosan oligosaccharide (CSO-SA) micelles have been presented as potential candidates for intracellular antitumour agent delivery carrier. Herein, podophyllotoxin (PPT) loaded CSO-SA micelles (CSO-SA/PPT) were prepared by a dialysis method. The drug encapsulation efficiency could reach a higher level, the micellar size and the zeta potential increased with increasing charged amounts of drug. The cumulative release percentage of PPT drug from micelles enhanced with decreasing PPT content in the micelles. The cytotoxicities of CSO-SA/PPT micelles against human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) cells, human lung cancer cells (A549) and human hepatoma cell line (Bel-7402) were higher than that of free PPT formulation. The higher cytotoxicities were due to the faster PPT transport into tumour cells mediated by CSO-SA micelles. Overall, CSO-SA micelles might be a promising carrier for PPT delivery in cancer therapy.
