Occidiofungin, a glycolipopeptide obtained from the liquid culture of Burkholderia contaminans MS14, has been identified as a novel fungicide. The present study was designed to initially assess the in vitro toxicity in a rat hepatoma (H4IIE) cell line and acute toxicological effects of occidiofungin using a mouse model. In vitro toxicity was observed in all variables at 5 Î¼mol/L. B6C3F1 mice were given single and repeat doses of occidiofungin up to 20 mg/kg. Key effects were a reduction in body and organ weights. However, no significant decrease in body weight was noted at a dose of 1 mg/kg, which is comparable to the dose level of other cyclic glycopeptide antifungal agents currently approved for human use. Microscopic examination of treated mice did not identify any signs of organ-specific toxicity at the dose levels tested.
