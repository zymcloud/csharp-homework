Background/aims:To evaluate the influence of the width of resection margin on recurrence and survival for hepatocellular carcinoma.Methodology:Randomized controlled trials and non-randomized trials evaluating the influence of the width of resection margin for HCC were identified using a predefined search strategy. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate pooled recurrence and survival rate.Results:One randomized controlled trial and four non-randomized trials were identified. The only randomized controlled trial reported that a margin aiming at 2cm could decrease the recurrence rate (p=0.037) and increase the 3-year survival (p=0.02) and 5-year survival rate (pConclusions:A resection margin â‰¥1cm does not provide significant prognostic benefit compared with a resection margin
