Background:Computed tomographic (CT) perfusion imaging has been applied in many clinical areas, but few studies have addressed the values of CT perfusion imaging in evaluating the therapeutic response of chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Objective:To assess the perfusion changes of HCC after transarterial chemoembolization, and to investigate the values of CT perfusion imaging in chemoembolization procedure.Methods:Multidetector computed tomographic perfusion imaging was performed in 24 patients with HCC 1 week before and 4 weeks after chemoembolization. The CT perfusion parameters, including hepatic arterial perfusion (HAP), hepatic portal perfusion (HPP), total liver perfusion (TLP), and hepatic arterial perfusion index (HAPI), were calculated by using the slope method. The t statistic was used to analysis the difference of CT perfusion parameter values before and after chemoembolization therapy.Results:The values of HAP, TLP, and HAPI in tumors 4 weeks after chemoembolization were significantly decreased than those before chemoembolization (P 0.05).Conclusion:Computed tomographic perfusion imaging has the ability to evaluate the perfusion changes in HCC after chemoembolization, which can be used to evaluate the therapeutic response of chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma.
