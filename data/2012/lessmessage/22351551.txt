Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer with a high rate of metastasis to sites, such as, lung, bone, and regional lymph nodes. However, metastasis of HCC to the hand is rare and the majority of reported cases involve hand bones. Here, the authors report a rare case of finger skin metastasis from HCC without bone involvement. This case highlights that patients presenting with a nodule or granuloma-like tumor of the hand should generate a suspicion of metastasis when there is a history of HCC.
