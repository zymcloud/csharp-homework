Background/aims:Surgery remains a mainstay of current approaches for the treatment of gastric cancer. Since the introduction of the first mechanical stapling devices, a debate started about whether mechanical staplers or manual suture produce better results.Methods:88 patients operated by a single team between January 2004 and November 2011 were included in this study: 14 patients underwent minimally invasive total gastrectomy and 74 patients had an open total gastrectomy. Manual suture anastomoses were performed on 59 patients and stapled anastomoses were done on 29 patients.Results:There were no cases of anastomotic leakage or stenosis for the stapled group. There were 4 cases of anastomotic leakage in the manually suture group. There were no cases of anastomosis related mortality.Conclusion:the data support the use of stapled esophagojejunal anastomosis as a safe way to create a esophagojejunal anastomosis, with superior results in term of anastomotic leakage or stenosis to those with hand suturing.
