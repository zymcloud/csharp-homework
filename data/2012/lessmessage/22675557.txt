Background:Studies focused on the correlation of mutations in the genome of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) like Pre-S mutation, Basal Core promoter (BCP), Enhancer II (EnhII), especially Precore mutation, with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have triggered stiff controversies. With an increasing number of studies in this field recently, we conducted this meta-analysis to appraise the correlations.Methods:We searched the commonly used databases both in English and Chinese till February 1(st), 2012. Meta-analysis was performed in fixed/random-effects models using STATA 10.0. Publication bias was examined through Egger's test and Begg's funnel plot.Results:In total, 85 case-control studies were included involving 16745 HBV-infected patients, of whom 5781 had HCC. Statistically significant correlations were observed in Precore mutation G1896A (OR = 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-1.85, P(OR) = 0.002), G1899A (OR = 3.13, 95%CI = 2.38-4.13, P(OR)Conclusions:Precore mutation G1896A, G1899A, deletions in Pre-S region as well as the other commonly seen mutations correlated with the increased risk of HCC, especially in Asians and may predict the progression of the liver disease.
