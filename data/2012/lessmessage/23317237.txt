Background and aim:Gastric cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide. In this study the clinical and histological features of gastric cancer in the cardia and distal stomach were evaluated.Method:Proximal and distal gastric cancer diagnosed and treated in eight provinces of Iran from 2010-2011 were reviewed in all collected cases. The age standardized incident rates were calculated and tumor location and histological type were recorded.Results:The age-standardized incidence rate for the eight centers was 40.6 per 100,000 populations per year with an upper and lower range of 22.1 and 102.4 per 100,000 population per year. Thirty four percent of the tumors were located in the cardia, 3% in fundus, and 63% in the distal stomach. In 7 provinces the prevalence of distal tumors was significantly greater than proximal tumors (p=0.006). A significant relationship was observed between diffuse form of gastric cancer and distal gastric tumors (p=0.007) and between poor tumor differentiation and distal gastric tumors (p<0.001).Conclusions:the result of this study shows that distal gastric cancer is more common than proximal gastric cancer in Iran.
