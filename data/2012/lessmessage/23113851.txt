A 58-year-old female with hepatitis C was referred to our hospital after computed tomography (CT) revealed a tumor in the right lobe of her liver. After thorough examination, tumor thrombosis was detected on the main trunk of the portal vein, and we decided to administer a combination of subcutaneous interferon-alfa and intra-arterial 5-fluorouracil. However, after 2 cycles of treatment, this regimen was ineffective, and thus cisplatin (CDDP) was added for the third cycle. On completion of 5 treatment cycles, the tumor and portal vein tumor thrombosis were not detected by CT or (18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography. Hence, chemotherapy was considered effective and stopped. Two years after chemotherapy, Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonists-II (PIVKA-II) levels were within normal limits. Combination therapies have been recognized recently, and judging from the above case, the addition of CDDP to the combination regimen can prove beneficial.
