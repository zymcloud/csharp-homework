Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most prevalent liver disease in western society and is increasing in parallel with the worldwide epidemic of obesity. It exists in a simple form, steatosis, or a more complex and more dangerous form, steatohepatitis, and it is often but not always associated with the metabolic syndrome. NAFLD can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is responsible for the majority of cryptogenic cirrhosis cases. Increasingly, NAFLD and its more sinister form, steatohepatitis, have been linked to the increased incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) worldwide, independent of the metabolic syndrome. Death from CVD surpasses death from liver complications, but that is beginning to change as people are living longer with CVD. In this article, we will review nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and its epidemiology, prevalence, pathology, and link to CVD.
