Background/aims:To determine the efficacy of portal vein embolization (PVE) against unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methodology:We conducted a comparative study using 17 patients with HCC determined to be unresectable and who received a combination of PVE and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) (PVE group) and 22 HCC patients with tumors in the unilateral lobe, which were treated only with repeated TACE (TACE group) from January 2000 to December 2008.Results:There were no significant differences in background factors except for gender between the two groups. The cumulative intrahepatic recurrence rates in the non-portal-embolized area (in the contralateral lobe for the TACE group) at 1 year and 3 years was 41.1% and 58.8% in the PVE group and 77.3% and 81.8% in the TACE group, respectively. The former was significantly lower (pConclusions:Although in patients with unresectable HCC, when HCC is localized in the portal-embolized area, PVE combined with TACE can prevent intrahepatic metastasis to the non-portal-embolized area and improve overall survival.
