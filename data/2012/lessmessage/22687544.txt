Barely-Shochu is a traditional Japanese liquor distilled from fermented barley with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Barely-Shochu distillation remnants (SDR) are by-products in the manufacturing process of barley-Shochu. We have already reported on valuable powder from Shochu distillation remnants (PSDR) including antioxidative compounds such as polyphenols. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of barely-PSDR against orthotopic xenograft mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vivo. We constructed a mouse model of HCC by orthotopical inoculation of HepG2 cells into the liver of SCID mice. Barely-PSDR (2250 mg/kg) was orally treated once each day for 21 d after the inoculation of HepG2 cells. The livers were removed from anaesthetized mice after the treatment with barely-PSDR and fixed in formalin. The liver sections were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick-end labeling (TUNEL) methods. Remarkably high reduction of tumorigenesis was obtained in the mouse models of HCC after the oral administration of barely-PSDR in vivo. Induction of apoptosis in the liver section on the mouse models treated with barely-PSDR was observed. Furthermore, prolonged survival was obtained. Thus, therapeutic effects of barely-PSDR without side effects on the orthotopic xenograft mouse models were revealed for the first time.
