Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) has been identified as a proto-oncogene that is overexpressed in various types of human cancers. CIP2A acts by inhibiting protein phosphatase 2A-dependent destabilization of c-Myc, resulting in increased cell proliferation. Here, we have characterized the proximal promoter region of the human CIP2A gene in cervical, endometrial and liver carcinoma cells. The 5' flanking minimal proximal promoter of the CIP2A gene consists of putative binding sites for Ets1 and Elk1 in forward and reverse orientations. Here, we show that Ets1 and Elk1 binding is essential for CIP2A basal expression in several urogenital cancer cell lines. Interestingly, both Ets1 and Elk1 are required together for CIP2A expression, as siRNA knockdown of Ets1 and Elk1 together decreased CIP2A gene transcription, whereas knockdown of Ets1 or Elk1 alone had no effect. Moreover, ectopic expression of Ets1 and Elk1 together increased CIP2A expression. To gain physiological significance of the Ets1 and Elk1 regulation we observed, a panel of matched human cervical carcinoma samples was analyzed for the expression of CIP2A and Ets1 and/or Elk1. We found a direct correlation between the levels of CIP2A and the levels of Ets1 and Elk1. Our results suggest that the binding of Ets1 and Elk1 together to the proximal CIP2A promoter is absolutely required for CIP2A expression in cervical, endometrial and liver carcinoma cell lines. Thus, different factors regulate CIP2A expression in a cell-type specific manner. As previous work has shown a requirement for only Ets1 in prostate and gastric carcinomas, our results now indicate that CIP2A regulation is more complex than previously determined.
