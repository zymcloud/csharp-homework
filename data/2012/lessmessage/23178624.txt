Background/aims:Recently, we detected that UNC5C expression was downregulated in colon and gastric cancer.Methodology:In the present study, the methylation status of the UNC5C gene was examined in primary carcinomas and the corresponding normal tissues derived from 42 patients with HCC.Results:Methylation of the UNC5C gene was detected in 11 out of the 42 (26%) HCCs, suggesting that the methylation of UNC5C was frequently observed in HCCs. The clinicopathological data were correlated with the methylation results.Conclusions:TNM stage 1 HCC presented UNC5C methylation, indicating that the UNC5C gene has been methylated from the early stages of HCC.
