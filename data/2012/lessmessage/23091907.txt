Background:"Intestinal-type" mucinous carcinoma of the vulva is extremely rare with very few cases reported in the literature.Case report:The authors report two patients who had diagnosis of intestinal-type mucinous adenocarcinoma of the vulva after excisional biopsy. In both cases, restaging was perfomed with total body computed tomography (CT) scan, gastroscopy, and colonoscopy that showed no other site of disease. A radical vulvectomy with bilateral systematic inguinal lymphadenectomy was performed, and in both cases no residual disease was found. A patient developed metastatic (liver, bone marrow) colonic cancer 36 months after primary surgery, received multiple lines of chemotherapy, and died of disseminated disease 18 months after diagnosis. The other patient was found to have dysplastic polyp in the sigmoid colon, and is alive without disease at 39 months after primary diagnosis.Conclusion:Intestinal-type mucinous carcinoma of the vulva has a poor prognosis. Strict endoscopic follow-up of the colon is mandatory in such cases, considering the high propensity of associated gastrointestinal (GI) tumors.
