Metastatic involvement of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract secondary to breast cancer (BC) is rare and usually occurs in patients with lobular BC. We report 2 cases with GI presentations of metastatic BC. In the first case endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography because of abdominal discomfort, tenesmus and rectal bleeding demonstrated liver, gastric and rectal metastases with histological and immunohistological patterns of metastatic lobular BC. In the second case gastric involvement, endoscopically presented as a solid nodular lesion in the gastric body and fundus with involvement of the gastro-esophageal junction, was established with clinical symptoms of solid food dysphagia and dyspepsia; the metastatic infiltration from ductal BC was proven histologically and immunohistochemically. The GI metastases were presented 5 and 7 years after radical mastectomy because of lobular and ductal BC respectively. The cases are of interest with a feature of liver and GI metastases in double sites (stomach and rectum) from lobular BC, as well as solid gastric metastasis from ductal BC. They illustrate the need for special attention to GI metastatic disease in patients with invasive BC who present with non-specific GI symptoms.
