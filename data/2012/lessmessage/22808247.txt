Furin is a member of the pro-protein convertase family. It processes several growth regulatory proteins into their active forms, which are critical to tumor progression, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Furin over-expression could occur in liver cancer and a previous study showed that over-expression of furin promoted HepG2 cell invasion in tail vein xenograft models. However, the clinical relevance of furin expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remained unknown. Surprisingly, in a postoperative survival analysis for HCC patients, it was found that the tumor/non-tumor (T/N) ratio of furin expression â‰¥ 3.5 in HCC tissues predicted a better postoperative disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.010; log-rank test). Furthermore, subcutaneous xenograft experiments demonstrated a significant suppression effect of tumor growth in the furin-overexpressed xenografts (Huh7-Furin) compared to the mock control. Administration of a synthetic furin inhibitor for inhibition of the pro-protein convertase activity, decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone (decRVKR-CMK), to the Huh7-Furin xenograft bearing mice restored the repression effect of tumor growth. In contrast, administration of decRVKR-CMK to the mock Huh7 xenograft bearing mice showed no change in growth rate. In conclusion, furin overexpression inhibited HCC tumor growth in a subcutaneous xenograft model and predicted a better postoperative DFS in clinical analysis.
