Background/aims:Due to different biological characteristics of non-colorectal liver metastasizes (NCLM), surgical treatment, especially itÂ´s long term results, is a topic of discussion. The aim of the study was to evaluate the single center experience with surgical treatment of NCLM.Methodology:Seventy two patients were prospectively included. The average length of time after the primary surgery was 3.9 years (0-8.5 years). RFA prevailed -50 patients (69.4%), resection presenting 30.6%. Preoperative chemotherapeutical downstaging or portal vein embolization was performed on 12 patients (16.7%). Resectable or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatable extrahepatic metastasizes were removed in 26 patients (36.1%).Results:One, three and five years patient survival after the liver resection or RFA was 88.6, 72.5 and 36.9%. The best survival rate was in patients with carcinoid (5 years-100%), breast cancer (5 years-33.8%), renal carcinoma (3 years-44.4% ) and gynecological tumors metastasizes (2 years-72.9%). With regards to long-term survival of patients, we did not find any statistically significant difference between RFA and resection. Patients with extrahepatic metastasizes had worse prognosis (p<0.01).Conclusions:Liver resection and RFA in NCLM have an unambiguous place in multi-modal curative strategy. The decision for surgical treatment of patients suffering from NCLM, is strictly individual with the aim of achieving qualitative long-term survival.
