Objective:The association between codon 72 polymorphism of the tumour protein p53 (TP53) gene - which results in a missense mutation of arginine (R) to proline (P) - and susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial. A metaanalysis was performed in order to define this relationship more precisely.Methods:Published studies of TP53 codon 72 polymorphism and the risk of HCC were identified. Data were extracted, and summary odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Pooled ORs were determined for an additive model (R/R versus P/P), a dominant model ([R/R + R/P] versus P/P) and a recessive model (R/R versus [R/P + P/P]).Results:The meta-analysis included seven case-control studies (total 1511 cases and 2165 controls). The risk of cancer was significantly decreased in the overall dominant model and the dominant model in Asian populations. A significantly decreased risk was found for all models in hospital-based but not population-based studies. There was no association between polymorphism and cancer risk when data were stratified according to hepatitis B or C virus infection status.Conclusion:The TP53 codon 72 polymorphism may be a risk factor for HCC.
