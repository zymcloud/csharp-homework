Objective:To report a case of huge hepatocellular carcinoma associated with tumor lysis syndrome and its management.Clinical presentation and intervention:A 51-year-old hepatitis B carrier visited our clinic with progressive weight loss over recent months. Abdominal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a huge hepatic mass in a cirrhotic liver, identified as hepatocellular carcinoma. A hepatologist and surgeon recommended transarterial chemoembolization followed by hepatectomy. The patient underwent the procedure, with the complication of tumor lysis syndrome. He was treated with a single high dose (9 mg) of rasburicase and his clinical condition improved dramatically, with acute kidney injury subsiding without emergent hemodialysis.Conclusions:This was a case of hepatocellular carcinoma with tumor lysis syndrome and acute kidney injury, treated successfully with rasburicase.
