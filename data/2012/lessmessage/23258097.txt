Objectives and methods:Findings of histological analyses of 2 cases of liver biopsy revealing hypovascular nodules are described.Results:Ultrasound examination revealed hypovascular and hypoechoic nodules (8 mm in diameter) in segment 1 (case 1) and (8 mm) in segment 8 (case 2). The nodules were detected by only Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of ultrasound-guided biopsy of the nodules revealed slight hypercellularity without the features of early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) such as cell atypia, fatty change and pseudoglandular formation. Early HCC was suspected; however, Victoria blue staining disclosed terminal portal tract invasion, the most important finding of early HCC. Also, cytokeratin 7 staining revealed decreased ductular reaction compatible with early HCC. Taken together, these histological analyses confirmed the two nodules to be early HCC.Conclusion:Based on the criteria of the International Consensus Group, the two nodules were diagnosed as early HCC through biopsy.
