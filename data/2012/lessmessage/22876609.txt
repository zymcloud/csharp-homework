New (tetrazol-5-yl)methylindole derivatives were synthesized from 2-phenylindole. Furthermore, the sugar acetyl hydrazones of the tetrazole derivatives as well as their derived acyclic C-nucleoside analogs were prepared. The synthesized compounds were studied for their anticancer activity against human liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2) and the results showed that arylidine substituted tetrazole derivatives 7c and 7d were the most active.
