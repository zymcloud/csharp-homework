This study aimed to determine the possibility of using the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA) to evaluate the quality of life and functional status in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The study recruited 300 outpatients with HCC from a teaching hospital in Central Taiwan to serve as subjects. All subjects were interviewed with a structured questionnaire for rating the nutritional status with the MNA (long-form and short-form), and for evaluating quality of life and functional status with Global Quality of Life (GQL) and Global Functional Status (GFS), respectively, of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 version-3. Cancer staging and liver cirrhosis indicators, blood biochemical indicators, and self-rated health status and mobility were used as reference standards. Results showed that based on the strength of the correlation and association with the reference standards, both the long-form and short-form of the MNA performed better than GQL and GFS in predicting quality of life and functional status of patients with HCC. These results suggest that the MNA is suitable for identifying the risk of deteriorating quality of life or functional status, in addition to identifying the risk of malnutrition, in patients with HCC.
