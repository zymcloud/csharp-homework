Metastasis to lymph nodes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is generally observed to occur in regional chains of involvement. We encountered a HCC patient who had hepatitis C virus-related liver cirrhosis and portal vein tumor thrombosis, accompanied by metastasis to only a single cervical lymph node, skipping the common intermediate routes of involvement. It is noteworthy, so as not to miss the clinical diagnosis, to remark that metastasis to the cervical lymph node is rarely observed in patients with HCC, and that the metastasis can skip to the regional lymph nodes.
