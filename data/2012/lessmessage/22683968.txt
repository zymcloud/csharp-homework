Background/aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often recurs after complete surgical resection. Detection of markers of residual circulating cancer cells may predict postoperative HCC recurrence. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) mRNA may be a candidate tumor marker.Methodology:We prospectively assessed the expression patterns and prognostic value of preoperative peripheral blood hTERT mRNA in patients with HCC undergoing hepatic resection (n=17) or liver transplantation (n=6). As controls, we assessed hTERT mRNA in patients with liver cirrhosis without HCC (n=6) and in living liver donors (n=4). Concentrations of hTERT mRNA were measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR).Results:No significant difference was observed in the levels of hTERT mRNA between the HCC and control groups. Only alpha-fetoprotein â‰¥400ng/mL was associated with greater expression levels of hTERT mRNA. At a median follow-up of 30 months, HCC recurred in 10 of 17 resected patients, but in none of the 6 liver transplant recipients. hTERT mRNA concentration was not associated with HCC recurrence after either resection or liver transplantation.Conclusions:Peripheral blood hTERT mRNA concentration is not a likely marker for the diagnosis or prognosis of HCC, especially in patients undergoing resection. Owing to the small number of transplanted patients assessed, the clinical significance of hTERT mRNA concentration was not objectively verified, suggesting the need for a study in larger numbers of HCC patients undergoing liver transplantation.
