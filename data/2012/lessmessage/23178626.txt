Recent technological improvements in laparoscopic devices have significantly extended the surgeon's ability to perform laparoscopic liver surgery safely. Hand-assisted laparoscopy has been proposed in order to achieve greater safety and accessibility in laparoscopic liver surgery. Moreover, in order to expand the indications of minimally invasive liver resection and improve its safety, the "hybrid procedure" or "laparoscopy-assisted resection" has been proposed. Hand-assisted laparoscopic liver resection consists of the placement of a gas-tight port through an 8cm incision that enables a hand to be introduced into the abdomen. The "hybrid procedure" is performed through an 8-12cm midline or subcostal incision. Such a minimal abdominal incision is preferred not only for cosmetic reasons but also for obtaining adequate surgical margin. We performed laparoscopic liver resection via a minimal incision that was based on the measurement of the to-be-resected specimen intraoperatively by ultrasonography. Here, we have described our procedure and evaluated its efficacy.
