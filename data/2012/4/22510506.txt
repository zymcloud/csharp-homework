Background and objective:Lung cancer is the most common type among all malignant tumors, bringing huge pain and mood disorders to patients suffering from it. This study aims to evaluate the effect of the Feiji Decoction for soothing the liver combined with psychotherapy for depression and anxiety on patients with primary lung cancer. It also aims to further explore the relationship between depression and anxiety.Methods:A total of 118 patients with primary non-small cell lung cancer were randomly divided into two groups. The combined therapy group consisted of 57 patients who were treated with Feiji Decoction for soothing the liver and psychotherapy combined with chemotherapy. The control group consisted of 61 patients who were treated with chemotherapy only. Both groups were observed for two treatment courses. The Zung Self-reported Depression Scales (SDS) and Zung Self-reported Anxiety Scales (SAS) were used to assess the patients' psychology status in both groups before and after treatment scales.Results:After treatment, the depression and anxiety scores of the therapy group remarkably decreased compared with scores before treatment, indicating a statistical significance (P<0.01). In comparison, after treatment, the depression and anxiety scores of the control group significanfly increased compared with scores before treatment, indicating a statistical significance (P<0.01) as well. The depression and anxiety scores of the therapy group significanfly decreased compared with scores of the control group, showing statistical significance (P<0.01). Thus, depression and anxiety score has a close co-relationship, showing significant positive correlation (P<0.01).Conclusions:Feiji Decoction for soothing the liver combined with psychotherapy can alleviate depression and anxiety in patients with primary lung cancer. This therapy has good clinical therapeutic effect.
