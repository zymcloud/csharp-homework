Objective:The high rate of early major infections in liver transplantation recipients is due to their compromised immune-system. We examined the risk factors of early major infection in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT).Materials and methods:From January 2004 to December 2010, 242 patients undergoing LDLT were enrolled in the prospective cohort. We prospectively collected their clinical and demographic variables, operative details, and posttransplant complications.Result:One hundred thirty-nine patients (57.7%) experienced 252 episodes of early infection posttransplantation: bloodstream septicemia (n = 46, 18.3%), urinary tract (n = 34; 14.1%), pneumonia (n = 64; 25.4%), peritonitis (n = 62; 25.7%), and catheter related (n = 46; 19%). The most frequent Gram-positive bacteria were coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 52; 16.9%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (n = 32; 10.4%). The most common Gram-negative bacteria were Escherichia coli (n = 27; 8.8%); Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 29; 9.4%), Pseudomonas aureos (n = 18; 5.8%), and Sternotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 18; 5.8%). Upon multivariate logistic regression analysis, the risk factors for early major infection were a high creatinine level (odds ratio = 1.481), a long anhepatic arterial phase (1.01), a reoperation (6.417), young age (1.040), and non-hepatocellular carcinoma recipient (2.141).Conclusion:Early major infection after LDLT was high with Gram-positive bacteria, the most common etiologies. Prolonged anhepatic arterial phase, renal insufficiency, and reoperation were risk factors for an early major infection.
