Hepatic malignancies are commonly faced clinical problem. Non surgical minimally invasive therapies are current treatment goal. Interventional radiologists are going forwards with such minimally invasive but effective therapies by transarterial chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection, cryoablation, laser ablation and upcoming promising procedures like focused ultrasound & gene therapy. Response rates of transarterial chemoembolization for primary and most metastatic tumors are 60-80% with survival rates of 70% at 1 year, 40% at 3 years, and 10% at 5 years. Percutaneous ethanol injection ablation is the most accepted minimally invasive method worldwide, for hepatocellular carcinomas less than 5 cm in diameter, the complete ablation rate is about 70-75%; in 5-8 cm diameter, encapsulated hepatocellular carcinomas, the rate is about 60%. RFA is becoming a widely used ablative technique for primary and secondary liver tumors, with a 52-67% complete ablation rate at 1 year and survival rates of 96%, 64%, and 40% at 1, 3 and 5 years, respectively. Meticulous patient selection, careful planning and execution are imperative and should be carried out with the participation of interventional and diagnostic radiologists, nuclear medicine specialists, and medical, surgical, and radiation oncologists. In terms of cost, equipment, technical efficiency, efficacy & repeated applicability percutaneous procedures particularly PEI & RFA can be carried out in Bangladesh.
