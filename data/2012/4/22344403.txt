Purpose:To evaluate dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for monitoring and assessing treatment response in patients with neuroendocrine liver metastases treated using yttrium 90 ((90)Y)-labeled octreotide ((90)Y-DOTATOC).Materials and methods:The study was approved by the local research and ethics committee and patient informed consent was obtained. Twenty patients with liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors underwent T1-weighted DCE MR imaging of the liver before and at 2 months after intravenous (90)Y-DOTATOC treatment. Regions of interest were drawn around target lesions, as well as along liver outlines for each patient. A dual-input single-compartment model was used to compute parameters including fractional distribution volume and the arterial flow fraction. Pre- and posttreatment values were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test. Treatment response was defined as showing a greater than 50% reduction in the nadir chromogranin A level within the 1st year after treatment. Pretreatment values of responders and nonresponders were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. A two-tailed P value of .008 or less, which accounts for multiple testing, was considered to indicate a significant difference.Results:In responders, tumor and whole liver distribution volume significantly increased after treatment (median tumor distribution volume, 0.182 vs 0.244; median whole liver distribution volume, 0.175 vs 0.207; P = .008). The pretreatment whole liver distribution volume was significantly lower in responders (median, 0.175 vs 0.248; P = .003), while pretreatment tumor arterial flow fraction was significantly higher in responders (median, 1.000 vs 0.7 Â± 1, P = .006).Conclusion:DCE MR imaging may be used to monitor the effects of peptide receptor radiolabeled targeted therapy in patients with neuroendocrine tumors liver metastases; a lower pretreatment distribution volume and high arterial flow fraction was associated with a better response to treatment.
