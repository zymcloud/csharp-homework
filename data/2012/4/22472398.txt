The purpose of this study was to determine the poor prognostic factors after repeat hepatectomy (Hx) in patients with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Overall survival rates and clinicopathological variables in 112 patients with repeat Hx from 1992 to 2010 were compared with those in 531 patients who underwent a primary Hx. To clarify the poor prognosis factors after repeat Hx, survival data among 112 patients were univariately and multivariately analyzed. Overall survival after repeat Hx was similar for that of the patients who underwent a primary Hx. The mean age of repeat Hx group was significantly higher, and a well-preserved liver function was recognized than the primary Hx group. Multivariate analysis revealed that: 1) indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes; 2) disease-free interval; 3) tumor size; 4) portal vein invasion at primary Hx; 5) gender; and 6) estimated blood loss to be an independent and significant poor prognostic factors. The overall 3-year postrecurrence overall survival rates were 100, 91.3, 59.6, and 0 per cent at risk number (R) R0, R1/2, R3, R4, respectively (P
