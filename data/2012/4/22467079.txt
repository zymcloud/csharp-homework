Retrospective, hypothesis-generating population studies suggest that diabetics treated with metformin have a substantially reduced risk of several cancers, including hepatoma, relative to diabetics on other therapies. In this issue of the journal (beginning on page 544), Bhalla and colleagues contribute to the growing literature on metformin effects in experimental carcinogenesis models, showing reduced carcinogen-induced hepatoma in mice. The clinical need to develop novel prevention strategies for hepatoma is obvious, given an increasing prevalence and poor prognosis. The clues that metformin or related biguanides may have utility in this area justify accelerated laboratory research, as more data concerning mechanism, pharmacokinetics, and predictors of efficacy will help to optimize the design of clinical trials.
