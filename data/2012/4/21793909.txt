Background and aim:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Taiwan. HCC with duodenal involvement are rare and are associated with a poor prognosis. The purpose of this retrospective study was to collect clinical information and data regarding survival following various treatments.Methods:Between 1996 and 2009, 21 cases (17 men) were diagnosed with HCC and duodenal invasion and metastases by diagnostic imaging, endoscopy with biopsy, or surgically collected specimens sent to pathology. The clinical course was analyzed from the patients' medical records.Results:Gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 18/21 patients. Diagnostic imaging showed that the majority of cases involved direct tumor invasion (predominantly from the right liver lobe) and six cases from metastasis. Tumor mass and ulcerations were the most common features noted on endoscopy. In addition to the component therapy and medication treatment, panendoscopic hemostasis, surgery, transcatheter arterial embolization, and radiotherapy were performed for the management of duodenal involvement and gastrointestinal bleeding. Survival duration after duodenal involvement ranged from 0.2 to 57.8 months (mean 10.5 months).Conclusions:Gastrointestinal bleeding in advanced HCC should raise suspicions of duodenal involvement. HCC can involve the duodenum by direct invasion (from either the left or right liver lobes) or metastasis. The prognosis for HCC patients with duodenal involvement is poor, but is improved by supportive care and application of various treatment modalities.
