Solid papillary tumor (SPT) is an uncommon lesion of the pancreas whose origin and behavior are poorly understood. Very rare cases of primary extra-pancreatic SPTs have been described, and their clinical, histological, immunophenotypic and ultrastructural features seem to be similar to those arising in the pancreas. Here we report a case of primitive SPT of the liver, the second case described in the literature so far.
