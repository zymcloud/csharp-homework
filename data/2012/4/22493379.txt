Background/aim:Hepatectomy without recurrence for more than five years may be considered as being a sufficient resection of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of the present study was to clarify the predictive factors for sufficient resection for HCC patients.Patients and methods:In our Department, 77 patients with HCC survived without recurrence for more than five years following hepatectomy (curative group) and 187 patients underwent hepatectomy but developed recurrence within five years (recurrence group). We compared the clinicopathology between these two groups and evaluated the favorable factors for HCC without recurrence using logistic regression analysis.Results:The curative group was associated with three independent factors by multivariate logistic regression analyses: tumor size, serum indocyanine green retention rate (ICG15) and anatomic wide hepatectomy (all pConclusion:Sufficient resection is closely related to patient, tumor, and treatment factors. Anatomic wide hepatectomy for small (
