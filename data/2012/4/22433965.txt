Background:There is increasing evidence that the presence of an ongoing systemic inflammatory response is a stage-independent predictor of poor outcome in patients with cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an inflammation-based prognostic score, the prognostic nutritional index (PNI), is associated with overall survival (OS) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:All patients with a new diagnosis of HCC presenting to the Medical Oncology Department, Hammersmith Hospital between 1993 and 2011 (n=112) were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Patients in whom the combined albumin (g l(-1)) × total lymphocyte count × 10(9) l(-1) was ≥45, at presentation, were allocated a PNI score of 0. Patients in whom this total score was Results:Univariate analyses showed that PNI (P=0.003), intrahepatic spread (P400 ng ml(-1) (PConclusion:The presence of a systemic inflammatory response, as measured by the PNI, is an independent and externally validated predictor of poor OS in patients with HCC.
