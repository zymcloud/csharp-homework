Background:Radiofrequency Ablation is the most widely performed percutaneous treatment for Hepatocellular Carcinoma. This multicentre study was aimed at assessing the complication, overall survival and disease-free survival rates in cirrhotic patients with single Hepatocellular Carcinoma nodule ≤3 cm undergoing Radiofrequency Ablation.Methods:Data of 365 patients (59% males; mean age 67 ± 8 years), Child-Pugh A/B, with single Hepatocellular Carcinoma nodule ≤3 cm (tumours >2-3 cm = 127/236), showing complete necrosis after Radiofrequency Ablation between 1998 and 2010 in 7 Italian Centers were retrospectively reviewed. Complication, overall survival and disease-free survival rates were analyzed as main clinical end-points.Results:Major complications were observed in 8 patients (2.2%) and minor complications in 23 patients (6.3%). The 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 80% and 64%. One hundred and seven patients (29.5%) died, being 41 deaths (38.3%) Hepatocellular Carcinoma-related. At multivariate analysis only age (p = 0.04; OR 2.29), ascites (p Conclusions:Radiofrequency Ablation is an effective and safe tool for the treatment of single Hepatocellular Carcinoma ≤3 cm providing excellent 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates. Patient's age and liver status appeared as main determinants of outcome.
