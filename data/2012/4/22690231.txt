Context:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a public health problem. HCV alone is responsible for 90% cases of acute hepatitis among multiply transfused patients who are at risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Objectives:To provide a clear picture of available data, we performed a systematic review of the epidemiological characteristics of HCV infection among patients with inherited coagulation disorders in the countries under the Eastern Mediterranean Region Office (EMRO).Evidence acquisition:Meta-analysis was carried out on the basis of results of electronic and manual search. This analysis included studies in English, French, and Persian that met with the following criteria: (1) appropriate study design: cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort; (2) studies reporting HCV prevalence according to enzyme immune assay; (3) studies in which the sample population was enrolled from EMRO countries. According to the results of the heterogeneity tests, we used fixed-effect/random-effect model for our meta-analysis, with the "Metan" command.Results:We included 30 studies, most of which were from Iran. The mean age of the subjects ranged from 13 to 27.1 years. The majority of the patients were male (range, 81% to 100%). The pooled estimate of HCV infection among patients with inherited coagulation disorders was 48.07% (95% confidence interval [CI], range: 27.39-55.68) in Iran, 36.03% (95% CI, range: 4.466-67.598) in Pakistan, and 48.27% (95% CI, range: 36.12-60.43) in all the EMRO countries taken together.Conclusions:In Iran and other EMRO countries, the HCV infection rate among patients with inherited coagulation disorders is high. Our study shows that there is a lack of knowledge about infections in such patients in most of the EMRO countries. It is the responsibility of health-policy makers to address this knowledge gap and provide safe and adequate treatment for patients in high-risk groups.
