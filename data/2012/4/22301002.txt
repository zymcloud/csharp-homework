A neutral polysaccharide fraction (ARP) prepared from the rhizome of Anemone raddeana was tested for its anticancer activity in H22 tumor-bearing mice by oral administration. ARP could not only significantly inhibit the growth of H22 transplantable tumor, but also remarkably promote splenocytes proliferation, NK cell and CTL activity, as well as serum IL-2 and TNF-Î± production in tumor-bearing mice. In addition, ARP treatment to tumor bearing mice had no toxicity to body weight, the liver and kidney. Moreover it could reverse the hematological parameters induced by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to near normal. The above results suggested that the antitumor activity of ARP might be achieved by improving immune response, and they could act as antitumor agent with immunomodulatory activity.
