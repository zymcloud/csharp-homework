Aim:To investigate the association of Rab27A and Rab27B expression with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time PCR, and Western blotting to detect Rab27A and Rab27B mRNA and protein expression in 5 human HCC lines and the immortalized hepatic HL-7702 cell line. We further examined 148 primary HCC samples matched with adjacent normal tissue and 80 non-HCC specimens by immunohistochemistry to evaluate the correlation of Rab27A and Rab27B expression with clinicopathological features and prognosis.Results:Our data showed that Rab27A and Rab27B were differentially expressed in cell lines and primary HCC tumors. Rab27A mRNA and protein were detected in 67% (4/6) of human cell lines and 80% (4/5) of HCC cell lines, while Rab27B was found in 50% (3/6) of human lines and 40% (2/5) of HCC lines. Rab27A expression was higher in primary HCC (46.2%, 66/143) than in matched adjacent tissue (24.3%, 33/136, P Conclusion:Rab27A and Rab27B expression were closely correlated with tumor progression and can be valuable prognostic indicators for HCC patients.
