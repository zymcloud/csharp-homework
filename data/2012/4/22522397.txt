The study investigated the immunity and antioxidant potential of paeonol by employing a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rat model. Three doses of paeonol (20, 40, 60 mg/kg b.w. orally) were administrated to diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC rats. Results showed that paeonol significantly reduced the serum AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, AFU and liver MDA levels, increased serum WBC, TP, ALB, A/G, TNF-α and IFN-γ and liver antioxidant enzymes activities (SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, GR) in HCC rats. Altogether, these results suggest that the paeonol could effectively decrease oxidative injury and improve immunity function in HCC rats.
