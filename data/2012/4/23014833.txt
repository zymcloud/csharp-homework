A 76-year-old male was referred for the treatment of liver tumors detected by abdominal computed tomography (CT). Dynamic CT revealed a low-density tumor with an irregularly enhanced rim in the left lateral sector, and a highly enhanced, well-circumscribed tumor in the caudate lobe, accompanied by dilation of the intrahepatic biliary ducts in the left lobe. Preoperative imaging studies led to the diagnosis of double cancers consisting of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Left hemihepatectomy with caudate lobectomy was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. Microscopic evaluation revealed that the tumor in the left lateral sector was adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC), whereas that in the caudate lobe was HCC. This report presents the first case describing the resection of synchronous double cancers of primary hepatic ASC and HCC.
