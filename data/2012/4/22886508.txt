Background:Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) have been reported to attenuate hepatic fibrosis in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, it is uncertain whether ARBs prevent hepatocarcinogenesis in NASH even after hepatic fibrosis has developed.Methods:Male Wistar rats were fed with a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet for 24 weeks, and then fed with the CDAA diet with telmisartan (2 mg/kg/day), a novel ARB, or vehicle for another 24 weeks. The liver histology and the expression of genes and proteins related to angiogenesis were investigated.Results:The 24-week CDAA diet induced liver cirrhosis. The 48-week CDAA diet exacerbated liver cirrhosis, and developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 54.6 % of the rats concurrently with increases of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) protein and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA, which are potent angiogenic factors in the liver. Telmisartan inhibited hepatic fibrosis and preneoplastic lesions and prevented the development of HCC along with inducing decreases in HIF-1α protein and VEGF mRNA.Conclusions:These data indicated that telmisartan may prevent hepatocarcinogenesis through the inhibition of hepatic angiogenesis even after liver cirrhosis has been established.
