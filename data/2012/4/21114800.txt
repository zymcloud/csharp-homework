Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the commonest primary hepatic malignancy and the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Incidence remains highest in the developing world and is steadily increasing across the developed world. The majority of HCC occurs on a background of cirrhosis, principally caused by two major risk factors, chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection. Current diagnostic modalities, of ultrasound and Î±-fetoprotein, are expensive and lack sensitivity in tumour detection. Early diagnosis is integral to improved survival rates and there have been recent advances in technology that have enabled early identification of the process of hepatocarcinogenesis. This review outlines the epidemiological trends and risk factors for HCC; diagnostic techniques and current guidelines for screening and surveillance; and newer methods of screening.
