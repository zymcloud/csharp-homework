Purpose:To evaluate local tumor control and survival rate after repeated transarterial chemoembolization using two different protocols in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Materials and methods:A total of 190 patients (mean, 68 years) with HCC were repeatedly treated with transarterial chemoembolization in 4-week intervals. The chemotherapy protocol consisted of mitomycin C alone (n = 111) and mitomycin C with gemcitabine (n = 79). Embolization was performed with lipiodol and microspheres. Tumor response was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Survival rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier method.Results:In the mitomycin C-only group, we observed partial response in 38.8% (43/111), stable disease in 27% (30/111), and progressive disease in 34.2% (38/111). In the mitomycin C/gemcitabine group (n = 79), partial response was observed in 43% (34/79), stable disease in 16.5% (13/79) and progressive disease in 40.5% (32/79). The overall 1- and 2-year survival rates were 56% and 28%, respectively. The overall median survival time from the start of transarterial chemoembolization treatment was 15 months. The median survival of patients treated with mitomycin C was 16.5 months and it was 12 months for patients treated with a combination of mitomycin C and gemcitabine. No statistically significant difference between the two groups was observed (P = .7).Conclusion:Chemoembolization is an effective minimally invasive therapy option for palliative treatment of HCC patients. Mitomycin C only proves to be effective, the addition of gemcitabine was not advantageous.
