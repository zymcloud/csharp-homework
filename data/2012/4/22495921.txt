Hepatocellular carcinomas rank among the most common cancers worldwide. They are characterized by phenotypic heterogeneity and poor response to treatment modalities. Although considerable progress in diagnosis and management of hepatocellular carcinomas has been made over the last decade, the exact biology of liver cancer remains poorly understood, overall hindering the development of new therapeutic strategies. The development of whole-genome analyses on different molecular levels greatly advanced our understanding of hepatocarcinogenesis by simultaneously investigating thousands of molecular targets. Although implementation of the results from these analyses in routine clinical practice is still limited, these next generation technologies offer unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms of the development of liver cancer. Overall, great promise rests on whole genomic approaches to improve the diagnostic testing and to identify novel targets for individualized treatment modalities in liver cancer.
