The International Association of Surgeons, Gastroenterologists and Oncologists (IASGO) hosted their annual world congress under the auspices of president Masatoshi Makuuchi from Japan and the general secretary Nicolas J Lygidakis. This year the congress was held in Tokyo, and the president was Wataru Kimura of Yamagata University. It is common knowledge that a major triple disaster struck Japan in March 2011. It was thought, for a time, that the congress would not take place, but the great courage and determination of the hosts allowed the conference to continue as scheduled. This congress was one of the most interesting hosted by the IASGO, evidenced by the presence of 909 participants from 59 countries, including invited speakers from Europe, America, Africa and Asia. The congress provided an opportunity to exchange knowledge of new techniques, methods of diagnosis and therapy. The program included symposiums, video presentations, free papers and poster presentations. This manuscript highlights presentations of the newest and most original material concerning the treatment of liver tumors, especially hepatocellular carcinoma.
