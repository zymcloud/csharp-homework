Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the commonest tumors worldwide. The treatment of HCC is vital for disease diagnosis and prognosis, as the liver is the most important organ controlling metabolic functions. Now-a-days, western folklore medicines are largely dependent on the phyto compounds which are highly effective in therapy and with low side effects. Luteolin is a flavonoid (3,4,5,7-Tetrahydro flavones) possess anti-inflammatory, anticancer and anti allergic property. The present study evaluates the efficacy of luteolin against N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) induced HCC in albino rats. In the highlight of the above, luteolin was evaluated for its efficacy against DEN induced HCC in male Wistar albino rats. The Biochemical parameters such as tissue damaging enzymes viz., AST, ALP, LDH and Î³-GT, enzymatic antioxidants viz., SOD, CAT, GSH and GPx and histopathological changes have been estimated. The tissue damaging enzymes were found to be high in DEN alone treated group whereas the enzymatic antioxidants decreased destructively. Severe lesions and cirrhosis were observed in the toxin (DEN alone) treated group. The luteolin treated DEN group altered the tissue damaging enzymes and the enzymatic antioxidants. The damaged lesion in the histoarchitecture of DEN treated rat liver was almost completely restored. Finally this study strongly demonstrates that luteolin has potent curative property against HCC in albino rats.
