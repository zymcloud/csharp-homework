Hydatid cyst is a parasitic infection that is widely seen endemically in the Middle East countries. We studied hydatid cyst pattern in hospitalized adult patients in our hospital from 2000 to 2010. In this study 89 patients, 50 females and 39 males who were diagnosed to have hydatid cyst were evaluated. The mean age of the patients was 37.3 and the mean hospital stay was 10.1 days. The main complaint was abdominal pain (66.2%). The most common localization of cysts was the liver and the most radiological method to diagnose the disease was ultrasonography followed by CT scan. Our recurrence rate was more than average. We had no mortality and did not find any serious postoperative complication. Safe surgery is a role for hydatid cysts.
