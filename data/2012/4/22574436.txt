Two new eremophilenolides, 6beta,8beta,10beta-trihydroxyeremophil-7(11)-en-12,8-olide (1) and 3beta-acetoxy-8alpha-hydroxy-6beta-methoxyeremophila-7(11),9-dien-12,8-olide (2) along with twenty-nine other compounds were obtained from the methanolic extracts of the aerial parts and rhizomes of Farfugium japonicum (L.) Kitam. var. formosanum (Hayata) Kitam. (Compositae = Asteraceae). The structures of the isolated compounds were characterized and identified by spectral techniques. Compounds 5, 6, 10, 12-24, 29, and 30, were reported for the first time from this genus. Cytotoxicity and anti-inflammatory activity of the isolated compounds were evaluated. Compounds 3 and 16 possessed moderate cytotoxicity against human breast cancer cell line (MCF 7). Compounds 3, 16, 25 and 26 exhibited moderate cytotoxicity against hepatoma cells (Hep G2 and Hep 3B). With respect to the anti-inflammatory activity, compounds 15 and 16 (each 10 microg/mL) inhibited superoxide anion generation by human neutrophils in response to fMLP/CB by 92.0% and 87.3%, respectively.
