Background and aim:Renal insufficiency (RI) can coexist in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study analyzed the prognostic impact of RI on patients with HCC and determined the optimal staging strategy for these patients.Methods:RI was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate Results:For patients undergoing percutaneous ablation and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), RI was significantly associated with decreased long-term survival (P = 0.001 and 0.004, respectively). In patients receiving resection and other treatments, there were no significant survival differences between patients with and without RI. With similar demographics generated in the propensity model, significantly decreased survival was found in patients with RI in the TACE group (P = 0.018), but not in the resection, percutaneous ablation, and other treatment groups. Among HCC patients with RI, the TIS system had the lowest AIC value.Conclusions:RI is often present in patients with HCC and predicts a poor outcome in patients undergoing TACE. The survival of HCC patients receiving resection, percutaneous ablation, and other treatments is not affected by RI. The TIS staging system is a more feasible prognostic model for HCC patients with RI.
