The treatment of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) prior to orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) is of increasing importance due to the rise in HCC incidence and donor shortage. This single-center study examines 28 patients treated with TACE and 7 patients not treated with TACE, with HCC prior to OLT between 1999 and 2008. The overall 1- and 5-year survival of all transplanted patients with HCC was 94% (33 of 35) and 80% (28 of 35). There was no difference in survival (P = .99) between patients who underwent transplantation immediately (median 95 days) and patients who had significantly longer wait times (median 308 days) when treated with TACE. During extensive wait times for OLT, TACE can be used to keep patients with HCC on the waiting list by preventing tumor progression, with similar outcomes compared with those who underwent transplantation immediately.
