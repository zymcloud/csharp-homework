Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper accumulation in the liver, brain, kidneys, and cornea due to inadequate biliary copper excretion. It should be considered especially in young patients who have findings of liver disease with unexplained etiology. Clinical presentation of the disease can be variable, and different types of parenchymal changes of the liver can be seen on imaging modalities. Multiple nodular lesions mimicking metastases can be detected. This condition can obligate physicians to screen for a malignant disease. Moreover, it may cause misdiagnosis as advanced stage of disease when coexistent with a malignancy. The coexistence of Wilson disease with some malignant diseases has been reported; however, coexistence with seminoma was not reported before. Approximately 40% of testicular cancers are pure seminoma. Liver metastases are rare in seminoma. In this article, a case of Wilson cirrhosis is reported. The patient was first followed with diagnosis of seminoma with suspicion of liver metastases.
