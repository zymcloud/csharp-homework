Aim:Methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A) is inactivated in HCC and may be stimulated by an epigenetic change involving promoter hypermethylation in hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the possible clinical impact and prognosis of this inactivation have not been investigated.Methods:We studied the methylation status of the CpG sites in the promoter region and the mRNA and protein expression of MAT1A in HCC and corresponding adjacent non-tumor tissues using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry techniques.Results:MAT1A promoter methylation was significantly higher in HCC than that in adjacent non-tumor tissues (P Conclusion:Our observations suggest that hypermethylation of the MAT1A promoter may be one of the events in the development of HCC. Low expression of MAT1A is likely involved in the progression of the tumor and was found to be an independent factor for poor prognosis of patients with HCC.
