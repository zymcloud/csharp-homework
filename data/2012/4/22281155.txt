Aims:Numerous postoperative therapies for preventing recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been reported, but their efficacy remains controversial and knowledge about adverse effects is limited. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed to gain a comprehensive picture of the efficacy and risks of these therapies.Methods:MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched through July 2011. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.Results:A total of 2989 patients from 28 RCTs involving 10 postoperative therapies were included. For interferon therapy, the estimated RR for the 2-year recurrence rate was 0.84 (95% CI 0.73-0.97, P = 0.02) and the overall survival (OS) was 1.15 (95% CI 1.07-1.22, P Conclusions:Use of adjuvant interferon is definitely associated with an increase in OS. Postoperative therapies involving acyclic retinoid, lipidol-iodine-131, or tumor vaccine may improve the OS of patients with HCC after curative treatment.
