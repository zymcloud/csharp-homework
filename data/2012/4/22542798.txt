We report a case of unexpected heterogeneous uptake of gadoxetic acid into a hepatic metastasis in a patient with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma that also lacked hypermetabolic characteristics on positron emission (PET)/computed tomography (CT) with [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Therefore, in cases of heterogeneous uptake of gadoxetic acid, infiltrative lesions must be considered.
