Solitary necrotic nodule of the liver (SNNL) is rare. Generally thought to be nonmalignant, it is often mistaken for malignancy based on imaging findings alone. We present a case of a hepatitis B carrier who was found to have a new sonographically detected hepatic lesion. The lesion was further evaluated with CT and MRI, and as appearances were suggestive of a hypovascular hepatoma, the lesion was surgically resected. This case is unique in that while it demonstrates several characteristic features of SNNL, several other imaging and histological features have not been previously described.
