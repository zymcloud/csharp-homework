The pleiotropic HBx protein of hepatitis B virus is linked functionally to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via effectors and signalling pathways of the host. To identify such effectors in a macrocarcinogenic environment, a PCR-based cDNA subtraction analysis was carried out in the X15-myc oncomouse model of HCC. Altogether, 19 categories of genes, mainly involved in protein biosynthesis and the electron-transport chain, were found to be upregulated in the liver of these mice. Ribosomal protein S27a (RPS27a), which is a natural fusion protein of N-terminal ubiquitin and C-terminal extension protein (CEP), topped the list of expressed genes, with >20-fold higher expression compared with its normal level. Sustained and elevated expression of RPS27a in the mouse liver and its moderate expression in cell culture in the presence of HBx suggested an indirect role of RPS27a in hepatocarcinogenesis. Nevertheless, a remarkable change in the intracellular distribution of ubiquitin from cytoplasm to late-endosomal lysosomes, and of CEP from nucleoli to the perinucleolar region/nuclear foci, was observed in the presence of HBx. RPS27a accelerated the progression of the cell cycle and cooperated with HBx in this process. Further, the knockdown of RPS27a expression by RNA interference in an HBx microenvironment led to retarded cell-cycle progression and reduced cell size. Thus, these results suggest strongly that RPS27a could be an effector of HBx-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis.
