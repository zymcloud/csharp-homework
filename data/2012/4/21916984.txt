Background and aim:There has been little information about the long-term outcome and prognostic factors in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and extrahepatic metastases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical factors affecting survival after extrahepatic metastasis and to determine the survival benefit of controlling intrahepatic HCC.Methods:Between 2004 and 2009, a total of 240 consecutive patients with HCC and extrahepatic metastasis were recruited. Based on tumor extent, performance, and hepatic function, the patients underwent locoregional and/or systemic treatments. The treatment response of the intrahepatic tumor after extrahepatic metastasis and other prognostic parameters were analyzed retrospectively.Results:During the mean follow up of 276 days, 222 patients died; the median survival time was 146 days. Multivariate analysis revealed that Child-Pugh class A, smaller hepatic tumor size, absence of portal venous invasion, single metastatic organ involvement, and objective treatment response of the intrahepatic tumor were the favorable prognostic factors for survival. Of the 183 evaluable patients, 24 achieved complete or partial response for intrahepatic tumors after treatment. The overall survival for the 24 responders was significantly improved, with a median of 521 days, as compared to 170 days for the remaining 159 patients without objective tumor response. The leading cause of death was progressive intrahepatic tumor.Conclusions:Intrahepatic tumor status and hepatic reserve are among the significant predictors of survival in patients with HCC and extrahepatic metastases. This study indicates that even in patients with metastases from advanced HCC, therapeutic approaches to control intrahepatic tumors are important in improving patient survival.
