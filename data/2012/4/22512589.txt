Cantharidin, as a natural toxin, can inhibit multifarious tumor cell lines, especially to hepatocellular carcinoma cells. It is a strong inhibitor of protein phos- phatases type 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A). Because of the cytotoxicity, the clinical application is limited. While the analogues, such as norcantharidin(NCTD), cantha- rimide and heterocyclic substituted cantharidin reveal more powerful antitumor activity and less cytotoxicity.
