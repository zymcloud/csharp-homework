It is well established that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develops in a multistep process, from chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis to HCC. Adipose tissue is not simply an energy storage organ but also a secretory organ, producing a variety of bioactive molecules known as adipokines, including adiponectin and leptin. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is an extracellular matrix protein, often associated with a variety of human cancers. Our retrospective study determines serum levels of adiponectin, leptin, and HA in HCC of cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients and compares these levels to patients with cirrhosis and normal subjects. Noncirrhotic HCC (n = 19), cirrhotic HCC (n = 50), cirrhosis (n = 36) patients and twenty one age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched normal healthy controls were subjected in the present study. Serum adiponectin, leptin, and HA levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Levels of serum adiponectin were significantly higher in the cirrhosis and cirrhotic HCC groups than in the normal subjects, whereas serum HA levels were found to significantly increase in all three patients groups. The elevation of serum leptin in our HCC patients, regardless of being cirrhotic or noncirrhotic, but not in the patients with cirrhosis, may shed some light on the significance of serum leptin level in HCC. Further studies are recommended to evaluate the prognostic value of serum leptin level in HCC.
