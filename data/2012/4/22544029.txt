Although the adrenal gland is a common site of metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), adrenal metastases are rarely seen in clinical practice because of its lower metastatic potential compared to the other malignancies. Adrenal metastases usually were detected at the time of diagnosis of primary HCC or simultaneously with intrahepatic recurrence after curative management of HCC. It is very rare that only metastatic HCC is detected without evidence of intrahepatic recurrence. Hereby, we report two cases of adrenal metastasis from HCC without intrahepatic recurrence after hepatic resection.
