Aim:To investigate the expression and clinical significance of CEACAM1 and HBx in HBV related hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:The expression of CEACAM1 and HBx in 81 HBV related hepatocellular carcinoma were detected by immunohistochemistry, and the relationship with clinicopathological features was analyzed. The expression of CEACAM1 in the human normal hepatocyte cell line QZG, HepG2 and HepG2-X were detected by Western blot.Results:The positive rate of CEACAM1 and HBx in 81 HBV related hepatocellular carcinoma tissues were 71.60%(58/81) and 74.07%(60/81) respectively. The expression of CEACAM1 and HBx were correlated with portal vein invasion, nodal metastasis and TNM staging. The expression of CEACAM1 was negative correlated with HBx(r(s);=-0.310, PConclusion:The higher expression of HBx and lower expression of CEACAM1 are correlated with invasion and metastasis of HBV related hepatocelular carcinoma, CEACAM1 may be a effect molecule in HBV related hepatocarcinogenesis.
