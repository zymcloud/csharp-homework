Background:Neoplasms are the second leading cause of death in Poland after vessel diseases, despite the huge progress in medical sciences in the last 20 years. Recently, gastric cancer morbidity has decreased, but mortality is still at a high level.Material/methods:Tissues from 24 patients with a histopathologically diagnosed mucosal and adenomucosal gastric cancer were tested. Patients were divided into 2 equal groups: patients without metastases (G1) and patients with metastases in the liver (G2). In all tested tissues of G1 and G2, the expression of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and metalloproteinase 2, respectively, were estimated.Results:Results revealed a statistically significant increase in the VEGF expression for G1 and G2 in relation to the margin (p1<0.001; p2<0.001). The increase of gene expression for VEGF did not significantly differ statistically in G1 and G2. The obtained results revealed a statistically significant difference in the increase of gene expression for MMP-2 in G1 in relation to the margin (p<0.05) and a very high one in G2 in relation to the average margin value (p<0.001). A highly statistically significant correlation was obtained for VEGF and MMP-2 in the tissue of patients with metastases (p<0.001; r=0.714). The highly elevated expression of MMP-2 in the tissue of gastric cancer in patients with metastases confirms its participation in the invasiveness of the neoplasmatic process.Conclusions:The highly significant correlation between VEGF and MMP-2 suggests a connection between both mechanisms in the progression of gastric cancer.
