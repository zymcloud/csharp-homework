Introduction:Combination of multiple biomarkers representing distinct aspects of tumor biology will have a better prognostic value. This study was to identify prognostic subgroups of colon adenocarcinoma by combined analysis of synuclein-gamma (SNCG), a human homologue of piwi (Hiwi), phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3), arrest-defective protein 1, homolog A (ARD1) and clinicopathologic features in 225 colon adenocarcinoma specimens.Methods:Immunohistochemistry for 4 tumor markers was performed in whole tissue sections from 225 colon adenocarcinoma patients with complete clinicopathologic data and up to 10-year follow-up. The immunohistochemical expression patterns were examined individually and in multimarker combinations. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent predictive markers of poor outcome.Results:With the tumor marker positive rate [32.0% (62/225) for SNCG; 76.9% (173/225) for combined SNCG/Hiwi/PRL-3/ARD1] and the detecting accuracy [61.9% (252/407) for SNCG; 82.6% (336/407) for combined SNCG/Hiwi/PRL-3/ARD1] increasing, incremental value of combined SNCG/Hiwi/PRL-3/ARD1 (P < 0.001; hazard ratios (HR), 3.2) to poor outcome was found. Stratified by lymph node, Hiwi alone (P = 0.004; HR, 3.2) led to poor outcome in patients without lymph node metastasis (LN-), and SNCG (P < 0.001; HR, 2.5) had independently poor prognostic value for patients with lymph node metastasis (LN+).Conclusions:Multimarker phenotypes improved tumor positive rate, detecting accuracy and prognostic value. In addition, a subgroup of more aggressive tumors can be identified by evaluating Hiwi level in LN- cancer, and SNCG level in LN+ cancer.
