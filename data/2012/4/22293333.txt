Background:Overexpression of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in the liver induces transformation into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in animal models. Polymorphisms in the EGF gene modulate EGF levels.Objectives:To evaluate the effect of EGF gene single nucleotide polymorphism and to assess its correlation with the risk of HCC in patients with chronic liver diseases.Patients and methods:The present study included 80 participants divided into four groups: group 1 included 20 asymptomatic healthy control volunteers, group 2 included 20 patients with chronic hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection, group 3 included 20 patients with liver cirrhosis, and group 4 included 20 patients with HCC. For all participants, the following investigations were performed: routine laboratory investigations including complete blood count, liver function tests, sero markers of hepatitis viruses HBsAg, HCV-RNA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and Î±-fetoprotein. DNA was extracted from whole blood for detection of single nucleotide polymorphism of the EGF by polymerase chain reaction, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism.Results:We found a significant difference between both patients with HCC and HCV versus controls in terms of the G carrier (GG and GA; 80 vs. 40%, PConclusion:The EGF 61GG genotype might be associated with a high risk for the development of HCC in Egyptian patients with chronic liver disease.
