This report describes a rare case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) producing granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). A 46-year-old male with chronic hepatitis B, who presented with fever, general malaise, loss of appetite, and weight loss, had a huge liver mass in the portal region. He had marked granulocytosis and his serum level of G-CSF was elevated. Complete tumor resection was performed, and the pathological assessment of the resected specimen revealed HCC with extensive sarcomatous changes and immunohistochemical staining for G-CSF and G-CSF receptor. Only a few cases of G-CSF-producing HCC have been reported, and this is the first case of G-CSF-producing HCC that also expressed G-CSF receptor.
