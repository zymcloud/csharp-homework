Introduction:Imaging techniques, primarily ultrasound, are useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with schistosomiasis in endemic areas.Methods:Study of 219 patients treated in sub-Saharan Tropical Medicine Unit with a diagnosis of imported schistosomiasis by imaging techniques investigations including plain abdominal radiography and ultrasound.Results:A total of 17.8% of patients who had an abdominal X-ray showed findings suggestive of schistosomiasis, in most cases bladder calcifications. In 73 patients (41%) ultrasound showed pathological findings, mainly diffuse or focal wall thickening (26 patients), nodular lesions (n=14), and pseudopolyps (n=8). One patient, who had a large bladder mass (9cm) and bilateral ureterohydronephrosis, was finally diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder. Ultrasound liver abnormalities were found in 10 patients, 4 with signs of portal hypertension, of which 3 had the characteristic periportal fibrosis in schistosomiasis.Conclusion:Imaging studies, especially abdominal and bladder ultrasound, are useful for diagnosis, the study of disease and monitoring of patients with schistosomiasis in non-endemic countries.
