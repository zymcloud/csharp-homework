Background:High tumor uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is associated with an unfavorable outcome in patients with cancer. We evaluated FDG uptake as a prognostic factor in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Methods:Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of tumor, liver, and pulmonary artery were recorded. Ratios of SUVmax from tumor to liver (T/L) and from tumor to pulmonary artery (T/PA) were calculated for each patient. Clinical data, tumor, and SUVmax ratios were compared with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).Results:Eighty-nine patients were included: 48 presented a local recurrent disease or distant metastases and 42 died. For both DFS and OS, tumor SUVmax value of 7 was the best cutoff value and 4 and 5 for T/L and T/PA ratios. Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent prognostic value of these 3 thresholds for DFS and OS.Conclusions:FDG uptake has a significant and independent relationship with recurrence and survival.
