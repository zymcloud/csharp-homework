Background & aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive malignancy; its mechanisms of development and progression are poorly understood. We used an integrative approach to identify HCC driver genes, defined as genes whose copy numbers associate with gene expression and cancer progression.Methods:We combined data from high-resolution, array-based comparative genomic hybridization and transcriptome analysis of HCC samples from 76 patients with hepatitis B virus infection with data on patient survival times. Candidate genes were functionally validated using in vitro and in vivo models.Results:Unsupervised analyses of array comparative genomic hybridization data associated loss of chromosome 8p with poor outcome (reduced survival time); somatic copy number alterations correlated with expression of 27.3% of genes analyzed. We associated expression levels of 10 of these genes with patient survival times in 2 independent cohorts (comprising 319 cases of HCC with mixed etiology) and 3 breast cancer cohorts (637 cases). Among the 10-gene signature, a cluster of 6 genes on 8p, (DLC1, CCDC25, ELP3, PROSC, SH2D4A, and SORBS3) were deleted in HCCs from patients with poor outcomes. In vitro and in vivo analyses indicated that the products of PROSC, SH2D4A, and SORBS3 have tumor-suppressive activities, along with the known tumor suppressor gene DLC1.Conclusions:We used an unbiased approach to identify 10 genes associated with HCC progression. These might be used in assisting diagnosis and to stage tumors based on gene expression patterns.
