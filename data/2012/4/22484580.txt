Background:Steroids have been the mainstay of immunosuppressive regimen in liver transplantation. However, the use of steroids is associated with various post-transplant complications. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of reduced immunosuppressive regimen with steroids (steroid elimination within 24 hours post-transplant) in a cohort of Chinese liver transplant recipients.Methods:Seventy-six patients in line with the selection criteria were enrolled in this prospective study. All patients received anti-IL-2 receptor antibody induction and tacrolimus-based maintenance therapy. The recipients were divided into two groups according to the duration of steroid use: 40 transplant in a 3-month withdrawal group and the remaining 36 in a 24-hour elimination group. Recipient survival, post-operative infections, biopsy-proven acute rejection and steroid-resistant acute rejection, non-healing wound, recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), de novo diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension were assessed in the two groups.Results:There was no significant difference in patient survival, incidence of acute rejection episodes and hyperlipidemia, and recurrence of HBV and HCC between the two groups. However, the incidence rates of post-transplant infection, non-healing wound, de novo diabetes and hypertension were significantly lower in the 24-hour elimination group than in the 3-month withdrawal group (all P values Conclusion:Under anti-IL-2 receptor antibody induction and tacrolimus-based maintainance, steroid elimination within 24 hours post-transplant is associated with reduced steroid-related complications without increasing the risk of rejection.
