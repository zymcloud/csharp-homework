Background:Advances in surgical techniques and immunosuppressive therapy have improved graft survival in transplant recipients. However, intense long-term immunosuppression increases the incidence of cancer in these patients compared with the general population, not least because of viral infections. Cervical cancer is the third most common malignancy worldwide. In early invasive cervical cancer, surgery is the treatment of choice.Case:In 2010, we performed a laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) in a 42-year-old patient with micro-invasive cervical adenocarcinoma (FIGO stage IA1) who had undergone two liver transplantations in 2006 and 2008. The patient was followed up for 18 months after surgery. Despite upper abdominal adhesions and minor difficulties in inserting the Veress needle, the pneumoperitoneum was created safely. The procedure was completed within 157 minutes without any intraoperative complications. Blood loss was less than 100 mL. Postoperative course was uncomplicated with minimal fluctuations in liver function markers. Immunosuppressive therapy was continued without modification. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 9. No complications or recurrence were reported during the 18-month follow-up.Conclusions:The laparoscopic approach is a justifiable form of surgical management in the treatment of a liver transplant recipient with early-stage cervical cancer.
