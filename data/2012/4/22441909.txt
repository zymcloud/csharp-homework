Objectives:To determine the relative wash-out of hepatocellular carcinomas and dysplastic nodules using Kupffer-phase sonography with Sonazoid (Daiichi-Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan) enhancement and hepatobiliary-phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of the histopathologic grades of individual nodules.Methods:This retrospective study included 66 consecutive patients with 78 histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinomas and dysplastic nodules. In patients with carcinomas, 33 were well differentiated; 29 were moderately differentiated; and 11 were poorly differentiated; and there were 5 dysplastic nodules. All patients underwent both gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI and Sonazoid-enhanced sonography. The interval between the two imaging examinations was less than 30 days. Six radiologists independently reviewed both images and rated the degree of relative wash-out between the tumorous and nontumorous areas on Kupffer- and hepatobiliary-phase images using a continuous rating scale. We compared these results with the histopathologic grade of each nodule, and the results were then analyzed with multireader multicase receiver operating characteristic analysis.Results:The average Kupffer-phase (P Conclusions:Kupffer-phase Sonazoid-enhanced sonography and hepatobiliary-phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI may be useful in estimating the histologic grade, although Kupffer-phase Sonazoid-enhanced sonography may be more accurate in distinguishing hepatocellular carcinomas, especially moderately and poorly differentiated types.
