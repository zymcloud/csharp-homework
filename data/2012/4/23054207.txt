Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver malignancy still demanding for novel therapeutic options. Since the ion channel inhibitor TRAM-34 (1-[(2-chlorophenyl) diphenylmethyl]-1H-pyrazole) was shown to block growth in various cancer cells, we investigated anti-tumor effects of TRAM-34 in human HCC cell lines. We found that TRAM-34 reduced HCC cell proliferation without induction of apoptosis. This was due to a decreased mRNA expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and a reduced activation of NF-kappaB, which both are implicated in the development of HCC. Therefore, TRAM-34 might represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.
