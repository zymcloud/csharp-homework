Background & aims:The development and/or progression of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in overweight and obese individuals have been associated to low-grade inflammation, but few studies have simultaneously analyzed the circulating levels of several cytokines.Methods:In this pilot study, a group of 27 cytokines and growth factors was analyzed in the serum of obese patients (n=40) diagnosed for MetS in comparison with sex- and age-matched control subjects without MetS (n=53) by using a multiplex immunoassay. Release of cytokines was measured in culture supernatants of human primary endothelial cells, THP-1 macrophagic cells and HuH-7 hepatoma cells upon exposure to a high fat mixture.Results:While the majority of cytokines did not show significant differences between the investigated groups, the circulating levels of CXCL10/IP-10 and IL-6 were higher in the MetS group versus overweight control group. In contrast, PDGF-BB serum levels were significantly decreased in MetS patients. The in vitro addition of a high fat mixture increased the release of IL-6 and/or CXCL10/IP-10 in the culture supernatant of human primary endothelial cells and THP-1 macrophagic cells, while the same mixture significantly decreased the release of PDGF-BB by human THP-1 macrophagic and HuH-7 hepatoma cells.Conclusions:The current demonstration that MetS is associated with decrease of the pro-fibrotic PDGF cytokine is a completely novel finding, which adds complexity to the interplay between inflammation and fibrosis in patients affected by MetS.
