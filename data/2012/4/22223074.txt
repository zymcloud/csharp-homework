Purpose:To compare local control effects of superselective transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) using epirubicin (EPI) plus mitomycin C (M) and miriplatin (MPT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:One-hundred and twenty-nine HCCs treated with superselective TACE were divided into three groups according to the type of anticancer drug; EPI-M-TACE (n = 51), MPT-TACE (n = 21), and MPT-I-TACE (MPT emulsion) (n = 57). Local recurrence, patterns of recurrence (intratumoral recurrence; IR), and follow-up angiograms were evaluated.Results:Mean tumor diameter and follow-up period for the EPI-M-TACE, MPT-TACE, and MPT-I-TACE groups were 16.9 mm and 15.5 months, 20.7 mm and 12.0 months, and 18.8 mm and 9.6 months, respectively. Local recurrence for the EPI-M-TACE, MPT-TACE, and MPT-I-TACE groups at 5, 10, and 15 months was 6.1, 47.6, and 40.1%, 23.5, 67.3, and 63.9%, and 26.2, 75.4, and 72.9%, respectively. IR for the EPI-M-TACE, MPT-TACE, and MPT-I-TACE groups was 23.1, 71.4, and 71.0%, respectively. Local recurrence and IR in the EPI-M-TACE group were significantly less than those in the MPT-TACE and MPT-I-TACE groups. Follow-up angiograms revealed less arterial damage in the MPT-TACE and MPT-I-TACE groups.Conclusion:Superselective TACE using MPT resulted in very frequent local recurrence, in particular IR, despite less arterial damage.
