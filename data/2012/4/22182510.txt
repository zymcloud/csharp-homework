Wnt proteins are secreted glycoproteins that bind to the N-terminal extra-cellular cysteine-rich domain of the Frizzled (Fzd) receptor family. The Fzd receptors can respond to Wnt proteins in the presence of Wnt co-receptors to activate the canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways. Recent studies indicated that, among the Fzd family, Fzd7 is the Wnt receptor most commonly upregulated in a variety of cancers including colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and triple negative breast cancer. Fzd7 plays an important role in stem cell biology and cancer development and progression. In addition, it has been demonstrated that siRNA knockdown of Fzd7, the anti-Fzd7 antibody or the extracellular peptide of Fzd7 (soluble Fzd7 peptide) displayed anti-cancer activity in vitro and in vivo mainly due to the inhibition of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of Fzd7 by small interfering peptides or a small molecule inhibitor suppressed Î²-catenin-dependent tumor cell growth. Therefore, targeted inhibition of Fzd7 represents a rational and promising new approach for cancer therapy.
