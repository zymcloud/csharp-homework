Background:This study was conducted to evaluate Japanese treatment guidelines for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and normal alanine aminotransferase (N-ALT) levels from the viewpoint of the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Four groups of patients with chronic HCV infection treated with pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) plus ribavirin, and classified according to the N-ALT guidelines, were examined for HCC incidence: group A (n = 353), ALT ≤30 IU/L and platelet (PLT) ≥15 × 10(4)/mm(3); group B (n = 123), ALT ≤30 IU/L and PLT Results:In groups A and C, the HCC incidence was low even in patients with non-response (NR) (cumulative rates at 3 years, 0.0 and 2.9 %, respectively). In groups B and D, 14.5 and 5.3 % of NR patients had developed HCC at 3 years, but none of the patients with sustained virologic response (SVR) or relapse had developed HCC. In group B, no patients with mild fibrosis developed HCC irrespective of the antiviral effect of the treatment. Among patients with PLT Conclusion:These results suggest that N-ALT patients with PLT
