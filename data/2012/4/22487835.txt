Objective:To assess the correlation between familial clustering of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the level of anti-P53 in human serum in Guangxi.Methods:Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect anti-P53 in 164 members from 20 HCC families and 164 members from non-cancer control families. Univariate analysis was performed to assess the correlation between seral level of P53 antibody and familial clustering of HCC.Results:The level of P53 antibody was significantly higher in the members of HCC families than controls (Z=-3.04, P=0.002). After eliminating the interference of hepatitis B virus infection, this tendency still remains (P=0.011). And there was a significant difference between relatives of different degrees from HCC families (chi-square=11.593, P=0.021), with the expression of anti-P53 declining along with decrease in relationship coefficient. Furthermore, the number of individuals with high anti-P53 expression was also significantly greater in HCC families (95/164) than controls (71/164) (P=0.006). And the expression was rising along with the increasing HCC numbers (chi-square=16.068, P=0.000). Anti-P53 level was also greater in HCC families featuring sibling affection than parental affection (chi-square=12.679, P=0.002). Univariate analysis indicated that high expression of anti-P53 is a risk factor for development of HCC (OR=2.087, 95%CI: 1.270-3.431).Conclusion:High level of anti-P53 expression may be a factor for the clustering of HCC families in Guangxi, China.
