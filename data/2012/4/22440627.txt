A series of novel hybrid compounds between 2-phenylbenzofuran and imidazole have been prepared and evaluated in vitro against a panel of human tumor cell lines. The results suggest that substitution of the imidazolyl-3-position with a naphthylacyl or bromophenacyl group, were vital for modulating cytotoxic activity. In particular, hybrid compound 15 was found to be the most potent compound against 4 strains human tumor cell lines and more active than cisplatin (DDP), and exhibited cytotoxic activity selectively against liver carcinoma (SMMC-7721).
