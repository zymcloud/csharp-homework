Objective:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new generation of 2.45-GHz microwave to ablate hepatocellular carcinoma by surgical approach. DESIGN; Case series with prospective follow-up.Setting:A university teaching hospital in Hong Kong.Patients:From March 2009 to January 2011, 26 consecutive patients (19 men and 7 women) with a median age of 63 (range, 49-79) years with hepatocellular carcinoma were recruited. Five (19%) of the patients had recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma after previous treatment.Intervention:Microwave ablation for hepatocellular carcinomas (one tumour, n=24; two tumours, n=2) using a laparoscopic (n=16) or open approach (n=10).Main outcome measures:Operative mortality and morbidity, rate of incomplete ablation, recurrence rate, and survival rate.Results:The median tumour diameter was 3.8 cm (range, 2.0-6.0 cm). Complications occurred in five (19%) of the patients; only one was ablation-related, and there was no operative mortality. One (4%) of the patients experienced incomplete ablation. Recurrent tumours were noted in 11 (42%) of the patients (5 were local, 2 were remote, and 4 were multifocal) after a median follow-up of 14 (range, 4-26) months. The failure rate for local disease control was 23%, and was 14% if patients with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded. All but one patient survived until the time of censorship. The mean survival was 25 (standard deviation, 1) months.Conclusion:This new-generation microwave technique is safe and effective for local ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma. It is a valuable treatment option for patients who are not candidates for hepatectomy.
