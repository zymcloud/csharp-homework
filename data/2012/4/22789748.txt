A comprehensive understanding of the pathways underlying hepatocyte turnover and liver regeneration is essential for the development of innovative and effective therapies in the management of chronic liver disease, and the prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhosis. Nuclear receptors (NRs) are master transcriptional regulators of liver development, differentiation and function. NRs have been implicated in the modulation of hepatocyte priming and proliferation in regenerating liver, chronic hepatitis and HCC development. In this review, we focus on NRs and their pathways regulating hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration, with a perspective view on NRs as candidate biomarkers and novel pharmacological targets in the management of liver disease and HCC.
