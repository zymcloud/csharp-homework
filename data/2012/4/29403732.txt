A chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay based on magnetic microparticles (MmPs-CLEIA) was developed to evaluate serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) in parallel with traditional colorimetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A systematic comparison between the MmPs-CLEIA and colorimetric ELISA concluded that the MPs-CLEIA exhibited fewer dosages of immunoreagents, less total assay time, and better linearity, recovery, precision, sensitivity and validity. AFP was detected in forty human serum samples by the proposed MPs-CLEIA and ELISA, and the results were compared with commercial electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) kit. The correlation coefficient between MPs-CLEIA and ELISA was obtained with R2=0.6703; however, the correlation between MPs-CLEIA and ECLIA (R2=0.9582) was obviously better than that between colorimetric ELISA and ECLIA (R2=0.6866).
