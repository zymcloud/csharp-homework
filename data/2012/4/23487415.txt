Objective:The sensitivity of FDG at PET examination of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is restricted. In a few studies, all done in Oriental patients, PET-examination with (11)C-acetate has shown a higher accuracy than with FDG. In the current study, the uptake of (11)C-acetate has been compared with the uptake of FDG in the primary HCC in a cohort of Occidental patients.Material and methods:44 patients underwent PET-examination with both tracers with a mean of 9 days between the examinations. 26 patients had a microscopical diagnosis and 18 were diagnosed with multimodal radiological methods. At least one relevant radiological examination was available for comparison.Results:At visual evaluation, 13 of the HCC's were positive at PET-examination using FDG and 34 were positive using (11)C-acetate (pConclusion:Adding registration with (11)C-acetate to registration with FDG at PET-examination has an incremental value in the diagnosis of HCC. A higher tumor uptake of (11)C-acetate cannot be taken full advantage of because of a higher uptake also by the surrounding liver tissue.Conflict of interest:None declared.
