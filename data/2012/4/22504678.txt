We aim to maintain the registered pemetrexed (PEM) monotherapy regimen from the standpoint of its frequency of use, patient adherence and compliance to treatment its toxicity and efficacy. With the development and expanded indication of PEM for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we registered the PEM monotherapy regimen for pretreated NSCLC. In order to investigate the validity of this approach, we retrospectively collected and analyzed data on the background, administration status, and toxicity of PEM from medical records of the initial consecutive 21 cases who received PEM monotherapy. Excluding only one case of grade 3 neutropenia (leucopenia), hematological toxicities were not significant. Common non-hematological toxicities were grade 1-2 nausea, fatigue, rash, and liver dysfunction, while grade 3 pneumonitis was observed in one case, and grade 3 hyponatremia was observed in two. Co-medication with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) did not increase toxicity. PEM is tolerable for pretreated NSCLC, but continual problems with non-significant common toxicities may arise.
