Aim:To evaluate the effectiveness of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resistant to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:This study was conducted on 42 patients who received HAIC for advanced HCC between 2001 and 2010 at our hospital. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was administered continuously for 24 h from day 1 to day 5 every 2-4 wk via an injection reservoir. Intra-arterial cisplatin or subcutaneous interferon was administered in combination with the 5-FU. The patients enrolled in this retrospective study were divided into two groups according to whether or not they fulfilled the criteria for resistance to TACE proposed by the Japan Society of Hepatology in 2010 (written in Japanese); one group of patients who did not fulfill the criteria for TACE resistance (group A, n = 23), and another group who fulfilled the criteria for TACE resistance (group B, n = 19). We compared the outcomes in terms of the response and survival rates between the two groups.Results:Both the response rate and tumor suppression rate following HAIC were significantly superior in group A than in group B (response rate: 48% vs 16%, P = 0.028, tumor suppression rate: 87% vs 53%, P = 0.014). Furthermore, both the progression-free survival rate and survival time were significantly superior in group A than in group B (3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-mo = 83%, 70%, 29% and 20% vs 63%, 42%, 16% and 0%, respectively, P = 0.040, and 9.8 mo vs 6.2 mo, P = 0.040). A multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazards regression model) showed that resistance to TACE was an independent predictor of poor survival (P = 0.007).Conclusion:HAIC administrating 5-FU was not effective against advanced HCC resistant to TACE. Other tools for treatment, i.e., molecular-targeting agents may be considered for these cases.
