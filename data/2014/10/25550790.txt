Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells that commonly expand during tumor development and that play a critical role in suppression of immune responses. MDSCs can be classified into two groups: Mo-MDSCs and G-MDSCs. These cells differ in their morphology, phenotype, differentiation ability, and immunosuppressive activity, and inhibit immune responses via different mechanisms. Therefore, identifying an effective method for isolating viable Mo-MDSCs and G-MDSCs is important. Here, we demonstrated the differences and similarities between fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) in sorting G-MDSCs and Mo-MDSCs. Both MACS and FACS could obtain G-MDSCs and Mo-MDSCs with high viability and purity. A high yield and purity of G-MDSCs could be obtained both by using FACS and MACS, because G-MDSCs are highly expressed in the spleen of tumor-bearing mice. However, Mo-MDSCs, which comprise a small population among leukocytes, when sorted by MACS, could be obtained at much greater cell number, although with a slightly lower purity, than when sorted by FACS. In conclusion, we recommended using both FACS and MACS for isolating G-MDSCs, and using MACS for isolation of Mo-MDSCs.
