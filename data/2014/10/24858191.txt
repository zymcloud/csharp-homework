Background:Serum Î±-fetoprotein concentration (AFP) might be a useful addition to morphologic criteria for selecting patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for liver transplantation (LT). The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of AFP in selecting HCC patients at minimal risk of posttransplant tumor recurrence in the setting of existing criteria.Methods:This retrospective cohort study was based on 121 HCC patients after LT performed at a single institution. AFP was evaluated as a predictor of posttransplant tumor recurrence with respect to fulfillment of the Milan, University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Up-to-7 criteria.Results:There was a nearly linear association between AFP and the risk of HCC recurrence (p Conclusions:Combining the UCSF and Up-to-7 criteria with an AFP level
