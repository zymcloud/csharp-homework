Recent years have seen dramatic changes in the biological understanding and treatment of solid tumors. Based on the tumor biology, targeting agents have been developed which directly affect the underlying genetic or immunological changes found in specific tumor entities. Significant increases in survival have delivered the functional proof of the concept of targeted and immunological tumor therapy. The management and adherence of the patient as well as optimized cooperation with clinicians are decisive for the results of therapy and disease control.Several solid tumors are currently under investigation in clinical studies evaluating the (sequential) therapy with targeting and immunologically active agents, e.g. tyrosine kinase and mTOR inhibitors, targeting antibodies, such as bevacizumab, specific antagonists, such as enzalutamide and immunological checkpoint inhibitors via PD(L)1 and/or CTLA 4 antibodies.Currently approved agents have dramatically changed the landscape of treatment options especially for prostate cancer. Such agents include hormone therapy with enzalutamide and abiraterone, radiotherapy with cabazitaxel and xofigo (radium 223), metastatic breast cancer (eribulin and everolimus), renal cell carcinoma (sunitinib, sorafenib, axitinib, everolimus and temsirolimus), non-small cell lung cancer (crizotinib and afatinib), colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (regorafenib) and melanoma (ipilimumab and vemurafenib). The treatment of rarer tumors, such as pancreatic and hepatocellular cancer and soft tissue sarcoma has entered the stage of targeted therapy with the approval of nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel, sorafenib, and eribulin/pazopanib. Current clinical trials are focusing on the best time point and sequence of therapy and also improvement in the management of these promising agents.
