Background/aims:The liver transplantation (LT) criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is expanding. However, most of the existing criteria are based on tumor characteristics of radiology. We aimed to build a preoperative scoring model including the neutrophilâ€“lymphocyte ratio (NLR) to select HCC patients for LT.Methodology:Using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis the sensitivity and specificity were highest when NLR was 3.79, so we defined NLR > 4 as elevated. By univariate and multivariate analysis, the significant predictors including NLR were used to establish a scoring model to predict outcome of HCC patients after LT.Results:Of 280 HCC patients, there were 114 patients with elevated NLR. The one-, three- and five-year recurrence-free survival rates of patients with high and low NLR were 64.9%, 30.1%, 30.1% vs. 83.9%, 62.9%, 60.7% (p 9 cm (p Conclusion:This scoring model including NLR can aid in selecting HCC candidates for LT.
