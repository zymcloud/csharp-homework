Background:Bilobar hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not rare and curative resection often cannot be achieved. However, the long-term results of nonsurgical treatments remain unsatisfactory. This study investigates the safety, efficacy, and long-term outcome of hepatic resection (HR) and resection combined with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in treating patients with bilobar HCC.Materials and methods:A retrospective study of 364 patients with bilobar HCC was carried out. Among them, 89 received HR, 114 received resection combined with RFA, and 161 received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). The clinicopathologic parameters, surgical results, long-term outcomes, and prognostic factors were analyzed.Results:The median follow-up time was 28 mo (range, 3-84 mo). The 1-, 3-, 5-y overall survival rates were better after HR and resection combined with RFA than those of patients after TACE, that is, 78.9%, 49.4%, and 34.4%; 70.7%, 40.7%, and 22.3%; and 47.2%, 17.4%, and 8.6%, respectively (P Conclusions:HR combined with RFA provided a chance for cure to patients with bilobar HCC who were traditionally deemed unresectable and yielded better long-term outcomes than TACE in a subset of patients. With preserved liver function, patients can receive aggressive treatment and survival could be prolonged.
