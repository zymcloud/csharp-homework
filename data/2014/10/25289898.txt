Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been implicated in cell invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), via increased β1-integrin expression and cell migration; however, the mechanism remains unclear. PGE2 exerts its effects via four subtypes of the E prostanoid receptor (EP receptor 1-4). The present study investigated the effect of EP1 receptor activation on β1-integrin expression and cell migration in HCC. Cell migration increased by 60% in cells treated with 17-PT-PGE2 (EP1 agonist), which was suppressed by pretreatment with a β1-integrin polyclonal antibody. PGE2 increased β1-integrin expression by approximately 2-fold. EP1 receptor transfection or treatment with 17-PT-PGE2 mimicked the effect of PGE2 treatment. EP1 siRNA blocked PGE2-mediated β1-integrin expression. 17-PT-PGE2 treatment induced PKC and NF-κB activation; PKC and NF-κB inhibitors suppressed 17-PT-PGE2-mediated β1-integrin expression. FoxC2, a β1-integrin transcription factor, was also upregulated by 17-PT-PGE2. NF-κB inhibitor suppressed 17-PT-PGE2-mediated FoxC2 upregulation. Immunohistochemistry showed p65, FoxC2, EP1 receptor and β1-integrin were all highly expressed in the HCC cases. This study suggested that PGE2 upregulates β1-integrin expression and cell migration in HCC cells by activating the PKC/NF-κB signaling pathway. Targeting PGE2/EP1/PKC/NF-κB/FoxC2/β1-integrin pathway may represent a new therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of this cancer.
