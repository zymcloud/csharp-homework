Background/aims:The aims of this study are to explore the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on hepatocyte proliferation in presence of plasma from patients with acute liver failure (ALF).Methodology:HepG2 cells were cultured with 50% plasma from patients with ALF for 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72h with or without different concentrations of EGF. Cell proliferation was determined by the MTT assay and intracellular cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) expressions were analyzed by western blotting.Results:The proliferation of HepG2 cells was significantly inhibited by treatment with plasma from patients with ALF from 12 to 72 h. Intracellular expression of cyclin D1 and CDK4 was also markedly down-regulated. 5ng/ml, 10ng/ml and 20ng/ml EGF dose dependently induced HepG2 proliferation in presence of plasma from normal control, but only 20ng/ml EGF showed a transient promoting effect on proliferation of HepG2 cells in presence of plasma from patients with ALF.Conclusions:Plasma from patients with ALF inhibits HepG2 cell proliferation via downregulation of cyclin D1 and CDK4 expression. Plasma from patient with ALF dampens HepG2 cells to EGF induced proliferation response.
