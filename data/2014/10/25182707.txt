Kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) is the principal receptor that promotes the pro-angiogenic action of vascular endothelial growth factor and has been the principal target of anti-angiogenic therapies. Our aim was to determine whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in KDR gene are associated with clinical outcomes after first-line sorafenib therapy in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The SNPs in KDR were tested in 78 advanced HCC patients receiving first-line sorafenib. Correlations with clinicopathological features and survival were analyzed. Patients with AA genotype of rs1870377 and AA genotype of rs2305948 were significantly associated with a better response and longer time to progression (TTP) (5.8 vs 4.0 months, P=0.001; 5.8 vs 4.5 months, P=0.016, respectively). Patients harboring AA genotype in rs1870377 and TT/TC genotype in rs2071559 had a longer overall survival (OS) (15.0 vs 9.6 months, P=0.001; 13.0 vs 9.0 months, P=0.007, respectively). At multivariate analysis, major vascular invasion and rs1870377 were independent factors in TTP and performance status, rs1870377, and rs2071559 were independent factors in OS. Our results suggest that SNPs in KDR gene can predict clinical outcome in advanced HCC patients receiving first-line sorafenib.
