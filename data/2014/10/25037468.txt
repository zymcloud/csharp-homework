Emerging evidence indicates that RUNX3 is a candidate tumor suppressor in several types of human tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the correlation between RUNX3 hypermethylation and incidence of HCC remains unclear. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming to comprehensively assess the potential role of RUNX3 hypermethylation in the pathogenesis of HCC. A detailed literature search was made from PubMed, EMBASE, and ISI web of knowledge to identify studies for related research publications. Methodological quality of the studies was also evaluated. The data were extracted and assessed by two reviewers independently. Analysis of pooled data was performed. Odds ratio (OR) was calculated and summarized, respectively. Final analysis of 821 HCC patients from 14 eligible studies was performed. We observed that RUNX3 hypermethylation was significantly higher in HCC than in normal liver tissue, the pooled OR from eight studies including 382 HCC and 161 normal liver tissue (OR = 39.32, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 13.72-112.7, p
