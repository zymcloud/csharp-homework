In contrast to common genomic amplifications that support cancer cell growth by rewiring intracellular signaling, VEGFA amplification drives tumor cell proliferation via the tumor microenvironment. VEGFA amplification is present in a subset of mouse and human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) that appear to be particularly sensitive to sorafenib treatment, indicating its potential value as a biomarker for HCC treatment.
