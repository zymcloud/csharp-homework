Oncoimaging using positron emission tomography (PET) with a specific radioprobe would facilitate individualized cancer management. Evidence indicates that ectopically expressed metabotropic glutamate 1 (mGlu1) receptor independently induces melanocyte carcinogenesis, and it is therefore becoming an important target for personalized diagnosis and treatment strategies for melanomas. Here, we report the development of an oncoprotein-based PET imaging platform in melanomas for noninvasive visualization and quantification of mGlu1 with a novel mGlu1-specific radioprobe, 4-(18)F-fluoro-N-[4-[6-(isopropyl amino)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]-N-methylbenzamide ((18)F-FITM). (18)F-FITM shows excellent pharmacokinetics, namely the dense and specific accumulation in mGlu1-positive melanomas versus mGlu1-negative hepatoma and normal tissues. Furthermore, the accumulation levels of radioactivity corresponded to the extent of tumor and to levels of mGlu1 protein expression in melanomas and melanoma metastasis. The (18)F-FITM PET imaging platform, as a noninvasive personalized diagnostic tool, is expected to open a new avenue for defining individualized therapeutic strategies, clinical trials, patient management and understanding mGlu1-triggered oncologic events in melanomas.
