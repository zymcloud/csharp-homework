Purpose:To characterize modified triaxial microwave antennas configured to produce short ablation zones.Materials and methods:Fifty single-antenna and 27 paired-antenna hepatic ablations were performed in domestic swine (N = 11) with 17-gauge gas-cooled modified triaxial antennas powered at 65 W from a 2.45-GHz generator. Single-antenna ablations were performed at 2 (n = 16), 5 (n = 21), and 10 (n = 13) minutes. Paired-antenna ablations were performed at 1-cm and 2-cm spacing for 5 (n = 7 and n = 8, respectively) and 10 minutes (n = 7 and n = 5, respectively). Mean transverse width, length, and aspect ratio of sectioned ablation zones were measured and compared.Results:For single antennas, mean ablation zone lengths were 2.9 cm ± 0.45, 3.5 cm ± 0.55, and 4.2 cm ± 0.40 at 2, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively. Mean widths were 1.8 cm ± 0.3, 2.0 cm ± 0.32, and 2.5 cm ± 0.25 at 2, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively. For paired antennas, mean length at 5 minutes with 1-cm and 2-cm spacing and 10 minutes with 1-cm and 2-cm spacing was 4.2 cm ± 0.9, 4.9 cm ± 1.0, 4.8 cm ± 0.5, and 4.8 cm ± 1.3, respectively. Mean width was 3.1 cm ± 1.0, 4.4 cm ± 0.7, 3.8 cm ± 0.4, and 4.5 cm ± 0.7, respectively. Paired-antenna ablations were more spherical (aspect ratios, 0.72-0.79 for 5-10 min) than single-antenna ablations (aspect ratios, 0.57-0.59). For paired-antenna ablations, 1-cm spacing appeared optimal, with improved circularity and decreased clefting compared with 2-cm spacing (circularity, 0.85 at 1 cm, 0.78 at 2 cm).Conclusions:Modified triaxial antennas can generate relatively short, spherical ablation zones. Paired-antenna ablations were rounder and larger in transverse dimension than single antenna ablations, with 1-cm spacing optimal for confluence of the ablation zone.
