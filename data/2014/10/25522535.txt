Flavones have received considerable attention because of their antiproliferative properties and selective effects on cancer cells, making them good candidates for use in cancer therapy. In contrast to other flavones, little is known about the effects of the flavone core structure (2-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4one) on cancer cells. Here, we report that flavone induces cell death in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Furthermore, annexin-V+/PI- and SubG1 populations of HepG2 cells increased after flavone treatment. Exposure of HepG2 to flavone did not result in either cytochrome c release into the cytosol or changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential. Treatment of HepG2 cells with flavone for 24 h reduced the accumulation of intracellular ROS, which correlated with upregulation of Gred, CuZnSOD and MnSOD mRNA levels. Taken together, our results provided useful insights into the mechanism of cell death caused by flavones, in order to evaluate their future application in hepatocarcinoma therapy.
