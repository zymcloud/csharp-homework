Aim:To evaluate the safety of a potential ablation agent-hydrochloric acid (HCl), which may apply to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Eighty adult New Zealand rabbits were divided into five groups of equal size (n=16), i.e., untreated group, normal saline (NS) control group, 10% HCl group, 20% HCl group and 30% HCl group. Each group was divided into two subgroups: ten rabbits for two-week toxicology study at the time points of hours 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6 and days 2, 7, 14 and six rabbits for imaging and histopathology study at the time points of days 2, 7 and 14. In toxicology study we evaluated the safety of HCl from arterial blood gas status, hematology and hepatic and renal functions. In imaging and histopathology study, we observed the relationship between the sizes of lesion and the concentration of HCl, as well as extension of necrosis and concentration of HCl. In this study we also observed the microcosmic and macroscopic lesion that caused by HCl.Results:In general condition, food, water consumption and body weight decreased notablely during the beginning of the experiment. In toxicology study, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and lactic acid contents were higher in the 30% hydrochloric acid group than in other groups (PConclusions:HCl is a safe ablation agent for local injection in the liver. HCl at a lower concentration is safer than at a higher concentration.
