Partial hepatectomy is still the treatment of choice aiming at a cure for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), provided that the patient can tolerate the treatment. For patients with multiple recurrent HCC after partial hepatectomy which cannot be treated by re-hepatectomy or local ablative therapy, the prognosis is extremely poor. Sorafenib is a molecular-targeted agent which has been demonstrated in two global phase III randomized controlled trials to show survival benefit for advanced HCC. Here, we present a 56-year-old patient with HCC who showed complete clinical response after sorafenib was used for tumor recurrence which developed 3 mo after partial hepatectomy. There was no evidence of progression of disease for 60 mo till now after continuous treatment with sorafenib.
