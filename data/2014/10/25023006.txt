Background:Aim of the study was to determine the value of perfusion computed tomography in the quantitative assessment of tumour-related neoangiogenesis for the diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma lesions.Methods:Overall, 47 consecutive patients with cirrhotic liver disease, with a high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, and undergoing standard surveillance (six-month intervals) were eligible for inclusion in this prospective study; based on Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer guidelines, 27 patients were enrolled. Perfusion computed tomography was performed in 29 biopsy-proven hepatocellular carcinoma lesions before and after treatment with transarterial chemoembolization or radiofrequency ablation. The dynamic study was performed with a 256-slice multidetector-computed tomography scanner; the following parameters were measured: hepatic perfusion, arterial perfusion, blood volume, hepatic perfusion index, and time-to-peak in all patients.Results:Hepatocellular carcinoma lesions had the following median perfusion values: perfusion 46.3mL/min/100g; blood volume 20.4mL/100mg; arterial perfusion 42.9mL/min; hepatic perfusion index 92.5%; time to peak 18.7s. Significantly lower perfusion values were obtained in correctly treated lesions or surrounding parenchyma than in viable hepatocellular carcinoma tissue.Conclusions:In hepatocellular carcinoma, perfusion computed tomography could contribute to a non-invasive quantification of tumour blood supply related to the formation of new arterial structures, and enable the assessment of therapeutic response.
