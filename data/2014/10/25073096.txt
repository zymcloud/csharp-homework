Genipin is obtained from the fruit of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis and acts as an herbal medicine or functional food in East Asia. In addition to produce natural colorant, it possesses widely antiinflammatory, antithrombotic, antidepressive and anticarcinogenic activities. However, little research focuses on the potential of genipin for drug-drug interactions. In this study, effects of genipin on mRNA and protein expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 were detected by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively, in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Enzyme activities of which were detected by luminogenic CYP assay in vitro. Moreover, effect of genipin on P-glycoprotein expression was analyzed by Western blot. Results showed that genipin possessed a significant induction on CYP2D6 and a remarkable inhibition on CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 not only from the expression of mRNA and protein (P<0.05 or P<0.01), but the level of enzyme activity. Moreover, a concentration-dependent induction of genipin on P-glycoprotein expression was observed. In conclusion, caution should be exercised with respect to the induction or inhibition of genipin on CYP isoenzymes and the strong induction on P-glycoprotein.
