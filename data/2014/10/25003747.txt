Objective:Little is known about the role of antiviral therapy for patients with hepatitis B who underwent curative hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to assess whether antiviral therapy after hepatectomy improves the prognosis of HCC in preoperatively antiviral-free patients.Materials and methods:This was a retrospective study of postoperative antiviral treatment in patients (n=87) who underwent curative hepatectomy for HCC. Clinicopathological features and disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed. Patients were followed up to monitor HCC recurrence (median of 31 months).Results:In patients with HCC up to 3 cm (n=36), antiviral therapy reduced serum alanine transminase levels after 6 months of treatment (-26.3%, P0.05). Using multivariate analysis, postoperative antiviral therapy was found to be an independent prognostic factor that was associated with a better DFS in patients with HCC up to 3 cm (odds ratio=0.220, 95% confidence interval: 0.120-0.434, P=0.008).Conclusion:Antiviral therapy improved the prognosis of hepatitis B virus-related HCC up to 3 cm. Antiviral therapy should be considered a standard postoperative adjuvant therapy of hepatitis B virus-related HCC.
