The number of hepatectomies performed for metastatic cancer has dramatically increased over the past 2 decades. Hepatectomy for stage IV colorectal cancer is now considered the standard of care for resectable patients with isolated hepatic disease and acceptable performance status. However, the indications for resection of noncolorectal origin liver metastases are not as clearly defined. This review focuses on emerging data for the resection of noncolorectal metastatic disease to the liver, with a focus on indications for surgical resection. Specifically, we review the current data on the surgical management of nonneuroendocrine and neuroendocrine tumors metastatic to the liver.
