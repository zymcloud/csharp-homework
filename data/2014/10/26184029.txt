Neuroendocrine tumors consist of a spectrum of malignancies that arise from neuroendocrine cells throughout the body. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are rare tumors, with an incidence of 3.65 per 100,000 individuals per year, and they account for 1-2 % of all pancreatic neoplasms. A non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor with multiple liver metastases with calcifications was diagnosed in a 43-year-old female with diabetes mellitus. Early phase-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a hypovascular mass in the pancreatic body and tail with calcifications and multiple liver metastatic masses with calcifications. Percutaneous liver biopsy showed homogenous nuclear chromatins and tumor cells with acidophilic cytoplasm against the hyaline interstitium, and a non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor was diagnosed. An interesting clinical image of a metastasis from a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor is presented in which multiple liver tumors were accompanied by dystrophic calcifications. CT and percutaneous liver biopsy play an important role in the diagnosis of a non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, and are valuable diagnostic methods in planning treatment.
