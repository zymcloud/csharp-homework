Background and objective:Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is an immunoregulatory cytokine produced by T cells and plays an important role in antitumor immunity. Variations in the DNA sequence of the IL-2 gene may lead to altered cytokine production and/or activity, and thus modulate an individual's susceptibility to hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-related HCC). To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether IL-2 gene polymorphisms and its serum levels are associated with HBV-related HCC in a Chinese population.Methods:The +114T/G and -384T/G polymorphisms in the IL-2 gene were examined in 115 cases of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 67 cases of HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC), 107 cases of HBV-related HCC, and 105 healthy controls by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and DNA sequencing. The serum IL-2 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Results:We found that there were significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of the IL-2 gene +114T/G polymorphism between the HBV-related HCC patients and the healthy controls. The +114 TG and GG genotypes were associated with a significant increased HCC risk as compared with the TT genotype (OR=1.988, 95% CI, 1.034-3.480, P=0.009 for TG genotype, and OR=1.975, 95% CI, 1.012-3.341, P=0.013 for GG genotype, respectively). The +114 G allele was correlated with a significant increased HCC risk as compared with the T allele (OR=1.423, 95% CI, 1.023-1.975, P=0.031). In addition, we found significant decreased serum IL-2 in HBV-related HCC patients (288.6±177.1ng/L) compared with healthy controls (238.2±136.7ng/L) (t=2.32, P=0.021). Genotypes carrying the +114 G variant allele were associated with decreased serum IL-2 levels compared with the homozygous wild-type genotype in HBV-related HCC patients.Conclusion:The results suggested that the IL-2 +114T/G polymorphism may contribute to increased HBV-related HCC risk through regulating the serum IL-2 levels. Further large and well-designed studies in diverse ethnic populations are needed to confirm our results.
