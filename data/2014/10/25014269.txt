Background and objective:Available evidence has suggested that estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) is implicated in the pathogenic process of hepatitis B infection. Therefore, we evaluated the association of PvuII (rs2234693) and XbaI (rs9340799) in ESR1 and HBV infection in Guangxi Zhuang populations.Methods:A total of 389 subjects were divided into four groups: 112 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 65 patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver cirrhosis (LC), 107 patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and 105 healthy controls. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism strategy was used to detect ESR1 gene PvuII and XbaI polymorphisms.Results:Compared with healthy controls, binary logistic regression analyses show that the CC genotype of PvuII was associated with a significantly increased susceptibility to CHB compared with the TT genotype (OR=1.760, 95% CI 1.316-2.831; p=0.044). The PvuII CC genotype was also associated with significantly increased risk of HBV-related LC (OR=1.921, 95% CI 1.342-2.478; p=0.043). Similarly, the subjects bearing the homozygous CC genotype of PvuII polymorphism also had more than a 1.7-fold increased risk for development of HCC (OR=1.748, 95% CI 1.313-2.787; p=0.010) compared with those bearing the TT genotype. Furthermore, the AC haplotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of HCC with an OR of 1.456 (p=0.003). In contrast, there were no significant differences in the genotype and allele of XbaI polymorphisms in the ESR1 gene between the groups of patients and healthy controls. In addition, ESR1 polymorphisms were not significantly associated with susceptibility to HBV-related HCC when using CHB and LC patients as references.Conclusion:We conclude that the CC genotype of PvuII in ESR1 is associated with an increased risk of CHB, HBV-related LC and HCC in Guangxi Zhuang populations.
