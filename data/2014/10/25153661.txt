Background:Recently, a genome-wide association study conducted in Chinese reported a single nucleotide polymorphism at KIF1B, rs17401966, associated with the susceptibility of hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, we aim to investigate the effect of rs17401966 on the prognosis of hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma patients at intermediate or advanced stages.Methods:The SNP rs17401966 was genotyped using the TaqMan allelic discrimination assay in 414 intermediate or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models were used for survival analyses.Results:Previous studies have identified that the G allele of rs17401966 demonstrated protective effect for the susceptibility of hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we found that subjects carrying the G allele of rs17401966 was significantly associated with a better survival compared with those carrying the A allele (adjusted hazard ratio=0.82, 95% confidence intervals=0.68-0.99, P=0.044 in an additive genetic model).Conclusion:The variant G allele of rs17401966 may be a favorable biomarker for the prognosis of intermediate or advanced hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma patients in this Chinese population.
