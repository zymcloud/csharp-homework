Background/aims:Data about the clinical course after liver resection for HCC in non-cirrhotic liver (NCL) is rare in western countries. Although the patients with HCC in NCL tolerate major liver resections, it is less clear if an underlying steatosis or NASH increase the perioperative and postoperative risk. The purpose of this study was to characterize the clinical course after hepatic resection in patients with HCC in the absence of liver cirrhosis and in the absence of viral hepatitis.Methodology:The data of 148 patients with HCC in non-cirrhotic liver, who underwent curatively intented liver resection, were analyzed. Patients with hepatitis B or C infection were excluded. Patients with fibrolamellar HCC or liver cirrhosis or fibrosis higher than grade 2 according to the Desmet-Scheuer score were also excluded.Results:The overall 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 75.4%, 54.7% and 38.9%. Increased patient age (elder than 70 years) influenced the cumulative survival significantly. Especially the combination of increased patient age and major resection (>2 segments) at once influenced the cumulative survival. The overall postoperative morbidity was 37.8 %. No intraoperative death was observed. Postoperative increased leucocytes, urea and creatinin increased the postoperative complications. In the subgroup with major resection increased GGT correlated with steatosis, and raised AST correlated with elevated patient age.Conclusions:In Western countries HCC in non-cirrhotic liver is rare. Liver resection is safe and is the only curative therapy option for the time by HCC without liver cirrhosis. Further studies are necessary for identification of more prognostic factors and optionally special treatment
