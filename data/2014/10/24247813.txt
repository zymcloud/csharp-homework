Goals:The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to evaluate the prognostic and diagnostic significance of serum/plasma osteopontin (OPN) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Background:The prognostic and diagnostic value of serum/plasma OPN) in HCC remain controversial.Study:Eligible studies were identified through a systematic literature search. A meta-analysis of 8 studies (4 for prognosis and 4 for diagnosis, 1399 patients) was performed to estimate the association between serum/plasma-based OPN elevation and overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in HCC patients, and to evaluate the accuracy of plasma OPN and Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) in the diagnosis of HCC. Subgroup analyses were also performed in the meta-analysis.Results:We found that serum/plasma-based OPN elevation was significantly associated with poor OS (HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.47-2.61; PConclusions:The current evidence indicates that serum/plasma-based OPN seems to have significant predictive ability for estimating survival in HCC, and plasma OPN has a comparable accuracy to AFP for the diagnosis of HCC, although the diagnostic value of plasma OPN for early or AFP-negative HCC remains to be assessed by further studies.
