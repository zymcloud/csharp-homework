Background:Prevalence of gastroduodenal lesions is changing in the last decades. Prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be involved in such a phenomenon. We assessed gastroduodenal lesions prevalence in a nationwide study.Materials and methods:Consecutive patients who underwent upper endoscopy for the first time in 24 Italian centres between January 2012 and 31 March 2012 were enrolled. Prevalence of gastric ulcer (GU), duodenal ulcer (DU), gastric erosions (GE), duodenal erosions (DE), gastric polyp (GP), Barrett's oesophagus (BE), and neoplasia was assessed.Results:Overall, 1054 (M/F: 388/666; Mean age: 57.5 Â± 5 years) patients were enrolled. H. pylori infection was detected in 356 (33.9%) patients, 358 (34%) were taking NSAIDs, and 532 (50.5%) PPIs. PPI therapy was associated with a significantly lower H. pylori detection rate (27.8% vs 39.8%; OR: 0.6, 95% CI 0.45-0.77; P<0.001). GU, DU, GE, DE, GP and BE were detected in 17 (1.6%), 13 (1.2%), 150 (14.2%), 50 (4.7%), 51 (4.8%) and 17 (1.6%), respectively. Moreover, 3 (0.3%) distal gastric cancers were observed. H. pylori infection remained the most prevalent factor for all gastroduodenal lesions, but gastric polyp. One third of patients with GU and GE were taking only NSAIDs therapy.Conclusions:The prevalence of peptic ulcer was very low (<3%), with a similar rate between DU and GU. As many as half patients were on ongoing PPI therapy. Such a therapy could affect both the detection rate of H. pylori infection and the real prevalence of gastroduodenal lesions.
