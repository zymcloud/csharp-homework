Objective:Total bilirubin (TB) of >7 mg/dl is an accepted definition of postoperative hepatic insufficiency (PHI) given its association with the occurrence of complications and mortality after hepatectomy. The aim of this study was to identify a surrogate marker for PHI early in the postoperative course.Methods:A single-institution database of patients undergoing major hepatectomy (three or more segments) during 2000-2012 was retrospectively reviewed. Demographic, clinicopathologic and perioperative factors were assessed for their association with PHI, defined as postoperative TB of >7 mg/dl or new ascites. Secondary outcomes included complications, major complications (Clavien-Dindo Grades III-V) and 90-day mortality.Results:A total of 607 patients undergoing major hepatectomy without bile duct reconstruction were identified. Postoperative hepatic insufficiency occurred in 60 (9.9%) patients. A postoperative day 3 (PoD 3) TB level of ≥3 mg/dl was the only early perioperative factor associated with the development of PHI on multivariate analysis [hazard ratio (HR) = 7.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.74-16.31; P < 0.001]. A PoD 3 TB of ≥3 mg/dl was associated with increased risk for postoperative complications (75.7% versus 53.9%), major complications (45.6% versus 17.6%), and 90-day mortality (15.5% versus 2.3%). This association persisted on multivariate analysis for any complications (HR = 1.98, 95% CI 1.10-3.54; P = 0.022), major complications (HR = 3.18, 95% CI 1.90-5.32; P < 0.001), and 90-day mortality (HR = 8.11, 95% CI 3.00-21.92; P < 0.001).Conclusions:Total bilirubin of ≥3 mg/dl on PoD 3 after major hepatectomy is associated with PHI, increased complications, major complications and 90-day mortality. This marker may serve as an early postoperative predictor of hepatic insufficiency.
