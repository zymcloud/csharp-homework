Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most malignant of brain tumors, is characterized by extensive vascularization and a high degree of invasion. The current standard of care is not very effective, resulting in tumor recurrence with patients rarely surviving over 2 years. This tumor recurrence is attributed to the presence of chemo and radiation resistant glioma stem cells (GSCs). These cells are associated with vascular niches which regulate GSC self-renewal and survival. Recent studies suggest that while blood vessels support glioma stem cells, these tumor cells in turn may regulate and contribute to the tumor vasculature by transdifferentiating into endothelial cells directly or through the secretion of regulatory growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatoma derived growth factor (HDGF). The relationship between the tumor vasculature and the glioma stem cells is the subject of this review.
