Aim:The apelin-APJ system regulates angiogenesis, and is overexpressed in several types of cancer. The aim of this study was to clarify the role of the apelin-APJ system in the angiogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Expressions of angiogenic factors and vascular markers were investigated in specimens from 90 HCC patients. A subcutaneous HCC tumor mouse model was treated with the APJ antagonist, F13A, and tumor growth and vascular development were assessed.Results:APJ expression was observed in arteriole-smooth muscle. Higher amounts of APJ(+)-arteriole and apelin were detected in tumors (pConclusion:Apelin-APJ is overexpressed, and works as a signal for arteriogenesis in HCC.
