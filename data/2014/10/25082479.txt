Purpose:To evaluate safety, feasibility and overall survival rates for transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) alone or combined with MR-guided laser-induced-thermotherapy (LITT) in liver metastases of non-colorectal and non-breast cancer origin.Methods and materials:Included were patients with unresectable non-colorectal non-breast cancer liver metastases with progression under systemic chemotherapy. Excluded were patients with Karnofsky score ≤ 70, respiratory, renal and cardiovascular failure, and general TACE contraindications. TACE using Mitomycin alone, Mitomycin-Gemcitabine or Mitomycin-Gemcitabine-Cisplatin was performed to all patients. After TACE 146 metastases were ablated with MR-guided LITT. To be eligible for LITT metastases should be < 5 cm in size and ≤ 5 in number. Tumor response was evaluated using MRI according to RECIST. Survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis.Results:A total of 110 patients (mean age 59.2 years) with 371 metastases received TACE (mean 5.4 sessions/patient, n=110) with 76 (69%) receiving LITT (mean 1.6 session/patient) afterwards. TACE resulted in a mean decrease of mean maximum diameter of 52% ± 26.6 and volume change of -68.5% ± 22.9 in the 25 patients (23%) with partial response. Stable disease (n=59, 54%). Progressive disease (n=26, 23%). The RECIST outcome after LITT showed complete response (n=13, 17%), partial response (n=1, 1%), stable situation (n=41, 54%) and progressive disease (n=21, 28%). The mean time to progression (TTP) was 8.6 months. Median survival of all patients was 21.1 months.Conclusion:TACE with different protocols alone and in combination with LITT is a feasible palliative treatment option resulting in a median survival of 21.1 months for unresectable liver metastases of non-colorectal and non-breast cancer origin.
