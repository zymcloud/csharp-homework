Background & aims:Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is typically associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly ulcerative colitis (UC). PSC-IBD patients are at an increased risk for colorectal neoplasia. The ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is a treatment option for patients with medically refractory UC or neoplasia. However, little is known about the development of pouch neoplasia in PSC-UC patients following an IPAA. We aim to describe the incidence of pouch neoplasia in PSC-UC patients after an IPAA.Methods:We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PSC and IBD who underwent colectomy with IPAA followed by pouch surveillance between 1995 and 2012.Results:Sixty-five patients were included in the cohort and were followed up from the time of colectomy/IPAA for a median of 6years. The most common indications for surgery were low-grade dysplasia (LGD) and refractory colitis. Only 3 patients developed evidence of neoplasia (LGD n=1, high-grade dysplasia n=1, adenocarcinoma n=1). The cumulative 5-year incidence of pouch neoplasia was 5.6% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.8%-16.1%).Conclusion:Based on our short-term follow-up, surveying the pouch frequently appears to be an unnecessary practice in PSC-IBD patients. Longer follow-up will be needed to develop an optimal surveillance strategy for the development of dysplasia and cancer in such patients.
