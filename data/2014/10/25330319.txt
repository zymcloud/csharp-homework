Purpose:The aim of this study is to determine the predictive value of preoperative blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) for recurrence in recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (RHCC) patients following thermal ablation.Material and methods:This retrospective study enrolled 506 RHCC patients who underwent thermal ablation from April 2006 to April 2014. The clinicopathological parameters including NLR were evaluated to identify predictors of recurrence rate after thermal ablation. A Cox multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the parameters that predicted recurrence in RHCC patients. The best cutoff value of NLR was determined with time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate was determined in patients with high and low NLR.Results:The multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analysis showed that NLR was a prognostic factor in recurrence-free survival. NLR â‰¥ 2.14 was evaluated (AUROC = 0.824; PConclusion:Our results show that preoperative NLR is a predictor for re-recurrence after thermal ablation in RHCC patients. Additionally, patients with NLR
