Background:This pilot study aimed to test the possibility of therapeutic benefit imparted by early intervention based on sequential tumour marker (TM) measurements during follow-up of primary breast cancer (PBC) patients.Methods:Patients with oestrogen receptor positive PBC with no clinical and/or radiological evidence of metastases were recruited and followed-up 3-monthly with clinical assessment and TM (CA15.3 and CEA) measurements. The clinical team was blinded to the TM results. Asymptomatic patients who developed raised TMs (based on pre-defined cut-offs) were randomised to either 'treatment change' (either start or change of adjuvant endocrine agent to another agent) or 'no change' (control). Patients who developed symptomatic metastases came off the study. The primary and secondary endpoints were intervals from randomisation to symptomatic metastases and to last follow-up/death respectively.Results:Eighty-five patients (median age = 54 years (30-72)) were recruited with a median follow-up of 81 months (1-124). Sixteen patients were randomised as described. There was no significant difference (treatment change versus no change) with regards to interval from randomisation to symptomatic metastases - 23 (2-62) and 22 (1-63) months respectively (p = 0.9), as well as interval from randomisation to last follow-up/death - 36 (7-63) and 37 (10-63) months respectively (p = 0.9).Conclusions:Despite long follow-up (up to 10+ years), this small study has thus far shown no significant difference in outcome. However, we have confirmed the feasibility of this study design but a larger study will be required to show if there is a benefit to this approach.
