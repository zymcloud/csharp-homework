Melanoma-associated antigens (MAGE)-A9 has been reported to play important roles in the development of human cancers. However, the association between MAGE-A9 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well understood. The study was to detect the expression of MAGE-A9 in human HCC and investigate the association between its expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of HCC. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), one-step quantitative -PCR (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses were performed to characterize the expression of MAGE-A9 in HCC cell lines and tissues. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses were employed to evaluate the prognosis of 100 HCC patients. The results showed that the expression of MAGE-A9 in HCC was significantly higher than that in non-cancerous cells and tissues. Moreover, the expression level of the MAGE-A9 protein in HCC was related to the pathological grade (p = 0.003), portal vein invasion (p = 0.001), distant metastasis (p = 0.022) and TNM stage (p = 0.005). Cox regression analysis further revealed that MAGE-A9 expression is an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (p = 0.006) and overall survival (p = 0.022). These data are the first to indicate that MAGE-A9 expression is a valuable prognostic biomarker for HCC and that high MAGE-A9 expression suggests unfavorable survival outcomes in HCC patients.
