Stereotactic radiotherapy is a high-precision technique based on the administration of high doses to a limited target volume. This treatment constitutes a therapeutic progress in the management of many tumours, especially hepatic ones. If surgery remains the standard local therapy, stereotactic radiotherapy is first dedicated to inoperable patients or unresectable tumours. Patients with moderately altered general status, preserved liver function and tumour lesions limited in number as in size are eligible to this technique. Results in terms of local control are satisfying, regarding primary tumours (notably hepatocellular carcinomas) as metastases stemming from various origins. If treatment protocols and follow-up modalities are not standardized to this day, iconographic acquisition using four-dimensional computed tomography, target volumes delineation based on morphological and/or metabolic data, and image-guided radiotherapy contribute to an oncologic efficacy and an improved sparing of the functional liver. The purpose of this literature review is to report the results of the main works having assessed stereotactic radiotherapy in the management of primary and secondary liver tumours. Technical particularities of this radiation modality will also be described.
