Diethyl maleate (DEM) is a thiol-depleting agent frequently employed in cell culture analyses. Here, we investigated the effect of DEM exposure on insulin signaling at the level of FoxO transcription factor activity and its potential consequences for stress resistance and life span. Exposure of HepG2 human hepatoma cells to subcytotoxic concentrations of DEM resulted in nuclear accumulation of overexpressed EGFP-tagged FoxO1a. DEM-induced nuclear accumulation overrode insulin-induced nuclear exclusion of FoxO1a. Despite a slightly enhanced FoxO DNA binding activity in DEM-exposed cells, expression of FoxO-regulated genes (glucose 6-phosphatase, selenoprotein P) was downregulated, indicating that nuclear accumulation does not necessarily coincide with enhanced transcription factor activity. To test for an effect of DEM on organismal stress resistance, we exposed C. elegans roundworms to the thiol depletor. Survival in the presence of the redox cycler paraquat was significantly increased following exposure to DEM, implying that DEM pre-exposure induced cellular resistance against oxidative stress. Furthermore, in DEM-exposed C. elegans populations expressing a GFP-tagged version of the C. elegans FoxO ortholog, DAF-16, numbers of worms with predominantly nuclear DAF-16 increased - in line with the findings from HepG2 cells. In keeping with the known function of DAF-16 in stress resistance, C. elegans life span was elevated upon exposure to DEM in a concentration-dependent manner. A maximum extension of life span and deceleration of aging was achieved at 100 Âµ? of DEM. In summary, exposure to DEM caused a modulation of FoxO subcellular localization in both HepG2 cells and C. elegans roundworms, followed by a modulation of life span and stress resistance in C. elegans.
