There is limited information on chemotherapeutic agent doses suitable for patients with metastatic cancer who suffer from and irreversible hepatic impairment and who could potentially benefit from chemotherapy and on their results. In this retrospective study, we aimed to share our centerâ€™s experience of Gemcitabine + Platinum Combination chemotherapy in these patients. Data of 13 patients matching the criteria were analyzed. In our study the patients were treated with a dose of Gemcitabine + Platinum Combination, 50% of the original dose and the dose was increased gradually on the following days. Thirteen of one patient was given Gemcitabine & Carboplatin protocol and the others were given Gemcitabine & Cisplatin . In 42 chemotherapy cycles in total grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia occurred after 7 cycles, grade 3-4 neutropenia was not observed. While liver functions in 8 patients improved slightly, no change was observed in 2 patients and in 3 patients they deteriorated. Total survival period was calculated as 3.78 (95CI% : 0,17-7.54) months. As a consequence, Gemcitabine + Platinum Combination chemotherapy in patients with metastatic cancer who suffer from severe and irreversible hepatic impairment can be implemented when clinical benefits are expected.
