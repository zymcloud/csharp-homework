Aim:To investigate the feasibility and procedural value of catheter-directed contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CCEUS) compared with catheter-directed computed tomography arteriography (CCTA) in patients undergoing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) guided by digital subtraction angiography (DSA).Materials and methods:From December 2010 to December 2011, a pilot study was conducted including nine patients (mean age 66.6 years; SD 8.3 years; seven men) undergoing TACE with drug-eluting beads for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Both CCEUS and CCTA were performed in addition to DSA. Alterations of treatment plan based on CCEUS were recorded and compared with CCTA.Results:CCEUS provided additional information to DSA altering the treatment plan in four out of nine patients (44.4%). In these four patients, CCEUS helped to identify additional tumour feeders (n = 2) or led to a change in catheter position (n = 2). The information provided by CCEUS was similar to that provided by CCTA.Conclusion:CCEUS is a potentially valuable imaging tool in adjunction to DSA when performing TACE and may provide similar information to CCTA.
