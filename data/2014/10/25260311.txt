Molecular profiling of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is enabling the advancement of novel approaches to disease diagnosis and management. Accurate prognosis prediction in HCC is specially critical. Clinical staging systems for HCC support clinical decision-making (e.g., BCLC algorithm) might be complemented by molecular-based information in the near future. Molecular signatures derived from tumour and non-tumour samples are associated with patient recurrence an outcome. Single nucleotide polymorphisms have been linked with HCC development. Next generation sequencing studies have brought to light the genomic diversity of this disease. Gens recurrently altered in HCC and susceptible to be targeted belong to signalling pathways including telomere maintenance, cell cycle, chromatin remodelling, Wnt/beta-catenin, RAS/RAF/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. Oncogenic loops are unknown but might include some of the already discovered aberrations. Despite the intratumoral heterogeneity observed in HCC tumours, studies including large number of samples can identify key genetic drivers and contribute to the development of novel treatments and a personalized medicine.
