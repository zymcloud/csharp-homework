Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and is one of the most prevalent liver disorders worldwide. NAFLD can gradually progress to liver inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the pathogenesis of NAFLD is complex, and no efficient pharmaceutic treatments have yet been established for NAFLD. Accumulating data have shown that the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays important roles not only in bile acid metabolism, but also in lipid and carbohydrate homeostasis, inflammatory responses, among others. In this review, we aim to highlight the role of FXR in the pathogenesis and treatment of NAFLD.
