In the present study, Frizzled-2 (Fz2), a receptor of the Wnt ligand, was investigated as a potential target of molecular therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to determine the expression levels of Fz2. A surgical specimen of HCC was immunostained with an Fz2 antibody. A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt assay was performed on HCC cell lines, including HLF and Hep3B, 72 h after the transfection of the short hairpin (sh)RNA of Fz2 (shRNA-Fz2). RNA was isolated from the Hep3B and HLF cells 48 h after transfection and subjected to quantitative PCR. All cell lines had elevated levels of Fz2 compared with those in an adult liver. The highest and lowest expression levels of Fz2 were 246.9±15.7 in the HLF cells and 5.8±1.4 in the Hep3B cells, respectively. Fz2 was expressed in the tumorous HCC tissue, but not in the surrounding non-tumorous tissue. Cell proliferation was suppressed to 28.6±6.4% in the HLF cells and to 29.8±4.3% in the Hep3B cells at 100 ng shRNA-Fz2 per well. Levels of cyclin D1 expression decreased to 65.2±5.9% in the HLF cells and to 60.8±14.6% in the Hep3B cells at 2.5 μg per well. In conclusion, Fz2 was upregulated in the HCC cells. shRNA-Fz2 suppressed the proliferation of the Hep3B and HLF cells, decreasing Fz2 expression. As it was not expressed in the surrounding non-tumorous tissue, Fz2 may be an ideal molecular therapeutic target for HCC.
