TGF-β1 was inversely correlated with E-cadherin but significantly correlated with VEGF. VEGF and AFP had a low coefficient value but statistically significant. A significant correlation was found between E-cadherin and MMP2. In conclusion, TGF-β and E-cadherin are inversely correlated in HCC patients' sera and not related to the BCLC classification nor survival but rather to the biological properties of the tumor.
