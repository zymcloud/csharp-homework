Purpose:To investigate the potential role for CD44(+) and CD90(+) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cellular subpopulations in biological response to thermal ablation-induced heat stress.Methods:This study was approved by the institutional animal care committee. The N1S1 rat HCC cell line was subjected to sublethal heat stress (45 °C) or control (37 °C) for 10 min, costained with fluorescent-labeled antibodies against CD44, CD90, and 7-AAD after a 48-h recovery and analyzed by flow cytometry to assess the percentage of live CD44(+) and CD90(+) HCC cells (n = 4). Experiments were repeated with pretreatment of N1S1 cells with a dose titration of the dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 or vehicle control (n = 3). Rats bearing orthotopic N1S1 tumors were subjected to ultrasound-guided partial laser ablation (n = 5) or sham ablation (n = 3), euthanized 24 h after ablation, and liver/tumor analyzed for immunohistochemical staining of CD44 and CD90. Differences between groups were compared with an unpaired t test.Results:Sublethal heat stress induced a significant increase in the relative proportion of live CD44(+) and CD90(+) HCC cells compared to the control group: CD44(+)CD90(-) (5.3-fold; p = 0.0001), CD44(-)CD90(+) (2.4-fold; p = 0.003), and CD44(+)CD90(+) (22.0-fold; p 0.10). Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated preferential localization of clusters of CD44(+) cells at both the tumor margin and ablation margin.Conclusion:These studies provide experimental evidence supporting a role for HCC cells expressing the putative stem cell marker CD44 in HCC response to heat stress.
