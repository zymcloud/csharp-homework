Aim:Insulin resistance (IR) increases during the early stages of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related chronic liver disease and is a sign of poor prognosis as well as a risk factor for hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to determine the factors affecting IR in HCV-related chronic liver disease.Methods:We retrospectively examined 71 patients with HCV-related chronic liver disease and analyzed various parameters, including amino acids, as possible predictors of IR. IR was assessed using the Homeostasis Model of Assessment - Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). Amino acids were assayed by examining branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), tyrosine level, and the ratio of BCAA to tyrosine level (BTR).Results:HOMA-IR was significantly correlated with body mass index, platelet count, prothrombin time, hemoglobin, total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, total cholesterol, fasting glucose, BTR (r = -0.46, P = 0.0001) and tyrosine (r = 0.55, P Conclusion:Serum tyrosine levels may be associated with IR in patients with HCV-related chronic liver disease.
