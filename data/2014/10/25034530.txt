Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA is prone to mutations because of the proofreading deficiencies of HBV polymerase. The postoperative prognostic value of HBV mutations in HBV X protein (HBx) gene was assessed in HBV associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. The HBx gene was amplified and sequenced, the HBV mutations was identified according to NCBI database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/5536 ). The relationship between the HBV mutations and HCC survival was compared. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and comparisons between the curves were made using the log-rank test. Multivariate survival analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model. After adjusting for clinical characteristics, the following eight mutational sites were identified as statistically significant independent predictors of HCC survival: 1383, 1461, 1485, 1544, 1613, 1653, 1719, and 1753. In addition, the following four mutational sites were identified for their association with survival at a border-line significance level: 1527, 1637, 1674, and 1762/1764. A total of 12 mutations in HBx gene region were identified as independent predictors of postoperative survival in HCC patients. The analysis of HBV DNA mutations may help identify patient subgroups with poor prognosis and may help refine therapeutic decisions regarding HCC patients.
