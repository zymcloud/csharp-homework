Background/aims:So far, prognostic significance and risk factors of early recurrence after curative resection in large hepatocellular carcinoma (LHCC) remain unclear. The present study aimed to answer these questions.Methodology:Clinical, pathologic and follow-up data of consecutive 116 patients with LHCC (>5cm) after curative resection were collected and analyzed. The recurrence pattern of LHCC was also compared with that of 55 patients with small HCC (SHCC, â‰¤5cm).Results:Forty-five patients (38.8%) with LHCC developed recurrence within 1 year after surgery (defined as early recurrence), with a significantly higher ratio contrast to those with SHCC. Univariate analysis showed that age, HBsAg positivity, satellite nodule, TNM stage, resection extent and early recurrence served as significant indicators of post-recurrence overall survival in recurrent LHCC. In addition, only early recurrence was proven to be significant in multivariate Cox regression test. On the other hand, age, HBsAg positivity, portal vein tumor thrombosis, microvascular invasion, TNM stage, Edmondson-Steiner grade and resection extentwere related to early recurrence in LHCC. Among them, microvascular invasion and Edmondson-Steiner grade were independent predictors.Conclusions:Patients with early recurrence carried very poor post-recurrence prognosis in LHCC. The microvascular involvement and differentiation grade might be particularly helpful for prediction of early recurrence.
