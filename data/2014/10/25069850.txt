Cell division cycle 20 (CDC20) encodes a regulatory protein interacting with the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) in the cell cycle and plays important roles in tumorigenesis and progression of multiple tumors. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of CDC20 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the role of CDC20 in the progression of HCC. By bioinformatics analysis, CDC20 was found to be the major node in HCC molecular interaction networks. Quantitative PCR and western blot analyses were applied to examine CDC20 expression in 16 paired primary HCC tissues. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to examine CDC20 protein expression in 132 matched paraffin-embedded HCC tissues and to analyze the relationship between CDC20 staining and clinical characteristics. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting CDC20 was synthesized and transfected into HepG2 cells to investigate the role of CDC20 in cell growth and the cell cycle. Results show that CDC20 expression was upregulated in HCC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor liver tissues. In the 132 matched HCC tissues, high expression levels of CDC20 were detected in 68.18% HCC samples, and overexpression of CDC20 was positively correlated with gender (P=0.013), tumor differentiation (P=0.000), TNM stage (P=0.012), P53 and Ki-67 expression (P=0.023 and P=0.007, respectively). Cells transfected with CDC20 siRNA showed a decrease in cell proliferation and increase in the number of cells in G2/M-phase. In conclusion, increased expression of CDC20 was demonstrated to be associated with the development and progression of HCC, and may be regarded as a promising therapeutic target for HCC.
