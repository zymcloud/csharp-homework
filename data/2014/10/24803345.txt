Background:Although several studies have reported the outcomes of surgery for the treatment of liver metastases of gastric cancer (GLM), indications for liver resection for gastric metastases remain controversial. This study was designed to identify prognostic determinants that identify operable hepatic metastases from gastric cancer and to evaluate the actual targets of surgical therapy.Methods:Retrospective analysis was performed on outcomes for 24 consecutive patients at five institutions who underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer followed by curative hepatectomy for GLM between 2000 and June 2012.Results:Overall 5-year survival and median survival were 40.1 % and 22.3 months, respectively. Uni- and multivariate analyses showed that liver metastatic tumour size less than 5 cm was the most important predictor of overall survival (OS, p = 0.03). Four patients survived >5 years. Repeat hepatectomy was performed in three patients. Two of these patients have remained disease-free since the repeat hepatectomy.Conclusions:GLM patients with metastatic tumour diameter less than 5 cm maximum are the best candidates for hepatectomy. Hepatic resection should be considered as an option for gastric cancer patients with liver metastases.
