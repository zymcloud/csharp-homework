Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide and develops against a background of chronic liver damage. A variety of HCC-related genes are known to be altered by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Therefore, information regarding alteration of the genetic and epigenetic profiles in HCC is essential for understanding the biology of this type of tumor. Methylation at CpG sites in gene promoters is known to affect the transcription of the corresponding genes. Abnormal regional hypermethylation is observed in the 5' region of several tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in HCC, and this hypermethylation may promote carcinogenesis through the transcriptional inactivation of downstream TSGs. The DNA damage induced by oxidation is a trigger of abnormal DNA methylation and inactivation of TSGs through recruitment of the polycomb repressive complex to the promoter sequence. Thus, oxidative stress may be responsible for the emergence of HCC from chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis through the epigenetic alteration of TSGs. There have been several attempts to apply epigenetic information to the diagnosis and treatment of HCC. The predictive value of selected methylation events on survival in HCC patients has been reported, and the methylation profile of background liver could be associated with recurrence-free survival of HCC patients who have undergone hepatectomy. Another study detected methylated DNA from HCC cells in serum, and the circulating tumor DNA was regarded as a potential tumor marker. In addition, several trials of HCC therapy have targeted the epigenetic machinery and were based upon comprehensive analyses of DNA methylation of this type of tumor. Here, we present an overview of research regarding DNA methylation status in human HCC and describe the clinical application of epigenetic information to HCC.
