Objective:To evaluate safety, efficacy, survival and recurrence-free survival of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with drug eluting (DC) beads combined with MR-guided radiofrequency (RF) ablation for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) larger than 3 cm.Materials and methods:This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. 20 patients (69.6 years ± SD 8.8) with HCC underwent DC Bead TACE and subsequent MR-guided RF ablation. Treatment interval varied between 5 and 15 days. Mean HCC diameter was 39 mm ± SD 7 mm (range 31-50mm). Rates of recurrence-free survival and overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:Technical success rate, primary and secondary technical effectiveness rate were 100%, 90% and 95%, respectively. Local tumour progression developed in one patient. Cumulative survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 90% (Confidence Interval [CI]: 67%-97%), 50% (CI: 29%-70%), 27% (CI: 11%-51%) respectively. Median survival time was 37.4 months. During follow up (mean: 39.1 months ± SD 22.4; range 5-84 months), tumour progression in untreated liver developed in 14 cases. Cumulative recurrence-free survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 48% (CI: 27-69%), 16% (5-39%), 16% (5-39%) respectively. Median recurrence-free survival time was 10.7 months. One major complication occurred due to misdiagnosed local recurrence.Conclusion:In conclusion, we demonstrated that MR-guided RF ablation with subsequent DC Bead TACE is safe and effective in local tumour control in patients with intermediate sized HCC.
