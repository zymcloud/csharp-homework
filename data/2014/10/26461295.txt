Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a global health problem and lead to subacute liver failure, cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. An increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant depletion is found in the liver of obese patients with NAFLD. Irisin is a recently identified exercise-induced myokine. It increases total energy consumption, reduces body weight, and insulin resistance. It was shown that irisin levels were significantly lower in patients with NAFLD. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of irisin on prooxidant-antioxidant balance in liver. In the first phase; AML12 liver cells were divided into 4 groups: control, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-treated, 10nM irisin-treated and 50nM irisin-treated groups. ROS accumulation in these groups was analyzed by FACS. In the second phase; to see if there is any protective role of irisin on ROS production in the liver, AML12 liver cells were divided into 4 groups: control, H2O2 -treated, H2O2+10nM irisin-treated and H2O2+50nM-irisin treated groups. After measuring ROS accumulation again in these groups, the levels of enzymes related with prooxidant-antioxidant balance via oxidative stress in liver were measured by western blotting. In H2O2 treatment groups, ROS production was increased in AML12 liver cells, on the other hand in irisin treatment groups ROS production was slightly changed. Irisin might be a potential target for metabolic diseases like NAFLD.
