Staging and prognosis assessment are critical steps in the management of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. This cancer is a complex disease usually associated with chronic liver disease, and any attempt to assess the prognosis should consider tumour burden, degree of liver function impairment and evaluation of cancer-related symptoms. In addition, for any staging system to be meaningful it has to link staging with treatment indication and this should be based on robust scientific data. Currently, the only proposal that serves both aims is the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system. It divides patients into very early/early, intermediate, advanced and end-stage. Very early/early stage HCC patients should be considered for potentially curative options such as resection, transplantation and ablation. Patients at intermediate stage benefit from chemoembolization, while patients at an advanced stage or who cannot benefit of options of higher priority have sorafenib as standard of care. Finally, patients at end-stage should receive best supportive care.
