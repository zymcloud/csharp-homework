The role of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxygluose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been firmly established yet and its sensitivity has been reported to be in the range of 40-60 %. Because of this relatively low sensitivity alternative tracers have been proposed. The aim of our review is to analyse the literature data on the diagnostic role of (18)F/(11)C-choline PET/CT in the evaluation of HCC. A comprehensive computer literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus databases was conducted to find relevant published articles about the role of whole-body (18)F-choline or (11)C-choline PET or PET/CT in patients with HCC. Furthermore, a meta-analysis about the detection rate of this method in HCC was performed. Six articles were included in this systematic review and discussed. The meta-analysis of five out of six articles showed a DR of 84 % (95 % CI 79-89 %). The DR increased when poorly differentiated HCC was excluded from the analysis. Radiolabelled choline PET or PET/CT could be a valuable tool in detecting HCC and it is better than (18)F-FDG PET/CT, especially in well to moderately differentiated lesions; on the other hand, poorly differentiated and higher-stage HCC could be better evaluated with (18)F-FDG and dual tracer imaging should be considered and could be potentially useful to increase accuracy.
