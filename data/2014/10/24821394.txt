Background:Ablation techniques are widely used for solid malignant tumors in adults. There is no large series assessing the effectiveness of local ablative therapies in the treatment of malignant or aggressive benign lesions in children.Objective:To review the existing evidence on the techniques and results of ablation for pediatric solid malignant or aggressive benign tumors.Materials and methods:We searched MEDLINE for papers published between 1995 and 2012 that reported outcomes of radiofrequency, microwave and cryoablation, interstitial laser therapy, irreversible electroporation and percutaneous ethanol injection for patients younger than 18 years old. Data collection included factors related to the patient, tumor biology, ablation technique and cancer-specific endpoints. Additional series of predominantly adults including data on patients younger than 18 years old were also identified.Results:We identified 28 patients treated by ablation in 29 regions: 5 patients undergoing ablation for liver lesions, 9 patients for lung metastases, 11 patients for bone and/or soft tissue and 4 patients for kidney or pancreas. The ablation was performed to treat primary tumors, local recurrences and metastases. The histology of the tumors was osteosarcoma in 6 patients, Wilms tumor in 3, rhabdomyosarcoma in 3, hepatoblastoma in 3, desmoid tumor in 3, adrenocortical carcinoma in 2 and a single case each of leiomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, paraganglioma, solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm, sacrococcygeal teratoma, hepatic adenoma, juxtaglomerular cell tumor and plantar fibromatosis. Eighteen of the patients (64%) experienced a complication, but only 6 (21%) of these needed treatment other than supportive care.Conclusions:Although ablative techniques are feasible and promising treatments for certain pediatric tumors, large multicenter prospective trials will be needed to establish efficacy.
