Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) frequently leads to cirrhosis with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). CHC therapy is currently changing for the better whereas prognosis for HCC remains dismal if not detected early and thus regular screening in cirrhotic CHC patients for HCC is recommended. CHC is known to be underdiagnosed in Denmark where it is up to the involved physician to screen for risk factors for CHC and increase the patient's chance of a cure for CHC with therapy.
