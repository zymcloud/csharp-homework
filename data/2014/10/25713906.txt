Aims:We performed a retrospective analysis to evaluate the short and long-term impact of simultaneous prophylactic cholecystectomy with hepatectomy in these patients.Methods:We identified 642 patients who underwent curative hepatocellular carcinoma resection between 2001 and 2005 at five university hospitals. One hundred and twenty-five hepatocellular carcinoma patients who received left lateral sectionectomy or partial resection in the left lateral and Spiegel lobes were identified and followed. They were divided into two groups, 74 with and 51 without simultaneous cholecystectomy. None of these patients had gallbladder stones or polyps at preoperative diagnosis.Results:Although not statistically significant, the operating time was longer and blood loss was greater in the cholecystectomy group. Patients in the cholecystectomy group had a significantly higher postoperative morbidity rate. Surgical complications according to the Clavien classification differed significantly between the two groups. Variables significantly associated with complications in the univariate and multivariate analyses were simultaneous cholecystectomy and operative blood loss â‰¥ 1000 ml.Conclusion:Simultaneous cholecystectomy of the asymptomatic gallbladder with curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma in the left lateral section or Spiegel lobe resulted in higher postoperative complications. Consequently, the gallbladder should be preserved except in cases of gallbladder stones or polyps.
