Zinc finger protein X-linked (ZFX) is a zinc finger protein of Zfy family, which is highly conserved in vertebrates. This transcriptional regulator is not only highly expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESC) and hematopoietic stem cells, but is also upregulated in a number of human cancers where it is functional related to cell proliferation and survival. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is highly aggressive cancer that commonly resistant to most chemotherapies and displays stemness characteristics. In this study, we examined the expression of ZFX in HCC and its possible functional implications in liver tumorigenesis. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed common overexpressions of ZFX in 51.8% HCC tumors when compared with their adjacent nonmalignant liver (n = 43/83; p = 0.004). Inline with the pluripotency role of ZFX, we found silencing of ZFX readily inhibited self-renewal capability (p = 0.0022), colony formation ability (p
