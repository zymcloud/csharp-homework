Objective:To share our institutional experience in laparoscopic liver resection and our learning curve after the first 100 cases of laparoscopic liver resection.Design:Case series with internal comparison.Setting:A regional hospital in Hong Kong.Patients:Our institution started performing laparoscopic liver resection since 2006. All patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resections from March 2006 to October 2012 were identified in a prospectively collected database. The demographic data and operative outcomes of these patients were extracted, and results of the early (from March 2006 to May 2010) and late (from June 2010 to October 2012) study periods were compared.Results:Between March 2006 and October 2012, 100 laparoscopic liver resections were performed for 98 patients in the Department of Surgery, Kwong Wah Hospital, Hong Kong. They were 69 (70%) males and 29 (30%) females, and the median age was 65 years. The final histological diagnoses were as follows: hepatocellular carcinoma (n=72), colorectal liver metastases (n=14), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (n=4), and benign disease (n=10). There were more anatomical resections, major hepatectomies as well as resections of more anatomically challenging right-sided and posterosuperior lesions in the late versus the early period; however, operative outcomes remained comparable in both periods.Conclusion:Laparoscopic hepatectomies are feasible with growing experience. Bearing in mind the diversity in the level of operative techniques with various types of laparoscopic liver resections, more experience is needed to overcome the learning curve.
