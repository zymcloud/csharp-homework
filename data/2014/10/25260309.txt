Imaging plays a very important role in the diagnosis of HCC. Indeed, in high-risk patients a noninvasive diagnosis can only be obtained by imaging in presence of typical features. These features include arterial enhancement followed by washout during the portal venous and/or delayed phases on CT scan or MRI. This pattern is quite specific and has been endorsed by both Western and Asian diagnostic guidelines. However, its sensitivity is not very high, especially for small lesions. Therefore ancillary signs may be needed to increase the reliability of the diagnosis. Recent hepatobiliary MRI contrast agents seem to be interesting to improve characterization of small nodules in the cirrhotic liver.
