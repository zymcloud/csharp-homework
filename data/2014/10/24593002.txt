Aims:The aims of our work were to investigate the controlling role and the efficacy of nanocapsulated quercetin drug delivery system on the decrement of inflammatory mediators such as MMP-13 in diethyl nitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.Materials & methods:Hepatocellular carcinoma was developed in the Swiss albino rats by the exposure of DEN. DEN administration caused the generation of reactive oxygen species, upregulation of TNF-Î±, IL-6, activation of MMP-13, severe oxidative damage, hyperplastic nodules with preneoplastic lesions and the histopathological changes in rat liver.Results & conclusion:Nanocapsulated quercetin treatment restricted all alterations in DEN-mediated development of hepatocarcinogenesis. Therefore, it may be concluded that nanocapsulated quercetin may be accepted as a potent therapeutic formulation in preventing DEN-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis.
