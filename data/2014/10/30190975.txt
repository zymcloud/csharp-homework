Within 5 years after percutaneous ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma, roughly 70% of patients experience tumor recurrence. Relapses beyond curative options affected patients' survival. Ablation shares with resection common predictive factors of recurrence as size of the tumor, multinodularity and presence of vascular invasion. High serum Î±-fetoprotein level and markers of severity of underlying liver disease have also been found to be associated with recurrence and even survival. However, predictive values for recurrence of technical factors, histopathological and molecular tumors' features have been rarely studied. Few comparative studies have shown that ablation techniques impact recurrence rates. Moreover, although ablation does not allow analysis of the whole tumor, some reports suggest that biopsies allow histopathological and even molecular testing of the risk of recurrence.
