The aim of this study is to evaluate prognostic factors of brain metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma. Medical records of 95 patients who have been diagnosed of brain metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma between January 2000 and December 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The median age at diagnosis of brain metastases is 56.1 years. Eighty-two patients were male. Median interval from diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma to brain metastases was 29.5 months. Eighty-eight patents had extracranial metastases, and the lung was the most frequent involved organ. Motor weakness was the most frequent presenting symptom (49.5%). Intracranial hemorrhage was present in 71 patients (74.7%). Brain metastases were treated with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) alone in 57 patients, radiosurgery alone in 18, surgery and WBRT in 6, surgery and radiosurgery in 3, surgery alone in 3, radiosurgery and WBRT in 2, and conservative management only in 6. Median overall survival was 3.0 months. Multivariate analysis showed ECOG performance status, Child-Pugh class, AFP level, number of brain lesions, and treatment modality were associated with survival (p
