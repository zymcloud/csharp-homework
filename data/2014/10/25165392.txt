Background:Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) functions as a coenzyme in many cellular processes including one-carbon metabolism and the interconversion and catabolism of amino acids. PLP-dependent enzymes, cystathionine β-synthase and cystathionine γ-lyase, function in transsulfuration but also have been implicated in the production of the endogenous gaseous signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide (H2S) concurrent with the formation of the biomarkers lanthionine and homolanthionine.Objective:Our objective was to determine if H2S production and concurrent biomarker production is affected by vitamin B-6 restriction in a cell culture model.Methods:We used cultured human hepatoma cells and evaluated static intracellular profiles of amino acids and in vivo kinetics of H2S biomarker formation. Cells were cultured for 6 wk in media containing concentrations of pyridoxal that represented severe vitamin B-6 deficiency (15 nmol/L pyridoxal), marginal deficiency (56 nmol/L pyridoxal), adequacy (210 nmol/L pyridoxal), and standard medium formulation providing a supraphysiologic pyridoxal concentration (1800 nmol/L pyridoxal).Results:Intracellular concentrations of lanthionine and homolanthionine in cells cultured at 15 nmol/L pyridoxal were 50% lower (P Conclusion:In view of the physiologic roles of H2S, these results suggest a mechanism that may be involved in the association between human vitamin B-6 inadequacy and its effects on human health.
