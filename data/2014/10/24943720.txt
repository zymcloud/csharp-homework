Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) have been associated in a dose-dependent fashion with an increased risk of post-transplant hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence. The mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) (sirolimus/everolimus) might represent an alternative immunosuppressive regimen with antineoplastic effect. In the present systematic review, the association between mTORi and HCC recurrence after liver transplantation (LT) was evaluated and compared against that of CNIs-treated patients. In total, 3666 HCC liver transplant recipients from 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. Patients under CNIs developed HCC recurrence significantly more frequently, compared with patients under mTORi (448/3227 or 13.8% vs. 35/439 or 8%, P
