In this paper, a series of doxorubicin-loaded and negative-charge-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DOX-MSN/COOH) was successfully prepared and used for imaging and targeting therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma. The nanoparticles were uniform and negatively charged, with a diameter of about 55 nm, and a zeta potential of -20 mV. In vitro study showed that the nanoparticles could easily be endocytosed by liver cancer cells (HepG2) and were well-accumulated in the liver by passive targeting. In vivo study proved the ability of DOX-MSN/COOH to inhibit the tumor growth and prolong the survival time of mice bearing hepatocellular carcinoma in situ, giving better results than free DOX. More importantly, histological examination showed no histopathological abnormalities of normal liver cells and heart cells after the administration of DOX-MSN/COOH, while the treatment with free DOX caused damage to those cells. In conclusion, DOX-MSN/COOH exhibited enhanced antitumor efficacy as well as reduced side effects for liver cancer therapy.
