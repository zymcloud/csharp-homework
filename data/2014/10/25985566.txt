Sorafenib and conventional systemic cytotoxicity chemotherapy are currently being used in parallel for the patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While sorafenib has been proven to improve the prognosis in patients with this malignant disease, however, the outcome of other newly developed systemic chemotherapeutic regimens remains controversial. We evaluated the outcome and safety of patients treated with the SOX regimen (oxaliplatin + S-1) and those treated with sorafenib in a single-center cohort. This retrospective study involved a total of 46 patients with advanced HCC, 22 of which were treated with SOX regimen (oxaliplatin [130 mg/m2] on day 1 and S-1 [80 mg/m2/day] on day 1-14, every 3 weeks), and 24 were daily treated with sorafenib (400 mg, b.i.d.). The median progression-free survival was 3.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7 to 5.6) with SOX and 1.7 months (95% CI, 1.5 to 1.9) with sorafenib, respectively (P = 0.444). The median overall survival in SOX and sorafenib group was 7.6 months (95% CI, 4.3 to 10.9) and 4.7 months (95% CI, 2.7 to 7.3), respectively (P = 0.246). Response rate was 22.2% with SOX and 5.6% with sorafenib, respectively (P = 0.154). The frequent side effects in SOX-treated patients were thrombocytopenia, elevation of transaminase levels and neuropathy, whereas hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea and pruritus were common in sorafenib-treated patients. These preliminary results suggest that the SOX regimen may serve as an effective treatment for patients with advanced HCC, and the treatment-related toxicities were generally well-tolerated.
