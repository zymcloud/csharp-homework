Background:Chronic infection with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the major risk factor of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). This study is to explore the mechanism of sorafenib resistance and find an effective strategy to sensitize HBV-associated HCC to sorafenib.Methods:Cytotoxicity to sorafenib was evaluated in HBV-positive/negative HCC cell lines. Expression of miR-193b and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) protein were assessed by Q-PCR, in situ hybridization and western blot, immunohistochemistry, respectively. A luciferase reporter of Mcl-1 3'-UTR was used for validation as a target of miR-193b. Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry, caspase-3 activity assay and DAPI staining.Result:The IC50 to sorafenib was significantly higher in HBV-positive HCC cells than those without HBV infection. Significant downregulation of miR-193b and a higher level of Mcl-1 were observed in HBV-positive HCC cells and tissues. The activity of Mcl-1 3'-UTR reporter was inhibited by co-transfection with miR-193b mimic. Restoring the expression of miR-193b sensitized HBV-associated HCC cells to sorafenib treatment and facilitated sorafenib-induced apoptosis.Conclusions:Modulation of miRNAs expression might be a potential way to enhance response to sorafenib in HBV-associated HCC.
