Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Only 30%-40% of the patients with HCC are eligible for curative treatments, which include surgical resection as the first option, liver transplantation and percutaneous ablation. Unfortunately, there is a high frequency of tumor recurrence after surgical resection and most HCC seem resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Sorafenib, a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is the only chemotherapeutic option for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients treated with Sorafenib have a significant increase in overall survival of about three months. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop alternative treatments. Due to its role in cell growth and development, the insulin-like growth factor system is commonly deregulated in many cancers. Indeed, the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis has recently emerged as a potential target for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment. To this aim, several inhibitors of the pathway have been developed such as monoclonal antibodies, small molecules, antisense oligonucleotides or small interfering RNAs. However recent studies suggest that, unlike most tumors, HCC development requires increased signaling through insulin growth factor II rather than insulin growth factor I. This may have great implications in the future treatment of HCC. This review summarizes the role of the IGF axis in liver carcinogenesis and the current status of the strategies designed to target the IGF-I signaling pathway for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.
