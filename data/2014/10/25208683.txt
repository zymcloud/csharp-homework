Introduction:We performed a meta-analysis to compare the performance of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18) FDG) positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) with that of gadolinium-enhanced MRI for the detection of liver metastatic cancers.Methods:The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for relevant original articles. The histology and/or imaging follow-up data served as the reference standard. We calculated the pooled sensitivities, specificities, positive likelihood ratios, negative likelihood ratios and constructed summary receiver operating characteristic curves for (18) FDG PET-CT and gadolinium-enhanced MRI, respectively.Results:Ten studies (1105 patients) were included for this meta-analysis. (18) FDG PET-CT has similar patient-based specificity (1.00 and 0.99), positive likelihood ratios (253.1 and 138.2), negative likelihood ratios (0.16 and 0.10) and area under curves (0.99 and 0.99) with gadolinium-enhanced MRI. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI tends to have higher sensitivity (0.91 and 0.84) than (18) FDG PET-CT.Conclusion:Both (18) FDG PET-CT and gadolinium-enhanced MRI have excellent diagnostic performance for the detection of liver metastatic cancer.
