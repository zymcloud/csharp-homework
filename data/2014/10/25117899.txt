Electrostatic interaction is a major driving force in the binding of proteins to highly acidic glycosaminoglycan, such as heparin. Although NMR backbone chemical shifts have generally been used to identify the heparin-binding site on a protein, however, there is no correlation between the binding free energies and the perturbed backbone chemical shifts for individual residues. The binding event occurs at the end of a side chain of basic residue, and does not require causing significant alterations in the backbone environment at a distance of multiple bonds. We used the H2CN NMR pulse sequence to detect heparin binding through the side-chain resonances Hε-Cε-Nζ of Lys and Hδ-Cδ-Nε of Arg in the two proteins of hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2). H2CN titration experiments revealed chemical shift perturbations in the side chains, which were correlated with the free energy changes in various mutants. The residues K19 in HDGF and K125 in FGF2 demonstrated the most significant perturbations, consistent with our previous observation that the two residues are crucial for binding. The result suggests that H2CN NMR provides a precise evaluation for the electrostatic interactions. The discrepancy observed between backbone and side chain chemical shifts is correlated to the solvent accessibility of residues that the K19 and K125 backbones are highly buried with the restricted backbone conformation and are not strongly affected by the events at the end of the side chains.
