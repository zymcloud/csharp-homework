Background:Downregulation of hepatocellular carcinoma related protein 1 (HCRP1) has been reported to be associated with a poor prognosis in a variety of malignant tumors. The purpose of this study was to assess HCRP1 expression in breast cancer and to examine its possible correlation with commonly used prognostic factors, particularly epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).Methods:Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on tumors from 194 patients with primary breast cancer. HCRP1 expression was analyzed along with major clinicopathological variables.Results:HCRP1 protein expression was shown to be correlated with age (P = 0.001), histological grade (P = 0.005), tumor progression (P = 0.013), and death (P = 0.001), but not with tumor size, lymph-node metastasis, or Ki67 status. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that lower HCRP1 expression was significantly correlated with increased short-term survival (P Conclusion:Our results suggest that HCRP1 may play an important role in EGFR regulation and that its decreased expression is an independent predictor of breast cancer, especially in TNBC patients.
