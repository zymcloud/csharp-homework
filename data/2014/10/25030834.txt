Much evidence indicates that microRNAs could play potential roles as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present meta-analysis aimed to systematically evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of circulating microRNAs for HCC. Eligible studies were identified through multiple search strategies and assessed for relevance and quality. Results from different studies were pooled using random-effects models. The quality of each study was scored with the revised quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies tool. The summary receiver operator characteristic (SROC) curve and other measures were used to assess the overall performance of microRNA-based assays. Evidence of heterogeneity was evaluated using the I (2) test. Meta-regressions were conducted to analyze potential sources of heterogeneity. Deeks' test was used to test for potential publication bias. Thirty studies from 13 publications, including 1,314 patients with HCC and 1,407 controls, comprised healthy individuals and patients with hepatitis B/C or cirrhosis, were included in this meta-analysis. For diagnostic meta-analysis, the overall pooled results were as follows: sensitivity was 0.80 (95 % CI 0.74-0.84), specificity was 0.81 (95 % CI 0.74-0.87), positive likelihood ratio was 4.2 (95 % CI 3.0-6.0), negative likelihood ratio was 0.25 (95 % CI 0.19-0.38) and diagnostic odds ratio was 17 (95 % CI 10-29). The area under the SROC curve was 0.86 (95 % CI 0.84-0.90). Subgroup analyses suggested that multiple microRNAs had much better accuracy than single microRNA. Our findings suggest that circulating microRNAs show significant potential as diagnostic markers of HCC, particularly when using multiple microRNAs. However the results of this meta-analysis justify larger, more rigorous studies to confirm our conclusions.
