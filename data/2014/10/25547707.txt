Objective:To explore the clinicopathological characteristics, diagnosis, treatment outcomes and survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and nasopharyngeal multiple primary cancers.Methods:The clinical data of 12 male patients with hepatocellular and nasopharyngeal multiple primary cancers were retrospectively analyzed.Results:Second primary cancer was diagnosed with a median age of 54.5 years. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was detected in 7 patients (58.3%) and 6 cases (50.0%) had a family history of cancer. The treatments included radiochemotherapy (n = 5), radiotherapy (n = 6) and non-therapy (n = 1). And the interventions included hepatic surgery (n = 6), interventional treatment (n = 4) and conservative (n = 2). The 1, 3 and 5-year overall survival rates were 90.9%, 81.8% and 58.4% and the HCC-specific survival rates 80.0% at 1 year and 57.1% at 3 years respectively. The HCC-specific survival rates of surgery group were significantly better than those of the non-surgical group. The 1, 3-year HCC-specific survival rates were 100.0%, and 100.0%vs 50.0% and 0 respectively (P = 0.002).Conclusions:HCC and nasopharyngeal multiple primary cancers are not rare and careful follow-ups are necessary . The co-existence of HCC and nasopharyngeal multiple primary cancers does not imply a worse prognosis. And radical resection of HCC is considered.
