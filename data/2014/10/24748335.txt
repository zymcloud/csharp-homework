Background:Sorafenib is the only systemic treatment that has shown a significant benefit in overall survival (OS) and in progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. No standard of care currently exists for second-line treatment. The association of Gemcitabine-Oxaliplatine (GEMOX) has shown efficacy in the first-line setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of GEMOX after failure of at least one line of anti-angiogenic (AA) therapy.Patient and methods:We performed a multicenter retrospective analysis of advanced HCC patients that received GEMOX chemotherapy after progression on at least one line of AA therapy.Results:We analyzed a total of 40 patients that received a median of 7 cycles of GEMOX over a 6-year period. Grade 3/4 toxicity was observed in 25 % of patients, mainly neurotoxicity, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia in 12.5 %, 5 % and 5 % of patients respectively. Grade Conclusion:The GEMOX schedule seems to show clinical activity and an acceptable toxicity profile in advanced HCC patients who progressed after anti-angiogenic treatment. The observed median OS of over 8 months is encouraging in this population of heavily pretreated patients. These results would merit confirmation in a prospective randomized study.
