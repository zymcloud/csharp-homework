Purpose:To evaluate changes in liver function and portal hypertension parameters after repeated percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with cirrhosis.Materials and methods:This study included 24 patients (male-to-female ratio, 15:9; mean age, 59.4 y) with early-stage HCC (mean tumor size, 1.91 cm) and cirrhosis who underwent three consecutive treatments with RF ablation between April 1999 and August 2011. Serial changes of liver function and portal hypertension parameters after repeated RF ablation were compared with baseline values using a mixed model and Wilcoxon signed rank test.Results:The interval between the first and second RF ablation measurements and between the second and third RF ablation measurements was 26.1 months ± 18.3 (range, 3.8-65.8 mo) and 16.6 months ± 9.8 (range, 4.7-35.4 mo), respectively. Total bilirubin level was significantly increased between the first RF ablation and 6 months after the third RF ablation (0.75 g/dL ± 0.37 to 1.06 g/dL ± 0.68, P = .001), but all values were within the normal range. No other liver function parameter showed a significant change (P > .05 for all). Portal hypertension parameters did not show significant changes between the first RF ablation and 6 months after the third RF ablation (P > .05).Conclusions:Repeated RF ablation for controlling recurrent HCC did not seem to affect liver function and portal hypertension in patients.
