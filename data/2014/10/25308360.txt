Background:Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related end-stage liver disease is the leading indication for liver transplantation in China, but long-term results of liver transplantation in patients aged over 60 years are not clear. The present study was to reveal the natural history of liver recipients with hepatitis B older than 60 years.Methods:The recipients who had received liver transplantation between December 2003 and December 2005 were divided into two groups: those equal or older than 60 years (older group, n=60) and those younger than 60 years (younger group, n=305). Risk factors for poor long-term outcome in patients aged over 60 years were also analyzed.Results:Except for age and preexisting chronic disease (P0.05). The actuarial 1-, 3-, 5- and 8-year survival rates were 81.6%, 71.6%, 66.7% and 63.3% respectively for the older group vs 84.9%, 77.7%, 70.8% and 65.6% for the younger group (P>0.05). Multivariate analyses showed that pre-liver transplant renal insufficiency was a risk factor for poor outcome in the older group (odds ratio=3.615, P=0.014).Conclusions:Liver transplantation is safe and feasible for patients with HBV-related end-stage liver disease aged over 60 years. Older patients with renal insufficiency should undergo transplantation earlier than younger patients.
