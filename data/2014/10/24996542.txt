Expressions of Survivin and nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells (NF-κB) are associated with a poor prognosis in many malignancies. However, their relationship in hepatocellular carcinoma remains unclear. To investigate the protein expression of Survivin and NF-κB, determine their role in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma, and correlate expression with patient survival outcome, immunohistochemistry was used to detect the protein expression of Survivin and NF-κB in 305 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the relationship between the protein expression of Survivin and NF-κB and clinicopathological parameters, survival time, and prognosis. Survivin was expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm, and NF-κB was expressed mostly in the nucleolus. Survivin and NF-κB are expressed at significantly higher rates in hepatocellular carcinoma compared with benign tissue (75.7 vs 13.4 %, P
