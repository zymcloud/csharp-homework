Aim:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is frequently complicated with cirrhosis, and it is not unusual for treatment options to be limited as a result of pancytopenia due to hypersplenism. Partial splenic embolization (PSE) has been performed for thrombocytopenia resulting from hypersplenism. We studied the efficacy in terms of hepatic functional reserve and safety in patients who underwent concurrent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with PSE for HCC.Methods:The study population consisted of 101 HCC patients with thrombocytopenia. Fifty-three patients were treated with concurrent TACE/PSE (PSE group), and the remaining 48 TACE patients without PSE (non-PSE group) were investigated hepatic functional reserve.Results:Platelet counts were significantly higher in the PSE group after 2 weeks, 2 months and 6 months after TACE than the non-PSE group. Child-Pugh score significantly deteriorated from 7.13 ± 1.16 to 7.60 ± 1.20 at 2 weeks, to 7.71 ± 1.25 at 2 months, and 7.71 ± 1.35 at 6 weeks after TACE in the non-PSE group. Hence, it worsened from 7.04 ± 1.05 to 7.21 ± 0.99 at 2 weeks temporally, but improved to 7.00 ± 1.17 after 2 months and 6.70 ± 1.16 at 6 weeks after TACE in the PSE group.Conclusion:Thrombocytopenia has been improved and treatment continued using concurrent PSE. In addition, hepatic functional reserve could be maintained even after treatment for HCC. Concurrent TACE and PSE for HCC with thrombocytopenia can be expected to help maintain hepatic reserve, and may contribute to improving the prognosis of HCC.
