Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a severe acute disease. Although long-term consequences to public health have been reported, no association with cancer is known. We examined the risk of cancer development after HFRS in the Swedish population between 1997 and 2011 (n = 6582) and report a 73% increased risk for lymphoma.
