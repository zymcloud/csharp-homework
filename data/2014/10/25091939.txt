Sorafenib in combination with Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is increasingly used in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the current evidence is still controversial. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TACE plus sorafenib versus TACE alone for unresectable HCC. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library for clinical trials comparing TACE plus sorafenib with TACE alone for unresectable HCC. The study outcomes included overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP), objective response and adverse events (AEs). Six studies including 1,181 patients were included. Meta-analysis of all studies suggested that the combination therapy group had significant longer OS than TACE group [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.64, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.43-0.97], but the pooled HR of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) failed to achieve statistical significance. For TTP, meta-analysis in both RCTs subgroup and retrospective studies subgroup suggested that combination therapy was superior to TACE group. The combination therapy was also associated with better response to treatment (risk ratio = 1.45, 95 % CI = 1.04-2.02) when both RCTs and retrospective studies were pooled. However, the sorafenib associated AEs were more frequent in the combination therapy group. In conclusion, the combination of TACE and sorafenib is likely to improve OS, TTP and response to treatment when compared with TACE monotherapy. The combination group is also associated with more sorafenib-related AEs.
