Immuno-polymerase chain reaction (immuno-PCR) combines the specificity of antibodies with the amplification power of PCR to detect low levels of proteins. Here, we describe the development of a 384-well immuno-PCR method that uses streptavidin coated on a PCR plate to capture complexes of biotinylated capture antibody, antigen, and DNA-labeled detection antibody. Unbound molecules are removed by a wash step using a standard plate washer. Antibody-DNA molecules in bound complexes are then detected directly on the plate using real-time PCR. Circulating human vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations measured by this method correlated with measurements obtained from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Using this method, we developed an assay for human epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7), an extracellular matrix-bound angiogenic factor. EGFL7 is expressed at a higher level in certain cancers, although endogenous EGFL7 concentrations have not been reported. Our 384-well EGFL7 immuno-PCR assay can detect 0.51pM EGFL7 in plasma, approximately 16-fold more sensitive than the ELISA, utilizing the same antibodies. This assay detected EGFL7 in lysates of non-small-cell lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and also hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer tissues. This 384-well immuno-PCR method can be used to develop high-throughput biomarker assays.
