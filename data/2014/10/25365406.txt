Diabetes is associated with a poor prognosis for liver disease, particularly in chronic hepatitis carriers. We investigated the prevalence of factors associated with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) including diabetes and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) among individuals with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.We used data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationwide cross-sectional survey conducted between 2007 and 2011. Sociodemographic information was collected using a structured questionnaire. The HBV surface antigen, liver enzymes, and lipid profile were measured from blood samples.IFG was found in 18.1% of HBV carriers and 19.3% of noncarriers (P = 0.25). Diabetes was observed in 10.0% of HBV carriers and 12.2% of noncarriers (P = 0.08). Lower level of educational attainment was associated with a higher prevalence of IGT: high school education (odds ratio [OR] = 1.94 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-3.29] and less than a high school education (OR = 3.20 [95% CI, 1.66-6.15] vs more than or equal to a college education. Elevated alanine transaminase and triglyceride by 10 were associated with increased risk of IGT (OR = 1.10 [95% CI, 1.01-1.20] and OR = 1.04 [95% CI, 1.01-1.07], respectively). Being a man and older in age were associated with a higher prevalence of IGT, and individuals with a low body mass index were at lower risk for IGT.Given the synergistic effect of diabetes and HBV infection on liver disease prognosis, we recommend targeted IGT screening and follow-up for HBV carriers. These efforts should include health policies and intervention programs aimed at reducing educational disparities and encouraging early control of elevated liver enzymes or lipid profiles.
