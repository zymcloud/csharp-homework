The anti proliferative potential of siRNA26, targeted to Aurora kinase B, in prostate cancer cells is known from a previous study from our laboratory. Here we first show that siRNA26 cleaves at the same position of the target mRNA in the prostate cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, PC3 and HepG2 respectively. Aurorakinase B specific siRNA, but not a control siRNA, inhibited PC3 and HepG2 cell proliferation and cell migration. These effects correlated to RNA silencing of Aurorakinase B in both the cell lines. Intra-tumoral administration of HiPerfect complexed siRNA26 inhibited the growth of HepG2 xenografts in SCID mice. In an orthotopic setting, intravenous administration of HiPerfect encapsulated siRNA26 appeared to reduce the severity of multifocal lesions.
