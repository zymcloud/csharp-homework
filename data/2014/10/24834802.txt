Background:Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, has been shown to halt the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of Sorafenib on liver regeneration in healthy rats.Methods:In two substudies we examined the effect of pre- or post-operative treatment with Sorafenib (15 mg/kg/d). Wistar rats (n = 120) received either Sorafenib (S) or placebo (P). After 70% partial hepatectomy, the rats were euthanized on postoperative days 2, 4, or 8. Body weight and liver weight were recorded and regeneration rate (RR) calculated. Hepatocyte proliferation was estimated by immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 antigen using unbiased stereological methods.Results:Eleven animals (9%) died after surgery. In the preoperative substudy, lower body weight gains during the gavage period in the S group were found. No difference between groups S and P regarding liver weight gain, liver RRs, and hepatocyte proliferation on postoperative days 2 and 4 were found. In the postoperative substudy, significantly lower values of liver weight gain, liver RRs, and hepatocyte proliferation were found in the S group.Conclusions:In our rat model, Sorafenib did not increase posthepatectomy mortality. Postoperative treatment significantly impaired liver regeneration. Preoperative treatment impaired body weight during the gavage period, but was without effect on liver regeneration.
