Hypoglycemia is a well-established paraneoplastic manifestation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, hypoglycemia presenting as the primary presentation of HCC is extremely rare. Most cases are resistant to glucose infusion and may lead to severe complications such as hypoglycemic seizures. We present a patient who had hypoglycemia as first manifestation of HCC and was managed conservatively.
