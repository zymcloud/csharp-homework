Purpose:Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) are medications widely prescribed to reduce cholesterol levels. Observational studies in high-risk populations, mostly in Asia, have suggested that statins are associated with a reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The current study sought to evaluate the association of statin use and HCC in a U.S.-based, low-risk, general population.Methods:A nested case-control study was conducted among members of the Health Alliance Plan HMO of the Henry Ford Health System enrolled between 1999 and 2010. Electronic pharmacy records of statin use were compared among tumor registry-confirmed cases of HCC (n=94) and controls (n=468) matched on age, sex, diagnosis date, and length of HMO enrolment.Results:In multivariate analyses, ever-use of statins was significantly inversely associated with development of HCC (Odds ratio (OR): 0.32, 95%CI: 0.15-0.67). No clear dose-response relationship was evident as statin use for 2 years (OR=0.31, 95CI%=0.12-9.81) resulted in very similar ORs.Conclusions:The use of statins among populations in low-risk HCC areas may be associated with decreased risk of HCC.
