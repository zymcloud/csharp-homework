Liver resection is a valuable curative option for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Yet, the balance between the operative risk following hepatectomy for HCC occurring on chronic liver disease and the oncologic prognosis of advanced lesions have led treatment recommendations to limiting the place of liver resection to selected patients with preserved liver function harbouring early-stage tumours. However, better understanding of the natural history of both tumour and underlying liver disease, sophisticated assessment of the liver function, improvements in the preoperative management of the patients with the use of liver volume modulation, refinements in surgical technique including anatomic resection and laparoscopic approach along with tailored management of recurrences have led expert centres to better define and extend the indications for liver resection. In this setting, the reported favourable operative results and long-term outcomes following resection of HCC in a number of controversial scenarios support that current guidelines could be refined.
