Clinical studies have evaluated the safety and efficacy of radioembolization with yttrium-90 in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Citing literature published within the last 5 years, we review the clinical evidence of survival outcomes and safety of yttrium-90 treatment in patients with unresectable HCC. This paper is primarily focused on survival rates following the typical application of yttrium-90 in HCC treatment, and also includes time to progression and safety data. Also discussed are special indications and new developments related to yttrium-90 therapy in HCC, as well as patient selection and its correlation with successful treatment outcomes.
