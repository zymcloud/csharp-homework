Icteric Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is known to cause intraluminal biliary obstruction by one of three mechanisms: hemobilia from the tumour, migration of tumor debris, or continuous growth along the biliary tree. It is however a very rare presentation of HCC and an important differential diagnosis in the approach to obstructive jaundice. We report a case of a recurrent intraductal hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient initially underwent surgical resection of segment five HCC nine months ago with clear margins. The patient now presents with obstructive jaundice and imaging showed a right intraductal tumour involving the confluence, left and common hepatic ducts. He underwent a right hepatectomy and bile duct tumour thrombectomy despite the apparent absence of a parenchymal tumour. Histological examination showed a 2 mm focus of parenchymal tumour with extension of the tumour into the bile duct. In this case report, we reviewed the literature and describe the different surgical approaches to intraductal hepatocellular carcinomas and discuss the pathological aspects of these bile duct tumour thrombus. We report the favourable outcome of surgical resection for intraductal hepatocellular carcinoma and emphasize that intraductal HCC is not a late stage of disease and adequate surgical resection can still provide a reasonable disease free survival.
