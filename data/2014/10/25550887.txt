Sarcomatoid combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma is an extremely rare primary hepatic malignancy and only a few cases have been reported. Herein, we report a case of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma with sarcomatoid changes in a 52-year-old man, who had a history of liver cirrhosis and transarterial chemoembolization. The resected liver revealed a mass of 4.5Ã—3.5 cm. Microscopically, the tumor was composed of adenocarcinoma intermingled with poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, which contained atypical spindle cells. We also present a short review of reported cases of sarcomatoid combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma.
