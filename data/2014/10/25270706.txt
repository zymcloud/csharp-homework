Background:Metastatic tumor invasion of the condyle from the liver is rare. It is important for dental practitioners to differentiate tumor involvement from musculoskeletal disorders such as temporomandibular disorders.Case description:The authors present a case report of a patient with temporomandibular joint pain and dysfunction consistent with musculoskeletal disorders. Because of the patient's medical history, comprehensive examination results and findings of imaging studies performed, the dental practitioners referred him to other health care providers for further and more in-depth investigation. This resulted in the establishment of an accurate diagnosis, with treatment directed at the primary source.Practical implications:A thorough medical history, comprehensive clinical examination and adjunctive testing, when necessary, are paramount in establishing a definitive diagnosis for patients with orofacial pain, thereby enabling the delivery of appropriate treatment.
