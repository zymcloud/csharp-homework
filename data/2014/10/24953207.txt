Background:Although both colorectal neoplasms and atherosclerosis may be induced by visceral fat accumulation, no association between these factors has yet been elucidated.Methods:Among Japanese participants in our colonoscopic screening and annual surveillance programs, asymptomatic subjects were investigated. Visceral fat area was measured by computed tomography, and the ankle-brachial index and pulse-wave velocity (markers of systemic atherosclerosis) were also estimated. Colorectal findings during screening were investigated in association with these parameters.Results:Nine hundred and seven subjects (males: 71.9%; mean age: 57.3Â±8.7 years) were enrolled. Colorectal adenomas were identified during colorectal screening of 407 subjects (44.9%). The prevalence of all colorectal adenoma and advanced neoplasia increased with an elevated pulse-wave velocity from 32.2% (advanced neoplasia, 2.6) to 62.1% (8.4%) in higher quartiles (p<0.001 and p=0.003). The risk of advanced neoplasia was higher in subjects with an abnormal ankle-brachial index (33% vs. 4.6%, p<0.001). Upon multivariate analysis, visceral fat area and pulse-wave velocity were associated with all adenoma, and the ankle-brachial index with advanced neoplasia.Conclusions:The risk of colorectal adenoma was strongly associated with visceral fat area and markers of atherosclerosis. Colorectal adenoma and atherosclerosis may share a common pathogenesis and the same populations are at high-risk.
