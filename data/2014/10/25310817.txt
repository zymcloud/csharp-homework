Purpose:To evaluate whether gadoxetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced MR images of tumors taken during the hepatocyte-specific phase can aid in the differentiation between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and dysplastic nodules (DNs) in patients with atypical cirrhotic nodules detected on dynamic CT images.Materials and methods:Seventy-one patients with 112 nodules showing atypical dynamic enhancement on CT images underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging (MRI) studies. Using a reference standard, we determined that 33 of the nodules were DNs and that 79 were true HCCs. Tumor size, signal intensity on precontrast T1-weighted images (T1WI) and T2WI, and the pattern of dynamic enhancement on MR images taken in the hepatocyte-phase were determined.Results:There were significant differences in tumor size, hyperintensity on T2WI, hypointensity on T1WI, typical HCC enhancement pattern on dynamic MR images, or hypointensity on hepatocyte-phase images between DNs and HCC. The sensitivity and specificity were 60.8% and 87.9% for T2WI, 38.0% and 87.9% for T1WI, 17.7% and 100% for dynamic MR imaging, 83.5% and 84.9% for hepatocyte-phase imaging, and 60.8% and 87.9% for tumor size (threshold of 1.7 cm).Conclusion:Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced hepatocyte-phase imaging is recommended for patients at high risk of HCC who present with atypical lesions on dynamic CT images.
