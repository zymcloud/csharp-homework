Aim:The PNPLA3 rs738409 C>G polymorphism (encoding for I148M) has recently been identified as a susceptibility factor for steatosis-mediated liver damage. We evaluated the influence of this polymorphism on hepatocarcinogenesis in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) virus infection.Methods:We genotyped the rs738409 single nucleotide polymorphism in 358 hepatitis C-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and correlated the age at onset of HCC and the interval between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and the development of HCC in patients with each genotype.Results:The frequencies of CC, CG and GG genotypes were 27.9% (100/358), 49.2% (176/358) and 22.9% (82/358), respectively, and were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The median age at onset of HCC for the GG genotype was significantly younger compared to for non-GG genotypes (67.81 vs 69.87 years, P Conclusion:The PNPLA3 genotype GG may be associated with accelerated hepatocarcinogenesis in CHC patients through increased steatosis in the liver.
