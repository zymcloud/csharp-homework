Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has particularly high incidence rate in Asia and its resistance to the chemotherapeutic drugs and cell death make it intractable. Vaccinia virus (VV) is a potential vehicle and has been widely used in cancer therapy. SMAC/DIABLO is a critical factor in activating caspases and eliminating inhibition of IAPs when the programmed cell death is promoted. In this study, we constructed a tumor-targeted vaccinia virus carrying SMAC/DIABLO gene that was knocked in the region of viral thymidine kinase gene (VV-SMAC). Our results showed that VV-SMAC efficiently infected and destroyed HCC cells via triggering both caspase-dependent apoptosis and necroptosis with depletion of IAPs. Furthermore, ripoptosome, a prerequisite complex of necroptosis, was assembled and induced by VV-SMAC. In addition, the combination of VV-SMAC and vinblastine represented a synergistic effect on HCC cells. In summary, our data suggest that VV-SMAC is a potential candidate and combination of VV-SMAC and vinblastine may provide a new avenue in treatment of HCC.
