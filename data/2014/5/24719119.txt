Purpose:Liver resection with colorectal liver metastasis widely accepted and has been considered safe and effective therapeutic option. However, the role of liver resection in breast cancer with liver metastasis is still controversial. Therefore, we reviewed the outcome of liver resection in breast cancer patients with liver metastases in a single hospital experiences.Materials and methods:Between January 1991 and December 2006, 2176 patients underwent breast cancer surgery in Gangnam Severance Hospital. Among these patients, 110 cases of liver metastases were observed during follow-up and 13 of these patients received liver resection with potential feasibility to achieve an R0 resection.Results:The median time interval between initial breast cancer and detection of liver metastasis was 62.5 months (range, 13-121 months). The 1-year and 3-year overall survival rates of the 13 patients with liver resection were 83.1% and 49.2%, respectively. The 1-year and 3-year overall survival rates of patients without extrahepatic metastasis were 83.3% and 66.7% and those of patients with extrahepatic metastasis were 80.0% and 0.0%, respectively (p=0.001).Conclusion:Liver resection for metastatic breast cancer results in improved patient survival, particularly in patients with solitary liver metastasis and good general condition.
