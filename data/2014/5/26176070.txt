Background/aims:The serum aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) is a biomarker for hepatic fibrosis. The relationship between the APRI and postoperative hepatic failure is unclear.Methodology:The risk factors for postoperative hepatic failure and the APRI were evaluated in 457 patients who underwent liver resection for HCC.Results:Nineteen patients (4.2%) experienced postoperative hepatic failure and five (1.1%) died. An increased APRI (p = 0.039), increased total bilirubin (p = 0.044), longer operation (p = 0.035) and increased intraoperative blood loss (p = 0.028) were independent risk factors in the multivariate analysis. Incidence of postoperative hepatic failure in patients with an APRI ≥ 1.57 (13/127, 10%) was significantly higher than in patients with an APRI Conclusions:Increased APRI (≥ 1.57) may be a preoperative predictor of postoperative hepatic failure. Meticulous surgery with shorter operations and reduced blood loss may reduce the incidence of postoperative hepatic failure, even in patients with a high APRI.
