The prognosis is usually poor in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sorafenib is approved for Child-Pugh class A patients with unresectable and advanced HCC. We report here a rare case of a patient with advanced HCC with right portal vein thrombosis (PVT) who achieved a complete response after treatment with sorafenib. This 74-year-old man was a case of non-hepatitis B and C virus-related cirrhosis. Multiphase liver computed tomography showed an 8 cm tumor with early enhance, early wash out, and right PVT at segment 8 of the right lobe. A liver tumor biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of poorly differentiated HCC. Blood tests showed Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis and an alpha-fetoprotein level of 33,058 ng/mL. Sorafenib was initiated at 800 mg/day but was eventually reduced to 400 mg every other day because of a grade 3 hand-foot skin reaction. The alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level decreased rapidly with a linear trend after treatment. After log transformation, the calculated half-life of AFP was 6.84 days. There was no more tumor arterial enhancement, and tumor size was decreased to 3.7 cm on day 42. PVT shrank gradually and localized to the right anterior branch at month 9. There was no recurrence of tumor at the end of follow-up in month 19. Typical serial changes of clinical parameters were demonstrated in this patient.
