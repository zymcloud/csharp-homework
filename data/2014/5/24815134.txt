Objective:Liver ischemic reperfusion injury is harmful to transplant recipients, and is associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality. Our study was designed to investigate the oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory mediators in liver transplant recipients.Methods:We prospectively analyzed 14 recipients who underwent liver transplantation by measuring their blood levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and IL-6, at nine time points perioperatively. We also evaluated the correlations between oxidative stress (MDA levels) and the characteristics of the recipient or the donated graft.Results:These parameters significantly increased from 1 minute before reperfusion, and the values peaked within 3 to 30 minutes after reperfusion. On the time point at 5 minutes after reperfusion, the MDA levels which were the highest in the recipients correlated with the values of preoperative direct/and total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, international normalized ratio (INR), and surgical blood loss.Conclusion:The levels of MDA, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 greatly increased with the ischemic reperfusion insult. Recipients with higher values of preoperative direct/and total bilirubin, AST, ALT, MELD score, INR, and surgical blood loss tended to have higher levels of MDA and may suffer more injury from this insult.
