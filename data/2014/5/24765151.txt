Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is responsible for adenosine triphosphate synthesis and OXPHOS deficiency plays a significant role in tumorigenesis. The defects of mitochondrial-encoded OXPHOS subunits have been found in normal and cirrhotic liver, however their contributions in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not clear. The present study aimed to examine these defects in resected HCC tissues. In total, 102 human HCC tissues were collected from patients undergoing curative resection, and immunohistochemical staining was performed to assess tissue expression of complex I subunit 6, complex III subunit 3, complex IV subunit 1 (CIV-1) and complex V subunit 6. Cox proportional hazard model analysis was performed, including all clinicopathological factors, to postoperatively estimate the overall survival rate. The results showed that the majority of HCC tissues contained various degrees of expression defects for OXPHOS subunits. Among these, the major CIV-1 defect (expression defect area of >25% of the examined area) (P
ATP synthase; NADH dehydrogenase; cytochrome b; cytochrome c oxidase.
