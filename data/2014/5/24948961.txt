Objectives:Spontaneous rupture of hepatocarcinoma (HCC) is a fatal complication of advanced HCC and is associated with poor prognosis. However, there is no consensus on the best approach to treat hemoperitoneum due to ruptured HCC. In this paper, we evaluate and discuss the outcomes of different treatment methods employed at our center for ruptured HCC.Methods:We reviewed the medical records of 132 patients diagnosed with ruptured HCC at our hospital from January 2003 to December 2012 and evaluated and compared the outcomes of five treatment methods for ruptured HCC: conservative treatment, surgical hemostasis, transarterial embolization (TAE), and one- and two-stage resections.Results:There was no significant difference in the median survival time between the conservative treatment and surgical hemostasis groups. Patients in the TAE alone group had a better prognosis than those in the conservative treatment and surgical hemostasis groups. The survival time of the tumor resection group was obviously better than that of the conservative treatment, surgical hemostasis, and TAE alone groups, but no significant difference was observed between the one-stage and two-stage resection groups.Conclusions:One-stage hepatectomy is a better option for patients with preserved liver function, whereas TAE is a better option for those with poorly preserved liver function.
