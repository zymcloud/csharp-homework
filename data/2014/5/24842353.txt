Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are novel antineoplastic drugs that make use of the molecular abnormalities that have been discovered in certain types of tumours. These agents are associated with important dermatological side effects. This case report discusses an atypical presentation of the hand-foot syndrome in one patient treated with sorafenib. A 78-year-old man, recently started on sorafenib for the treatment of hepatocarcinoma with lung metastasis, presented to the emergency room with painful blistering lesions on the palms, soles and scrotum for 1 week. A punch biopsy was performed and sorafenib was withheld. Direct immunofluorescence study was negative for an autoimmune blistering disorder and histopathology stains did not show any microorganisms. A diagnosis of hand-foot syndrome was made. After 2 weeks, the patient showed marked improvement and the plan was to restart sorafenib at a lower dosage.
