Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The treatment options for patients with advanced HCC are limited, and novel treatment strategies are required urgently. Glypican-3 (GPC3), a member of the glypican family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, is overexpressed in 72%-81% of HCC cases, and is correlated with a poor prognosis. GPC3 regulates both stimulatory and inhibitory signals, and plays a key role in regulating cancer cell growth. GPC3 is released into the serum, and so might be a useful diagnostic marker for HCC. GPC3 is also used as an immunotherapeutic target in HCC. A Phase I study of a humanized anti-GPC3 monoclonal antibody, GC33, revealed a good safety profile and potential antitumor activity, and a Phase II trial is currently ongoing. In addition, the authors' investigator-initiated Phase I study of a GPC3-derived peptide vaccine showed good safety and tolerability, and demonstrated that the GPC3 peptide-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte frequency in peripheral blood correlated with overall survival in HCC patients. A sponsor-initiated Phase I clinical trial of a three-peptide cocktail vaccine, which includes a GPC3-derived peptide, is also underway. GPC3 is currently recognized as a promising therapeutic target and diagnostic marker for HCC. This review introduces the recent progress in GPC3 research, from biology to clinical impact.
