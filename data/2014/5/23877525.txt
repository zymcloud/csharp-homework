A 55-year-old man was a hepatocellular carcinoma patient, diagnosed by sonography and a biopsy. Because of his musculoskeletal tenderness, a bone scan was performed to exclude skeletal metastasis. A subsequent F-FDG PET/CT scan revealed that the unilateral abnormal uptake seen on the bone scan was actually a mineralized tendon. A mineralized tendon is easily detectable using Tc-MDP; therefore, it is imperative to differentiate between bone lesions and mineralized tendons. In addition, few studies have reported F-FDG uptake in a calcified tendon.
