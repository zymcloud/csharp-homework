Previous studies demonstrated that androgen receptor (AR) is expressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the male-dominant diseases. Glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78/Bip), which has a role in cancer development, is one of the androgen response genes in prostate cell lines. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of AR on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress signaling in human hepatoma. AR and GRP78 expressions were examined in human liver tissue panels. Human hepatoma cells stably expressing short hairpin RNA targeting AR and cells over-expressing AR were generated. The expressions of ER-stress molecules and AR were measured by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. The effect of AR on ER-stress responsive gene expression was examined by reporter assay. Strong positive correlation between AR mRNA and GRP78 mRNA was observed in stage I/II-HCCs. AR enhanced ER-stress responsive element activities and GRP78 expression, and regulated ER-stress response in hepatocytes. Sorafenib strongly induced significant apoptosis in HepG2 cells by the inhibition of AR and inhibition of the downstream GRP78. AR seems a co-regulator of GRP78 especially in earlier-stage HCC. AR plays a critical role in controlling ER-stress, providing new therapeutic options against HCC.
