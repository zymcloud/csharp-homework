Combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) is a rare form of primary liver cancer (PLC). It is difficult to make a correct preoperative diagnosis of cHCC-CC because of the lack of special features of the disease. We here present a case of a 68-year-old man who presented with fluctuant fever, chills, and sweating and was eventually diagnosed as cHCC-CC after surgery. The tumor was 6.0 cm in diameter with distinct borders and no satellite lesions or lymph nodes were observed during macroscopic examination of the resection specimen. The fever resolved in the postoperative period till the 28th day after surgery, when the patient developed extensive abdominal metastases and died shortly after. More attention should be paid to the patient with PLC showing abnormal features such as FUO, normal range of tumor markers, atypical imaging, and less cirrhosis. Hepatic resection is the treatment of choice although with short-term outcomes.
