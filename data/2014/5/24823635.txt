Focal amplifications in 6p21 containing the VEGFA locus occur in 7%-10% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A recent paper describes how VEGF-A stimulates paracrine secretion of hepatocyte growth factor by stromal cells, which induces tumor progression. HCC patients with VEGFA amplification are distinctly sensitive to sorafenib.
