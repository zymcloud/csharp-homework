Objective:To evaluate the anti neoplastic effects of p21(WAF1/CIP1) transcriptional activation induced by duplex RNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line BEL-7402.Methods:Cells were treated with dsRNAs complementary to promoter sequences of p21(WAF1/CIP1). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot were employed to detect the expression of p21. At various timepoints post-transfection, cell viability assay and apoptosis analysis were used to determine the effect of RNA activation. After transfection Western blot was also performed to detect the expression of Bcl-xL, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved PARP.Results:DsP21-322 transfection significantly inhibited cell viability. And, at Day 5, dsP21-322 inhibited cell growth by 65.84% versus control. Flow cytometry revealed that dsP21-322 caused a significant increase of cell apoptosis. The total percent of apoptotic cells (UR+LR) increased to 36.86% versus 11.51% and 14.06% in mocks and controls respectively. Such phenomena correlated with a decrease of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL and an increase of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved PARP.Conclusion:Activation of p21 gene expression by saRNA may offer therapeutic benefits for HCC and other cancers.
