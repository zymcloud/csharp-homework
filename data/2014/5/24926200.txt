Aim:To investigate the clinical significance of cyclic adenosine monophosphate-responsive element-binding (CREB) and phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses were performed to detect the expression and subcellular localizations of CREB and pCREB proteins in 130 pairs of HCC and adjacent nonneoplastic liver tissues.Results:Both immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses showed that the expression levels of CREB and pCREB proteins in HCC tissues were significantly higher than those in the adjacent nonneoplastic liver tissues (both PConclusion:Our data indicate for the first time that the activation of the CREB protein may be associated with tumor progression in HCC, and may serve as a valuable marker of prognosis for patients with this malignancy.
