Renal cell carcinoma is an aggressive urological malignancy. Metastases from the lesion are encountered late in the course of the disease and most often involve the lung and the liver. It is rare that metastatic lesions are the primary presentation of an otherwise clinically silent renal cell carcinoma. We report a case who presented with calvarial and cutaneous lesions which were later found to be metastases from an asymptomatic renal cell carcinoma.
