Percutaneous ablative procedures allow curative treatment of stage BCLC 0 or BCLC A hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as liver metastases of colorectal cancer. Several methods exist including radiofrequency ablation, the most commonly used. These techniques can be used in combination with surgical excision or alone if surgery is contraindicated. They are associated with significantly reduced mortality as compared to surgery.
