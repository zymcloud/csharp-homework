Objective:To evaluate the prognostic significance of (18)F-FDG PET-CT SUVmax value in 85 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) before transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:A retrospective analysis was conducted on 85 patients with HCC before TACE to evaluate the prognostic significance of SUVmax of (18)F-FDG PET-CT. The survival rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank method was used for univariate analysis, and Cox regression model was used for multivariate analysis.Results:The patients were divided into two groups before TACE: The high metabolic group (63 patients, with SUVmax value 7.71 ± 2.78) and low metabolic group (22 patients, with SUVmax value 3.89 ± 0.80). The SUVmax levels were statistically different (P 8 cm, number of tumors (solitary or multiple) and AFP level were independent prognostic factors (P Conclusion:The SUVmax value of the primary intrahepatic tumor can be used as an important prognostic factor to predict the effect of TACE in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
