Background:The extensive use of major hepatectomy for liver malignancies with cirrhosis increases the risk of posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF), which is associated with a high frequency of postoperative complications, mortality, and an increased length of hospital stay. Remnant liver volume-to-body weight ratio (RLV-BWR) is more specific than the ratio of RLV-to-total liver volume (RLV-TLV) in predicting postoperative course after major hepatectomy in normal liver. Patients having normal liver with an anticipated RLV-BWR â‰¤0.5% are at considerable risk for hepatic dysfunction and postoperative mortality. In the present study, the critical value of RLV-BWR after liver resection in cirrhotic liver was investigated.Patients and methods:Thirty one patients who underwent hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma in one medical treatment unit of West China Hospital from September 2012 to December 2012 were retrospectively enrolled in study. Volumetric measurements of TLV using computed tomography were obtained before hepatectomy. PHLF was diagnosed by the "50-50 criteria." The influence of RLV-TLV and RLV-BWR on the occurrence of PHLF was investigated, and the critical value of RLV-BWR was concluded.Results:According to the occurrence of PHLF, the patients were retrospectively divided into PHLF group and non-PHLF group. There were no statistical differences of preoperative indicators between the two groups. The intraoperative indicators including the resected liver volume, RLV-TLV, and RLV-BWR were statistically significant (P Conclusions:RLV-BWR was more specific than RLV-TLV in predicting PHLF after major hepatectomy of cirrhotic liver.
