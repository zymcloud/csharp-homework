Purpose:Inter-patient variations in tumour growth rate are usually interpreted as biological heterogeneity among patients due to, e.g., genetic variability. However, these variations might be a result of non-exponential, e.g. the Gompertzian, tumour growth kinetics. The aim was to study if the natural tumour growth deceleration, i.e. non-exponential growth, is a dominant factor in such variations.Materials and methods:The correlation between specific growth rate (SGR) and the logarithm of tumour volume, Ln(V), was calculated for tumours in patients with meningioma, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, primary lung cancer, post-chemotherapy regrowth of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and in nude mice transplanted with human midgut carcinoid GOT1, a tumour group which is biologically more homogeneous than patient groups.Results:The correlation between SGR and Ln(V) was statistically significant for meningioma, post-chemotherapy regrowth of NSCLC, and the mouse model, but not for any other patient groups or subgroups, based on differentiation and clinical stage.Conclusion:This method can be used to evaluate the homogeneity of tumour growth kinetics among patients. Homogeneity of post-chemotherapy regrowth pattern of NSCLC suggests that, in contrast to untreated tumours, the remaining resistant cells or stem cells (if exist) might have similar biological characteristics among these patients.
