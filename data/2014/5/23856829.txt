Metastasis to the bronchus from extrathoracic malignancy is a rare event. We present 2 cases of endobronchial metastases from extrathoracic tumors with FDG PET/CT findings. One patient had a hypermetabolic endobronchial metastasis from breast cancer. The other patient had a hypermetabolic endobronchial metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma. Both the endobronchial metastases were confirmed by bronchoscopic biopsy. These 2 cases indicate that FDG PET/CT is useful for detecting endobronchial metastases, and endobronchial metastasis should be included in the differential diagnosis of abnormal endotracheal or endobronchial FDG accumulation in patients with histories of malignant tumors.
