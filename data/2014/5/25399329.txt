Background:Recent data suggest that outcome of hepatocarcinoma is improving.Aims:In order to explore whether survival is also increasing in clinical practice, we compared two multicenter independent in-field cohorts of cirrhotics with newly diagnosed HCCs.Methods:Cohort 1 (C1) consisted of 327 patients enrolled between January and December 1998, and cohort 2 (C2) included 826 patients enrolled between September 2008 and November 2012. Patients were stratified according to Child-Pugh score, MELD score, and HCC staged according to TNM, BCLC systems.Results:At baseline, C2 patients were significantly older, with more frequent comorbidities and better liver function. In C2, HCC was more frequently detected under regular ultrasound surveillance (P Conclusions:This in-field study showed a trend on improved HCC outcomes over time, which seems to be mainly due to a better presentation thanks to the wider application of surveillance and increased propensity to treat patients. These encouraging data should support further efforts to implement such approach to HCC in everyday clinical practice.
