This article describes a highly-sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based immunoassay (IA) for human fetuin A (HFA), a specific biomarker for atherosclerosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The assay is based on a novel immobilization procedure that simply involves the dilution of an anti-HFA capture antibody (Ab) in 1% (v/v) 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), followed by its dispensing on a KOH-treated gold (Au)-coated SPR chip and incubation for 30 min. The developed SPR IA detected 0.3-20 ng mL(-1) of HFA with a limit of detection and sensitivity of 0.7 ng mL(-1) and 1 ng mL(-1), respectively. The highly-simplified Ab immobilization procedure is also 5-fold more rapid than conventional procedures. It leads to the leach-proof binding of the capture Ab, which means that the developed SPR IA is highly cost-effective, as the Ab-bound SPR chip could be reused for many repeated HFA IAs after regeneration with 10 mM glycine-HCl, pH 2.0. The Ab-bound SPR chip, stored at 4 Â°C, lost only 18% of its original activity after 4 months. For the detection of HFA spiked in diluted human whole blood and plasma, the results obtained by the developed SPR IA agreed well with the commercial HFA sandwich ELISA.
