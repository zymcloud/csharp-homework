The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety and efficiency of an intravenously delivered nano-hydroxyapatite (Nano-HA) solution into a rabbit model (Oryctolagus cuniculus) to determine the potential enhancement of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for the ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in liver tissue. The present study clearly indicated that the intravenous delivery of large quantities of Nano-HA into the body of the rabbit model over relatively short periods of time may be absorbed by the hepatic reticuloendothelial system. Subsequent HIFU treatment for HCC, as well as intravenous Nano-HA, produced a rapid increase in temperature and an enlargement of the coagulated necrotic area during ablation in the in vivo and ex vivo environments. In addition, it was found that the therapeutic doses of Nano-HA produced mild and transient abnormalities in the normal renal function and hepatic enzymes during the first 24 h following administration. The results of the current study indicated that the combination of Nano-HA and HIFU may provide a safe and effective alternative to conventional surgical procedures.
