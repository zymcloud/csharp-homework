Background/aims:It has been reported that Th2 cytokines down-regulate antitumor immunity, while activation of Th1 cells promotes such immunity. The aim of this study was to assess changes of host immunity in relation to efficacy in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC) treated by combined intra-arterial chemotherapy (CIAC).Methodology:Forty-three adult Japanese LC patients who had aHCC received CIAC. Blood samples were collected before and after CIAC.Results:Eleven of the 43 patients showed a partial response (group PR) and 21 patients had stable disease (group SD), but 11 patients showed no response (group PD). There were no significant differences of Th1 or Th2 cells between before and after CIAC in each group. However, groups SD and PD had higher levels of Th2 cells than in group PR before and after CIAC. The percentage of regulatory T (Treg) cells in group PD was significantly increased after CIAC compared with before CIAC, whereas groups PR and SD showed significant decrease after CIAC.Conclusions:The percentage of Th2 cells is useful for predicting the response to CIAC and the percentage of Treg cells is useful for assessment of efficacy in LC patients with aHCC receiving CIAC.
