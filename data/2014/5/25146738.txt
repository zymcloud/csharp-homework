Objective:To explore the expression of NVM-1(novel metastasis-promoting gene 1) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue and examine its clinical significance.Methods:The expression of NVM-1 in 92 cases of HCC tumor tissues and non-tumor tissues was detected by immunohistochemical staining with SP (streptavidin-perosidase). And its clinical significance was evaluated.Results:The staining of NVM-1 was predominantly located in the nucleus of HCC tumor tissue. The positive rate of NVM-1 was 52.2% in all detected cancers and it was higher than that in control non-tumor tissues (28.3%) and benign hepatic lesions (0) . A significant difference of positive rates existed between tumor and non-tumor tissues (P Conclusion:There is probably a close relation between recurrence and metastasis and the expression of NVM-1 in HCC.
