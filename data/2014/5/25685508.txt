We report the case of a male patient with resistant subphrenic abscess complicating radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of two left lobe hepatocellular carcinoma (HCCs). The causative organism was multidrug resistant Escherichia coli. Percutaneous pigtail drainage together with IV antibiotics failed to resolve the abscess which persisted for 4 months. Intracavitary doxycycline injection causes moderate reduction in the volume of the drained fluid. This was followed by percutaneous cyanoacrylate injection inside the abscess cavity and the fistulous tract which causes complete resolution of the abscess.
