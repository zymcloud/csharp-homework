Background/aims:We evaluated the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab for metastatic colorectal cancer patients.Methodology:All unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer patients who began receiving bevacizumab at participating facilities from 2006 to 2011 were retrospectively analyze to determine the safety and efficacy. The primary end points were Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS). The secondary end points were adverse events.Results:A total of 101 patients were enrolled in the study. The primary tumor site was the colon in 53 patients and the rectum in 48 patients. The most common metastatic sites were the liver (63.4%), lung (31%), and peritoneum (10%). In first-line therapy, 76 (75.2%) patients received the FOLFOX regimen. Among these patients, 33 (43.4%) patients received FOLFOX alone, and 43 (56.6%) received FOLFOX plus bevacizumab. The addition of bevacizumab to first-line chemotherapy was associated with increases in median PFS (12.5 vs. 6.0 months; P = .00001) and median OS (24.0 vs. 16.0 months; P = 0.0221). The risks of adverse events were not significantly increased with the addition of bevacizumab.Conclusions:The addition of bevacizumab to first-line therapy in CRC patients provided clinically significant patient benefit, including statistically significant improvement in OS and a favorable tolerability profile.
