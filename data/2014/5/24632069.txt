Arsenic trioxide (ATO) induces clinical remission in acute promyelocytic leukemia and growth inhibition in various cancer cell lines in vitro. Recently, genistein and quercetin were reported to potentiate ATO-provoked apoptosis in leukemia and hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Genistein acted via enhanced ROS generation and quercetin via glutathione depletion. Searching for potential strategies for the treatment of malignant gliomas in this study the capacity of these flavonoids to sensitize rat C6 astroglioma cells for the cytotoxic action of ATO was investigated. ATO inhibited cell growth in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. This effect was accompanied neither by enhanced radical generation nor lipid peroxidation and was not attributed to apoptosis. ATO treatment concentration-dependently increased glutathione levels. Genistein enhanced radical generation. Combined with ATO it inhibited cell growth additively. Additivity was also obtained after cotreatment with ATO and H2O2. Quercetin acted antagonistically on ATO-induced growth inhibition. Quercetin increased glutathione levels. In contrast, buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) depleted cellular glutathione and acted synergistically with ATO. In conclusion, in C6 cells neither genistein nor quercetin are suited as sensitizing agent, in contrast to BSO. Depletion of cellular glutathione content rather than an increase of ROS generation plays a central role in the enhancement of ATO-toxicity in C6 cells.
