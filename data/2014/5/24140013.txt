This study characterizes the environmental quality of sediments from the Arade and Guadiana estuaries using different in-vitro bioassays: a) fish hepatoma cell line (PLHC-1) to determine cytotoxicity and presence of CYP1A and oxidative stress inducing agents; b) gonad subcellular fractions from sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) to detect compounds that are likely to act as endocrine disrupters by interfering with the synthesis of androgens (CYP17, CYP11β) and estrogens (CYP19). Approximately 60% of extracts from the Arade estuary were cytotoxic when tested at 60 mg eQsed/mL, while only one sample from Guadiana showed cytotoxicity. Sediments from Arade collected close to harbours and waste water effluents were enriched with CYP1A inducing agents, while those from the upper Guadiana induced oxidative stress in PLHC-1 cells. On the other hand, several extracts from both estuaries were able to significantly inhibit CYP17, CYP11β and CYP19 activities in gonad subcellular fractions of sea bass, which indicates the presence of endocrine disrupters, particularly in several sites from the Arade estuary. Overall, the study highlights the usefulness of in-vitro bioassays to identify those sediments that could pose risk to aquatic organisms and that require further action to improve their environmental quality.
