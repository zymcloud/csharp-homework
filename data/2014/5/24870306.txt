Invasion of the bile duct by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is called intrahepatic bile duct HCC, is rare and has a poor prognosis. Early diagnosis and surgical resection is important for treatment. A 58-year-old man who underwent hepatic resection for HCC 4 years ago and received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) 2 years after the operation for recurred HCC presented with jaundice. CT scan revealed a tumor in the common bile duct without intrahepatic lesion. Therefore, ERCP was done to perform biopsy and biliary drainage. Histological examination was compatible with hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the tumor could not be visualized at angiography and thus, only transarterial chemoinfusion was performed without embolization. The tumor had disappeared on follow-up CT scan, and the patient has been disease free for 23 months without evidence of recurrence. Herein, we report a case of intrahepatic bile duct HCC which disappeared after ERCP.
