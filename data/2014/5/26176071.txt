Background/aims:Risk factors for recurrence and types of recurrence following hepatic resection for non-B non-C hepatitis hepatocellular carcinoma (NBC-HCC) have not yet been established.Methodology:The clinicopathological data of 76 patients with NBC-HCC were retrospectively reviewed. Risk factors for postoperative recurrence were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses. In addition, types of intrahepatic recurrence were investigated.Results:Of the 76 patients, 38 (50%) developed recurrence during the follow-up period, with disease-free survival rates at 1/3/5 years of 72%/46%/40%, respectively. Of the 38 patients with recurrence, 36 (95%) were found to have recurrence within three years after surgery. Of the 38 patients, 34 exhibited intrahe patic recurrence. In multivariate analysis, Child-Pugh B (p = 0.009) and microscopic vascular invasion (MVI) (p = 0.002) were independent risk factors for postoperative recurrence. Based on our definitions, of the 34 patients with intrahepatic recurrence, recurrence at the stump was present in one patient, multicentric recurrence in 11 patients and intrahepatic metastasis in 22 patients.Conclusions:Child-Pugh B and MVI are independent risk factors for the postoperative recurrence. Although most recurrences occurred within three years after hepatic resection, incidence of multicentric recurrence is not negligible. Preventing recurrence according to types of recurrence is therefore considered to be essential.
