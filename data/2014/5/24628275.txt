Background:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may cause damage to the hepatic artery (HA) and impact the postoperative course of the liver transplantation (LT). We aim to describe the relationship between preoperative TACE and the occurrence of histological and radiological hepatic artery complications (HAC).Methods:All cirrhotic patients with HCC undergoing LT between January 2009 and October 2012 were included and divided in two groups: TACE (group 1) and No TACE (group 2). HA histological complications were reviewed and compared.Results:Sixty-seven patients were reviewed, 32 in group 1 and 35 in group 2. Both groups were similar in gender, age, cirrhosis origin, and American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score. After a mean follow-up of 17 months, 10 radiological HAC occurred: seven in group 1 and three in group 2 (p = 0.02). There was one thrombosis in each group: six non-thrombotic complications in group 1 and two in group 2. Histological screening showed 12 HA injuries in group 1 (three HA wall edemas, five fibrosis, one edema + fibrosis, one hemorragic necrosis + thrombosis, two thrombosis) and three in group 2 (two HA wall edemas, one fibrosis) (p = 0.01). All these injuries were found at the proper HA and at the right/left HA bifurcation level.Conclusions:Despite the limits of our study, we found a higher incidence of radiological and histological injury in patients underwent TACE.
