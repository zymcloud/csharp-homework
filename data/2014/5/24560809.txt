Although Golgi protein 73 (GP73) has been widely evaluated for diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other liver diseases in recent decade, its serum profile of patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ACLF) is still unknown. This study was designed to evaluate the serum levels of GP73 in patients with HBV-ACLF. The participants included 200 apparently healthy controls; 200 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB); 200 patients with HCC; 210 patients with HBV-ACLF, in which 29 HBV-ACLF patients were followed up for 3 months. All patients were Hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) positive. The concentrations of GP73 in patients with HBV-ACLF (285.3 ± 128.5 ng/mL) were markedly higher than those HCC patients (159.1 ± 105.8 ng/mL), CHB patients (64.65 ± 44.99 ng/mL), and healthy controls (35.37 ± 12.41 ng/mL). When the cut-off value was set at 182.1 ng/mL, the sensitivity and specificity of HBV-ACLF diagnosis were 77.62% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 71.37%-83.07%) and 95.50% (95% CI: 92.27%-98.26%), respectively. If serum GP73 concentration was still above 361.6 ng/mL after 14 days of follow-up, the patient's prognosis may be depressed. Serum GP73 may be used to diagnosis HBV-ACLF in population with chronic HBV infections.
