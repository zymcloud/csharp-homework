Objective:To investigate the effects of mTOR-STAT3 pathway on the invasion and migration of hepatoma cell.Methods:mTOR and STAT3 expression in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 and normal liver cell line L02 were detected by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and western blotting. The migration and invasion abilities of cells and expression of STAT3 were detected by scratch adhesion test and transwell migration assays, after siRNA transfection blocking mTOR expression of HepG2 cells.Results:The HepG2 cells expression is higher compared with normal cells L02 expression. Western blotting assay showed the mTOR expression was blocked, while STAT3 expression was also decreased, after the siRNA transfection of HepG2 cells. The migration (scratch adhesion test) and invasion (transwell assays) abilities of HepG2 cells which the mTOR expression was blocked by siRNA interference were significantly decreased (PConclusion:mTORSTAT3 expression in hepatoma cells HepG2 was significantly higher than that in normal liver cells. mTOR blocking can reduce the expression of STAT3, which is also closely related to the invasion and metastasis of liver cancer cells.
