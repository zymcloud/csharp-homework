Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The efficacy of novel combination treatments are increasingly evaluated with use of integrative biology research and development (R&D) strategies and methodological triangulation. We investigated the anti-tumor effect of ɛ-viniferin alone, and the putative synergy of ɛ-viniferin with vincristine on the growth of HepG2 cells in vitro. Growth inhibition and apoptosis induction were determined by MTT assay and annexin V/propidium iodide (PI), respectively. Morphological changes and DNA fragmentation were investigated under electron microscopy and by agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. The results collectively showed that treating cells with ɛ-viniferin and vincristine significantly inhibited cell viability at lower doses as compared to each agent applied alone. IC(50) values for ɛ-viniferin and vincristine were determined as 98.3 and 52.5 μM at 24 h, respectively. IC(50) value of ɛ-viniferin in combination with vincristine was 15.8+11.25 μM (mean/SD) at 24 h. The viability of cells treated with 17.9 μM vincristine alone for 24 h was 79.62%; it reduced to 26.53% when 25 μM ɛ-viniferin was added in combination with vincristine (p
