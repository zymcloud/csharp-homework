Introduction:Simultaneous resection for colorectal cancer and synchronous colorectal liver metastases (SCRLM) has been found to be safe and effective. However, pure laparoscopic simultaneous resection (PULSAR) for primary colorectal cancer and SCRLM is usually difficult, especially in the right lobe of the liver. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of PULSAR for patients with primary colorectal cancer and SCRLM.Methods:From January 2008 to December 2012, a total of 10 patients (9 men and 1woman; mean age, 64 years) underwent PULSAR for a primary tumor and SCRLM.Results:Seven patients (70%) with lesions in the right lobe (segments 6, 7, and 8) successfully underwent resection with a pure laparoscopic procedure while in the left semi-prone position. No patient was converted to conventional open surgery. The mean operative duration, volume of bleeding, and postoperative hospital stay were 606 ± 46 min, 585 ± 145 mL, and 18 ± 3.5 days, respectively. Although a liver abscess developed in one patient, no colonic complications or perioperative death occurred.Conclusion:PULSAR for primary colorectal cancer and SCRLM is a feasible multidisciplinary treatment. Moreover, PULSAR can be safely and effectively performed with the patient in the semi-prone position, even when SCRLM exists in the right lobe of the liver.
