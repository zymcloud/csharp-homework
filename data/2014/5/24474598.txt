Purpose:To correlate metabolic response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACR) on FDG-PET/CT using PERCIST-based criteria to pathologic and clinical response, and survival in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer (LAEC).Materials and methods:Forty-five patients with LAEC underwent PET/CT at baseline and after NACR. Tumors were evaluated using PERCIST (PET response criteria in solid tumors)-based criteria including SUL, SUL tumor/liver ratio, % change in SUL. These parameters were compared to pathology regression grade (PRG), clinical response (including residual or new disease beyond the surgical specimen), and overall survival.Results:On surgical pathology, there was complete or near-complete regression of tumor in 51.1 %, partial response in 42.2 %, and lack regression in 4.4 %. One patient (2.2 %) had progression of disease on imaging and did not undergo surgical resection. None of the baseline PET parameters had significant correlation to pathology regression grade or clinical response. On follow-up, a positive correlation was found between post-therapy SUL ratio, %∆ SUL and %∆ SUL ratio and clinical response (p = 0.025, 0.035, 0.030, respectively). A weak correlation was found between post-therapy SUL ratio to PRG (p = 0.049). A strong correlation was found between the metabolic response score and PRG (p = 0.002) as well as between metabolic response and clinical response (p < 0.001).Conclusion:PERCIST-based metabolic response assessment to NACR in LAEC may correlate with clinical outcome and survival.
