Background/aims:To evaluate the efficacy of a surgical no-touch isolation technique in primary hepatocellular carcinoma patients compared with traditional hepatectomy.Methodology:Eighty hepatocellular carcinoma patients were randomly divided into traditional hepatectomy (n = 40) and no-touch isolation technique groups (n = 40). We compared peripheral blood variations in alpha-fetoprotein mRNA, miRNA-221, miRNA-224, and miRNA-122 expression levels in both groups pre- and postoperatively using real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction.Results:The patients in the no-touch isolation technique group had better clinical curative effect. In the traditional hepatectomy group, variations in alpha-fetoprotein mRNA copy number pre- and postoperatively indirectly indicated a significant increase in the number of exfoliated carcinoma cells induced by manipulating the liver, increasing the risk of postoperative recurrence and metastasis (P
