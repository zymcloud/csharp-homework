Although reports suggest that Schistosoma mansoni increases hepatitis C virus (HCV) morbidity and chronicity, its impact on HCV spontaneous resolution is not clear. HCV genotype, viral load, abdominal ultrasonographic findings, and HCV-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI) were examined among 141 healthcare workers infected with HCV (68 workers with and 73 workers without S. mansoni). HCV genotype 4 was dominate, and viral loads were 2.62 ± 0.69 × 10(6) and 4.24 ± 1.4 × 10(6) IU/mL among patients with and without coinfection, respectively (P = 0.309); 23.5% with and 32.9% without coinfection had spontaneously resolved HCV infection (P = 0.297). Interferon-γ spot-forming cells/10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells among responding viremic patients with and without coinfection were 716 ± 194 and 587 ± 162, whereas among aviremic patients, it was 794 ± 272 and 365 ± 36 (P > 0.05), respectively. In conclusion, there was no statistical difference in HCV spontaneous resolution, viral load, liver pathology, or CMI in patients with or without S. mansoni coinfection, suggesting that it did not impact the outcome of HCV infection.
