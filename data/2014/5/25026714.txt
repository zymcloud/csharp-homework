Two new fungal pigments named schweinitzins A and B (1-2), together with (S)-torosachrysone-8-O-methyl ether (3) and emodin-6,8-di-O-methyl ether (4) have been isolated from the methanolic extract of the fruit bodies of Xylaria schweinitzii (Xylariaceae) collected in Cuc Phuong national park, Ninh Binh province, Vietnam, by silica gel column chromatography and preparative HPLC. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis such as IR, UV-Vis, 2D NMR and FT-ICR-MS. In addition, two compounds (1 and 3) showed strong cytotoxicity against all four cancer cell lines, KB (a human epidermal carcinoma), MCF7 (human breast carcinoma), SK-LU-I (human lung carcinoma) and HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma).
