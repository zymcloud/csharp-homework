Nogo-A has been identified as an inhibitor of neurite outgrowth specific to the central nervous system. However, little is known about the role of Nogo-A in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common primary malignant tumor with a high mortality rate. This study aimed to investigate the role of endogenous Nogo-A in human liver cancer cells. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression of Nogo-A in four liver cancer cell lines. A lentivirus vector was then constructed to mediate RNA interference (RNAi) targeting of Nogo‑A (LV‑Nogo-A‑siRNA) and was confirmed to successfully suppress the expression of the Nogo-A gene in SMMC-7721 cells. Furthermore, Nogo-A was observed to be highly expressed in liver cancer cell lines. RNAi of Nogo-A using the LV‑Nogo-A‑siRNA construct significantly decreased Nogo-A protein expression and specifically inhibited the growth of SMMC-7721 cells. This growth inhibitory effect may be attributed to an increase in G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells containing Nogo-A‑siRNA. The results of this study demonstrate that Nogo-A may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of liver cancer, in addition to its potent roles in neural systems.
