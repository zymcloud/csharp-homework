Autophagy is a lysosome-associated, degradative process that catabolizes cytosolic components to recycle nutrients for further use and maintain cell homeostasis. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, which often leads to end-stage liver-associated diseases and is a significant burden on worldwide public health. Emerging lines of evidence indicate that autophagy plays an important role in promoting the HCV life cycle in host cells. Moreover, the diverse impacts of autophagy on a variety of signaling pathways in HCV-infected cells suggest that the autophagic process is required for balancing HCV-host cell interactions and involved in the pathogenesis of HCV-related liver diseases. However, the detailed molecular mechanism underlying how HCV activates autophagy to benefit viral growth is still enigmatic. Additionally, how the autophagic response contributes to disease progression in HCV-infected cells remains largely unknown. Hence, in this review, we overview the interplay between autophagy and the HCV life cycle and propose possible mechanisms by which autophagy may promote the pathogenesis of HCV-associated chronic liver diseases. Moreover, we outline the related studies on how autophagy interplays with HCV replication and discuss the possible implications of autophagy and viral replication in the progression of HCV-induced liver diseases, e.g., steatosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Finally, we explore the potential therapeutics that target autophagy to cure HCV infection and its related liver diseases.
