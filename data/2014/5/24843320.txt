Previous reports have shown that interferon (IFN)-based therapy decreases the risk of development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, it remains to be fully elucidated whether elimination of HCV by IFN-based therapy inhibits HCC recurrence after curative treatment, such as surgical resection and local ablation therapies. In this study, we aimed to clarify the influence of a sustained virological response (SVR) after IFN-based therapy on recurrence and survival after curative treatment of HCC. Fifty-one patients who underwent curative treatment of HCV-related HCC after receiving IFN-based therapy were analyzed retrospectively. They were classified into SVR (N = 14) and non-SVR groups (N = 37). In the SVR group, serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, the indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min, and the percentages of patients with liver cirrhosis and HCV serotype 1 were significantly lower, whereas serum albumin level and platelet count were significantly higher upon HCC occurrence. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) for the first recurrence was significantly higher in the SVR group (P
