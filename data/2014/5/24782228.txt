Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B is a non-transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase and major negative regulator in insulin signaling cascades, and much attention has been paid to protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitors as potential therapies for diabetes. The screening of a natural compound library led to the discovery of five lavandulyl flavonoids, which were isolated from the roots of Sophora flavescens, as novel PTP1B inhibitors: kuraridin (1), norkurarinone (2), kurarinone (3), 2'-methoxykurarinone (4), and kushenol T (5). The three most potent compounds, 1, 2, and 4 (IC50
