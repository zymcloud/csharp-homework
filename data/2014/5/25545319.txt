Introduction:In selected patients, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a well-established treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, subcapsular or lesions close to adjacent viscera preclude a percutaneous approach. In this setting laparoscopic-RFA (LRFA) is a potential alternative. The aim of this study was to analyse the safety and feasibility of LRFA in patients with HCC.Patients and methods:Retrospective study of patients with HCC meeting strict inclusion criteria who underwent LRFA at a single Institution from December 2000 to March 2013.Results:Forty-one patients underwent 42 LRFA of 51 nodules. The median size of the nodule was 2.5 (range 1.2-4.7) cm. Thirty-one tumours were subcapsular and 17 located near the gallbladder. Major complications occurred in 17 patients. The initial complete response (ICR) rate was 94% and was lower among tumours located adjacent to the gallbladder. At the end of the follow-up period, the sustained complete response (SCR) rate was 70% and was lower in tumours adjacent to the gallbladder while increased for subcapsular tumours. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rate was 92.6%, 64.5% and 43%, respectively.Conclusion:LRFA of HCC is safe, feasible and achieves excellent results in selected patients. LRFA should be the first-line technique for subcapsular lesions as it minimizes the risk of tumoural seeding and improves ICR. Proximity to gallbladder interferes in treatment efficacy (lower rate of ICR and lower rate of SCR).
