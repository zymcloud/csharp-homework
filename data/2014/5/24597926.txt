Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. There is growing evidence for a chemopreventive role of nutrition in the development of HCC in at risk populations. Bibliographical searches were performed in PubMed for the terms 'nutrition and hepatocellular carcinoma', 'nutrition and liver cancer', 'nutrition and hepatic cancer', 'diet and hepatocellular carcinoma', 'diet and liver cancer'. High dietary sugar intake should be discouraged in at risk populations. Coffee, polyphenols, vanadium, dietary fibre, fruits and vegetables show encouraging results in terms of chemoprevention. Red meat intake may be associated with increased risk of HCC. The evidence for fatty acids is inconclusive, but they might exert anti-cancer effects. Inconclusive results are available on vitamins, selenium probiotics and prebiotics. There is increasing evidence that diet may play an important role in the development of HCC, and may also have a chemopreventive role in at risk populations.
