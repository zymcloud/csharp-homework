Aim:To compare the pharmacokinetics of radiofrequency (RF) ablation with chemolipiodolization using cisplatin (CDDP) powder and miriplatin (MPT) in a porcine liver.Methods:Twelve pigs were divided equally into four groups. After each CDDP powder-lipiodol suspension (n = 6; groups A and B) or MPT-lipiodol suspension (n = 6; groups C and D) was injected into the lateral left artery, one RF ablation was performed at the lateral left lobe of each pig. Six pigs (groups A and C) were killed on the same day as treatment, whereas the other pigs (groups B and D) were killed 7 days after the treatment. The platinum concentrations in venous blood were assayed at 15, 60 and 120 min, and 7 days after treatment. The platinum concentrations in the ablated area and the surrounding liver were also examined.Results:Plasma platinum concentrations of the CDDP group peaked at 15 min, and then gradually diminished over time (Î¼g units), while plasma platinum levels in the MPT group gradually increased over time (ng units). Liver tissue platinum concentrations of the CDDP group were significantly lower in non-ablative areas than in ablated areas at days 0 and 7, while liver concentrations of the MPT group were significantly higher in non-ablative areas than in ablated areas at day 7.Conclusion:MPT may be a suitable chemotherapeutic agent to stagnate platinum in the surrounding liver.
