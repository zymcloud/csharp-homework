Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most serious health problems worldwide. As in many other diseases, environment and genetic factors are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of HCC. Numerous epidemiologic investigations including case-control and cohort studies have suggested the association of glutathione S-transferase (GST) genetic polymorphisms and HCC risk. However, some studies have produced conflicting results. Therefore, we performed an updated meta-analysis to clarify this inconsistency and to establish a comprehensive picture of the association of the polymorphisms of GSTM1 and GSTT1 with HCC susceptibility. We searched PubMed, Embase, ISI Web of Science, and CNKI databases to identify eligible studies meeting the inclusion criteria up to August 30, 2013. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of association. Finally, there were a total of 33 studies with 4,232 cases and 6,601 controls included in this meta-analysis. In the pooled analysis, significantly increased HCC risks were found for null genotype of GSTM1 (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.07-1.61, P = 0.010, P heterogeneity
