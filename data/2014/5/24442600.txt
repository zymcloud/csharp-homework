Radioembolization (RE) with (90)Y microspheres is a promising catheter-based therapeutic option for patients with unresectable primary and metastatic liver tumours. Its rationale arises from the dual blood supply of liver tissue through the hepatic artery and the portal vein. Metastatic hepatic tumours measuring >3 mm derive 80 - 100 % of their blood supply from the arterial rather than the portal hepatic circulation. Typically, an angiographic evaluation combined with (99m)Tc-macroaggregated albumin ((99m)Tc-MAA) scan precedes therapy to map the tumour feeding vessels as well as to avoid the inadvertent deposition of microspheres in organs other than the liver. Prior to administration of (99m)Tc-MAA, prophylactic coil embolization of the gastroduodenal artery is recommended to avoid extrahepatic deposition of the microspheres. SPECT/CT allows direct correlation of anatomic and functional information in patients with unresectable liver disease. SPECT/CT is recommended to assess intrahepatic distribution as well as extrahepatic gastrointestinal uptake in these patients. Pretherapeutic SPECT/CT is an important component of treatment planning including catheter positioning and dose finding. A post-therapy bremsstrahlung (BS) scan should follow RE to verify the distribution of the administered tracer. BS SPECT/CT imaging enables better localization and definition of intrahepatic and possible extrahepatic sphere distribution and to a certain degree allows posttreatment dosimetry. In this paper we address the usefulness and significance of SPECT/CT in therapy planning and therapy monitoring of RE.
