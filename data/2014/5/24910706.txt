Background:Gene expression microarrays' analyses provide a description of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) with lack of coding protein function that is often important in human cancer.Objectives:A number of lncRNAs that have been well characterized in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been scheduled in this study to discuss for protein-lncRNA interaction.Materials and methods:The identified lncRNAs were analyzed by bioinformatics tools, starBase and lncRNA db, to anticipate the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that tend to interact to HCC-related lncRNAs. The most important predicted RBPs in interaction with well-known lncRNAs in HCC were briefly discussed.Results:The lncRNAs HOTTIP, H19, HOTAIR, MALAT1, antisense Igf2r (AIR), HOXA13, GTL2 (also called MEG3) and uc002mb have been reported in association with HCC. Besides, this study predicted that eIF4AIII, PTB and FUS were the most involved RBPs in interaction with HCC-related lncRNAs.Conclusions:This information provides an explanation for the previously valuable literature on the functions of lncRNAs and suggest for the novel therapeutic targeting.
