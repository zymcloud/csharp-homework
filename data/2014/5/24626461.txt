Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is one of the major causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It has been demonstrated that the overexpression of angiogenic factors are associated with the maintenance of liver neoplasia. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are important regulators of angiogenesis and are important in wound healing, the regeneration of new vessels and reproductive functions. The present study investigated the role of the HCV core protein in the induction of HIF-1α and VEGF expression. The HCV core gene and HIF-1α siRNA were transfected into Huh7.5.1 cells. The results demonstrated that the induction of HCV core gene expression in Huh7.5.1 cells leads to the overexpression and stabilization of HIF-1α, and the activation of HIF-1α leads, in turn, to the stimulation of VEGF, which is one of the most important angiogenic factors. These results provide new information to facilitate the understanding of HCC oncogenesis.
