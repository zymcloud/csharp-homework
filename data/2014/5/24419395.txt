Thrombosis of the portal venous system is a frequent and potentially life-threatening condition that can take place in a number of different clinical settings including liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, other solid tumours, abdominal septic foci, acute pancreatitis, haematological malignancies and congenital or acquired prothrombotic disorders. Clinical decision-making in patients with thrombosis of the portal venous system is a particularly complex process owing to the heterogeneity of the population affected by this condition and the lack of high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials for the use of anticoagulation therapy in these patients. This Review discusses the available data regarding how imaging can provide assistance to physicians involved in this decision-making process in different clinical settings. A flowchart illustrating how to use imaging in this setting, based on current evidence and on the experience of the Vascular Liver Diseases Group of the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona, is also presented.
