The existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) is central to the pathogenesis and therapeutic target of human hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of casticin on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) derived from the SMMC-7721 cell line. Our results demonstrated that CD133+ sphere-forming cells (SFCs) sorted from the SMMC-7721 cell line not only possessed a higher capacity to form tumor spheroids in vitro, but also had a greater potential to form tumors when implanted in Balb/c-nu mice, indicating that CD133+ SFCs possessed similar traits to LCSCs. Casticin increased the expression levels of E-cadherin and decreased those of N-cadherin in LCSCs. Treatment of LCSCs with casticin for 48 h also decreased the levels of the EMT-associated transcription factor, Twist. Overexpression of Twist attenuated the casticin-induced regulation of E-cadherin and N-cadherin protein expression, as well as the EMT capacity of LCSCs. In conclusion, CD133+ SFCs of the SMMC-7721 cell line may represent a subpopulation of LCSCs with the characteristics of EMT. Furthermore, casticin targeted LCSCs through the inhibition of EMT by downregulating Twist.
