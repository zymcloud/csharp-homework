Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) expression was associated with the onset, development, invasion, and metastasis of numerous tumor types including prostate cancer, melanoma, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, and breast cancer. However, RKIP mRNA expression and the clinical significance in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) remain unresolved. Real-time PCR was performed to detect the expression of RKIP mRNA in 126 pairs of lung tumor tissues (TT) and surrounding normal tissues (sNT). Correlations between RKIP mRNA expression and clinicopathological features were evaluated by statistical analysis. In the 126 patients examined, RKIP mRNA expression was significantly lower in lung TT than the sNT (p < 0.05). Our results indicated that downregulation of RKIP mRNA expression was associated with a poorer N-stage (p = 0.019) and poorer pathological TNM stage (p = 0.015). However, no significant association was observed between the expression status of RKIP mRNA and clinicopathologic factors, such as gender, age, histological type, and the size of the tumor (p > 0.05). The level of RKIP mRNA expression was found to be significantly downregulated in NSCLC, and the lower mRNA levels correlated with poorer differentiation, advanced pathologic TNM stage in patients with NSCLC.
