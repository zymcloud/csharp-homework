Objectives:Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of pulmonary metastasectomy for postoperative colorectal cancer with hepatic metastasis, and to investigate the role of clinicopathological factors as predictors of outcome.Methods:Consecutive patients undergoing pulmonary metastasectomy for colorectal cancer with (group PH, n = 27) or without (group P, n = 46) a history of hepatic metastasis were included in the study. Clinicopathological variables, including sex, age, site, carcinoembryonic antigen in the primary tumor, disease-free interval, prior hepatic resection, timing of pulmonary metastases, preoperative chemotherapy, type of pulmonary resection, and number, size, and location of pulmonary metastases were retrospectively collected and investigated for prognostic significance.Results:Five-year survival rates were 59.5 and 70.0 % for patients with and without a history of hepatic metastasis, respectively; these values did not differ significantly. Among all investigated prognostic variables, sex and number of pulmonary metastases (1 vs. >1) were the most important factors affecting the outcome after colorectal and pulmonary resection. There was no significant difference in overall survival whether it was calculated from the time of resection of the primary colorectal cancer or of pulmonary metastases.Conclusions:Pulmonary resection is not contraindicated in clinical practice. Significant factors indicating a good prognosis were female sex and the number of pulmonary metastases. Special attention should be paid to comparison of survival among studies.
