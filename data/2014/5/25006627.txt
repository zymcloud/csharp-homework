Purpose:To evaluate the diagnostic value of gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:A systematic, comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed (2004 [Gd-EOB-DTPA was first approved in Europe in 2004] to April 2013), Embase (2004 to April 2013), Web of Science (2004 to April 2013), and the Cochrane Library (2004 to April 2013). The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Studies (QUADAS) items was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. Stata 12.0 was used to analyze the data. Pooled sensitivity (SEN), pooled specificity (SPE), pooled positive likelihood ratio (PLR), pooled negative likelihood ratio (NLR), pooled diagnostic odds ratio (dOR), and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves were calculated to assess the diagnostic value of the individual diagnostic tests.Results:A total of 11 articles were included, involving 1578 nodules from four countries. The results of the meta-analysis showed that the pooled SEN, SPE, and SROC curve values were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89-0.94) 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93-0.97), and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.95-0.99), respectively, and subgroup analyses were performed.Conclusion:Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI has value for the detection of HCC; in particular, it has high sensitivity for the detection of lesions larger than 10 mm.
