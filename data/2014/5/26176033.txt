Background/aims:Indication of hepatectomy for liver metastases from gastric cancer (LMGC) is still controversial despite many papers favoring surgery. The aim of this study is to claim that we should accept hepatectomy as first choice treatment for LMGC. It is important to have a consensus on this matter for surgeons to treat LMGC properly.Methodology:Fifty three patients undergoing hepatectomy for LMGC from 1990 through 2010 were retrospectively analysed for survival and prognostic factors. Analyses were made on size, multiplicity, synchronicity and positive surgical margin as liver metastasis factors. Serosal invasion, node metastasis, histological differentiation and UICC stage were analysed as primary site factors. Multivariate analysis was performed for those positive for univariate analysis.Results:Cumulative 5 year survival rate was 27%. Multiplicity, positive margin and node metastasis (N > 2) yielded significant difference on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis multiplicity and node metastasis (N > 2) were significant.Conclusion:Hepatectomy for LMGC is potentially curative and should be regarded as first choice. Solitary and N < 3 are good prognostic factors.
