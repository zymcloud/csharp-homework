In total portosplenomesenteric thrombosis patients, cavoportal hemitransposition (CPHT) is indicated but rarely applicable for adult-to-adult (A-to-A) living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) because partial liver graft requires splanchno-portal inflow for liver graft regeneration. If intra- & peri-pancreatic collaterals draining into pericholedochal varix were present, pericholedochal varix may provide splanchnic blood flow to the transplanted liver and also relieve recipient's portal hypertension. To date, however, there is no successful report using pericholedochal varix in liver transplantation (LT). We successfully performed A-to-A LDLTs using pericholedochal varix for those 2 patients. The surgical strategies are followings: (a) dissection of hepatic hilum to isolate left hepatic artery using for arterial reconstruction of implanted right lobe graft, (b) en-mass clamping of the undissected remaining hilum if we can leave adequate length of stump from the clamping site, and then hilum is divided, (c) delay the donor hepatectomy until the feasibility of the recipient operation is confirmed. Portal flow was established between the sizable pericholedochal varix (caliber > 1cm) and graft portal vein, but the individually designed approaches were used for each patients. Currently, they have been enjoying normal life on posttransplant 92 and 44 months respectively. In conclusion, enlarged pericholedochal varix in patients with totally obliterated splanchnic veins might be an useful inflow to restore portal flow and secure good outcome in A-to-A LDLT. AASLD.
