In Europe, trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is usually given to patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) "intermediate stage" hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and is associated with a modest improvement in median overall survival. In the two positive randomized trials that have been reported, TACE was stopped in cases of severe toxicity, worsening of liver cirrhosis or performance status and tumor progression, including local progression, extrahepatic spread and portal vein thrombosis. The necessity to stop TACE leads to the concept of untreatable progression, which is characterized by massive liver involvement, extrahepatic spread, vascular invasion, impaired liver function or performance status. More recently, the assessment for re-treatment with TACE (ART) score has been developed to determine which patients will not benefit from a second or a third TACE therapy. Herein, we propose an algorithm that summarizes our experience with TACE.
Hepatocellular carcinoma; Intermediate stage; Transarterial chemoembolization.
