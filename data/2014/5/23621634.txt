Aim:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide. Liver is the largest human digestive gland with abundant Golgi apparatus involved in cell division, migration and apoptosis and others.Methods:In the present study, Golgi apparatus of HCC and the surrounding liver tissues were isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and identified by electron microscopy and enzymology methods. Using 2-D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, 17 differentially expressed protein of Golgi apparatus in HCC and the surrounding liver tissue were screened and identified in the Mascot database.Results:Of those differentially expressed proteins, six were upregulated and 11 were downregulated, some of them were related to the biological processes such as protein sorting, glycosylation, cell cycle regulation, transcription regulation and Golgi integrity. One protein, annexin A5, was verified to be upregulated in HCC by western blot.Conclusion:The differentially expressed proteins may provide new insight into HCC biology and potential diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers.
