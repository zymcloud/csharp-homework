Background:Hepatic resection is the preferred treatment for huge hepatocellular carcinoma (>10 cm in diameter; H-HCC). However, the patients with H-HCC suffer from poor prognosis due to the early recurrence/metastasis. The underlying mechanism of H-HCC's early recurrence/metastasis is currently not well understood.Results:Here, we describe an Isobaric Tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomics approach to analyze the early recurrence/metastasis related proteins of H-HCC after radical resection through multidimensional chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (2DLC-MS/MS). The different protein expression profiles between the early recurrence/metastasis within 6 months(R/M≤6months) and late recurrence/metastasis within 6-12 months after surgery (R/M6-12months) were confirmed and might reveal different underlying molecular mechanisms. We identified 44 and 49 significantly differentially expressed proteins in the R/M≤6months group and the R/M6-12months group compared to the group who had no recurrence within 2 years post surgery (the NR/M group), respectively. Moreover, among those proteins, S100A12 and AMACR were down regulated in the R/M≤6months group but up-regulated in the R/M6-12months group; and this regulation was further confirmed in mRNA and protein level by Q-PCR, Western-Blot and Immunohistochemistry (IHC).Conclusions:This current study presents the first proteomic profile of the early recurrence/metastasis of H-HCC. The results suggest that S100A12 and AMACR might be potential prognostic markers for predicting the early recurrence/metastasis of H-HCC after hepatectomy.
