Background/aims:Hepatitis C virus infects more than 3% of the world's population and 4% of Pakistan's population. The virus multiplies in the host using novel methods, defending itself from the host's immune response, ultimately leading to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The approved therapy for the disease is interferon alpha combined with ribavirin. The disease is incurable, and often resistant, due to multiple viral and cellular factors. However, a strong host system can minimize the viral count to zero. This study was designed to detect the functional interferon alpha receptor 2 in liver biopsies of interferon resistant hepatitis C virus patients.Methodology:Total messenger ribonucleic acid was isolated from the liver biopsies of the interferon resistant hepatitis C virus patients and subjected to complementary deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. Primers specific to interferon alpha receptor 2 were designed and used in polymerase chain reaction to detect interferon alpha receptor 2.Results:Interferon alpha receptor 2 was detected in 90% of interferon resistant hepatitis C virus patients.Conclusion:Lack of expression of functional Interferon Alpha Receptor 2 does not seem to be the major cause of interferon resistance in hepatitis C virus patients receiving standard interferon therapy.
