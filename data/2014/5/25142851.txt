Objective:To assess the safety and short-term therapeutic efficacies of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous microwave ablation (PMA) for diaphragm-abutting liver tumors.Methods:A total of 69 patients with 75 diaphragm-abutting liver tumors (tumor from diaphragmc ≤ 5 mm) underwent CT-guided PMA. According to the site of diaphragm-abutting lesions, they were divided into neighboring muscle group (group A) and neighboring aponeurosis group (group B); According to the size of lesions, they were divided into <2.5 cm group (group I) and ≥ 2.5 cm group (group II). The complications of intra and post-ablation within 2 weeks were recorded. They underwent contrast enhanced CT (CECT) or contrast enhanced MRI (CEMRI) at Month 1, 3 and 6 post-ablation. Then CEMRI or CECT was re-checked every 3-6 months. All patients were followed up for 12-30 months. Comparative analyses were performed for short-term therapeutic efficacies.Results:At Month 1 post-PMA, complete response (CR) rate was 86.7% (65/75) and incomplete response (ICR) rate 13.3% (10/75). After additional ablation, 5 lesions transformed into CR.No statistical difference in CR rate existed between groups A and B (95.0% vs 77.1%). The CR rate of group I was obviously higher than that of group II (95.0% vs 77.1%). The 1-year survival rate was 97.1%. The occurring rate of minor complications was 42.0% (29/69) and that of serious complications 2.9% (2/69).No statistical difference of occurring rates of minor complications existed between groups A and B(38.1%vs 45.5%). But the occurring rates of diaphragmatic burns, pulmonary exudation and pneumothorax had obvious statistical differences between two groups. The occurring rate of minor complications in group I was obviously lower than that of group II (30.0% vs 54.3%) and serious complications occurred in group II. Minor complications were reversible and recovered after non-special or symptomatic treatment. Two cases of serious complications improved after standard clinical treatment.Conclusion:CT-guided PMA for diaphragm-abutting liver tumors is both safe and effective.However puncture route and power/time should be optimized according to tumor size and location.
