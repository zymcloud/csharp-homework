Most liver tumors are benign and hypervascular, and it is important to avoid unnecessary interventions for benign lesions. This review describes the typical and atypical imaging features of common hypervascular benign liver tumors and outlines a general approach to distinguishing between benign and malignant hepatic lesions. There are many types of benign liver tumors that need to be differentiated from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, it is very important to know the imaging characteristics of benign tumors. Gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is helpful in diagnosing hypervascular pseudotumors, focal nodular hyperplasia, and nodular lesions associated with alcohol-induced hepatitis. There are also some hypervascular malignant tumors, such as cholangiocarcinoma, cholangiolocellular carcinoma, mixed type tumors, and metastatic liver tumors, which also required differentiation from HCC.
