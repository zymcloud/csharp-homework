Objectives:To compare the potential of T1 mapping on gadoxetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for assessing liver function in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:One hundred consecutive patients with known HBV-related HCCs were included. T1 relaxation time and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the liver were measured, and the reduction rate of T1 relaxation time (∆%) was calculated. T1 relaxation time measurements were compared with ADC values according to the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score.Results:Hepatobiliary phase (HBP) and ∆% of T1 relaxation time measurements showed significant correlations with MELD score (rho = 0.571, p Conclusions:T1 mapping on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI showed promise for evaluating liver function in patients with HBV-related HCC, while DWI was not reliable. HBP T1 relaxation time measurement was equally accurate as ∆% measurement.Key points:• T 1 mapping on Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI was accurate for assessing liver function. • HBP T 1 relaxation time measurement was as accurate as ∆% T 1 • T 1 mapping on Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI was more accurate than DWI-ADC measurement.
