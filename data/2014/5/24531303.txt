Objectives:To investigate the relationship between volume-based PET parameters and prognosis in patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS).Methods:We retrospectively reviewed 55 patients with pathologically proven STS who underwent pretreatment with (18) F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) PET/CT. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), average SUV (SUVavg), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of primary tumors were measured using a threshold SUV as liver activity for determining the boundary of tumors. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses for overall survival were performed according to the metabolic parameters and other clinical variables.Results:Cancer-related death occurred in 19 of 55 patients (35 %) during the follow-up period (29 Â± 23 months). On univariate analysis, AJCC stage (stage IV vs. I-III, hazard ratio (HR) = 2.837, p = 0.028), necrosis (G2 vs. G0-G1, HR = 3.890, p = 0.004), SUVmax (1 unit - increase, HR = 1.146, p = 0.008), SUVavg (1 unit - increase, HR = 1.469, p = 0.032) and treatment modality (non-surgical therapy vs. surgery, HR = 4.467, p = 0.002) were significant predictors for overall survival. On multivariate analyses, SUVmax (HR = 1.274, p = 0.015), treatment modality (HR = 3.353, p = 0.019) and necrosis (HR = 5.985, p = 0.006) were identified as significant independent prognostic factors associated with decreased overall survival.Conclusions:The SUVmax of the primary tumor is a significant independent metabolic prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with STS. Volume-based PET parameters may not add prognostic information outside of the SUVmax.
