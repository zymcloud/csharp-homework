Background & aims:Sorafenib is recommended as the treatment of choice for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with extrahepatic spread (EHS). However, early discontinuation of sorafenib treatment is not uncommon because of adverse events, deterioration of liver function and/or performance. This study aimed to investigate the treatment outcome and prognostic factors of sorafenib treatment in HCC patients with EHS in which sorafenib was administered for at least 8 weeks.Methods:From May 2007 to December 2012, a total of 254 HCC patients with EHS were treated with sorafenib monotherapy for at least 8 weeks. The treatment outcome, risk factors for disease progression, and overall survival were retrospectively analyzed.Results:The median duration of radiologic progression and overall survival after sorafenib was 2.5 and 9.6 months, respectively. Prognostic factors for radiologic progression were intrahepatic tumor with macrovascular invasion (MVI) (hazard ratio (HR) 2.38, pConclusion:Sorafenib prolonged survival in HCC patients with EHS who achieved disease control. Intrahepatic tumor is a poor prognostic factor for both disease progression and overall survival in HCC patients with EHS treated with sorafenib.
