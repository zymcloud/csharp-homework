Background/aims:The present pilot study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) with interferon-beta (IFN-β) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methodology:We studied 10 patients with advanced HCC and who were unresponsive to previous HAIC using low-dose 5-FU and cisplatin. The median age was 67 years. Eight patients had portal vein tumor thrombosis and four patients had extrahepatic metastasis. Using a drug delivery system, patients were treated with HAIC of IFN-β (600 MIU/body, three times/week) and 5-FU (250 mg/body, five times/week). Chemotherapy was repeated consecutively for 2 weeks every 4 weeks.Results:Six (60%) patients had a decrease in tumor markers alpha-fetoprotein (APP) or des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP). The median overall survival was 108 days and the 1-year survival rate was 10.0%. Univariate analysis showed two significant prognostic factors related to long-term survival for more than 60 days: a decrease in APP or DCP 4 weeks after treatment (P = 0.035) and no extra hepatic metastasis (P = 0.035). Severe hepatic injury was not observed.Conclusions:HAIC with IFN-β and 5-PU exerts modest antitumor effects and poses no particular safety concerns. This may be a new promising strategy for treatment of advanced HCC.
