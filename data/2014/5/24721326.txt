Background:The beneficial effects of bevacizumab, a widely used agent in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), on clinical survival have been proven. This study investigated the correlation of the clinical benefits and prognosis with proteinuria and other parameters.Methods:The study included mCRC patients receiving bevacizumab. Hypertension, 24-hour urine proteinuria, and other routine parameters were recorded at baseline and at certain intervals during treatment.Results:The study included 36 consecutive patients. The median progression-free survival (PFS) duration was 10.9±2.6months, and the median overall survival (OS) was 23±3.1months. The median PFS was 7.2months among patients with basal proteinuria above 114mg/day, whereas the median PFS was 12months among patients with an equal or lower level (P=0.010). Similarly, PFS was shorter in patients with high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels (LDH, P=0.022; CEA, P=0.014). Bevacizumab response's performance status was good (P=0.05) and was even better in patients with a single liver metastasis (P=0.034) or hypertension (P=0.034).Conclusions:We demonstrated that high basal proteinuria, LDH, or CEA levels may be negative prognostic factors in mCRC patients receiving bevacizumab.
