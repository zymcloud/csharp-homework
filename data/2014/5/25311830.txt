With the approval of 2 direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in 2011 and anticipation of interferon (IFN)-free regimens, more hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronically infected patients are now seeking treatment. To describe the characteristics of newly referred HCV patients in 2011-2012 (Era-2) and compare them to those seen in 1998-1999 (Era-1). Retrospective data were collected from HCV patients newly referred to our tertiary liver clinics. Advanced liver disease was defined as cirrhosis (based on histology or Aspartate aminotransferase-platelet-ratio index (APRI) >2), hepatic decompensation or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 1348 patients (538 in Era-1, 810 in Era-2) were included. Compared to Era-1, Era-2 patients were older (median age 56 vs 45 years), more likely to be black (17.2% vs 11.6%) and had a longer interval between diagnosis and referral (median 4 vs 2 years). Genotype (GT) 1 predominated in both Eras with a significant increase in GT1a from 39.9% in Era-1 to 53.8% in Era-2. A higher per cent of patients in Era-2 were treatment experienced, but 77% had never received treatment. Era-2 patients were more likely to have advanced disease at referral (61.6% vs 51.5%, P
