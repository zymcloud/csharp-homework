The use of phlebotomy is relatively common for 'difficult-to-treat by antiviral therapies' hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients and for certain patients having chronic liver diseases with an iron overload of the liver. In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed patients treated with phlebotomy and their adverse events. We observed the occurrence and recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma, and the appearance of ascites in some patients infected with HCV as well as the reduction of serum ferritin and alanine aminotransferase levels. Severe adverse events necessitating a cessation of phlebotomy occurred independently of Î±-fetoprotein (>10 ng/ml) in patients infected with HCV according to multivariate logistic regression analysis. These findings may serve as a basis for phlebotomy especially in older patients with chronic hepatitis C.
