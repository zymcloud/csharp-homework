Background and aim:Doxorubicin-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) is a novel locoregional treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, to date, the benefits of DEB-TACE versus conventional transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) remain unclear. This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the two treatments for patients with unresectable HCC.Methods:We searched for relevant articles by means of computerized bibliographic search and complementary manual search. Objective tumor response, overall survival, and adverse events were then calculated and analyzed.Results:A total of seven clinical studies with 700 participants were included in the current meta-analysis. Significantly better objective tumor response was found for DEB-TACE than for conventional TACE (OR = 1.92, 95% CI [1.34, 2.77]; P = 0.0004), with relative risk difference of 0.15 [0.07, 0.24] (P = 0.0003). One-year and 2-year survival rates were statistically significantly higher for DEB-TACE compared with conventional TACE (Peto OR, 95% CI: 0.64 [0.46, 0.89], P = 0.007; 0.61 [0.47, 0.80], P = 0.0003, respectively). Peto ORs of 6-month and 3-year survival were 0.72 [0.46, 1.14] (P = 0.16) and 0.77 [0.55, 1.06] (P = 0.11), respectively, showing no difference statistically. However, we could still find a tendency favoring DEB-TACE. Adverse side effects were similar in both groups, with postembolization syndrome occurring most commonly.Conclusions:This meta-analysis shows that DEB-TACE provides significantly better tumor response compared with conventional TACE. One-year and 2-year survival are better with DEB-TACE. In addition, DEB-TACE is as safe as conventional TACE. Therefore, DEB-TACE is a better choice for HCC patients for whom curative treatments like liver transplantation and liver resection are not suitable.
