Background and aims:Surgical resection (SR) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) have been commonly applied for patients with huge hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, optimal treatment has not been established.Methods:Between 2000 and 2009, 267 patients with huge HCC (â‰¥ 10 cm) underwent TACE and 84 underwent SR as the first treatment. Propensity score matching generated a matched cohort composed of 152 patients. We investigated overall survival and possible prognostic factors.Results:At baseline, the surgery group showed a tendency to have solitary tumor (72.6% vs 39.3%, P Conclusion:Comparing survival after SR and TACE, we showed that SR would be associated with better outcomes than TACE as the first treatment of huge HCC.
