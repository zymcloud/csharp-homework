Activation of p53 can induce apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and cell senescence, although some evidence has suggested that p53 could promote cell survival. However, whether p53 plays a positive role in cancer cell survival to chemotherapy remains unknown. In this study, we show that inhibition of p53 enhanced apoptosis and increased chemosensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in nutrient-deprived hepatocarcinoma cells (HCC). Meanwhile, nutrient-deprivation-induced autophagy was inhibited by pifithrin-Î± or small interfering RNA targeting p53. The expression of p53 was not increased when HCC were incubated under nutrient-deprived conditions. This indicates that the basal level of p53 is important to autophagy activation in nutrient-deprived HCC cells. Furthermore, combining p53 inhibition and nutrient deprivation or 5-FU treatment resulted in a marked increase in reactive oxygen species generation and mitochondrial damage. Antioxidants reduced nutrient deprivation or 5-FU-induced cell death of HCC after p53 inhibition. Our results suggest that p53 contributes to cell survival and chemoresistance in HCC under nutrient-deprived conditions by modulating autophagy activation.
