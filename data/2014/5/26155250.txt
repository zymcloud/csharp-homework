Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies in the world, with high frequency rates in Asia. Many of the patients have unresectable disease at the time of diagnosis, and early detection and surgical resection is the best hope for survival. But, if HCC is presenting as an extrahepatic mass, the diagnosis is difficult. Herein, we report a case of primary HCC masquerading as a pelvic mass. A 74-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital due to a palpable mass in the lower abdomen. CT scan detected an approximately 15.0×13.4×11.4 cm-sized multilobulated homogeneous enhancing mass in the right adnexa. Operative findings showed that the pelvic mass originated from the liver. We performed hepatic wedge resection. Permanent histopathologic report revealed primary HCC. Exophytic-growing hepatocellular carcinoma should be carefully diagnosed.
