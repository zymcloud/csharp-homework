Background:With the advent of 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), many subcentimeter hepatic nodules have been frequently detected in patients with chronic liver disease, and the prediction of subcentimeter nodules that progress to hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is important.Purpose:To reveal the imaging features of subcentimeter hypointense nodules on gadoxetic acid-enhanced hepatobiliary phase MR images in patients with chronic liver disease that may be related with progression to hypervascular HCC.Material and methods:This study included 109 patients with 135 subcentimeter hypointense nodules (103 hepatocellular carcinomas [HCCs] and 32 benign nodules) on gadoxetic acid-enhanced hepatobiliary phase. For each subcentimeter nodule, the following imaging features were analyzed: (i) hyperintensity on T2-weighted (T2W) image or DWI; (ii) arterial hypervascularization; and (iii) hypointensity on a portal or late phase. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of those imaging features for predicting subcentimeter nodules that progressed to hypervascular HCC were evaluated. Volume doubling time (VDT) of subcentimeter nodules that progressed to hypervascular HCC was compared to that of growing benign nodules.Results:Arterial hypervascularization with washout yielded the highest specificity (90.6%) and PPV (95.4%) for prediction of subcentimeter nodules that progressed to hypervascular HCC. Combining hyperintensity on T2W image or DWI and arterial hypervascularization with washout did not raise the specificity (90.6%) for prediction of subcentimeter nodules that progressed to hypervascular HCC. Mean VDT (112.2 ± 106.3 days) of subcentimeter nodules that progressed to hypervascular HCC during follow-up was significantly shorter than those of benign subcentimeter nodules (1258 ± 766.5 days, P Conclusion:Arterial hypervascularization with washout in subcentimeter hypointense nodules on gadoxetic acid-enhanced hepatobiliary phase in patients with chronic liver disease is strongly related with progression to hypervascular HCC.
