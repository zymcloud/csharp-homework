Background:Repeated resection via an open approach is an effective treatment for post-operative recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, there are limited data on the application of laparoscopic approach for recurrent HCC in patients with prior liver resections. The aim of this study was to review our experience of laparoscopic re-resection in patients with postoperative tumor recurrence.Materials and methods:A total of 11 patients received laparoscopic re-resections for postoperative tumor recurrence in our center. Data were reviewed for demographics, tumor characteristics, and perioperative outcomes. Case-match analysis with the open approach was performed in a 1:2 ratio.Results:Six patients had their first liver resection carried out via the open approach and the remaining five patients received the laparoscopic approach. The recurrent tumor size was 20 mm (12-50 mm) and ten patients had a solitary recurrence. Two patients had laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy and the remaining nine patients had sub-segmentectomies. There was no significant difference in patient characteristics, preoperative liver function, and tumor features between the laparoscopic and open groups. Perioperative blood loss was significantly reduced in the laparoscopic group (100 vs. 314 mL; p = 0.014) but the morbidity rate (18.2 vs. 4.5 %; p = 0.199) and length of hospitalization were comparable (6 vs. 5 days; p = 0.831). The 3-year overall survival rates for the laparoscopic and open groups were 60.0 and 89.3 %, respectively (p = 0.279).Conclusion:Our study showed that laparoscopic re-resection for recurrent HCC was feasible with satisfactory postoperative and oncological outcomes, even in patients with previous major liver resections.
