Objective:To evaluate the outcome of patients with hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-CC) or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (I-CC) on pathological examination after liver transplantation for HCC.Background:Information on the outcome of cirrhotic patients undergoing a transplant for HCC and with a diagnosis of HCC-CC or I-CC by pathological study is limited.Methods:Multicenter, retrospective, matched cohort 1:2 study.Study group:42 patients undergoing a transplant for HCC and with a diagnosis of HCC-CC or I-CC by pathological study; and control group: 84 patients with a diagnosis of HCC. I-CC subgroup: 27 patients compared with 54 controls; HCC-CC subgroup: 15 patients compared with 30 controls. Patients were also divided according to the preoperative tumor size and number: uninodular tumors 2 cm or smaller and multinodular or uninodular tumors 2 cm or larger. Median follow-up: 51 (range, 3-142) months.Results:The 1-, 3-, and 5-year actuarial survival rate differed between the study and control groups (83%, 70%, and 60% vs 99%, 94%, and 89%, respectively; P Conclusions:Patients with HCC-CC have similar survival to patients undergoing a transplant for HCC. Preoperative diagnosis of HCC-CC should not prompt the exclusion of these patients from transplant option.
