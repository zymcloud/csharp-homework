Cirrhosis can be sub-classified in clinical stages with distinct differences in prognosis and can even be reversed in some cases with successful etiological treatment. In this article, we review potential future therapies of cirrhosis, mainly focusing in the expansion of indications of currently licensed drugs. We strongly advocate that future therapies should focus on preventing the advent of complications and further progression of liver disease and should involve both primary and secondary care physicians. Such strategies could be based on the combination of currently licensed, relatively safe and inexpensive drugs and such randomized controlled trials should be prioritized in patients with advanced liver disease. The paradigm should be similar to that of prevention in cardiovascular diseases and long-term follow-up trials are needed.
