Resection and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Conclusion:Radiation segmentectomy is an effective technique with a favorable risk profile and radiology-pathology outcomes for solitary HCC â‰¤ 5 cm. This approach may allow for treatment of HCC in difficult locations. Since RFA and resection are not options given tumor location, there appears to be a strong rationale for this technique as second choice.
