Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging surpasses all other imaging modalities in characterizing liver lesions by virtue of the exquisite tissue contrast, specificity for various tissue types, and extreme sensitivity to contrast enhancement. In addition to differentiating benign from malignant lesions, MR imaging generally discriminates between the various malignant liver lesions. Hepatocellular carcinoma constitutes most primary malignant liver lesions and usually arises in the setting of cirrhosis. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is a distant second and features distinctly different imaging features. Overall, metastases are the most common malignant liver lesions and arise from several primary neoplasms; most commonly gastrointestinal, lung, breast, and genitourinary.
Cholangiocarcinoma; Embryonal sarcoma; Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma; Fibrolamellar carcinoma; Hepatic lymphoma; Hepatoblastoma; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Liver metastases.
