A 74-year-old woman was diagnosed with histologically proven multiple bilobar hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) in 2012. The lesions were inoperable and a repeat CT scan prior to starting chemotherapy revealed spontaneous regression of these lesions. Subsequent repeat scans have revealed continued regression of these lesions despite no active treatment. The case is presented with a literature review and discussion summarising the possible aetiologies of this phenomenon.
