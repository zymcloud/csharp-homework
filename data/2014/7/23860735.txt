Background:We aimed to clarify the association between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located near interleukin 28B and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A cohort comprising 792 patients treated with interferon for chronic hepatitis C was investigated. SNPs at rs8099917 and rs12979860 were determined. Cumulative incidence and HCC risk were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analyses for a mean follow-up period of 4.9 years. Fibrosis progression rate (FPR) was determined in these patients with a known time of infection (n = 294).Results:Cumulative HCC incidence was significantly higher in rs8099917 nonTT (minor homozygote or heterozygote) patients than in rs8099917 TT (major homozygote) patients (20.8 vs. 10.5% over 10 years, logrank test, p = 0.002). This difference was notable in patients infected with genotype 1 and those treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Among nonSVRs, interferon had a limited effect in suppressing alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) levels in nonTT patients. The suppression of these values after interferon therapy was associated with a lower incidence of HCC. FPR were similar in TT and nonTT patients.Conclusions:rs8099917 nonTT is related to higher HCC development in patients with HCV genotype 1 and those treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Higher HCC incidence observed in nonTT patients partly results from the limited suppression of ALT and/or AFP by interferon in these patients.
