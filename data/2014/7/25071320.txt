Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects 130-210 million people worldwide and is one of the major risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma. Globally, at least one third of hepatocellular carcinoma cases are attributed to HCV infection, and 350000 people died from HCV related diseases per year. There is a great geographical variation of HCV infection globally, with risk factors for the HCV infection differing in various countries. The progression of chronic hepatitis C to end-stage liver disease also varies in different study populations. A long-term follow-up cohort enrolling participants with asymptomatic HCV infection is essential for elucidating the natural history of HCV-caused hepatocellular carcinoma, and for exploring potential seromarkers that have high predictability for risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, prospective cohorts comprising individuals with HCV infection are still uncommon. The risk evaluation of viral load elevation and associated liver disease/cancer in HCV (REVEAL-HCV) study has followed a cohort of 1095 residents seropositive for antibodies against hepatitis C virus living in seven townships in Taiwan for more than fifteen years. Most of them have acquired HCV infection through iatrogenic transmission routes. As the participants in the REVEAL-HCV study rarely receive antiviral therapies, it provides a unique opportunity to study the natural history of chronic HCV infection. In this review, the prevalence, risk factors and natural history of HCV infection are comprehensively reviewed. The study cohort, data collection, and findings on liver disease progression of the REVEAL-HCV study are described.
