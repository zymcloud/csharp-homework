Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several common susceptibility loci associated with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or chronic hepatitis B infection (CHB). However, the relationship between these genetic variants and survival of patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC is still unknown. In this study, 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped among 330 HBV-related HCC patients using the MassARRAY system from Sequenom. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine the effects of genotype on survival time under an additive model with age, sex, smoking status and clinical stage as covariates. We identified four SNPs on 6p21 (rs1419881 T>C, rs7453920 G>A,rs3997872 G>A and rs7768538 T>C), and two SNPs on 8p12 (rs2275959 C>T and rs7821974 C>T) significantly associated with survival time of HBV-related HCC patients. Our results suggest that HCC or CHB susceptibility loci might also affect the prognosis of patients with HBV-related HCC.
