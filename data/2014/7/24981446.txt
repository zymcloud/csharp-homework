Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The incidence continues to rise and only a detailed surveillance of patients with chronic liver disease can allow an early assessment. Diagnosis is made by imaging techniques, such as contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and also histopathological examination of biopsy material. The determination of the tumor marker alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is no longer established for early detection but can be used as a supplement in addition in HCC history progressio.
