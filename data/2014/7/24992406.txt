Introduction:Incidental gallbladder cancer is found in 0.6-2.1% of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. Patients with Tis or T1a tumours generally undergo no further intervention. However, spilled stones during surgery may have catastrophic consequences. We present a case and suggest aggressive management in patients with incidental gallbladder cancer who had spilled gallstones at surgery.Case history:A 37-year-old woman underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones, during which some stones were spilled into the peritoneal cavity. Subsequent histological examination confirmed incidental pT1a gallbladder cancer. Hepatopancreatobiliary multidisciplinary team discussion agreed on regular six-monthly follow-up. The patient developed recurrent pain two years after surgery. Computed tomography revealed a lesion in segment 6 of the liver. At laparotomy, multiple tumour embedded gallstones were found on the diaphragm. Histological examination showed features (akin to the original pathology) consistent with a metastatic gallbladder tumour.Conclusions:This case highlights the potential for recurrence of early stage disease resulting from implantation of dysplastic or malignant cells carried through spilled gallstones. It is therefore important to know if stones were spilled during original surgery in patients with incidental gallbladder cancer following a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Aggressive and early surgical management should be considered for these patients.
