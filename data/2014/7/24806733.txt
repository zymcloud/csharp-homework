Bone metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) seem to be increasing. Previous studies showed that soluble factors secreted by host cells and direct cell-to-cell interactions contributed to the preferential metastasis and growth of cancer cells in bone, while the underlying mechanism(s) of the metastasis of HCC in the bone are poorly understood. Here, we determined the effect of HS-5 cells on Huh7 cell proliferation, and investigated the role of CCL5 from HS-5 cells on the development of Huh7 cells. In addition, the underlying mechanisms on the influence in Huh7 cells were investigated. Our results showed that HS-5 cells could promote the proliferation, migration and invasion of Huh7 cells, and inhibited apoptosis. CCL5 downregulation was able to inhibit the effects of HS-5 cells on Huh7 cell migration and invasion via the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and reduce MMP-2 expression. Therefore, these findings suggest that CCL5 secreted from MSCs can promote the migration and invasion of Huh7 cells and could be an important factor in HCC related to occurrence of bone metastases.
