Purpose:To assess the usefulness of intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) for predicting lipiodol uptake in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).Materials and methods:The institutional review board approved this study. 44 HCC patients underwent IVIM-DWI and Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI prior to TACE. Using post-TACE CT as a reference standard, each HCC was classified into either lipiodol good uptake (LGU) or poor uptake (LPU) group. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), true diffusion coefficient (D), perfusion coefficient (D*), and perfusion fraction (f) in HCC were calculated. Arterial enhancement ratio (AER) and IVIM parameters were compared between those two groups using the Mann-Whitney U test.Results:Of the 51 HCCs, 37 (72.5%) were LGU group and 14 (27.5%) were LPU group. AER of HCC was significantly higher in LGU than LPU (0.99±0.54 and 0.67±0.45; P=.034). ADC, D, and f values were not significantly different (P=.073, .059, and .196, respectively) between these two groups. D* was significantly elevated in LGU than LPU (48.10±15.33 and 26.75±9.55; P=.001).Conclusion:Both AER derived from contrast enhanced MRI and D* values derived from IVIM-DWI for HCC were significantly higher in LGU than in LPU. These parameters would be helpful for predicting the lipiodol uptake.
