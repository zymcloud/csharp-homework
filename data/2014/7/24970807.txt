The human sulfatase 1 (hSulf-1) gene encodes an endosulfatase that functions to inhibit the heparin-binding growth factor signaling, including the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-mediated pathway, by desulfating the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). bFGF could stimulate cell cycle progression and inhibit cell apoptosis, this biological effect can be reversed by hSulf-1. However, molecular mechanisms have not been fully reported. In the current study, by reactivation of hSulf-1 expression and function in the hSulf-1-negative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and HCC xenograft tumors, we found that hSulf-1 blocked the bFGF effect on the promotion of cell cycle and inhibition of apoptosis. The bFGF-stimulated activation of protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways was suppressed by hSulf-1, which led to a decreased expression of the target genes Cyclin D1 and Survivin, then finally induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HCC cells. Our data suggested that hSulf-1 may be a suitable target for cancer therapy.
