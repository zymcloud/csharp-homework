Pim-3 is a member of the provirus integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (Pim) family proteins that exhibit serine/threonine kinase activity. Similar to the other Pim kinases (Pim-1 and Pim-2), Pim-3 is involved in many cellular processes, including cell proliferation, survival, and protein synthesis. Although Pim-3 is expressed in normal vital organs, it is overexpressed particularly in tumor tissues of endoderm-derived organs, including the liver, pancreas, and colon. Silencing of Pim-3 expression can retard in vitro cell proliferation of hepatocellular, pancreatic, and colon carcinoma cell lines by promoting cell apoptosis. Pim-3 lacks the regulatory domains similarly as Pim-1 and Pim-2 lack, and therefore, Pim-3 can exhibit its kinase activity once it is expressed. Pim-3 expression is regulated at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by transcription factors (e.g., Ets-1) and post-translational modifiers (e.g., translationally-controlled tumor protein), respectively. Pim-3 could promote growth and angiogenesis of human pancreatic cancer cells in vivo in an orthotopic nude mouse model. Furthermore, a Pim-3 kinase inhibitor inhibited cell proliferation when human pancreatic cancer cells were injected into nude mice, without inducing any major adverse effects. Thus, Pim-3 kinase may serve as a novel molecular target for developing targeting drugs against pancreatic and other types of cancer.
