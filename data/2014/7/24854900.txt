Purpose:The purpose of this study was to elucidate the incidence and risk factors for the progression of hyperintense nodules, observed in the hepatobiliary phase of gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI), to hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Hypovascular nodules (n = 157) showing hyperintensity in the hepatobiliary phase of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI were examined in 41 patients. All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) during hepatic arteriography and CT during arterial portography within one month of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. The incidence of progression to hypervascular or classical HCC was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:Tumor size was determined by univariate and multivariate analysis to be an important risk factor of hypervascularization (p = 0.041, odds ratio 1.135). The cumulative incidences of hypervascularization in hypovascular nodules showing hyperintensity on the hepatobiliary phase of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI were 2.4, 4.5, and 6.2 % at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. The incidence of hypervascularization was significantly increased in nodules >10 mm in diameter (p = 0.00035).Conclusion:In patients with chronic liver disease, hypovascular nodules presenting as hyperintense in the hepatobiliary phase of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and >10 mm in diameter have malignant potential for progression to hypervascular HCC and require careful management.
