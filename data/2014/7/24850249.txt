Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is considered as the standard therapy for patients with intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. However, given the high heterogeneity of this population, no common strategy or protocol standardization has been defined yet. In the last few years TACE treatment has been combined with sorafenib systemic therapy, reporting overall positive results both in terms of safety and efficacy. This systematic review presents and critically discusses the evidence available on the use of TACE in combination (concomitant or sequential) with sorafenib, focusing also on clinical trials currently ongoing to better define an optimal therapeutic strategy for this group of patients.
