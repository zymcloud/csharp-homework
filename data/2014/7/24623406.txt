To identify key microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using small RNA-seq data. Small RNA-seq data for two HCC samples and two normal samples were downloaded from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. MiRNAs were identified through database search. Differentially expressed miRNAs were screened out with t test and their target genes were retrieved. Functional enrichment analysis was performed to uncover their biological functions. Regulatory networks and core metabolic networks were also constructed to present the global patterns. In addition, new miRNAs and their target genes were predicted. A total of 59 differentially expressed miRNAs were obtained, 12 up-regulated and 47 down-regulated. A total of 3,306 target genes were retrieved for eight miRNAs. Pathway enrichment analysis for the target genes showed that "pathways in cancer" and "MAPK signaling pathway" were significantly over-represented. Functional enrichment analysis found that "biological regulation" and "macromolecule modification" were significantly related to the target genes. Two regulatory networks were constructed for up- and down-regulated differentially expressed miRNAs with information from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis database. Two metabolic networks were also established based upon "pathways in cancer" and "MAPK signaling pathway", consisting of miRNAs, target genes, compounds and others genes. Moreover, a number of new miRNAs and relevant target genes were predicted. Our study discloses a number of miRNAs as well as genes which may be involved in the development of HCC and these findings are beneficial in guiding future researches.
