Aim:To assess the expression of nuclear hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) in benign and malignant gallbladder lesions and to determine its clinicopathological significance.Methods:We studied 40 patients with gallbladder cancer (GBC) and a control group of 40 patients with cholelithiasis. All diagnoses of GBC and cholelithiasis were confirmed by histopathological examination after surgery. None of the patients received chemotherapy or radiotherapy before surgery. All tissue samples were fixed in 4% formalin immediately after removal and embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemical staining. The HDGF expression in the GBC and cholelithiasis specimens was examined by immunohistochemical staining. The relationship between the HDGF expression and the clinicopathological parameters of GBC was analyzed.Results:Nuclear HDGF expression was significantly higher (77.5%) in GBC than in chronic cholelithiasis (21.5%, P < 0.001). High nuclear HDGF levels were associated with histopathological subtype (P < 0.05), clinical stage (P < 0.01), and perineural invasion (P < 0.01) but not with sex, age, history of gallstones, or lymph node metastasis. A univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that positive nuclear HDGF expression was associated with decreased overall survival (P < 0.01). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that nuclear HDGF expression and lymph node metastasis were independent risk factors for disease-free survival.Conclusion:The expression of nuclear HDGF might be closely related to the carcinogenesis, clinical biological behaviors, and prognosis of gallbladder adenocarcinoma.
