Background:The risk of tumor progression during neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in esophageal cancer (EC) is around 8% to 17%. We assessed the efficacy of computed tomography (CT) to identify these patients before esophagectomy.Methods:Ninety-seven patients with locally advanced EC treated with Carboplatin/Paclitaxel and 41.4 Gy neoadjuvantly were restaged with CT. Two radiologists reviewed pre- and post-CRT CT images. The primary outcome was detection of clinically relevant progressive disease. Missed metastases were defined as metastatic disease found during surgery or within 3 months after post-CRT CT.Results:Progressive disease was detected in 9 patients (9%). Both radiologists detected 5 patients with distant metastases (liver, n = 4; lung metastasis, n = 1), but missed progressive disease in 4 cases. One radiologist falsely assessed 2 metastatic lesions, but after agreement progressive disease was detected with sensitivity and specificity of 56% and 100%, respectively.Conclusion:CT is effective in detecting clinically relevant progressive disease in EC patients, after neoadjuvant treatment.
