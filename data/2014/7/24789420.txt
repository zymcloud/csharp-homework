The aim of the present study was to identify miRNAs that were differentially expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by comparing normal and cancer tissue samples and to analyze the correlation of the target genes and HCC. The gene expression profile of GSE31383 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, including 19 samples, 9 normal and 10 from HCC tissue samples. The differentially‑expressed miRNAs were identified with packages in R language and further analyzed using bioinformatics methods. Firstly, the verified targets of miRNAs were integrated in two miRNA databases: miRecords and miRTarBase, and the targets of the differentially‑expressed miRNAs were obtained. The software STRING was then used to construct the interaction network of target genes. Finally, a functional enrichment analysis of the genes in the interaction network was conducted using the software Gestalt. Typical miR‑224 and miR‑214 were identified by comparing normal and cancer samples, each of which obtained 14 and 8 target genes, respectively. The functional enrichment analysis of the targets in the two groups highlighted the intracellular signaling cascade. In conclusion, the featured miRNAs (the upregulated miRNA‑224 and downregulated miRNA‑214) and their target genes are significant in the occurrence and development of HCC, which is likely to be significant for the identification of therapeutic targets and biomarkers to aid in the treatment of HCC.
