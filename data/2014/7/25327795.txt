Objective:To analyze the clinicopathologic characteristics of well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (WD-HCC), and to find clues for its pathologic diagnosis and differential diagnosis.Methods:Seventy-three cases of WD-HCC were studied with clinical data analysis, gross and microscopic examination.Results:Among the 73 cases, the prevalence of HBV (+) and/or HCV (+) was 94.5% (69/73), liver cirrhosis was 80.8% (59/73), increased hepatic cell density was 95.9% (70/73), dilated and irregular hepatic sinus was 89.0% (65/73), prominent trabecularism was 89.0% (65/73), increased cytoplasmic eosinophilia or basophilia was 90.4% (66/73), glandular-like structure was 16.4% (12/73, and fatty degeneration was 42.4% (31/73) .Conclusions:There are important clinicopathologic features associated with WD-HCC. These features are useful in the differential diagnosis of WD-HCC with dysplastic nodule (DN), focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and hepatocellular adenoma.
