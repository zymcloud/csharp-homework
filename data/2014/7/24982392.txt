Aim/background:Few data are available about the prevalence of hepatitis B and C infections in early breast cancer patients and its impact on systemic treatments. The objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of positive serology for hepatitis B and C in women with early breast cancer and to assess the clinical course and its impact on liver function during adjuvant treatments.Patients and methods:we retrospectively reviewed hepatitis B and C serology [HBs antigen (HBsAg), HBc antibodies (HBcAb), HBs antibodies (HBsAb) and HC (HCV) antibodies] in 746 consecutive patients with early breast cancer treated at our Institution between 2009 and 2011.Results:Among 375 evaluable patients, we identified 312 controls (83.2%) and 63 patients (16.8%) with positive serology (cases): 15 patients (4%) with HCV, 8 (2.1%) with resolved HBV without anti-HBs (HBsAg-negative, HBsAgAb-negative, HBcAgAb-positive), 36 (9.6%) with resolved HBV with anti-HBs (HBsAg-negative, HBsAgAb-positive, HBcAgAb-positive) and 4 (1%) with chronic HBV (HBsAg-positive, HBsAgAb-negative, HBcAgAb-positive). During systemic treatments, hepatitis (defined as at least a three-fold increase in serum alanine aminotransferase level) occurred in nine (20.4%) out of 44 evaluable cases and in 14 (5.9%) out of 234 evaluable controls.Conclusion:Approximately 20% of patients with early breast cancer with positive serology for viral hepatitis may develop hepatitis during systemic treatment. Pre-treatment serum detection of viral hepatitis B and C antigens and antibodies may be useful in the adjuvant therapy decision-making process and for adequate monitoring of liver function during antineoplastic therapy.
