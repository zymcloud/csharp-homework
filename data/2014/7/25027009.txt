Endothelial cells (ECs) are critical for angiogenesis, and microRNA plays important roles in this process. In this study, we investigated the function and mechanism of miR-302c in the process of endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) in ECs. When miR-302c was overexpressed in HUVECs, the motility of the HUVECs was weakened; the expression levels of EndMT markers were also changed: vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin was up-regulated, whereas β-catenin, FSP1, and α-SMA were down-regulated. Further in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that the growth of HCC was inhibited when co-cultured or co-injected with HUVECs overexpressing miR-302c. On the contrary, when miR-302c was suppressed in HUVECs, the opposite results were observed. Reporter assays showed that miR-302c inhibited metadherin (MTDH) expression through directly binding to its 3'UTR. In addition, compared to ECs isolated from normal liver tissues of HCC patients, ECs isolated from tumor tissues expressed markedly low levels of miR-302c but high levels of MTDH. These results suggest that EC-specific miR-302c suppresses tumor growth in HCC through MTDH-mediated inhibition of EndMT. MTDH and miR-302c might provide a new strategy for anti-angiogenic therapy in HCC.
