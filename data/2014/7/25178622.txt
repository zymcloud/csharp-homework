Cirrhosis is characterized by diffuse hepatic fibrosis and nodule formation which can occur at any age with significant morbidity and is an important cause of premature death. Occlusive portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is common complication of chronic liver disease with prevalence ranging from 1% to 16% of population. The occurrence of portal vein thrombosis is influenced by local factors (cirrhosis with associated liver architectural changes and increased resistance effects), systemic factors (inherited and acquired abnormalities leading to hyper coagulability) and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The majority of patients with cirrhosis PVT are diagnosed on radiographic studies although in some patients PVT may present with decompensated chronic liver disease but the natural history of PVT in patients with cirrhosis is largely unknown. However patients with cirrhosis and PVT have been shown to have inferior survival in comparison with patients without PVT.
