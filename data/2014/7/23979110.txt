Purpose:We investigated the predictive indicator for a good prognosis of surgical resection for liver metastasis of colorectal cancer.Method:Between 1990 and 2009 at our institute, 117 patients underwent 132 hepatic resections for liver metastasis of colorectal cancer. The clinical, pathological, and outcome parameters affecting their prognoses were analyzed. The extent of the liver metastases was subdivided according to the Japanese Classification of Colorectal Carcinoma (JCCRC), and the patients were classified into different grades based on the JCCRC classification and the status of the nodal involvement of the primary tumor.Result:The median survival time (MST) of the 117 patients was 58 months, and the actuarial survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 92.3, 60.0, and 46.1 %, respectively. A multivariate analysis revealed that the JCCRC Grade classification was an independent prognostic indicator (Grade A vs. B vs. C: MST, 72 vs. 41 vs. 23 months; 5-year survival, 59.0 vs. 38.6 vs. 0 %: p < 0.0001).Conclusion:Our findings indicate that the JCCRC Grade classification for liver metastasis of colorectal cancer is a significant prognostic indicator and may be useful for making decisions regarding the treatment of liver metastasis.
