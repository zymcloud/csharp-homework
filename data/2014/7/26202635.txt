Circulating tumor cells (CTC) and cancer stem cells (CSC) have been proposed as tools for detection and characterization of disease and individualization of therapy in patients with many solid tumors. Several automated and semi-automated techniques for identification and isolation of these cells from blood have been proposed and reviewed mostly focusing on their feasibility. In this mini review we summarize the recent relevant literature on this topic and discuss the clinical usability of measuring CTC and CSC in peripheral blood in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Besides literature, the basis for this evaluation was the authors' experience with treating HCC and research experience on CSC and CTC. Few original reports and reviews have been published focusing on CTC and CSC in HCC. Though HCC is one of the five most common malignancies worldwide only recently these cells have come into focus for detection and characterization of this disease that is characterized by high plasticity and malignancy. A focused and prospective validation of the clinical usability of detecting these cells in HCC is still needed, but results seem promising that they may add great benefit for early detection and individualization of therapy.
