Objective:To observe the antitumor effect of Stihopus japonicus acidic mucopolysaccharide combined with fluorouracil in mice bearing neoplasia of H22 hepatoma cells, and study the mechanism.Methods:Inoculate the H22 liver cancer cells in the right forelimbs axillary region subcutaneous of 50 Kunming mice, and then randomly divide the mice into 5 groups, including negative control group, 5-FU group, SJAMP group and two combined groups. Tumor histopathological changes were examined by HE. The expressions of PCNA protein level, P53, P21, Cyclin D1 and CDK4 protein and mRNA levels in the H22 tumor tissues were detected by immunohistochemical and Real-time PCR methods.Results:Compared with negative control group, the weights of the H22 tumor tissues in other groups are decreased statistically significant (P Conclusion:SJAMP and 5-FU can via decrease the expressions of PCNA protein, P53, Cyclin D1 and CDK4 proteins and mRNAs, increase the expressions of P21 proteins and mRNAs, to inhibit the growth of H22 tumor in mice. And the combination of SJAMP and 5-FU shows synergistic effect which can strengthen the ability of antitumor obviously.
