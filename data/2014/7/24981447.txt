Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent malignancies worldwide. Besides liver transplantation, which is only feasible in few patients and surgical resection, the scope of potential treatment options has considerably expanded in recent years. Thermoablative therapies are now well established in early HCC due to the low rate of complications and short hospital stay. The disadvantage of higher relapse rates compared to surgical resection will be further diminished through technical advances regarding radiofrequency ablation and microwave ablation, as well as growing experience of users and thorough multidisciplinary selection of potential candidates for thermoablative therapy.
