Aim:The impact of viral status on recurrence of hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative therapy remains controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to determine whether the presence of viral load, genotype, specific mutation and antiviral therapy influenced HCC recurrence after curative therapy.Methods:We performed a meta-analysis including 20 studies to assess the effect of viral status and antiviral therapy with nucleoside analog on recurrence of HCC after curative therapy. The pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated using a random or fixed effects model. PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Database were searched for articles published from 1990 to December 2012.Results:Our results showed that the presence of high viral load significantly increased overall HCC recurrence risk after curative therapy. Pooled data from four studies on the recurrence rate among patients with genotype C infection compared with genotype B showed an increased risk of recurrence. Basal core promoter (BCP) mutation was associated with a significant risk in the recurrence of HCC. The pooled estimate of treatment effect was significantly in favor of a preventive effectiveness of antiviral therapy.Conclusion:The present study suggested that HCC patients with high viral load, genotype C and BCP mutation had a significantly higher risk of recurrence. Antiviral therapy has potential beneficial effects after the curative treatment of HCC in terms of tumor recurrence.
