Background:Karyopherin alpha 2 (KPNA2) promotes tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to determine the content and clinical significance of mechanism underlying.Methods:The association of transcriptional factor pleomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) with KPNA2 was explored by co-immunoprecipitation. In vitro gain- and loss-of-function models were established to explore the functional interaction. Clinical samples from 314 HCC patients were applied to explore the clinical significance.Results:We found that PLAG1 could associate with KPNA2 and be promoted into nucleus by KPNA2. The increment of proliferative and metastatic abilities by KPNA2 over-expression can be significantly retarded by PLAG1 inhibition. The co-enrichment of KPNA2 and PLAG1 in nucleus is observed in clinical samples and can distinguish patients with the worst prognosis. The positive PLAG1 expression is an independent risk factor of recurrence free survival (HR: 1.766, 1.315-2.371; P = 0.000) and overall survival (HR: 1.589, 1.138-2.220; P = 0.007). Especially for patients with positive KPNA2 staining (N = 152), the positive PLAG1 expression is the sole risk factor for both recurrence free survival (HR: 1.749, 1.146-2.670; P = 0.010) and overall survival (HR: 1.662, 1.007-2.744; P = 0.047).Conclusions:The nuclear import of PLAG1 by KPNA2 is essential for the role of KPNA2 in HCC cells and is significant to predict poor survival of HCC patients after hepatectomy.
