The aim of this study was to investigate the expression rates of CD133 and CD90 in cirrhosis-dysplastic nodule-HCC (Crh-DN-HCC) sequence related to the etiologic background. Thirty-five HCC, 8 small cell dysplasia (SCD), and 63 cases of cirrhosis having different etiologies were collected. Immunohistochemical expressions of CD133 and CD90 were evaluated. CD133 positivity was higher in HCC cases with chronic hepatitis B and CD90 with chronic hepatitis C. The highest staining rate was seen in poorly differentiated HCC cases. Only one SCD case and almost half of the cirrhotic cases which were stained for CD133 were associated with hepatitis B; none was stained for CD90. Increased CD133 expression indicated a significantly shorter overall survival rate. No significant relationship was detected between the expression rates of CD133 or CD90 and other parameters. In this study, which investigates the immunohistochemical expression profiles of CD133 and CD90 through Crh-DN-HCC sequence, the highest staining rate was detected in HCC. It is rational to try to elucidate the earliest events in hepatocarcinogenesis by studying SCD. It is important to be aware of this issue in daily practice, which will provide a deeper insight into the understanding of the effects of CSCs in the progression and management of HCC.
