Background:An estimated one million people worldwide die each year from complications of chronic hepatitis B infection (CHB), including liver cancer. A disproportionate number of infections and deaths occur in China. The incidence and mortality of liver cancer in Haimen City is among the highest in China, and in the world. A multi-year citywide campaign was aimed at eliminating hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and significantly reducing the number of liver cancer deaths due to CHB in Haimen City, China.Methods:Strategies included a public health information campaign targeting the 1.03 million city residents; specialized health education for leaders and providers to increase adoption of evidence-based HBV management protocols; establishment of health care infrastructure and management systems; and increased prevention and care delivery to key subpopulations (especially pregnant women).Results:The project developed and deployed broad-reaching public awareness and health education tools and modules to 280,000 households and at community-based events. More than 90% of targeted healthcare providers and 80% of the community leaders/government officials attended educational seminars during the project period (1,441 health care providers; 1,883 local government officials). A centralized registration and management system for pregnant women was developed and instituted, 100% of pregnant women were enrolled (5,407 women over one year), and all infants born to HBV-infected mothers received one dose of HBIG and the first dose of HBV vaccine by 24 hours of birth.Conclusions:Lessons from the implementation phase of the project include the importance of: gaining early and ongoing support from the local government and health bureau for success in reaching the targeted populations; and having project management by a local, experienced, and trusted health expert to navigate implementation and relationships, and help develop culturally and linguistically appropriate materials.
