Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an effective, minimally invasive treatment option for unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) located in high-risk areas or for patients with poor hepatic functional reserve. However, for tumors adjacent to major bile ducts and hepatic blood vessels, complete ablation is difficult to achieve for fear of causing a postoperative bile leak, bilioma or bile duct stenosis. Therefore, RFA is often combined with multiple alcohol injections to eliminate residual tumor tissues in adjacent bile duct or blood vessels; however, the injections directly affect the efficacy and prognosis of RFA. This study reports three successful "one-off" cases of complete ablation of HCCs adjacent to major bile ducts and blood vessels in neighboring hepatic segments or hepatic lobes, highlighting both the efficacy and safety of RFA for HCC tumors in these high-risk locations.
