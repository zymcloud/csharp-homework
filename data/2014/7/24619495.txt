Background:Recent studies have shown that high hepatitis B virus (HBV) load is associated with increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The aim of our study was to investigate the predictive role of HBV DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels in early and late recurrence of HCC after curative resection in patients with HBV-related HCC.Methods:From January 2008 to December 2010, a total of 248 patients underwent curative resection for HBV-related early-stage HCC (solitary tumor; Results:The median follow-up duration was 33.3 months. Cumulative recurrence rates after resection at 1, 3, and 5 years were 16.6, 34.0, and 46.7 %, respectively. The multivariate analysis showed that risk factors for early recurrence were the presence of microvascular invasion (hazard ratio [HR] 3.86; p Conclusion:The HBV DNA levels were associated with early recurrence, whereas HBsAg levels were associated with late recurrence after curative resection in HBV-related HCC.
