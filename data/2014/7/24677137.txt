Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a hypervascular tumor characterized by neovascularization. The objective of the current study was to determine circulating proangiogenic [vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-Î±)] and antiangiogenic [IL-4, IL-12, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), and angiostatin] factors in Egyptian patients with different stages of HCC. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the concentrations of these mediators in plasma of 135 HCC patients (57 Child-Pugh A, 24 Child-Pugh B, and 54 Child-Pugh C stage) and 50 healthy subjects. Results showed a significant increase in plasma levels of VEGF (P
