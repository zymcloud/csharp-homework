Background & aims:High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation is a non-invasive treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), but long-term survival analysis is lacking. This study was to analyse its outcome compared to that of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:From October 2003 to September 2010, 113 patients received HIFU ablation as a treatment of HCCs at our hospital. Twenty-six patients had HCCs sized 3-8 cm. Fifty-two patients with matched tumour characteristics having TACE as primary treatment were selected for comparison. Short-term outcome and long-term survival were analysed.Results:In the HIFU group (n = 26), 46 tumours were ablated. The median age of the patients was 69 (49-84) years. The median tumour size was 4.2 (3-8) cm. In the TACE group (n = 52), the median age of the patients was 67 (44-84) years. The median tumour size was 4.8 (3-8) cm. There was no hospital mortality in any of the groups. In the HIFU group, the rates of complete tumour response, partial tumour response, stable disease and progressive disease were 50%, 7.7%, 25.6% and 7.7% respectively, according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours. The TACE group had the corresponding rates at 0%, 21.2%, 63.5% and 15.4% respectively (P Conclusion:HIFU ablation is a safe and effective method for unresectable HCCs. A survival benefit is observed over sole TACE.
