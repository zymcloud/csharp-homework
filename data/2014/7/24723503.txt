Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in liver transplantation (LT) recipients who progress to cirrhosis has received little attention. We investigated the adequacy of empirical treatment with third-generation cephalosporins for SBP in this population and the impact of transplantation on the evolution of the infection. We performed a cohort study with 138 SBP episodes: 19 in LT patients and 119 in non-LT patients. The etiology of SBP was identified for 73.7% of the episodes in LT patients and for 38.7% of the episodes in non-LT patients (P = 0.004). The main microorganisms in recipients were Escherichia coli (35.7%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (21.4%). The etiologies did not differ in non-LT patients. The cephalosporin sensitivity was similar in the 2 groups (85.7% versus 78.4%, P = 0.7). LT recipients developed renal failure (57.9% versus 25.2%, P = 0.004) and encephalopathy (42.1% versus 22%, P = 0.08) more often than non-LT patients, and the mortality rates during episodes (52.6% versus 13.4%, P 18 odds ratio (OR) = 6.1 and being an LT recipient (OR = 4.45). At 6 months, the risk factors for mortality were a MELD score > 18 (OR = 3.08), being an LT recipient (OR = 3.47), a known etiology (OR = 2.08), and the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma (OR = 3.73).
