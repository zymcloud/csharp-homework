Objective:Epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG) claims a plethora of health benefits including protection against neoplastic diseases. Meanwhile, heparan-sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) have defensive role against tumour cell invasion. Therefore, the chemopreventive and hepatoprotective effects of EGCG were studied in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vivo and in vitro and compared with strong water soluble antioxidant, sodium ascorbate.Methods:HCC was induced in SD rats by thioacetamide (200 mg/Kg). Some rats were treated with EGCG (20 mg/Kg) or sodium ascorbate (100 mg/Kg). Liver impairment was assessed by measuring serum α-fetoprotein and investigating liver sections stained with H/E. Hepatic HSPGs, syndecan-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) were measured by ELISA. Gene expression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 was measured. Cell death was assessed by caspase-3 activity. In addition, all markers were measured in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2).Key findings:EGCG increased the animal survival and decreased both α-fetoprotein and HepG2 viability. In addition, EGCG ameliorated fibrosis and massive hepatic tissue breakdown. EGCG restored HSPGs and reduced expression of MMP-9, syndecan-1 and FGF-2 in-vivo and in-vitro. Sodium ascorbate showed significantly lower results than EGCG.Conclusions:Besides antioxidant activity, other mechanisms are involved in the chemopreventive and hepatoprotective effects of EGCG including restoration of HSPGs receptors and inhibition of vascular invasion.
