Background:Entecavir (ETV) is one of the first-line nucleoside analogs for treating patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk for ETV-treated patients remains unclear.Methods:A total of 496 Japanese patients with chronic HBV infection undergoing ETV treatment were enrolled in this study. The baseline characteristics were as follows: age 52.6 ± 12.0 years, males 58%, positive for hepatitis B e antigen 45 %, cirrhosis 19%, and median HBV DNA level 6.9 log copies (LC) per milliliter. The mean treatment duration was 49.9 ± 17.5 months.Results:The proportions of HBV DNA negativity (below 2.6 LC/mL) were 68% at 24 weeks and 86% at 1 year, and the rates of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level normalization were 62 and 72%, respectively. The mean serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels decreased significantly at 24 weeks after ETV treatment initiation (from 29.0 ± 137.1 to 5.7 ± 27.9 ng/mL, p Conclusions:The AFP level at 24 weeks after ETV treatment initiation can be the on-treatment predictive factor for HCC incidence among patients with chronic HBV infection.
