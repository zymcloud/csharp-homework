Background:The incidence of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is increasing, and we sought to characterize the differences and trends in HCC over 2 decades in Hawaii.Methods:This retrospective study of 821 HCC cases analyzed risk factors, diabetes, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), tumor characteristics, and treatment, comparing 5-year eras (1993 to 2012).Results:With succeeding eras, there were fewer Asians, immigrants, and hepatitis B-related HCC. Hepatitis C, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and body mass index have increased. Over time, more patients had normal AFP, and normal AFP was seen more often in nonviral HCC (49.6% vs 33.2%, P = .007). Over time, the proportion of patients who underwent resection or transplant was stable, but fewer patients underwent no therapy.Conclusions:Characteristics of HCC are changing, and diagnosis may be more difficult as metabolic factors are becoming more important than viral factors. AFP seems to be a less important biomarker, and clearly, better diagnostic tools will be necessary to identify HCC in the future.
