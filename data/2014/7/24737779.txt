Background:It has not yet been determined whether hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) chemotherapy improves survival in patients with early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We evaluated the effectiveness of HAI with high-concentration cisplatin (DDP-H) for the treatment of HCC by comparing outcomes between patients who received HAI with DDP-H before radical local treatment of early-stage HCC [Japan Integrated Staging (JIS) score 0/1] and patients who did not receive HAI chemotherapy.Patients and methods:Survival was analyzed in 114 patients with early-stage HCC who underwent radical local treatment. The patients were divided into two groups: a HAI group (n = 79) who received DDP-H infusion into the whole liver via the proper hepatic artery, and a non-HAI group (n = 35) who did not receive HAI chemotherapy.Results:The cumulative survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 77.4%, 69.2%, and 55.3% in the non-HAI group and 97.4%, 87.0%, and 84.4% in the HAI group, respectively. Survival time prolonged significantly in the HAI group compared with the non-HAI group (log-rank test: P = 0.023; generalized Wilcoxon test: P = 0.012) Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model identified HAI with DDP-H as the most important factor affecting survival.Conclusions:Whole-liver HAI with DDP-H before radical local treatment can improve the prognosis of patients with early-stage HCC.
