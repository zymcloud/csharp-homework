Background:Recurrence following complete resection of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) still remains common. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic factors in patients with recurrence after complete resection of esophageal SCC.Methods:The medical records of 190 patients with recurrent disease after complete resection of esophageal SCC were retrospectively reviewed. Recurrence pattern was classified as loco-regional recurrence and distant metastases. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for the survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analysis.Results:Mediastinal nodal clearance area was the most common sites of loco-regional recurrence, whereas lung, liver and bone were the most common sites for distant metastases. The median survival after recurrence was 8 months. The 1, 3, 5-year post-recurrence survival rates were 45.9%, 10.6% and 6.4%, respectively. The overall 1, 3, 5-year survival rates were 76.6%, 27.3% and 12.3%, respectively. The independent prognostic factors included time of recurrence (â‰¥12 months vs. <12 months, HR: 3.228, 95% CI: 2.233-4.668), pattern of recurrence (local-regional recurrence vs. distant metastases, HR: 1.690, 95% CI: 1.170-2.439), and treatment of recurrence [no treatment vs. treatment (radiotherapy or surgery or chemotherapy), HR: 0.642, 95% CI: 0.458-0.899].Conclusions:Our retrospective study showed that time of recurrence, pattern of recurrence and treatment of recurrence were independent prognostic factors in patients with recurrence after complete resection of esophageal SCC.
