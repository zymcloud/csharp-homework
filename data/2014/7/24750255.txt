Two recent genome-wide studies showed that the single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the HLA-DQ region (rs2856718 and rs9275572) were associated with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and chronic hepatitis C virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma in Japanese patients. We tested the effects of the two single-nucleotide polymorphisms for all major HBV outcomes and lamivudine treatment in Han Chinese. A total of 1649 samples were enrolled, and peripheral blood samples were collected in this study. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the HLA-DQ region were genotyped using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. Our study demonstrated the clear relevance of HLA-DQ rs2856718 and rs9275572 with HBV susceptibility, natural clearance and HBV-associated HCC. HLA-DQ rs2856718G and rs9275572A were strongly associated with decreased risk of chronic HBV infection (odds ratio = 0.641; P = 2.64 × 10(-4) ; odds ratio = 0.627, P = 7.22 × 10(-5) ) and HBV natural clearance (odds ratio = 0.610; P = 4.80 × 10(-4) ; odds ratio = 0.714, P = 0.013). Moreover, rs9275572A was also associated with development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (odds ratio = 0.632, P = 0.008). In addition, we showed for the first time to our knowledge that rs9275572 was a predictor for lamivudine therapy (viral response: odds ratio = 2.599, P = 4.43 × 10(-4) ; biochemical response: odds ratio = 2.279, P = 4.23 × 10(-4) ). Our study suggested that HLA-DQ loci were associated with both HBV clearance and HBV-related diseases and outcomes of lamivudine treatment in Han Chinese.
