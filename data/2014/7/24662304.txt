The nonsense mutations of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface (S) gene have been reported to have oncogenic potential. We have previously identified several transforming nonsense mutations of the HBV S gene from hepatocarcinoma (HCC) patients. Among them, the sW182* mutant (the stop codon for tryptophan 182) showed the most potent oncogenicity in a mouse xenograft model using stably transfected mouse fibroblast cells. This study is aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms leading to the oncogenic activity of the sW182* mutant. A gene expression microarray in combination with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed differentially expressed gene sets in the sW182* cells, including those related to cell-cycle regulation, deoxyribonucleic acid repair, and genome instability. Of the differentially expressed genes, the transforming growth factor-Î²-induced (TGFBI) gene was further validated to be dysregulated in the sW182* cells. This dysregulation was accompanied by hypermethylation of the TGFBI promoter. The level of cyclin D1, a negatively regulated TGFBI target, was highly elevated in the sW182* mutant cells, which is consistent with the potent oncogenicity. Furthermore, frequent abnormal mitosis and multinucleation were observed in the mutant cells. Exogenous expression of TGFBI alleviated the oncogenic activity of the sW182* cells. In human HBV-related HCC cancerous tissue, expression of TGFBI was downregulated in 25 of the 55 (45%) patients examined, suggesting that TGFBI dysregulation could occur in HBV-related HCC development in some cases. These results suggest that dysregulation of TGFBI is involved in the oncogenic activity of the sW182* mutant of the hepatitis B virus S gene.
