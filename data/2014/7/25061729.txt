We investigate the potential association of miR-149C>T and miR-499A>G polymorphisms and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A matched case-control study of 152 cases and 304 controls were conducted. The miR-149C>T and miR-499A>G genotypes were analyzed using duplex polymerase chain reaction with restricted fragment length polymorphism. HCC patients were more likely to be smokers and drinkers, have hepatitis B and C virus infections, and a family history of cancer. The miR-149 CC genotype was associated with a reduced risk of HCC, while the miR-499 GG genotype was associated with an increased risk of HCC. However, we did not find that the miR-149 CC and miR-499 GG genotypes were associated with risk of HCC, and no interaction was found between miR-149C>T and miR-499A>G polymorphisms and hepatitis B virus infection. In conclusion, the miRNA-149C>T and miR-499A>G polymorphisms were found to play an important role for HCC risk in China. This finding could be useful in identifying people at high risk for the disease for early intervention.
