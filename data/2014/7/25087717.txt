Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most significant causes of death from cancer and is currently the main cause of death in patients with hepatic cirrhosis. Various scientific societies have compiled evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Homogeneous criteria are therefore available for establishing and predicting the prognosis and directing the most favorable treatment option for each evolutionary stage. In all of these aspects, patient assessment is based on conventional instruments: clinical assessment, laboratory tests and examinations using imaging techniques. For now, research into molecular profiles has not resulted in this information impacting the clinical decision. Numerous investigations have provided relevant information on the possible classification of tumors based on genetic abnormalities and on the possible identification of molecular targets. In the future, this type of data will be incorporated into conventional practice in a similar manner as has occurred with breast, lung, colorectal and melanoma.
