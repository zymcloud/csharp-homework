Right atrial and vena cava thrombus is a challenging clinical problem with limited treatment options for percutaneous extraction. We describe the use of a novel AngioVac venous extracorporeal bypass system (AngioDynamics) to remove a part of large right atrial tumor and thrombus in a patient with recurrent pulmonary embolism from hepatocellular carcinoma infiltrating into the inferior vena cava and the right atrium.
