Objective:Hepatic malignancy is a common and lethal disease, whether due to a primary tumor or metastasis. There are numerous treatment options available depending on the stage of the disease and medical condition of the patient, including systemic chemotherapy, transcatheter embolization, thermal ablation, and surgical resection. In a subset of patients with liver malignancy, surgical resection can offer the best chance of long-term survival and potentially even cure. This article reviews the major indications and contraindications for resection, basic surgical techniques and terminology, key clinical and imaging preoperative workup, and pertinent interventional oncology procedures in the management of hepatic malignancy.Conclusion:Diagnostic and interventional radiology plays an important role in the assessment and treatment of malignant hepatic lesions. Radiologists should be familiar with how surgeons select, work up, and treat candidates for liver resection to provide the most clinically valuable service.
