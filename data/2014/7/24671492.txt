The poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is mainly due to the development of invasion and metastasis. Recent data strongly suggests the important role of miRNAs in cancer progression, including invasion and metastasis. Here, we found miR-217 expression was much lower in highly invasive MHCC-97H HCC cells and metastatic HCC tissues. Restored miR-217 expression with miR-217 mimics inhibited invasion of MHCC-97H cells. Inversely, miR-217 inhibition enhanced the invasive ability of Huh7 and MHCC-97L cells. Mechanically, bioinformatics analysis combined with experimental analysis demonstrated E2F3 was a novel direct target of miR-217. Moreover, E2F3 protein level was positively associated with HCC metastasis and functional analysis confirmed the positive role of E2F3 in HCC cell invasion. Our findings suggest miR-217 function as a potential tumor suppressor in HCC progression and miR-217-E2F3 axis may be a novel candidate for developing rational therapeutic strategies.
