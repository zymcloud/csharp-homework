The condensation of DNA in a controlled manner is one of the key steps in gene delivery and gene therapy. For this purpose, a water-soluble supramolecular nanostructure is constructed by coating 14 β-cyclodextrins onto the surface of a gold nanoparticle, followed by the noncovalent association of different amounts of anthryl-modified adamantanes with coated β-cyclodextrins. The strong binding of β-cyclodextrins with anthryl adamantanes (K(S) =8.61×10(4) M(-1)) efficiently stabilizes the supramolecular nanostructure. Spectrophotometric fluorescence spectra and microscopic studies demonstrated that, with many anthryl grafts that can intercalate in the outer space of the DNA double helix, this supramolecular nanostructure showed good condensation abilities to calf thymus DNA. Significantly, the condensation efficiency of supramolecular nanostructure towards DNA could be conveniently controlled by adjusting the ratio between gold nanoparticles and anthryl adamantane grafts, leading to the formation of DNA condensates of a size that are suitable for the endocytosis of hepatoma cells, which will make it potentially applicable in many fields of medicinal science and biotechnology.
