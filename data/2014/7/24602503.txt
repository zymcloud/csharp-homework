Purpose:Hydroinfusion is a commonly used ancillary procedure during percutaneous thermal ablation of the liver that is used to separate and protect sensitive structures from the ablation zone. However, risks of hydroinfusion have not been systematically studied. The purpose of the present study was to systematically examine the frequency and severity of local and systemic complications related to hydroinfusion.Materials and methods:From January 2009 to April 2012, 410 consecutive patients underwent percutaneous thermal hepatic tumor ablation. One hundred fifty patients in the study group underwent hydroinfusion and 260 in the control group did not. Patient charts and imaging studies of both groups were reviewed to compare incidences of complications that could potentially be caused by hydroinfusion, including pleural effusion, bowel injury, infection, electrolyte imbalance, and hyperglycemia.Results:Pleural effusions were found to occur more commonly in the hydroinfusion group (45.3%) than in the control group (16.5%). Pleural effusions were significantly larger (P Conclusions:Hydroinfusion is a safe procedure overall. However, pleural effusions occur commonly after hydroinfusion, tend to be moderate or large in size, and are occasionally symptomatic.
