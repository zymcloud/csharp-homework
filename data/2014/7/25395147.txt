Background:Although the prevalence of non-B non-C hepatocellular carcinoma (NBNC HCC) has increased, its clinicopathologic characteristics remain unclear.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 518 HCC patients who underwent hepatic resection. Hepatitis B surface antigen- and hepatitis C antibody-negative patients were categorized into the NBNC HCC group (n = 145); others were categorized into the hepatitis B or C HCC (BC HCC) group (n = 373). We subdivided the etiologies of NBNC HCC according to alcohol intake and presence of steatosis.Results:NBNC HCC was associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (13.1 %), fatty liver disease with moderate alcohol intake (9.0 %), alcoholic liver disease (ALD) (29.7 %), cryptogenic disease (44.1 %), and other known etiologies (4.1 %). The prevalence of obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension was higher and hepatic function was better in the NBNC HCC group, which had significantly larger tumors than the BC HCC group. The entire NBNC HCC group displayed similar overall and disease-free survival as the BC HCC group. Among the subdivisions, NAFLD-associated HCC patients had significantly better disease-free survival than ALD-associated HCC and BC HCC patients. Microvascular invasion (hazard ratio [HR] 2.30; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.33-3.96) and steatosis area Conclusions:The prognosis of NBNC HCC was similar to that of BC HCC. Among NBNC HCC patients, NAFLD-associated HCC patients had a relatively low recurrence risk. Absence of steatosis in hepatic parenchyma had a significant impact on disease-free survival in NBNC HCC patients.
