Background:Hepatectomy with exposure of tumor surface (a special type of R1 resection) provides a chance of cure for selected patients with centrally located hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that is adherent to or compresses major vessels. However, the operative indications, safety, and patient outcomes are not well defined.Methods:We performed hepatectomy for removal of complex centrally located HCC using a selective and dynamic region-specific vascular occlusion technique. Between May 2006 and March 2012, a total of 118 patients underwent resection with exposure of tumor surface (exposure group) and 169 underwent conventional hepatectomy (without exposure of the tumor and vascular surface). The short- and long-term outcomes of patients were evaluated and compared.Results:The postoperative recovery of liver function was comparable between the two groups. Bile leakage occurred in five patients, all in the exposure group. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates were 74.4, 45.6, and 30.1 % in the exposure group and 80.9, 57.2, and 31.7 % in the control group (p = 0.041). Corresponding overall survival rates were 92.3, 70.3, and 44.9 % in the exposure group and 97.8, 81.4, and 53.1 % in the control group (p = 0.094).Conclusions:Hepatectomy with exposure of tumor surface is technically demanding, but can be performed safely. It is also associated with a risk of tumor recurrence. Multidisciplinary combined therapy would be the solution and can contribute to improve overall survival.
