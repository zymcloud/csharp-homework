Exploring intracellular behavior of suicide gene is significant for improving the efficacy and safety of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene/ganciclovir (HSV-TK/GCV) system in cancer therapy. Molecular imaging represents a powerful tool to understand gene transportation and function dynamics. In this work, we reported a quantum-dot-based technique for revealing the procedure of HSV-TK/GCV suicide gene therapy by constructing covalent linkage between near-infrared fluorescent quantum dots (QDs) and TK gene. This stable QD labeling did not influence either the QDs fluorescence or the biological activity of TK gene. Furthermore, we visualized and dynamically traced the intracellular behavior antitumor effect of TK gene in vitro and in vivo. It is demonstrated that TK gene was shuttled to the nucleus after a-24 h treatment; at that time the single dose of GCV administration exerts the gradually increasing lethal effect until to 72 h. Real-time tracing the formation of hepatocellular carcinoma treated with HSV-TK/GCV suicide gene system in vivo by QD-based NIR fluorescence imaging provides useful insight toward QD-based theranostics in future cancer therapy.
