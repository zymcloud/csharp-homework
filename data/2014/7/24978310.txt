Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects 2-3% of the global population. Approximately one-quarter of acute infections cause chronic hepatitis that leads to liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. The major obstacle of current research is the extremely narrow host tropism of HCV. A single HCV strain can replicate in the Huh7 human hepatoma cell line. Huh7 cells can be adapted under selective pressure in vitro to identify host factors that influence viral replication. Here, we extended this strategy to the in vivo condition and generated a series of cell lines by multiple rounds of adaptation in immunocompromised mice. Adaptation increased the cellular resistance to HCV infection. Microarray analyses revealed that the expression levels of several genes were associated with HCV resistance. Notably, up-regulation of the mRNA encoding cysteine-rich secretory protein 3 (CRISP3), a glycoprotein with unknown function that is secreted from multiple exocrine glands, was correlated with HCV resistance. The presence of CRISP3 in the culture medium limited HCV replication at the early phase of infection.
