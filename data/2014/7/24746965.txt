Drug resistance is a big problem in systemic chemotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and nanomedicines loaded with both chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. paclitaxel, PTX) and siRNA's targeting antiapoptosis genes (e.g. BCL-2) possess the advantages to simultaneously overcome the efflux pump-mediated drug resistance and antiapoptosis-related drug resistance. However, tumor-penetrating drug delivery with this type of nanomedicines is extremely difficult due to their relatively big size compared to the single drug-loaded nanomedicines. Aiming at address this problem, US-responsive nanobubbles encapsulating both anti-cancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) and siRNA (PTX-NBs/siRNA) for HCC treatment were developed by hetero-assembly of polymeric micelles and liposomes in the present study. Utilizing an external low-frequency US force imposed to the tumor site, effective tumor-penetrating codelivery of siRNA and PTX was achieved via tail vein injection of PTX-NBs/siRNA into nude mice bearing human HepG2 xerografts. Consequently, the PTX treatment-inducible antiapoptosis in HepG2 cells was effectively suppressed by the codelivered siRNA targeting an antiapoptosis gene (BCL-2 siRNA) during chemotherapy. Owing to the synergistic anti-cancer effect of two therapeutic agents, tumor growth was completely inhibited using low-dose PTX in animal study. Our results highlight the great potential of this type of US-responsive hetero-assemblies carrying both anti-cancer drug and siRNA as an effective nanomedicinal system for HCC therapy.
