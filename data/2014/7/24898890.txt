Esophageal cancer recurrence rates after esophagectomy are high, and locally recurrent or distant metastatic disease has poor prognosis. Management is limited to palliative chemotherapy and symptomatic interventions. We report our experience of four patients who have undergone successful liver resection for metastases from esophageal cancer. All underwent esophagectomy and were referred to our unit with metastatic recurrent liver disease, two with solitary metastases and two with multi-focal disease. The patients underwent multidisciplinary assessment and proceeded to a course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by open or laparoscopic liver resection. Three patients were male, and the mean age was 57.5 (range 44-71) years. Response to chemotherapy ranged from partial to complete response. Following liver resection, two patients developed recurrent disease at 5 and 15 months, and both had disease-specific mortality at 10 and 21 months, respectively. The other two patients remain disease free at 22 and 92 months. Recurrent metastatic esophageal cancer continues to have a poor prognosis, and the majority of patients with liver involvement will not be candidates for hepatic resection. However, this series suggests that in selected patients, liver resection of metastases from esophageal cancer combined with neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy is feasible, but further research is required to determine whether this can offer a survival advantage.
