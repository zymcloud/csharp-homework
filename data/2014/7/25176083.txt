Objective:To analyze the long-term therapeutic effects of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) before liver transplantation.Methods:Forty-six patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing liver transplantation in our department between November, 2009 and November, 2011 were analyzed. Of these patients, 24 received TACE before the surgery while the other 22 did not. We compared the liver graft function (ALT and AST levels), immune function (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD4/CD8, NK cells, activated T cells), cumulative survival rate and disease-free survival rate between the two groups at 1 year and 2 years after the operation.Results:The patients receiving preoperative TACE showed significantly better liver functions and immune function than those who did not receive TACE (PConclusion:TACE prior to liver transplantation can significantly improve the postoperative liver function, immune function, disease-free survival and cumulative survival rates in patients with HCC.
