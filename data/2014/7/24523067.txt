Identification of therapeutic targets against tumor-initiating cells (TICs) is a priority in the development of new therapeutic paradigms against cancer. We enriched a TIC population capable of tumor initiation and self-renewal by serial passages of hepatospheres with chemotherapeutic agents. In chemoresistant hepatospheres, CD47 was found to be up-regulated, when compared with differentiated progenies. CD47 is preferentially expressed in liver TICs, which contributed to tumor initiation, self-renewal, and metastasis and significantly affected patients' clinical outcome. Knockdown of CD47 suppressed stem/progenitor cell characteristics. CD47(+) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells preferentially secreted cathepsin S (CTSS), which regulates liver TICs through the CTSS/protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) loop. Suppression of CD47 by morpholino approach suppressed growth of HCC in vivo and exerted a chemosensitization effect through blockade of CTSS/PAR2 signaling.Conclusion:These data suggest that CD47 may be an attractive therapeutic target for HCC therapy.
