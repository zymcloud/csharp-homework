Aim:The aim of our study was to compare clinical outcomes between elderly patients aged â‰¥75 years (elderly group, n=66) with intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and younger patients aged Methods:Clinical outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and tumor response rate at initial therapy, were compared between these two groups.Results:The median survival time and the 1- and 3-year cumulative OS rates were 2.90 years and 84.1% and 48.0%, respectively, in the elderly group and 2.44 years and 78.2% and 39.3%, respectively, in the control group (p=0.887). The objective response rate in the elderly group was 81.8% (54/66 patients), while that in the control group was 78.6% (66/84 patients) (p=0.227).Conclusion:Elderly patients with intermediate HCC undergoing TACE had a prognosis comparable with that of younger patients with intermediate HCC undergoing TACE.
intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma; transcatheter arterial chemoembolization.
