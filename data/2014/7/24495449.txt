Objectives:Carcinoma of the bladder is the fifth most common cancer whose incidence continues to rise. MTDH/AEG-1 is associated with the initiation and progression of many cancers including breast, hepatocellular, ovarian, and colorectal carcinomas. However, the expression and functional importance of MTDH/AEG-1 in bladder cancer remains unknown. The present study was aimed at exploring the functional role of MTDH/AEG-1 in selected bladder cancer cell lines.Methods and materials:The relative expression of MTDH/AEG-1 was assessed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in several human bladder cancer cell lines as well as cancerous and benign bladder tissues. Then, expression of MTDH/AEG-1 in RT112 and 647V bladder cancer cell lines was knocked down by an RNA interference strategy. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined after treatment with specific interfering RNA. Potential effects of MTDG/AEG-1 specific interfering RNA on the cell cycle were investigated by flow cytometry. We also performed anchorage-independent growth and wound-healing assays to study MTDH/AEG-1 function.Results:Down-regulation of MTDH/AEG-1 did not significantly affect the cell cycle distribution but rather reduced cell viability via apoptosis, as evidenced by increased annexin V staining and caspase 3/7 activities as well as mitochondrial potential disruption. Of note, serum starvation did not exacerbate the effects of MTDH/AEG-1 knockdown. Furthermore, MTDH/AEG-1 down-regulation significantly decreased anchorage-independent growth and migration of bladder carcinoma cells.Conclusion:Overexpression of MTDH/AEG-1 contributes to the neoplastic phenotype of bladder cancer cells by promoting survival, clonogenicity, and migration.
