Purpose:To determine the safety and efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with sorafenib (hereafter, TACE-sorafenib) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT).Materials and methods:This study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement for informed consent was waived. The medical records of consecutive patients with HCC and PVTT who underwent TACE-sorafenib or TACE alone from January 2010 to December 2012 were retrospectively evaluated. Sorafenib (400 mg) was administered twice daily. Outcomes of patients who underwent TACE-sorafenib were compared with outcomes of patients who underwent TACE by using the Kaplan-Meier method according to types of PVTT: PVTT in the main portal vein (type A), PVTT in the first-order portal vein branch (type B), and PVTT in second- or lower-order portal vein branches (type C).Results:Ninety-one patients were included in the analysis; 46 patients underwent TACE-sorafenib and 45 underwent TACE. TACE-sorafenib showed significant survival benefits compared with TACE in patients with type B (median survival, 13 months vs 6 months; P = .002) or type C (median survival, 15 months vs 10 months; P = .003) PVTT. TACE-sorafenib and main PVTT were the independent prognostic factors for survival at uni- and multivariate analysis. Liver function after TACE-sorafenib worsened only in patients with main PVTT. Sorafenib-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 16 patients (35%).Conclusion:TACE-sorafenib side effects were acceptable, and this treatment may improve overall survival in patients with HCC with first-order or lower-branch PVTT when compared with patients who underwent TACE alone.
