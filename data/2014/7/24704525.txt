Background & aims:Treatment for hepatitis B virus infection reduces the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the long-term protective effects for subgroups of patients with chronic hepatitis B are unclear.Methods:We conducted a retrospective nationwide cohort study using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2010). Cumulative incidences were calculated and multivariable analyses were carried out after adjusting for competing mortality. Propensity scores were used to match 21,595 patients with chronic hepatitis B who received nucleoside analogue therapy for at least 90 days (treated cohort) with 21,595 untreated patients with chronic hepatitis B (controls), who received hepatoprotectants for at least 90 days. Data were collected from the treated cohort for a mean period of 3.46 years and from controls for 5.24 years.Results:The treated cohort had a significantly lower 7-year incidence of HCC (7.32%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.77%-7.87%) than controls (22.7%; 95% CI, 22.1%-23.3%; P Conclusions:Based on a retrospective, nationwide study in Taiwan, nucleoside analogue therapy use is associated with reduced risk of HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection.
