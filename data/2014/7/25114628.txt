Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second-most common cause of cancer-related death in the world. In spite of HCC surveillance with repeated imaging, about 50% of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage and are not amenable to curative treatment options. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, remains the standard of care for advanced HCC. Over the last 5 years, several other medications have been tested in Phase III trials. However, they have not shown any added benefit over sorafenib. Regorafenib, another multikinase inhibitor, has demonstrated inhibition of a broader range of kinases, along with higher inhibition potential in preclinical models. After its safety and pharmacological properties was studied in Phase I trials, a Phase II study evaluating the role of Regorafenib in patients with advanced HCC who progressed on sorafenib therapy demonstrated efficacy and a manageable safety profile. A Phase III trial is ongoing, and its result will help us better evaluate the role of Regorafenib in patients with advanced HCC.
