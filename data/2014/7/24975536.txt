Patients with inflammatory bowel disease may develop dysplasia in the cryptal epithelium, polypoid neoplasias, and nonpolypoid (flat) adenomas, lesions at risk to proceed to colorectal carcinoma. The onset of invasion in nonpolypoid adenomas may occur without changes in the shape or the size of the lesion. In experimental animals, some colonotropic carcinogens induce polypoid and nonpolypoid neoplasias and others induce polypoid neoplasias exclusively. Some of the biologic attributes of nonpolypoid adenomas in humans can be demonstrated in laboratory animals.
