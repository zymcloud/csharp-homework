Clinical/methodical issue:Due to late diagnosis and a lack of organs only about 30 % of patients suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergo curative treatment.Standard radiological methods:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a routine procedure in intermediate stage HCC. In addition transarterial embolization (TAE) and transarterial radioembolization (TARE) are available for these patients.Performance:For inoperable patients with HCC, TACE is superior to best supportive care in terms of survival. Combined with percutaneous ablation TACE achieves results similar to resection.Achievements:Current developments, such as drug-eluting beads, TARE and multimodal treatment are well suited to further improve outcome in patients with intermediate stage HCC.Practical recommendations:Transarterial therapies in HCC should be applied in accordance with the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) criteria. Due to a better safety profile and potentially improved disease-free survival the use of drug-eluting beads should be liberally considered.
