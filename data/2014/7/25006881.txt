Liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represent the endstage of most chronic liver diseases and are a major global health burden. It has been consistently shown that both liver cirrhosis and HCC are triggered by inflammatory processes, but the molecular mechanisms linking chronic hepatitis with cirrhosis and HCC are only poorly understood. Recent studies suggested that the intestinal microflora as a main source of portal-vein LPS might play a critical role in this process. Here we summarize the available literature on the role of the gut microbiome in hepatofibrogenesis and -carcinogenesis. Such knowledge might help to develop novel, innovative strategies for the prevention and therapy of liver disease.
