Objective:Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) that arise in noncirrhotic livers have several histologic and biochemical features that distinguish them from HCCs occurring in the setting of cirrhosis. Because the presentation, management, and prognosis of these entities are distinct, the accurate preoperative characterization of these lesions is of great clinical significance. We review the pathogenesis, imaging appearance, and clinical implications of noncirrhotic HCCs as they pertain to the clinical radiologist.Conclusion:HCCs that develop in noncirrhotic patients have distinct etiologic, cytogenetic, histopathologic, and clinical features. Despite a larger tumor burden at the time of HCC diagnosis, noncirrhotic patients with HCC have better overall survival and disease-free survival than cirrhotic patients with HCC. Knowledge of the precise clinical and imaging features of this entity and of other diagnostic considerations for the noncirrhotic liver is essential for improved patient care.
