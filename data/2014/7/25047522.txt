Clinical/methodical issue:Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) constitute the gold standard in radiological imaging of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In cases of typical contrast behavior each modality as a single dynamic technique allows the diagnosis of HCC. There is still a challenge in detection of small HCCs Performance:Nowadays, both modalities achieve high detection rates of 90-100 % for lesions > 2 cm. Regarding lesions between 1 and 2 cm there is a higher sensitivity for MRI ranging between 80 and 90 % compared to 60-75 % with CT. Besides the multimodal diagnostic criteria, MRI provides significant benefits with the use of hepatobiliary contrast. Especially in combination with diffusion- weighted imaging (DWI) increased sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy compared to CT has been described for lesions sized Achievements:The use of MRI including hepatobiliary imaging and DWI has to be regarded as the best non-invasive imaging modality for the detection of HCC and for the characterization of nodules in patients with liver cirrhosis. In comparison to CT there are benefits regarding detection of small lesions Practical recommendations:Both MRI and CT provide a high diagnostic performance in evaluation of HCC in liver cirrhosis. With MRI there are considerable advantages regarding the detection rate and specificity. For daily clinical routine, CT offers a fast, reliable and easy available modality with benefits for patients in reduced general state of health and restricted compliance.
