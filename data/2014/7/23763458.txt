Aim:To compare the recurrence and survivals between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with major portal vein tumor thrombus (TT) and major hepatic vein TT after hepatic resection (HR).Methods:A retrospective study was carried out with the medical records of 272 patients who underwent hepatic resection and thrombectomy for HCC with major portal vein (group A) or hepatic vein (group B) TT. The clinicopathological parameters, recurrence, survivals and prognostic significance associated with major portal or hepatic vein TT were analyzed.Results:Patients in group A had a better median survival compared with their counterparts in group B (52 vs 38 weeks; P Conclusion:Patients with HCC and major hepatic vein TT had higher incidence of extrahepatic metastases and worse overall survival after hepatic resection compared with patients with major portal vein TT. With preserved liver function, patients can receive aggressive treatments and survivals could be prolonged.
