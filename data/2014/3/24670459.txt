Objective:To investigate the risk factors affecting neoplasm recurrence and metastasis following liver transplantation (LT) and liver resection (LR) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) meeting Milan criteria.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 88 patients with HCC meeting Milan criteria undergoing LT or LR in Nanfang Hospital between January, 2006 and December, 2011 and compared the survival rate and recurrence-free survival rate between the two groups. Univariate analysis of 12 variables during peri-operative period was carried out to screen the risk factors affecting neoplasm recurrence and metastasis.Results:The LT group and HR group had similar 1-, 3-, and 5-year-survival rates (P>0.05), but the LT group showed significantly higher 1-, 3-, and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates (PConclusion:Patients with HCC meeting Milan criteria undergoing LT have longer long-term recurrence-free survival. A male patient with a greater tumor size, microvascular tumor embolism, and poorly differentiated carcinoma is more likely to develop neoplasm recurrence and metastasis following the surgery.
