Liver disease, specifically cirrhosis, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. The diagnosis of early cirrhosis in HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients may be challenging. The development of noninvasive methods for fibrosis assessment empowers the infectious disease specialist to diagnose advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Early diagnosis is essential to enroll patients in screening programs for esophageal varices and hepatocellular carcinoma. Cirrhosis may also modify decisions about treatment of both HIV and HCV, including vaccination, medications chosen, and referral for liver transplant.
