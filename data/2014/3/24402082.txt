E2F transcription factor 3 (E2F3), a member of the E2F transcription factor family and a member of the genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle, is an oncogene with strong proliferative potential. E2F3 is involved in many processes and plays important roles in the development of several types of cancer, while its relationship with prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has yet to be reported. In the present study, based on 4 independent microarray data sets which covered 385 cases of HCC and 327 cases of normal livers retrieved from the Oncomine database, we demonstrated that E2F3 was upregulated at least 1.5-fold and on average 2.3-fold in HCC when compared with normal controls. Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis consisting of protein-protein interaction, gene co-occurrence, microRNA-mRNA interaction and biological process annotation indicated that E2F3 interacted with a large number of genes, proteins and microRNAs which were all associated with poor prognosis in patients with HCC and other types of cancer, suggesting that E2F3 may also serve as a biomarker for poor prognosis. Taken together, for the first time, we show that the overexpression of E2F3 may be associated with unfavorable prognosis in HCC.
