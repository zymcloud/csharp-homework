Background:Accumulating evidence has shown that up-regulation of microRNA-25(miR-25) is associated with the prognosis of several types of human malignant solid tumors. However, whether miR-25 expression has influence on the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unknown.Methods:The differentially expressed amount of the miR-25 was validated in triplicate by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Survival rate was analyzed by log-rank test, and survival curves were plotted according to Kaplan-Meier. Multivariate analysis of the prognostic factors was performed with Cox regression model.Results:The expression of miR-25 was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues when compared with adjacent normal tissues (pConclusion:Our data suggests that the overexpression of miR-25 in HCC tissues is of predictive value on poor prognosis.Virtual slide:The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1989618421114309.
