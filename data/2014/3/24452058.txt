Objective:This study evaluated the feasibility of CT perfusion parameters for the early efficacy prediction of sorafenib in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in rats.Methods:CT hepatic perfusion measurements were performed in the livers of 40 rats implanted with rat HCC. The rats in the experimental group (n = 28) were treated by oral gavage with sorafenib (20 mg per day), whereas the rats in the control group (n = 12) were treated by normal saline. Rats were classified into the responder group if the maximum diameter of their tumour had decreased 21 days after treatment, whereas the other rats were classified into the non-responder group. Data were analysed using the Pearson correlation analysis or analysis of variance.Results:CT perfusion was used to depict haemodynamic changes before and after treatment. The arterial liver perfusion was significantly decreased in the responder group on Day 11 after treatment with sorafenib (from 71.5 to 53.4 ml min(-1) 100 ml(-1)), whereas no significant changes were observed in the non-responder group (p = 0.87). The maximum diameter of the tumour was also significantly decreased in the responder group on Day 21 after treatment (p = 0.042), whereas the maximum tumour diameter was significantly increased in the control group (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION AND ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: CT perfusion could be used to quantitatively analyse the haemodynamic changes in the treatment of HCC with sorafenib, which indicates that this approach may be developed for the early prediction of treatment efficacy for sorafenib.
