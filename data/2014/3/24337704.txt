Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an important trigger of the immune response against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and liver injuries. The roles of HBV reactivation versus TLR4-dependant immune response may be critical factors in preventing radiation-induced liver diseases (RILDs) after liver cancer radiotherapy. This study consists of three phases. In the primary phase, livers of mutant TLR4 (TLR4(-)) mice were irradiated with 30 Gy in either the absence or presence of HBV infection. The latter was done by introduction of plasmid pAAV/HBV 1.2. In the advanced phase, RILDs were compared in normal TLR4 (TLR4(+)) versus TLR4(-) mice. In the validation phase, 28 liver cancer patients who had undergone radiotherapy before hepatectomy were enrolled. Liver biopsies near tumors, irradiated with 35-48 Gy, were used to construct tissue microarrays. HBV reactivation, TLR4 expression, and severity of RILDs were studied in both mouse and human. More HBV reactivation, without significant RILD, was observed in irradiated versus unirradiated TLR4(-) mice. RILD scores of TLR4(+) mice were higher than TLR4(-) mice. In humans, serious RILDs tended to develop in patients with high TLR4 expression, but not in patients with low TLR4 or high HBV surface antigen expression. High TLR4 expression was seen in only 2 of 12 HBV-reactive patients, but in HBV-nonreactive patients, it was seen in 6 of 9 (P < 0.03). In summary, RILDs correlated with high TLR4 expression, but not with HBV reactivation, which is inhibited in liver with high TLR4 expression after liver cancer radiotherapy.
