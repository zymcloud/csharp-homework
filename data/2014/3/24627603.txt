Aim:To investigate the usefulness of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) before transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Methods:We investigated the usefulness of pre-intervention with BCAAs by comparing patients treated with BCAAs at 12.45 g/d orally for at least 2 wk before TACE or RFA and those not receiving such pretreatment. A total of 270 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma complicated by cirrhosis were included in the study. Mean changes from baseline (Δ) in serum albumin (Alb), C-reactive protein (CRP), and transaminase levels, as well as peak body temperature were also determined and compared at days 2, 5, and 10 after the start of TACE or RFA.Results:In patients who underwent TACE or RFA, BCAA pre-intervention significantly suppressed the development of post- intervention hypoalbuminemia and reduced inflammatory reactions during the subsequent clinical course. After TACE, the ΔAlb peaked on day 2, remained constantly lower in BCAA-treated patients, compared to the control group, and was -0.13 ± 0.42 g/dL in BCAA-treated patients and -0.33 ± 0.51 g/dL in untreated patients on day 10. The ΔCRP was also significantly lower in BCAA-treated patients on days 2, 5 and 10 after TACE. Like the trends noted after TACE, a similar tendency was noted as to the ΔAlb and ΔCRP after RFA. The changes in serum Alb level were inversely correlated with CRP changes; therefore, a possible involvement of the anti-inflammatory effect of BCAAs was inferred as a factor contributory to the suppression of decrease in serum Alb level.Conclusion:Pre-intervention with BCAAs may hasten the recovery of serum Alb level and mitigate post-operative complications in patients undergoing TACE or RFA.
