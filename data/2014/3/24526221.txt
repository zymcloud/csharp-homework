Background:Laparoscopic resection is an emerging tool in surgical oncology, but its role in liver tumors is far from being universally accepted.Methods:We designed a case-matched control study, comparing laparoscopic (LAP) vs. open hepatectomies (OP) performed in the same center during the same period of time. Fifty LAP were performed (34 liver metastases, 7 hepatocellular carcinomas, 2 hydatid cysts, and 5 benign tumors). Cases were compared with 100 OP matched according to: diagnosis, number of lesions, type of resection, age, ASA score, and ECOG performance status. We evaluated intraoperative and postoperative parameters, focusing on morbidity and mortality.Results:Preoperative data were comparable in both groups. Operative features were similar in terms of overall morbidity 18 (36 %) vs. 36 (36 %), p = 1; intraoperative bleeding, 401 (18-2192) vs. 475 (20-2000) mL, p = 0.89; pedicle clamping, 37 (74 %) vs. 88 (88 %), p = 0.55; margin, 0.6 (0-5) vs. 0.65 (0-5) cm, p = 0.94, and mortality p = 0.65 for the LAP and OP groups, respectively. There was a significant decrease in surgical site infections 1 (2 %) vs. 18 (18 %) p = 0.007 in the LAP group. Operative time was longer: 295 (120-600) vs. 200 (70-450) min (p = 0.0001), and hospital stay significantly shorter: 4 (1-60) vs. 7 (3-44) days, p = 0.0001 with less readmissions (0 vs. 7 %) in the LAP.Discussion:In adequately selected patients, laparoscopic hepatectomy is feasible, safe, shortens hospital stay, and decreases surgical site infections.
