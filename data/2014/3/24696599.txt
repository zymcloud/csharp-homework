A growing number of multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) has undergone testing for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Unfortunately, this enthusiasm has recently been discouraged by a number of negative phase III studies on several anti-angiogenic TKIs in HCC. Several postulations have been made to account for this phenomenon, namely the plateau effects of anti-angiogenesis approach, the heterogeneity of HCC in terms of background hepatitis/cirrhosis and tumor biology, as well as the way how clinical trials are designed. Regardless of the underlying reasons, these results suggested that alternative strategies are necessary to further develop systemic therapy for HCC. Several new strategies are currently evaluated: for examples, molecular agents with activities against targets other than vascular endothelial growth factor receptor are being evaluated in on-going clinical trials. In addition, different approaches of targeted agents in combination with various treatment modalities, such as concurrently with another molecular agent, cytotoxic chemotherapy or transarterial chemoembolization, are being developed. This review aims to give a summary on the results of recently released clinical trials on TKIs, followed by discussion on some of the potential novel agents and combinational approaches. Future directions for testing innovative systemic agents for HCC will also be discussed.
