Reduction-sensitive shell-sheddable glyco-nanoparticles were designed and developed based on poly(ε-caprolactone)-graft-SS-lactobionic acid (PCL-g-SS-LBA) copolymer for efficient hepatoma-targeting delivery of doxorubicin (DOX). PCL-g-SS-LBA was prepared by ring-opening copolymerization of ε-caprolactone and pyridyl disulfide carbonate followed by postpolymerization modification with thiolated lactobionic acid (LBA-SH) via thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. The dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that PCL-g-SS-LBA was self-assembled into monodisperse nanoparticles (SS-GNs) with a mean diameter of about 80 nm. SS-GNs while remaining stable under physiological conditions (37 °C, pH 7.4) were prone to rapid shell-shedding and aggregation in the presence of 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). DOX was loaded into SS-GNs with a decent loading content of 12.0 wt %. Notably, in vitro release studies revealed that about 80.3% DOX was released from DOX-loaded SS-GNs in 24 h under a reductive condition while low drug release (
