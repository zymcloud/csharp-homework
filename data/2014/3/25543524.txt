Aflatoxin-B1 (AFB1) intoxication is known to develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, pathogenesis and diagnosis of AFB1-induced HCC remain undefined. This article describes histopathological progression versus kinetics of the placental glutathione S-transferase (GST-pi) expression and profiles of the antioxidant enzymes, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in the liver from the rats administered with two doses of 1 mg AFB1/kg b.w. Histopathologically, hepatocytes necrosis could be observed after 4 weeks of the AFB1 treatment, which subsequently developed into the well-defined foci of altered hepatocytes (FAH) at 10 weeks post-treatment stage. This was consistent with an increasing trend of GST-pi immunostaining especially in the liver foci as a function of FAH progression and thus, suggesting that GST-pi over expression may serve as a marker for AFB1-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. The liver from AFB1-treated rats showed significantly enhanced level of reactive oxygen species coinciding with the declined immunostaining for superoxide dismutase-1, a committed enzyme of the antioxidant pathway, in the FAH regions and also with declined activity of the other antioxidant enzymes. Concordantly, the liver from the AFB1-treated rats showed over expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines; TNF-α & IL-1α and a cell proliferative marker PCNA. These findings present histological characterization of AFB1-induced HCC development and provide evidence for activation of oxidative stress-pro-inflammatory pathway during hepatocarcinogenesis induced by AFB1 toxicity.
