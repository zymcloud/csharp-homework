Purpose:This study assessed the efficacy and safety of artificial ascites in assisting ultrasound-guided percutaneous microwave (MW) ablation of hepatic tumours adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract.Materials and methods:In total, 36 patients with 36 hepatic malignancies who underwent the introduction of artificial ascites before ultrasound-guided percutaneous MW ablation were included in this retrospective study. The separation success rate of the artificial ascites, the technique effectiveness of the MW ablation, local tumour progression and complications were assessed.Results:The separation success rate of the artificial ascites for 36 hepatic tumours adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract was 88.9% (32/36). The technical effectiveness of MW ablation in 32 cases with successful separation was 96.9% (31/32). During follow-up (mean, 12.1 Â± 7.2 months), local tumour progression was found in five of 31 patients (16.1%). One patient experienced a major complication (infection of the hepatic ablation zone).Conclusions:Ultrasound-guided percutaneous MW ablation assisted by artificial ascites is a safe and effective method for the treatment of primary and metastatic hepatic tumours adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract and can achieve good local control of such tumours.
