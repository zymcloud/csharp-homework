Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the major causes of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and the development of HCV-related disease is accelerated in individuals coinfected with human immunodeficiency-1 virus (HIV). In the present study, we correlated different host single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL28B, CTLA4, LDLr, and HFE genes and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups with the outcome of HCV infection and the response to pegylated-interferon plus ribavirin (pegIFN-RBV) treatment. Our study population consisted of 63 Majorcan patients coinfected with HCV and HIV and 59 anonymous unrelated controls. Whereas the population frequency of IL28B alleles was similar to that found in a North-American cohort of European descent, the frequency of the rs12979860 C allele was lower than that determined in other cohorts from Spain. The frequencies of CTLA4 and LDLr polymorphisms were comparable to those reported in other populations. Significant differences between cases and control cohorts occurred only for the H63D mutation of the HFE gene. There were no other differences in the frequencies of other polymorphisms or mtDNA haplogroups. The IL28B rs12979860 CC genotype was shown to be associated with a rapid virological response, and the spontaneous viral clearance rate for HCV was higher in patients with the CTLA4+49 G allele. There was no relationship between SNPs in the LDLr and HFE genes and mtDNA haplogroups and the response to treatment. Our results suggest that the host genetic background plays a significant role in the pegIFN-RBV response of patients coinfected with HCV and HIV.
