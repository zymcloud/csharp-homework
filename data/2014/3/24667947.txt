A 60-year-old man underwent surveillance colonoscopy that demonstrated five subcentimetre polyps, all of which were biopsied. One of the five polyps had histopathology consistent with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) metastasis from primary lung cancer. Subsequent imaging demonstrated a spiculated mass in the right upper lung lobe with metastasis to the brain, liver and spleen. He was immediately treated with palliative whole-brain irradiation followed by eight cycles of carboplatin and etoposide. Despite aggressive management, he had disease progression characterised by worsening performance status and development of transfusion-dependent anaemia, new blastic bone lesions and epidural disease. Given his liver failure, he was not considered a candidate for second-line topotecan. After discussion with the patient, family and palliative services, he was discharged with home hospice. This report describes a rare case of advanced SCLC presenting as a metastatic caecal polyp on surveillance colonoscopy.
