Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global health problem that affects more than 170 million people worldwide. It is a major cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, making the virus the most common cause of liver failure and transplantation. The standard-of-care treatment for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) has been changed during the last decade and direct acting antiviral drugs have already been used. Besides, understanding of the pathogenesis of CHC has evolved rapidly during the last years and now several host factors are known to affect the natural history and response to treatment. Recent genome-wide association studies have shown the important role of interleukin-28B and inosine triphosphatase in HCV infection. The present review article attempts to summarize the current knowledge on the role of host factors towards individualization of HCV treatment.
