The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of radiotherapy in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVT) and to determine the prognostic factors for overall survival. Altogether, 106 patients with HCC and PVT referred for radiotherapy between 2004 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 60 Gy in 30 daily fractions was delivered with intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques. Patient-related and treatment-related factors were analyzed to evaluate their prognostic significance for the overall survival rate. Complete response was noted in 10 patients and partial response in 55 patients. The liver lesions had become resectable after the completion of radiotherapy in 12 patients, and surgery was subsequently performed. One or two courses of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) were administered to 19 patients following radiotherapy. The 1-year and 2-year overall survival rates were 34.7% and 11%, respectively, and the median survival was 7 months for the entire cohort of patients. Post-radiotherapy treatment modality, response to radiotherapy and JIS score were demonstrated as independent prognostic factors for overall survival (P = 0.003, P
