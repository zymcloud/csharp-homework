A multifunctional pH-sensitive polymeric nanoparticle system was developed for simultaneous tumor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and therapy. The nanoparticles were self-assembled using the multi-block polymer poly(lactic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(l-lysine)-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (PLA-PEG-PLL-DTPA) and the pH-sensitive material poly(l-histidine)-poly(ethylene glycol)-biotin (PLH-PEG-biotin). The anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) drug sorafenib was encapsulated inside the nanoparticles. Gd ions were chelated to the DTPA groups which were distributed on the nanoparticle surface. Biotinylated vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) antibodies were linked to the surface biotin groups of nanoparticles through the avidin linker to form the target pH-sensitive theranostic nanoparticles (TPTN). TPTN exhibited spherical or ellipsoidal shapes, uniform particle size distribution (181.4 ± 3.4 nm), positive zeta potential (14.95 ± 0.60 mV), high encapsulation efficiency (95.02 ± 1.47%) and drug loading (2.38 ± 0.04%). The pH-sensitive sorafenib release from TPTN was observed under different pH values (47.81% at pH = 7.4 and 99.32% at pH = 5.0, respectively). In cell cytotoxicity studies, TPTN showed similar antitumor effect against HepG2 cells compared to solubilized sorafenib solution after pre-incubation in acid PBS (pH = 5.0) for 1 h in vitro (P > 0.05). In in vivo anti-tumor studies, TPTN showed significantly higher antitumor effect in H22 tumor (VEGFR overexpressed cell line) bearing mice compared to the solubilized sorafenib solution (oral or i.v. administration) group (P
