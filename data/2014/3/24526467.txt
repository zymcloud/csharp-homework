Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common liver malignancy in the world. The X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 gene (XRCC1) is one of the most important candidate genes for influencing HCC risk. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between genetic polymorphisms of XRCC1 and HCC risk. A total of 592 HCC patients and 594 healthy controls were recruited in this case-control study. The c.1804C>A genetic polymorphism of XRCC1 gene was genotyped by the created restriction site-polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing methods. Our data suggested that the c.1804C>A genetic polymorphism of XRCC1 gene was significantly associated with the increased risk of HCC in the homozygote comparison (AA vs. CC: odds ratio (OR) 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25-2.94, P=0.003), recessive model (AA vs.Ca/cc:OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.28-2.92, P=0.002), and allele comparison (A vs. C: OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.00-1.42, P=0.045). The allele A and genotype AA might contribute to the susceptibility to HCC. Our findings support that c.1804C>A genetic polymorphism of XRCC1 gene plays a genetic influence on the susceptibility to HCC in the studied population.
