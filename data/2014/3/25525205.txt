Aberrant glycosylation-targeted disease biomarker development is based on cumulative evidence that certain glycoforms are mass-produced in a disease-specific manner. However, the development process has been hampered by the absence of an efficient validation method based on a sensitive and multiplexed platform. In particular, ELISA-based analytical tools are not adequate for this purpose, mainly because of the presence of a pair of N-glycans of IgG-type antibodies. To overcome the associated hurdles in this study, antibodies were tagged with oligonucleotides with T7 promoter and then allowed to form a complex with corresponding antigens. An antibody-bound specific glycoform was isolated by lectin chromatography and quantitatively measured on a DNA microarray chip following production of fluorescent RNA by T7-trascription. This tool ensured measurement of targeted glycoforms of multiple biomarkers with high sensitivity and multiplexity. This analytical method was applied to an in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assay where a panel of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) biomarkers comprising alpha-fetoprotein, hemopexin, and alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) was examined in terms of the serum level and their fuco-fractions. The results indicated that the tests using the multiplexed fuco-biomarkers provided improved discriminatory power between non- hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma subjects compared with the alpha-fetoprotein level or fuco-alpha-fetoprotein test alone. The developed method is expected to facilitate the validation of disease-specific glycan biomarker candidates.
