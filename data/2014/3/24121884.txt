The Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important etiological factor for hepatocarcinogenesis, because HBV DNA load and HBV reactivation are major risks that influence the long-term survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who underwent hepatectomy and, thus, may cause postoperative liver function deterioration, tumor recurrence, and reduce patient's overall survival. However, anti-HBV therapy can suppress HBV replication, improve the remnant liver function, render patients better able to tolerate HCC treatments, and may even improve their prognosis. In this paper, an anti-HBV therapy that benefits the prognosis of HBV-related HCC following hepatectomy is reviewed.
