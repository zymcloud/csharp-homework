Background and aim:Liver transplantation (LT) for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related disease can be complicated by HBV recurrence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors, prophylaxis treatment, and histological characteristics of HBV recurrence after LT when using long-term, low-dose hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) plus nucleoside analog (lamivudine [LAM] or entecavir [ETV]).Methods:Retrospective data from 253 adult LT patients using long-term, low-dose HBIG plus nucleoside analog after LT, for a mean treatment duration of 1-72 months, were collected from a single center in Beijing, China. Univariate analyses were conducted to determine the association among gender, age, hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatitis B e antigen-positive status, HBV-DNA level and tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) mutations on HBV recurrence in these patients.Results:Overall, the HBV recurrence rate was 6.32% (16/253). There was no significant difference in the survival rate between the HBV recurrence and non-recurrence groups. Risk factors for HBV recurrence were: hepatitis B e antigen positivity, HBV-DNA > 10(5) copies/mL, hepatocellular carcinoma, and YMDD mutation. Sixteen patients receiving LAM had HBV recurrence (16/169; mean treatment duration: 61.8 ± 18.3 months). No HBV recurrence occurred in patients receiving ETV after LT (0/84; mean treatment duration: 57.1 ± 15.9 months). Differences in rate of mortality and HBV recurrence were not significant between the two groups.Conclusions:LT is an effective treatment for HBV-related end-stage liver disease. The combination of ETV and intramuscular HBIG for HBV recurrence prophylaxis after LT was more effective than LAM, especially in Chinese patients with HBV recurrence risk factors.
