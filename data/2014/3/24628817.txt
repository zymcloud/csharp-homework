Background:Bone scanning (BS), liver ultrasonography (LUS), and chest radiography (CXR) are commonly recommended for baseline staging in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate whether these tests are indicated for specific patient subpopulation based on clinical staging and molecular subtype.Methods:A retrospective study on 5406 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer was conducted to identify differences in occurrence of metastasis based on clinical staging and molecular subtypes. All patients had been evaluated by BS, LUS and CXR at diagnosis.Results:Complete information on clinical staging was available in 5184 patients. For stage I, II, and III, bone metastasis rate was 0%, 0.6% and 2.7%, respectively (P < 0.01); liver metastasis rate was 0%, 0.1%, and 1.0%, respectively (P < 0.01); lung metastasis rate was 0.1%, 0.1%, and 0.7%, respectively (P < 0.01). Complete information on molecular subtype was available in 3411 patients. For Luminal A, Luminal B (HER2-), Luminal BH (HER2+), HER2+ overexpression, and Basal-like, bone metastasis rate was 1.4%, 0.7%, 2.5%, 2.7%, and 0.9%, respectively (P < 0.05); liver metastasis rate was 0.1%, 0.1%, 1.0%, 1.1%, and 0.9%, respectively (P < 0.01); lung metastasis rate was 0.20%, 0%, 0%, 0.27%, and 0.9%, respectively (P < 0.05). cT (tumor size), cN (lymph node), PR (progesterone receptor), and HER2 status predicted bone metastasis (P < 0.05). cT, cN, ER (estrogen receptor), PR, and HER2 status predicted liver metastasis (P < 0.05). cT, cN, and PR status predicted lung metastasis (P < 0.05).Conclusion:These data indicate that based on clinical staging and molecular subtypes, BS, LUS and CXR are necessary for patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer.
