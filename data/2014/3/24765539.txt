We report an extremely rare case of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the stomach. A 69-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a 2-month history of dysphagia and tarry stools. Endoscopic examination revealed a cauliflower-shaped protruding mass along the lesser curvature of the gastric cardia. Biopsy of the lesion revealed squamous cell carcinoma of the stomach. Computed tomography revealed a thickened stomach wall and a mass protruding into the gastric lumen. Total gastrectomy with splenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, and Roux-en-Y reconstruction was performed, together with a lower thoracic esophagectomy via a left thoracotomy. Histopathological examination of the specimen revealed well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the stomach. Postoperative follow-up was uneventful for the first 18 months. However, multiple liver metastases and para-aortic lymph node metastasis developed subsequently. Despite systemic combination chemotherapy, the patient died because of progression of the recurrent tumors. Here, we review the characteristics of 56 cases of gastric squamous cell carcinoma reported in Japan.
