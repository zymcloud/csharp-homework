Hepatoid adenocarcinoma is a rare and unusual tumor in the female genital tract. Hepatoid adenocarcinoma resembles hepatocellular carcinoma morphologically but develops in extrahepatic organs, and usually demonstrates foci of adenocarcinoma of the primary organ. Tumor cells often stain positive for anti-α-fetoprotein antibody, and may be associated with elevated serum α-fetoprotein, which may be useful as a tumor marker to guide treatment. There is little reliable information to guide clinical management of these unusual tumors and prognosis is poor despite multi-modal treatment. This report describes the diagnosis and treatment of this tumor in a postmenopausal woman.
