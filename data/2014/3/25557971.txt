Background:Parenchyma transection techniques during liver resection (LR) are linked to intraoperative blood loss and postoperative morbidity, with a recent increased use of energy devices over traditional clamp-crush hepatotomy (CCH).Methods:Prospectively collected data from 191 consecutive patients undergoing LR with exclusive CCH by a single surgeon were examined.Results:There were 94 men and 97 women, with 25% primary and 59% secondary malignancies or other conditions (16%). Forty-nine percent of LRs were major, 65% anatomic, and 32% included extrahepatic components. Median Pringle time was 23 minutes (9 to 76), blood loss 300 mL (20 to 5,000), and red blood cell transfusion rate 14%. Morbidity rate was 27% with 6 deaths. Significant relationships were observed for blood loss with complex resections, transfusions, major morbidity, and length of stay, but not between Pringle time and any outcomes.Conclusion:A CCH technique as employed in this LR experience without any use of additional devices can yield good postoperative results.
