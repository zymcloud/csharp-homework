Mutant p53 proteins in human hepatoma cell lines such as HuH-7 (Y220C) and PLC/PRF/5 (R249S) accumulate in the cytoplasm, and lose their transcriptional function. Geranylgeranoic acid (GGA) is a naturally occurring acyclic diterpenoid that induces cell death in both cell lines, but not in HepG2 cells harboring wild-type p53. Here, we demonstrate that micromolar concentrations of GGA induce a rapid nuclear translocation of cytoplasmic p53 in both p53-mutant cell lines and p53 knockdown attenuates GGA-induced cell death in HuH-7 cells. Cell-free experiments demonstrate that GGA is able to release 670-kD p53-containing complexes from putative huge macromolecular aggregates in post-mitochondrial fractions as revealed on blue-native gradient PAGE. Among several p53-target genes tested, GGA upregulates PUMA gene expression, and ivermectin, an inhibitor for importin α/β, blocks GGA-induced nuclear translocation of cytoplasmic p53 and suppresses GGA-induced upregulation of PUMA mRNA levels in HuH-7 cells. Taken together, these data suggest that GGA treatment stimulates a nuclear translocation of mutant p53 through its dissociation from cytoplasmic aggregates, which may be essential for GGA-induced cell death.
