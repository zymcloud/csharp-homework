In this article, we have reviewed current literature regarding the regulation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by the interaction of malignant hepatocytes and their tissue environment through cytokine signaling, here represented by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling. We have discussed responses of TGF-β signaling in transition of hepatic stellate cells to myofibroblasts (MFBs), recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and enrichment of tumor-associated endothelial cells (TECs). The malignant hepatocytes also secrete various factors such as platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and TGF-β. TGF-β, a super-family of cytokines, creates tumor microenvironment by interacting through other growth factors (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), PDGF, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), VEGF), cytokines and chemokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Hence, the HCC tumor microenvironment may now be recognized as an important participant of tumor progression to act as potential target to systemic therapies compared to targeted therapies.
