Objectives:The incidence of malignancy is higher in solid-organ transplant recipients compared with the general population. In the present study, we present our experience with de novo malignancies encountered after both deceased-donor and living-donor liver transplants.Materials and methods:We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 335 patients who underwent an orthotopic liver transplant at our institution between September 2001 and December 2012 to identify subjects with de novo malignancies.Results:Fourteen patients (4.1%) developed de novo malignancies after liver transplant. De novo malignancies included lymphoproliferative disorders after liver transplant in 7 patients (treated with chemotherapy), thyroid papillary carcinoma in 1 patient (treated with total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine therapy), squamous cell carcinoma in 2 patients (treated with surgical resection), gastric stromal tumor in 1 patient (treated with surgical resection), ovarian carcinomas in 1 patient (treated with radical surgical resection and chemotherapy, who died within 1 year of diagnosis), lung cancer in 1 patient (treated with chemotherapy, but he had bone metastasis and died within 1 year of diagnosis), and neuroblastoma in 1 patient (treated with chemotherapy). In all patients, immunosuppression was changed to sirolimus.Conclusions:Transplant recipients generally have advanced stage cancers at the time of diagnosis with a poor prognosis. Because some neoplasms are common, early detection of cancer is important to decrease cancer-related mortality and morbidity.
