A 79-year-old man was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in 2000 and treated with partial hepatectomy. Intrahepatic carcinoma recurred with lung metastases 7 years later. Several transcatheter arterial chemoembolizations were performed to treat the recurrence, and a right lower lobectomy was performed for lung metastasis. Twelve years after the original carcinoma diagnosis, lip and lung metastases were detected, and he was hospitalized for radiotherapy of the lung metastasis; an oral molecular-targeting drug was initiated. During the therapy, hematochezia was observed, and a colonoscopy was performed. A submucosal lesion with a blood clot measuring approximately 4mm in diameter was found in the sigmoid colon, and endoscopic mucosal resection was performed. Furthermore, an elevated lesion with a 5-mm diameter recess was observed on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Both lesions were diagnosed histopathologically as hepatocellular carcinoma metastases.
