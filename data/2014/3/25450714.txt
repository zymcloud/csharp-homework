Liver transplantation is increasingly performed in selected HIV-infected patients in most developed countries, with excellent results reported in patients with liver diseases unrelated to HCV. In contrast, survival in HCV/HIV-coinfected liver recipients is poorer than in HCV-monoinfected patients, due to more aggressive recurrence of HCV and consequent graft loss and death. Results from American, French, and Spanish cohort studies showed a 5-year survival rate of only 50-55%. Therefore, it is debated whether liver transplantation should be offered to HCV/HIV-coinfected patients. Studies have shown that the variables more consistently associated with poor outcome are: (1) the use of old or HCV-positive donors, (2) dual liver-kidney transplantation, (3) recipients with very low body mass index and (4) less site experience. However, the most effective factor influencing transplantation outcome is the successful treatment of HCV recurrence with anti-HCV. Survival is 80% in patients whose HCV infection resolves. Unfortunately, the rates of sustained virological response with pegylated-interferon plus ribavirin in coinfected recipients are low, particularly for genotype 1 (only 10%). Here we present a non-systematic review of the literature based on our own experience in different liver transplant scenarios. This review covers selection criteria in HIV-infected patients, pre- and post-LT management, donor selection, anti-HCV treatment, drug interactions with antiretrovirals and anti-HCV direct antiviral agents, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver retransplantation. Recommendations are rated. Finally, we explain how the introduction of new effective and more tolerable direct antiviral agents may improve significantly the outcome of HCV/HIV-coinfected liver recipients.
