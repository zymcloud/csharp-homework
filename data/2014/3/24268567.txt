Objective:To compare chemotherapy first (group 1) versus self-expanding metal stent first (group 2) for the management of malignant dysphagia in unresectable oesophageal or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer.Methods:Patients from two university hospitals with severe malignant dysphagia (dysphagia score â‰¥ 2) uneligible for surgery or radiochemotherapy were evaluated retrospectively.Results:Forty-two patients were included in group 1, and 29 in group 2. After 4 weeks, dysphagia scores improved by at least 1 point in 67% of patients in group 1 versus 93% in group 2 (p=0.01); 48% of patients in group 1 were able to eat solid food versus 68% in group 2 (p=0.054). In group 1, a self-expanding metal stent was secondarily placed in 18 patients (42.9%), whereas in group 2 dysphagia required a second self-expanding metal stent placement in 33.3% of patients.Conclusion:Chemotherapy as the first treatment may be a valid option, avoiding self-expanding metal stent insertion in half of the patients.
