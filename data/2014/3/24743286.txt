A 73-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of appetite loss and weight loss in January 2009. Endoscopy showed an advanced type II gastric tumor at the middle of the gastric wall, and computed tomography showed multiple liver metastases. Immunohistological examination confirmed a diagnosis of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma which was chromogranin A(+), CD56(+), and synaptophysin(+). Oral administration of S-1(100mg/body)was given 5 days on and 2 days off, while cisplatin(CDDP 40 mg/body)was administered intravenously once every 2 weeks. The patient achieved a partial response(PR), and no serious adverse effects were observed. This case suggests that S-1/CDDP chemotherapy may be an effective treatment in patients with large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the stomach.
