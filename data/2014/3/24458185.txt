Tc-MAA uptake in the portal vein tumor thrombus may be a predictor of a favorable response to radioembolization. We report here 2 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and massive intrahepatic and extrahepatic tumor thrombus that showed Tc-MAA uptake in SPECT/CT, who underwent radioembolization with Y resin microspheres. The patients did not experience any adverse effects.
