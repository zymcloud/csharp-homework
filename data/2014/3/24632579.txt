Purpose:To evaluate the feasibility of applying R2* values to differentiate hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) from cavernous hemangiomas of the liver (CHL).Materials and methods:This retrospective study was approved by the participating Institutional Review Board and written informed consent for all subjects were obtained. Seventy-three patients with 79 pathologically identified HCCs and 65 patients with 91 clinically or pathologically identified CHLs were enrolled in this study. All subjects underwent a breath-hold multi-echo T2* weighted MR imaging on a 1.5 T clinical MR scanner. R2* values from HCC and CHL groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney non-parametric U test. A cut-off value of R2* was evaluated with receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis.Results:The mean R2* value was 23.32 ± 12.23 Hz (95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.58 Hz, 26.06 Hz) for the HCC group, and 3.66 ± 2.37 Hz (95% CI: 3.17 Hz, 4.15 Hz) for the CHL group. The mean R2* value for HCC was significantly higher than that of CHL (pConclusions:R2* is a significant MRI biomarker to differentiate HCC from CHL with satisfying sensitivity and specificity.
