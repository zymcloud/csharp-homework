Background and study aims:Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common clinical condition associated with obesity and considered as possible precursor of more serious disease like Non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. There is very little research work carried concerning NAFLD in African countries in relation to prevalence and risk factors. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of NAFLD and risk factors among asymptomatic co-patients accompanying patients admitted to gastroenterology wards at the National Centre for GI & Liver Diseases, Ibn Sina Hospital (Khartoum, Sudan).Patients and methods:Subjects with liver disease, excess alcohol intake (the intake of more than 21 units of alcohol per week for men and 14 units for women per week) and pregnancy were excluded from this study. The age, sex, body mass index (BMI), history and duration of diabetes and hypertension were recorded. Ultrasound was offered followed by clinical examination and blood sample was taken for assessment of liver function from each subject (total number of participants was 100).Results:NAFLD was diagnosed in 20 patients, giving prevalence of 20%. There was no statistical significance between the two sexes. The mean age of subjects with NAFLD was 53 years old and without NAFLD was 40 years (pConclusion:The estimated prevalence of NAFLD in our study is 20% and this figure is comparable to the prevalence of NAFLD in Asian countries. Males and females were nearly equally affected and the prevalence of NAFLD increased with age and BMI, making obesity a main risk factor.
