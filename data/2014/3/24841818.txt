Objective:To investigate characterization of human lacrimal adenoid cystic carcinoma line LACC and establish a model of human LACC.Methods:Experimental research. Human LACC cells were injected into subcutaneous tissue of nude mice. The length (L) and width (W) of the tumor were measured every day after injection of LACC cells, and the tumor volume was calculated as L×W(2)×1/2. Two mice bearing LACC tumor were randomly killed, removed the tumors anatomy and their lungs, livers, and lymph nodes of oxter, 14, 28, 35, 42, 49 days after injection of LACC cells. Histologic examination, immunohistochemical analysis for Keratin,Vimentin,α-SMA, S-100, Desmin, PCR analysis for human β-actin and electron microscopy were performed. Whether tumor metastasis to lungs, livers and lymph nodes of oxter were observed by hematoxylin-cosin staining method.Results:Heterotransplanted tumors were observed in all 10 mice after injection of LACC cells. The results of HE staining and transmission electron microscope indicated that heterotransplanted tumor possesses typical histological characterization of epithelial carcinoma. The results of immunohistochemistry showed that keratin, S-100, Vimentin, α-SMA expression in tumor tissue were positive, but Desmin expression were negative. RT-PCR analysis revealed that tumors expressed human β-actin, indicating their human origin. Histologic examination show that tumors didn't metastasize to lung, liver and lymph node.Conclusions:Human LACC cell line possesses characterization of malignant carcinoma and also possesses characterization of adenoid cystic carcinoma. It is found that the heterotransplanted LACC tumor has histologic features similar to the original LACC of the patient. This model with lacrimal cystic adenoid carcinoma in nude mice is relatively easy, quick, and especially with high successful rate. So it can be considered as an ideal animal model for study on lacrimal cystic adenoid carcinoma in vivo.
