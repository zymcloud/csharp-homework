The association of aberrant expression of Kindlin-2 with tumor progression has been reported in recent years. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of Kindlin-2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to evaluate its clinical and prognostic significance. The mRNA and protein levels of Kindlin-2 in HCC and adjacent non-cancerous tissues were examined by real-time PCR and western blotting. The relationships between Kindlin-2 expression, clinicopathological features and postoperative survival of HCC patients were also evaluated. Kindlin-2 expression was higher in HCC tissues as compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues at both mRNA and protein levels (P
