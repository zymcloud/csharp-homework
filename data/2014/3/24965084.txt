Primary pancreatic hepatoid carcinoma (PHC) is extremely rare, resembling hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in terms of morphology and immunohistochemical features. Hepatoid carcinoma can present in other organs, most noticeably in the stomach. PHC is present in two forms either a pure form like HCC or admixed with other histologic tumor components characteristic of the underlying primary site (endocrine tumors, ductal, or acinar adenocarcinomas). Here, we report a 69-year-old male patient with distal pancreatic mass incidentally found during a CT scan workup for a pulmonary nodule suspicious for metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma. We described the clinical, cytological, and histological finding and conducted a literature review.
