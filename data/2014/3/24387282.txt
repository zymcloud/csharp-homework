Introduction:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease (CLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. More than 350 million people are at risk for HCC, and with few treatment options available, therapeutic approaches to targets other than the virus polymerase will be needed. This review suggests that the HBV-encoded X protein, HBx, would be an outstanding target because it contributes to the biology and pathogenesis of HBV in three fundamental ways.Areas covered:First, HBx is a trans-activating protein that stimulates virus gene expression and replication, thereby promoting the development and persistence of the carrier state. Second, HBx partially blocks the development of immune responses that would otherwise clear the virus, and protects infected hepatocytes from immune-mediated destruction. Thus, HBx contributes to the development of CLD without virus clearance. Third, HBx alters patterns of host gene expression that make possible the emergence of HCC. The selected literature cited is from the National Library of Medicine (Pubmed and Medline).Expert opinion:Understanding the mechanisms, whereby HBx supports virus replication and promotes pathogenesis, suggests that HBx will be an important therapeutic target against both virus replication and CLD aimed at the chemoprevention of HCC.
