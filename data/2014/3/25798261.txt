Managing extrahepatic recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is crucial for improving prognosis. The present study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of using combination therapy with S-1 and interferon (IFN)- α in HCC patients with lung metastasis. Of the 646 patients who underwent radical surgery for HCC at our institute, 62 developed their first distant metastasis in the lung. Among these patients, 11 received S-1 combination therapy, while the remaining 51 patients received other conventional therapy, such as 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin or best supportive care. We retrospectively evaluated the toxicity and efficiency of combination therapy with S-1 and IFN- α. Hematological toxicity was observed in 5 patients and was grade 1 or 2 in all cases, except 1 patient (9.1%) who developed grade 3 leukopenia. Non-hematological toxicity was observed in 6 patients and was grade 1 in all cases, except 1 patient who exhibited a grade 2 increase of serum bilirubin levels. No patient required discontinuation of the S-1 combination therapy and no treatment-related mortality was reported during this study. Patients who received S-1 treatment exhibited significantly better survival after distant recurrence (SADR) compared to those without S-1 treatment (3-year survival rate, 81.8 vs. 43.1%, respectively; P=0.014). The multivariate analysis revealed that the S-1 treatment was prognostically significant for SADR (P=0.0091; hazard ratio = 0.343). In conclusion, combination therapy with S-1 and IFN- α may be efficient for HCC patients with lung metastasis.
