Background and aim:There is limited data on the efficacy and outcome of telbivudine (LdT) therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B and compensated cirrhosis. We evaluated LdT as first-line therapy in these patients and compared with those treated with entecavir (ETV).Methods:We consecutively enrolled 88 chronic hepatitis B patients with compensated cirrhosis primarily treated with LdT at least for 2 years or less than 2 years but developed resistance, and evaluated the efficacy and clinical outcomes. Meanwhile, we matched a control group who treated with ETV for comparison.Results:In LdT group, alanine aminotransferase normalization (65.8%), hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion (39.8%), hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA undetectablility (71.6%), and virologic resistance (23.9%) were noted after 2 years treatment. Compared with ETV group, there were significant difference in HBV DNA undetectablility (P Conclusions:These results indicated that although LdT and ETV are similar in clinical outcomes for patients with HBV-related compensated cirrhosis, LdT still had lower HBV undetectablility and higher resistant rate after 2 years treatment, which was a challenge for being as first-line therapy in these patients who need lifelong therapy.
