Objectives:Patients infected with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) are at greater risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The objective of this study was to identify virus-specific serum microRNA profiles associated with liver function and disease progression. Microarray analysis of serum microRNAs was performed using the Toray 3D array system in 22 healthy subjects, 42 HBV patients, and 30 HCV patients. Selected microRNAs were then validated by qRT-PCR in 186 HBV patients, 107 HCV patients, and 22 healthy subjects.Results:Microarray analysis showed up-regulation of a number of microRNAs in serum of both HBV and HCV patients. In qRT-PCR analysis, miR-122, miR-99a, miR-125b, miR-720, miR-22, and miR-1275 were up-regulated both in HBV patients relative to healthy subjects, and all except miR-1275 were up-regulated in HBeAg-positive patients relative to HBeAg-negative patients. Specific microRNAs were independently associated with different aspects of HBV infection. MiR-122 was independently associated with HBV DNA level, whereas miR-125b was independently associated with levels of HBV DNA, HBsAg, and HBeAg. MiR-22 and miR-1275 were independently associated with serum Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase levels.Conclusions:Serum microRNA levels reflect differences in the etiology and stage of viral hepatitis.
