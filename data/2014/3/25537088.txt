Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) is an oncogenic enzyme promoting transformation, proliferation, and angiogenesis of a number of human tumors. However, its effect on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) behavior has not been fully clarified. The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation between HCC and SphK1, and to evaluate the effect of SphK1 inhibitor N,N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS) in HCC. The expression of SphK1 was measured in tissue samples from 76 HCC and paired adjacent noncancerous liver tissues (NT) by immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time PCR, and Western blotting analysis. The effect of DMS was tested on HCC cells by evaluating cell viability in vitro. Transwell cell migration and invasion assay were carried out for functional analysis. Furthermore, Western blotting analysis was performed to examine the impact of DMS on the PI3K/Akt/NF-kB signaling. High expression of Sphk1 was observed in 84.21% (64/76) of the HCC versus 15.79% (12/76) of the adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues; the difference of Sphk1 expression between HCC and the adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues was statistically significant (P
