Background:The interaction between Siglec-10 and its ligand, CD24, selectively represses tissue damage-caused immune responses. However, the nature of Siglec-10 and CD24 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still poorly defined. Hereon, the expression, function, and regulation of CD24 and Siglec-10 in HCC were investigated in the present study.Methods:Flow cytometry was performed to examine the expression of Siglec-10 in HCC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues of HCC patients. To further determine whether Siglec-10 expression is associated with the clinical characteristics and survival, conventional immunohistochemistry was performed in 96 HCC patients. Additionally, the role of Siglec-10 in the regulation of natural killer (NK) cell dysfunction was evaluated. Finally, CD24 expression in HCC was also assessed.Results:Siglec-10 was expressed most on NK cells in HCC (40.7 ± 4.5%). Compared with surrounding non-tumor tissues, tumor tissues had higher Siglec-10 expression (31.0 ± 1.7% versus 40.7 ± 4.5%, n = 10, P Conclusions:These findings suggest that Siglec-10 is associated with decreased survival and impaired NK cell function in human HCC. This process may function via the CD24-Siglec-10 interaction, which may represent a therapeutic target in HCC patients.
