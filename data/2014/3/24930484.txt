Background & aims:Liver stiffness (LS) value using transient elastography is a reliable, non-invasive tool for assessing liver fibrosis. LS-based prediction model, LSPS (=LS value Ã— spleen diameter/platelet count) is well correlated with the risk of developing portal hypertension-related cirrhotic complications. Here, we assessed the prognostic performance of LSPS in predicting the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Methods:Between 2006 and 2010, we recruited 227 patients with CHB who underwent liver biopsy and LS measurement. The major end point was HCC development.Results:Median age was 45 years and 156 (68.7%) patients were male. During the follow-up period (median, 61 months), HCC developed in 18 patients. Patient with HCC had a higher LS value, a longer spleen, and lower platelet counts (all P 2.5), the 5-year cumulative risk of HCC increased significantly in association with a higher LSPS value (4.0, 13.8, 36.2%, respectively, P 2.5 (HR 8.7, P = 0.002) had a higher risk of developing HCC than those with LSPS Conclusions:LS value-spleen diameter to platelet ratio score is useful for assessing the risk of HCC development and careful surveillance strategies are required in an individual manner.
