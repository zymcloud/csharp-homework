Backgrounds & aims:Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHC-CC), a malignant liver tumour with poor prognosis, is composed of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CC) and diverse components with intermediate features between HCC and CC, which correspond to hepatic progenitor cells. According to the WHO classification 2010, we surveyed the prevalence and clinicopathological significance of each subtype with stem-cell features [SC subtype; typical subtype (TS), intermediate cell subtype (INT) and cholangiolocellular type (CLC)] in cHC-CC and HCC.Methods:Sixty-two patients with cHC-CC (19 women and 43 men) and 26 patients with HCC (all men) were examined. The prevalence of each component was histologically assessed with assistance of mucin and immunohistochemical stainings.Results:SC subtypes were observed in all cHC-CCs in various amount and combination. The prevalence of each SC subtype in cHC-CC was as follows: TS, 10 (16.1%); INT, 53 (83.9%) and CLC, 44 (71.0%). The proportion of INT was significantly correlated with gender (female-dominant) (P Conclusion:The proportion of each SC subtype was significantly associated with certain clinicopathological factors, suggesting different properties of each SC subtypes.
