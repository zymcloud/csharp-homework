Background:Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is overexpressed in many types of cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Meloxicam, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, has shown potential therapeutic effects against HCC, but the mechanisms accounting for its anti-cancer activities remain unclear.Methods and findings:Meloxicam inhibited the ability of human HCC cells expressing higher levels of COX-2 to migrate, invade, adhere and form colonies through upregulating the expression of E-cadherin and downregulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -2. Meloxicam induced cell apoptosis by upregulating pro-apoptotic proteins including Bax and Fas-L, and downregulating anti-apoptotic proteins including survivin and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), through inhibiting phosphorylation of AKT. Addition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), the major product of COX-2, could abrogate the effects of meloxicam on the expression of survivin and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), but not Bax and Fas-L, indicating that meloxicam induces cell apoptosis via both COX-2-dependent and -independent pathways. Meloxicam also induced cell autophagy by upregulating Beclin 1 and light chain 3-II. Specific inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine and chloroquine had little effect on cell apoptosis but could enhance the pro-apoptotic effects of meloxicam by further upregulating the expression of Bax.Conclusions:Meloxicam executes its antitumor effects by targeting the COX-2/MMP-2/E-cadherin, AKT, apoptotic and autophagic pathways in COX-2-dependent and -independent pathways, and inhibition of cell autophagy could help to overcome the resistance to meloxicam-induced apoptosis in HCC.
