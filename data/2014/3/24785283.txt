Objective:The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment and prognosis of advanced urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (AUCB).Methods:The clinicopathological data of 117 patients with AUCB admitted in our hospital from 1998 to 2009 were reviewed. All patients received first-line chemotherapy. The survival rate was calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test.Results:The median age of all patients was 56 years and the male-to-female ratio was 3.33:1. Their 6-, 12-, 24-, 36- and 60-month survival rates were 90.3%, 61.3%, 32.3%, 24.2% and 8.1%, respectively. In the first-line chemotherapy regimen, the effectiveness rate of gemcitabine + platinum drugs was 49.3% (37/75), the median progression-free survival(PFS) was 7.9 months and overall survival (OS) was 18.7 months. The effectiveness of cyclophosphamide + epirubicin + platinum drug regimen was 45.5% (10/22), Median PFS was 7.1 months and OS was 15.3 months. The effectiveness of paclitaxel + platinum drug regimen was 47.1% (8/17), median PFS was 6.5 months and OS was 13.7 months. Among them, the effectiveness rate of the gemcitabine + cisplatin regimen in 67 patients was 47.8%, the median PFS was 7.0 months and OS was 15.3 months. In the 13 patients who received paclitaxel + carboplatin regimen, the effectiveness rate was 53.8%, median PFS was 7.7 months and OS was 16.0 months. The major side effects were leucopenia and thrombocytopenia, mostly were tolerable, of grade I to II.Conclusions:In advanced unresectable and metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, GC regimen is recognized as a standard first-line chemotherapy, with a higher effectiveness and tolerable side effects. Taxane and molecular targeted drugs may further improve the therapeutic effect of the treatment of advanced urothelial carcinomas of the bladder in the future.
