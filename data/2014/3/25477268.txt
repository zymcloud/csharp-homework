Background:In the current era of total mesorectal excision, local relapse remains a main cause of recurrence. Although standard treatment for locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) has not been established, R0 resection represents the only potentially curative treatment. However, extended surgery accompanying bony pelvic resection is technically demanding and is still challenging.Methods:Studied were 35 patients with LRRC who underwent combined resection of bony pelvis between August 2006 and October 2013. Safety and prognostic factors for survival were analyzed. Median follow-up was 33 months.Results:Sacrectomy was performed in 32 patients and 3 patients underwent combined resection of the pubis and ischium. The dominant operative procedure was total pelvic exenteration in 30 (86%) patients. R0 resection was achieved in 27 (77%) patients. No patients died. Pelvic sepsis was the most frequent complication (40%). Recurrence developed in 20 (57%), with the lung the most frequent site (10 patients). Three-year local relapse-free survival (LRFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 72.1% and 32.7%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, R1 resection was the only independent risk factor for local recurrence (p = 0.010), and concomitant liver metastasis and initial non sphincter-preserving surgery were independent predictors of worse DFS (p = 0.008 and p = 0.042, respectively).Conclusions:Aggressive surgical treatment combined with bony resection for carefully selected patients with LRRC was safe with a high rate of R0 resection and favorable LRFS. However, DFS was not satisfactory even after R0 resection and the main cause was lung metastasis. Preventing distant recurrence might be a key to improve survival.
