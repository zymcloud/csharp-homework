Introduction:Liver cancer is one of the most common cancers. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents > 90% of primary liver cancers and is a major global health problem today. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is associated with more than half of HCCs.Areas covered:Long-term therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs) improves outcomes in HBV-infected patients by slowing the progression of liver disease. It is associated with improvements in histological and clinical outcomes, improved patient survival, reduced need for liver transplantation and improved liver function in patients with decompensated liver disease. This review highlights the results of previous studies conducted on HCC prevention with long-term NUC therapy. Studies include the use of all available drugs in different clinical scenarios, and the comparison between treated and untreated patients.Expert opinion:NUCs have been studied extensively in HCC prevention. A comprehensive review of the literature has shown that they can be safely and effectively used for this purpose. Despite some discrepancies between studies, most of the evidence favors using NUC therapy for HCC prevention.
