Studies have highlighted important features of the nucleocytoplasmic transport of mRNAs and proteins. Nuclear RNA export factor 3 (NXF3) is a member of the nuclear RNA export factor family that plays a role in mediating the export of cellular mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for translation. However, little is known about the clinical significance of NXF3 in human tumors. To evaluate the prognostic significance of NXF3 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the expression levels of NXF3 in a cohort of 112 patients with primary HCC who had undergone hepatectomy for histologically confirmed HCC were assessed by immunohistochemistry. It was identified that the expression levels of NXF3 were higher in the primary HCC tissues compared with those in paired peritumoral liver tissues. The overexpression of NXF3 in the HCC tissues was correlated with decreased survival time [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.954, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.034-3.695, P=0.039] and earlier tumor recurrence (HR = 2.101, 95% CI = 1.186-3.722, P=0.011) in postoperative patients with HCC. Notably, overexpression of NXF3 was correlated with a poor survival time and increased recurrence following HCC resection in male patients (P=0.020 and P=0.007, respectively) but not in female patients (P=0.916 and P=0.821, respectively). In conclusion, the findings provide evidence that implicates NXF3 as a prospective predictor of HCC prognosis as well as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment.
