Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a worldwide neoplasm for which early diagnosis is difficult and the prognosis is usually poor. Overexpression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) has been suggested to be associated with hepatocarcinogenesis. Although several COX-2 inhibitors have been used in hepatoma therapy, the genetic background between COX-2 and HCC remains largely unknown. In this study, the association of genotypic polymorphisms in COX-2 with HCC was investigated. 25 healthy individuals served as control (group I), group II: 50 HCV infection patients without any complications, group III: 50 HCV infected patients complicated with cirrhosis and group IV: 75 HCV infected patients complicated with (45 localized and 30 metastatic) HCC from Zagazig University Hospital in Egypt were genotyped by a PCR-RFLP method. The results showed that, no differences in distribution between the HCC and other groups were found. We found -1195A allele carriers had a higher risk of HCC with HCV infection. As regard the obtained results of serum AFU, a significant increase was detected in HCC as compared with cirrhosis, hepatitis and healthy control groups (p In conclusion:identification of SNP in COX-2 gene promoter and evaluation of serum AFU and AFP give a red light in early detection of HCC which may be reduce its fatal incidence.
