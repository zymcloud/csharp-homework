Occult hepatitis B (OHB) infection has been reported to play an important role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this systematic review, a significantly higher prevalence of OHB was observed in patients with HCC in the presence or absence of HCV infection when compared with control populations without HCC. Correspondingly, among adequately designed prospective studies, the cumulative probability of developing HCC was significantly greater among patients with OHB than among HBV DNA-negative patients in the presence or absence of HCV infection. Study design, inclusion criteria, treatment options, methodology and potential confounding variables were evaluated, and immunopathogenic mechanisms that could be involved in OHB as a risk factor in HCC were reviewed. From this analysis, we conclude that although OHB is an independent risk factor in HCC development in anti-HCV-negative patients, a synergistic or additive role in the occurrence of HCC in HCV-coinfected patients is more problematic due to the HCC risk attributable to HCV alone, especially in patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.
