The objective of this study was to explore the effects of dendritic cells (DCs) from hepatitis B virus (HBV) transgenic mice-stimulated autologous lymphocytes on in vitro HBV replication. DCs from HBV transgenic mice were induced to maturity by lipopolysaccharide, followed by incubation with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) in vitro. Mature DCs and autologous lymphocytes were co-stimulated to form specific sensitized immune effector cells (IEC), which were then co-cultured with the human hepatoma cell line HepG2.2.15. Changes in morphology and activity of hepatocytes were then observed, as well as analysis of changes in liver enzyme, and HBV DNA and inflammatory cytokine levels in the culture supernatant. Intracellular HBV DNA and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) concentration were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Co-stimulation by mature DCs and IEC showed no impact on the morphology and liver enzyme expression level of HepG2.2.15 cells, but the supernatant HBV DNA and intracellular HBV DNA and cccDNA levels decreased significantly compared with those cells co-cultured with immature DCs. Secretion of inflammatory cytokines in the supernatant showed that when HBV DNA was highly expressed, the concentration of IFN-γ and IL-2 decreased, while IL-10 increased. Contrastingly, when HBV DNA had low expression, the concentration of IFN-γ and IL-2 increased and IL-10 decreased. Co-stimulation of HBV-related antigen-induced mature DCs and autologous lymphocytes showed inhibitory effects on ex vivo HBV replication, and cytokines were suggested to mediate this effect.
