The spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) has been reported as a novel biomarker for human hepatocellular carcinoma, but the functional contributions of its two isoforms SYK(L) and SYK(S) are undefined. In this study, we investigated their biologic functions and possible prognostic values in hepatocellular carcinoma. SYK(L) was downregulated in 38% of human specimens of hepatocellular carcinoma examined, whereas SYK(S) was detectable in 40% of these specimens but not in normal liver tissue samples without cirrhosis. SYK(S) expression correlated with pathologic parameters characteristic of tumor metastasis, including multiple tumors (P = 0.003) and vascular invasion (P = 0.001). Further, SYK(S) was specifically associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatocellular carcinoma specimens. Functional studies showed that SYK(S) promoted tumor growth, suppressed apoptosis, and induced EMT through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, countering the opposite effects of SYK(L). Patients with SYK(L(+)/S(-)) tumors exhibited longer overall survival and time to recurrence than those with SYK(L(-)/S(-)) or SYK(L(+)/S(+)) tumors (P
