Purpose:To investigate the clinicopathological features and postoperative survival of patients with mucinous colorectal carcinoma (MC) and to identify the factors related to long-term survival.Methods:Twenty-three patients who had undergone resection for MC at Miyazaki University Hospital from 1991 to 2006 were followed up for at least 5 years or until death. The effects of the clinicopathological variables on the 5-year cancer-specific survival were assessed by the univariate analyses. These patients' clinicopathological data were compared with those of 403 non-mucinous carcinoma (NMC) patients (102 well-differentiated adenocarcinomas, 301 moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas).Results:The 5-year cancer-specific survival rate was significantly worse in MC (56.2 %) than in NMC (73.8 %; p = 0.008) cases. Univariate analyses showed the T factor, lymph node metastases, liver metastases, metastases to the distant peritoneum, remote metastases and curative resection to be significant factors predicting the survival. However, there were no significant differences in the postoperative survival in patients with stage II-IV disease. The rates of metastases to the distant peritoneum, M1, T4, a tumor size â‰¥5 cm and non-curative resection were higher in MC than in NMC patients.Conclusions:Patients with MC had advanced stage cancer, especially with metastases to the distant peritoneum, more frequently than did the patients with NMC. To improve the survival of these patients, it is therefore important to detect MC at an early stage and to perform curative resection.
