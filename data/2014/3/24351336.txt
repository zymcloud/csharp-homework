The failure of EGFR inhibitors in colorectal tumors with KRAS mutations requires the development of alternative treatment strategies for this patient subgroup. Among the hallmarks of cancer the disturbed immunosurveillance and cancer immune evasion have become emerging targets for cancer therapy. Due to their pleiotropic functions immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) are interesting agents for combination therapies in solid tumors. However, their possible contribution and a way of monitoring their biological effects have yet to be revealed. In a heavily pretreated patient with advanced colorectal cancer carrying mutations in APC and KRAS genes, we show an early metabolic response and enhanced NK cell activity to monotherapy with lenalidomide. After subsequent lenalidomide/cetuximab combination treatment, the patient had progressive disease. At the same time a reduced performance status, complicated by febrile neutropenia, occurred, as well as a slight increase in metabolic activity. Concordantly NK cell activity dropped back to baseline. Thus, laboratory measurements and metabolic response assessment correlated with clinical conditions. This case report describes the feasibility and potential of a functional assessment of patient derived immune competent cells in combination with functional imaging for the detection of a biological response.
