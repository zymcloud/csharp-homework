Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) is involved in important biological processes including cell invasion, metastasis, and carcinogenesis. However, its clinical significance has remained largely unknown in hepatocellular carcinoma.

A clinicopathological study revealed that AEG-1 expression level in tumor cells was significantly correlated with TNM stage (P = 0.001) and Edmonson grade (P
