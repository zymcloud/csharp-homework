Objective:To explore the effects of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) on human liver cancer stem cells (HepG2) and cell proliferation of HepG2 and Nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line (CNE1).Methods:The pEGFP-N1/CTCF, CTCF-shRNA and GFP-shRNA plasmids were constructed and transfected into HepG2 and CNE1 cells, and RT-PCR or Western blot were performed to detect the mRNA or protein levels of CTCF. The subpopulation of CD90+ cancer stem cells in HepG2 cells transfected with CTCF-shRNA plasmid or GFP-shRNA plasmid (as transfection control) were assayed by flow cytometry with the wild type HepG2 cells as control. Proliferation of cells transfected with CTCF-overexpression or CTCF-shRNA plasmid was evaluated by MTT assay.Results:The levels of both mRNA and protein of CTCF were increased in pEGFP-N1/CTCF transfected HepG2 and CNE1 cells compared to that in pEGFP-N1 transfected cells (P 0.05).Conclusion:CTCF inhibits human liver cancer stem cells but no effect on cell proliferation.
