In previous studies, we confirmed that mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) induced apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. However, the exact molecular mechanism remained unclear. Mfn2 expressed lower in tumour tissues, compared with adjacent non-cancer tissues. Furthermore, Mfn2 immunostaining was very weak in HCC tissue (P
