Objective:Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a rare primary liver tumor, which significantly differs from conventional HCC. This article reviews the molecular cytogenetics, pathology, imaging features, and management of this relatively rare tumor.Conclusion:Fibrolamellar HCC predominantly occurs in young patients without underlying hepatitis or cirrhosis. Serum Î±-fetoproteins are not elevated in most cases, and hence imaging plays an important role in diagnosis, staging, and surveillance.
