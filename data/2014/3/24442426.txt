We aimed to elucidate whether serum VEGFR2 concentration before and after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) can predict survival in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Serum VEGFR2 concentrations were serially measured in 169 patients with advanced HCC before and after TACE. We defined a decrease in the serum VEGFR2 level>10% from the pretreatment level as response. Serum VEGFR2 concentrations decreased in 44 (26.0%) patients at week 4. Patients who had a VEGFR2 response at week 4 had a longer median survival than those who did not have a VEGFR2 decrease (19.0 vs. 9.8 months, p
