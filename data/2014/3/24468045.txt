Purpose:To determine any differences in patient characteristics and outcomes after transarterial chemoembolization between different viral etiologies of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:This retrospective study consisted of 201 patients undergoing first-time transarterial chemoembolization for unresectable HCC from January to December 2009. The patients were divided into four groups: hepatitis B virus (HBV) only (n = 104), hepatitis C virus (HCV) only (n = 63), HBV and HCV (n = 10), and no viral hepatitis (n = 24). The clinical and laboratory data were obtained from electronic medical records, and imaging findings obtained before transarterial chemoembolization were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to assess the impact of HBV or HCV status, clinical characteristics, and imaging results on overall survival.Results:After a median follow-up of 28.3 months Â± 16.2, the 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival rates were 74.1%, 59.7%, and 53.2%. Patients with HBV had a significant association with younger age (P = .001), higher male-to-female ratio (P = .003), lower alanine aminotransferase levels (P = .018), higher albumin levels (P = .009), and multifocal tumors at diagnosis (P = .04) compared with patients with HCV. Patients with both HBV and HCV had significantly higher serum bilirubin levels compared with the other groups (P = .002). No significant difference was found in overall survival among the different hepatitis groups (P = .943). Multivariate analysis showed that statistically significant determinants for overall survival were Child-Pugh class (P = .002), Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage (P Conclusions:Viral etiology has no correlation with the outcome of patients with HCC undergoing transarterial chemoembolization.
