Autophagy is a critical intracellular pathway which maintains cellular function by lysosomal degradation of damaged proteins and organelles besides elimination of invading pathogens. Its primary function is to prevent cell death. Autophagy has diverse physiological functions namely; starvation adaptation, prevention of tumorigenesis, energy homeostasis, intracellular quality control and degradation of abnormal intracellular protein aggregates. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of autophagy has given key insights into the pathogenesis of various diseases like Non Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis, Hepatitis B and C infections, Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and hepatocellular carcinoma. Pharmacological modulation of autophagy may have a therapeutic potential in management of these liver diseases.
