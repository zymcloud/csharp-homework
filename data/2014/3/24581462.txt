Purpose:To evaluate the characteristics of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) fed by the right renal capsular artery and to assess the tumor response and complications in patients treated with transarterial therapy via the renal capsular arteries with or without other extrahepatic arteries and/or intrahepatic arteries.Materials and methods:Between March 2006 and May 2012, 24 lesions in 19 patients were treated by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (23 sessions), transcatheter arterial embolization (two sessions), or transcatheter arterial infusion (one session), with HCCs fed by the right renal capsular artery with or without intrahepatic arteries and/or other collateral arteries. Other intrahepatic lesions were concurrently treated if needed.Results:Tumor size ranged from 10 mm to 107 mm (mean, 30.5 mm). Of the 24 tumors, 12 were located in segment VI, 10 in segment VII, one in the posterior segment, and one in the anterior segment after posterior segment resection. Severe complication occurred in four patients: liver abscess (n = 2), pleural effusion (n = 1), and duodenal ulcer (n = 1). Pleural effusion might be related to chemoembolization via the right renal capsular artery. A complete response was obtained in six sessions and a partial response in eight; 10 sessions were associated with stable disease and two with progressive disease.Conclusions:Precise renal capsular artery knowledge would facilitate successful and safe transarterial therapy for HCCs fed by the renal capsular arteries.
