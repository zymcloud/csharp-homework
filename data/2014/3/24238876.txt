Aim:To assess the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of percutaneous cryoablation for the treatment of liver metastases from breast cancer.Materials and methods:This study included 39 liver metastases in 17 female breast cancer patients who underwent computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous cryoablation. The mean age of the cohort was 55 years (range 30-66 years). The tumour response was evaluated by CT performed before treatment, 1 month after treatment, and every 3 months thereafter. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) was used to assess the patients' quality of life before, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after cryoablation. The primary endpoints were technique effectiveness, quality of life, and complications.Results:The technical success rate was 92% with no major complication reported. At the 1-month follow-up, the primary technique effectiveness was 87.1% (34 of 39 tumours). At the 3-months follow-up, local tumour progression was observed in six of 39 lesions (15.4%). The 1-year survival from the time of cryoablation was 70.6%. The quality of life symptoms and functioning scales were preserved in patients alive at 3 months after cryoablation. The global quality of life, mean value of "pain" and "fatigue" between 3 months after cryoablation and prior to treatment showed statistically significant differences, but no clinical significance.Conclusions:Cryoablation is a safe and effective ablative therapy, providing a high rate of local tumour control in breast cancer liver metastases.
