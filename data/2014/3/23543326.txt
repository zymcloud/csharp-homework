Background:Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) responds poorly to conventional systemic therapies. Therefore, new effective therapy strategies are urgently needed. Molecular targeted therapies have entered the field of anti-neoplastic treatment and are being used on their own and in combination with other drugs. Sorafenib inhibits proliferation and angiogenesis of HCC by suppressing the Raf serine/threonine kinases and the receptor tyrosine kinases. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has shown activity in a variety of solid tumors, including HCC. However, the precise anti-proliferative mechanisms of these agents remain unclear.Methods:We treated human hepatoma cell lines (Huh7 and Hep3B) and immortalized human hepatocyte (OUMS29) with sorafenib and/or proteasome inhibitors, including epoxomicin and acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal. Cytotoxic effects were examined by morphometric analyses of apoptosis and necrosis. Apoptosis was also evaluated by Western blotting of keratin18, PARP and caspase3. The activity of Akt and stress-activated protein kinases was examined by Western blotting.Results:Both sorafenib and proteasome inhibitors induced apoptosis in Huh7 and OUMS29. However, sorafenib attenuated proteasome inhibitor-induced apoptosis. Sorafenib induced necrosis, especially in combination with proteasome inhibitors. Sorafenib induced down-regulation of Akt synergistically in combination with proteasome inhibitors in Huh7. Sorafenib inhibited both the JNK and p38 pathways in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In addition, sorafenib also inhibited proteasome inhibitor-mediated JNK and p38 activation in both Huh7 and OUMS29.Conclusions:Sorafenib enhances the anti-proliferative effect of proteasome inhibitors in part by inactivating the Akt signaling pathway and modulating stress-activated protein kinases. The combination of these agents could be an ideal molecular targeted therapy for HCC.
