Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of multiple cellular processes, and the aberrant miRNAs expressions have been observed in different types of cancer including HCC. Their pathysiologic role and their relevance to tumorigenesis are still largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated the down-regulation of miR-424 in HCC cell lines and tissues by quantitative RT-PCR analyses. Overexpression of miR-424 reduced the HCC cell prolifetation, migration, and invasion. Conversely, inhibiton of miR-424 expression significantly accelerated the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In addition, we further identified c-Myb as a functional downstream target of miR-424 by directly targeting the 3'UTR of c-Myb. Furthermore, overexpression of c-Myb impaired miR-424-induced inhibition of proliferation and invasion in HCC cells. Our results demonstrated that miR-424 was involved in tumorigenesis of HCC at least in part by suppression of c-Myb.
