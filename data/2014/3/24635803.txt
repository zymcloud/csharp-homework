Hepatocellular carcinoma with prominent fatty change is rare, and to date only a few cases have been reported. In this article, we present a 57-yearold woman who underwent a liver transplant for hepatocellular carcinoma. Ten months after liver transplant, she presented with a persistent cough. Computed tomography of the chest was performed, revealing a solid lung mass that measured 1 Ã— 0.9 cm in the right inferior lobe. Right inferior lobectomy was performed, and the final diagnosis was noted as hepatocellular carcinoma with prominent fatty change. Fatty change was extensive in the tumor; therefore, lipoid pneumonia was the first condition that was considered in the differential diagnosis during examination of the lobectomy material. For the differential diagnosis, the immunohistochemistry panel was studied to show the hepatocellular nature of the tumor. Although metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma to the lungs is expected, hepatocellular carcinoma with prominent fatty change can cause diagnostic difficulties, such as lipoid pneumonia, especially in small lung biopsies.
