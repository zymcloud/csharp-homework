Liver cirrhosis (LC) is a critical stage of chronic liver disease, including that caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV). In the absence of antiviral therapy, 67%-91% of patients with HCV-related LC patients die of liver-related causes, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver failure. Among the therapeutic strategies used to prevent liver-related complications in these patients is standard therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, which induces a sustained virological response (SVR) in 25% of HCV genotype 1-infected patients and in 69% of patients infected with genotypes 2 and 3. SVR in patients with HCV-related LC has been associated with reduced rates of hepatic decompensation, HCC, and mortality. More recently developed direct-acting antiviral agents have shown excellent antiviral efficacy, with preliminary data demonstrating that an interferon-free regimen that includes these direct-acting antiviral agents achieved SVR in more than 50% of patients with HCV genotype 1 LC. Branched-chain amino acid supplementation, improvement of insulin resistance, and the use of Î²-blockers for portal hypertension may also reduce liver-related complications. Here, we review advances in antiviral and adjunctive therapies for improved outcomes in patients with HCV-associated LC.
