Aim:To explore the characteristics of multi-slice computed tomography (CT) manifestations of hepatic epithelioid angiomyolipoma (HEA), improve the rate of accurate diagnosis, and reduce the misdiagnostic rate.Methods:The multi-slice CT manifestations in five patients who were diagnosed with HEA definitely by postoperative pathological examination were analysed retrospectively. Three female patients and two male patients were included. Before operation, four patients received plain CT scanning and dynamic enhancement scanning, and the other patient only received enhancement scanning, with immunohistochemical analysis conducted after postoperative pathological examination. Four patients were misdiagnosed by CT, including three patients misdiagnosed with hepatic cell carcinoma and one patient with focal nodular hyperplasia.Results:Upper abdominal multi-slice spiral CT scanning and three-stage enhancement scanning were conducted in five patients with HEA before operation. HEA had certain characteristic CT manifestations: low density masses, a few relatively high-density masses or fat-density masses diffusely shown in foci, clear boundary, round or oval and large focus, and tumour size ranging from 3.1 cm × 2.5 cm to 7.0 cm × 5.2 cm. During enhancement scanning, the foci were significantly enhanced uniformly or non-uniformly during the arterial phase, while during the venous and equilibrium phases, the foci were enhanced continuously or showed obvious low-density masses. Obviously enhanced and widened vessels could be found adjacent to foci or in the central area of foci during the arterial phase.Conclusion:CT manifestations of HEA have certain characteristics. Primary diagnosis can be obtained by combining CT findings with clinical data, but pathological examination is still needed for a definite diagnosis.
