Invasive candidiasis (IC) causes high morbidity and mortality rates after liver transplantation, in part due to delayed diagnosis. The fungal cell wall component (1,3)-beta-d-glucan (BG) could be an early biomarker of IC. This preliminary prospective study was designed to evaluate the contribution of BG measurements to the diagnosis of IC after liver transplantation. All consecutive patients who underwent liver transplantation at Henri Mondor Hospital in France between January and June 2013 were enrolled prospectively in the study. They were monitored weekly for colonization by Candida, and colonization index values were calculated. Serum samples were tested for BG (Fungitell; Cape Cod Inc.) at least weekly between liver transplantation and discharge from the hospital. A total of 52 patients (including 39 male patients) were enrolled, with a median age of 55 years (range, 31 to 69 years). The median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 27 (range, 6 to 40). Cultures from 42 patients (81%) yielded Candida spp., with the most common Candida species isolated being Candida glabrata (47%). Six cases of documented IC were found for four of the 52 patients. On the day the clinical diagnosis of IC was made, analysis based on combining two sequential BG-positive samples (>146 pg/ml) and a colonization index of â‰¥0.5 revealed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) results of 83%, 89%, 50%, and 97.6%, respectively. The detection of BG associated with Candida colonization may be a promising tool based on a high NPV that can rule out IC among high-risk patients.
