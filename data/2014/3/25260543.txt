Nowadays, much effort is being devoted to detect new substances that not only significantly induce the death of tumor cells, but also have little side effect on normal cells. Our previous study showed that 2',4'-dihydroxy-6'-methoxy-3',5'-dimethylchalcone (DMC) exhibited significant cytotoxic potential with an IC50 value of 32.3 ± 1.13 μM against SMMC-7721 cells and could induce SMMC-7721 cells apoptosis. In the present study, we found that DMC was almost nontoxic to human normal liver L-02 and human normal fetal lung fibroblast HFL-1 cells as their IC50 values (111.0 ± 4.57 and 152.0 ± 4.83 µM for L-02 and HFL-1 cells, respectively) were much higher. To further explore the apoptotic mechanism of DMC, we investigated the role of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the apoptosis induced by DMC in SMMC-7721 cells. Our results suggested that the cytotoxicity and the generation of intracellular ROS were inhibited by N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Reversal of apoptosis in NAC pretreated cells indicated the involvement of ROS in DMC-induced apoptosis. The loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) induced by DMC was significantly blocked by NAC. NAC also prevented the decrease of Caspase-3 and -9 activities, the increase of Bcl-2 protein expression and the decrease of p53 and PUMA protein expressions. Together, these results indicated that ROS played a key role in the apoptosis induced by DMC in human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells.
