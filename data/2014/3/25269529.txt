Purpose:Recurrence is a disastrous outcome in patients with hepatitis-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have undergone curative resection, and little is known about whether high levels of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) increase the risk of HCC recurrence.Patients and methods:This retrospective study included 1,360 HBsAg-positive postoperative HCC patients with hepatitis B viral (HBV) DNA levels Results:We demonstrated that 1,000 IU/mL, but not 10 or 100 IU/mL, was a meaningful cutoff level for significantly discriminating these patients into an HBsAg(Low) group and an HBsAg(High) group based on correlations between the HBsAg level and liver cirrhosis (p = 0.028), tumor size (p = 0.039), and hepatitis B e antigen level (p Conclusion:HBsAg level is correlated with more aggressive tumor behavior and serves as a prognostic indicator in patients with surgically resected HCC with low HBV load.
