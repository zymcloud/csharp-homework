Purpose:To evaluate the risk factors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) extension into the right atrium (RA) and determine poor prognostic factors for HCC extension to the heart.Materials and methods:A total of 665 patients who were newly diagnosed with HCC were analyzed retrospectively from January 2004 to July 2012. The patients were divided into two groups: 33 patients with HCC extending into the RA and 632 HCC patients during the same period. The patients with HCC extending into the RA were subdivided into shorter survival group (Results:The prevalence of HCC extending to the RA was 4.96%. In multivariate analysis, a modified Union Internationale Contre le Cancer (UICC) stage higher than IVA, hepatic vein invasion, concomitant inferior vena cava and portal vein invasion, and multinodular tumor type were risk factors for HCC extending to the RA. In multivariate analysis, Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score>3 (p=0.016, OR: 13.89) and active treatment (p=0.024, OR: 0.054) were associated with prognostic factors in patients HCC extending into the RA. Active treatment such as radiation (n=1), transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) (n=11), Sorafenib (n=1), and combined modalities (n=2) were performed.Conclusion:Modified UICC stage higher than IVA, vascular invasion and multinodular tumor type are independent risk factors for HCC extending to the RA. Active treatment may prolong survival in patients HCC extending into the RA.
