A 42-year-old woman developed epigastric abdominal pain and acutely elevated serum transaminase levels during a course of chemotherapy for breast cancer. Serum antibodies to hepatitis A, B and C were not identified initially, but subsequently a high hepatitis C viral load was detected. Ultrasonic imaging of the liver was normal. Serum transaminase elevations resolved within 2 months, and, after 6 months without therapy, the hepatitis C viral load became undetectable.
