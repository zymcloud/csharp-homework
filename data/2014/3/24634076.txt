The insufficient penetration through the cell membranes is one of the major drawbacks of chemotherapeutics such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; 1). To improve the penetration, a useful strategy is the attachment of lipophilic moieties. Thus, we have synthesized a series of nucleolipid derivatives of 5-fluorouridine (5-FUrd; 2a), carrying lipophilic moieties at N(3) and/or at the 2',3'-O position, i.e., 3a, 3b, 4-7, and tested their cytostatic/cytotoxic activities towards three carcinoma cell lines (colon (HT-29), hepatocellular (HepG2), and renal (RENCA)) in comparison with 5-FU (1) and 5-FUrd (2a). After 48 h of incubation, four derivatives, 3a, 3b, 5, and 7, showed inhibitory effects on the survival of HT-29, HepG2, and RENCA cells. Additionally, to differentiate between anticancer and side-effects, we tested the cytotoxicity of the derivatives in human macrophages. Interestingly, the derivatives 4, 5, and 6 did not exhibit any effects on survival of THP-1 macrophages. Furthermore, we investigated the apoptosis induction of compound 1 and 2a, and the above-mentioned derivatives in HT-29 cells. Derivative 5 showed the highest significant (p
