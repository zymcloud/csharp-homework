Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide. Only a minority of HCC patients benefit from curative therapies, such as surgical resection, liver transplantation, or percutaneous treatment, since the majority of HCCs are diagnosed at intermediate or advanced stages. To determine whether transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) affects survival in patients with unresectable HCC, we conducted a case-controlled study, investigating 129 patients diagnosed with intermediate- or advanced-stage HCC, classified according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system. Of these 129 patients, 102 received TACE and 27 received symptomatic treatment alone. The primary follow-up endpoint was survival. The association of TACE with survival was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Survival was significantly higher in the chemoembolization group compared to that in the symptomatic treatment group. The estimated 1-, 2- and 3-year survival rates were 61.8, 34.0 and 24.3% for the chemoembolization group and 51.9, 9.9 and 0% for the symptomatic treatment group (P
