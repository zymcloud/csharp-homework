Aim:To investigate hepatic function after combined transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with a short-term interval (0-2 d).Methods:A total of 115 patients with compensated liver cirrhosis underwent RFA combined with TACE at a time-interval of 0-2 d for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Results:At 1 mo after treatment, Child-Pugh scores (CPs) remained unchanged in 89 of 94 patients (94.7%), and transiently increased by one-point in 5 patients (5.3%). However, the score returned to baseline score at 3 mo and was maintained until 6 mo in all patients. The baseline CPs of 8 or more was identified as a factor for transient rise of CPs after the treatment (CPs 8/9 vs 5/6/7; 21.4% vs 2.5%; P = 0.022). At 12 mo follow-up, CPs was unchanged in 90 patients (95.7%), and increased by one-point in 4 patients (4.3%). The rise of CPs at 12 mo was not statistically associated with the initial transient rise of CPs. There were procedure-related complications in 3 patients (3.2%), but the complications were resolved by medical and interventional treatments without hepatic functional sequelae.Conclusion:The combined TACE and RFA with an interval of 0-2 d are safe for the management of HCC
