In patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), cirrhosis is associated with age, gender, diabetes, alcohol abuse, and coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). The effect of these factors on the outcome of cirrhosis is unknown. This study in CHC patients with cirrhosis aimed to assess the influence of these factors on decompensation, liver transplantation, and death. Consecutive patients with CHC and cirrhosis hospitalized between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2008 were followed up until death, transplantation, or study closure in March 2013. Gender, age, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, diabetes, alcohol abuse, HIV, or HBV coinfection were collected at inclusion. The complications of cirrhosis, death, and liver transplantation were recorded at inclusion and during follow-up. The association between baseline factors and liver-related outcomes at inclusion and during follow-up were tested using logistic regression and Cox's model, respectively. A total of 348 patients with CHC and cirrhosis (68% men; median age: 59 years; median MELD: 10) were included. At baseline, 40% of the patients had diabetes, 29% alcohol abuse, and 6% HIV or HBV coinfection. Baseline MELDâ‰¥10 (PConclusion:In patients with CHC and cirrhosis, diabetes is an independent prognostic factor. Improving diabetes control may improve the outcome of cirrhosis.
