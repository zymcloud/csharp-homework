Surgical resection is not indicated in patients with portal hypertension in the current guideline of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage. We report a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the impact of clinically significant portal hypertension on survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following hepatectomy. Searched data in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were reviewed and 11 publications were included in the meta-analysis. The inclusion criteria of clinically significant portal hypertension were esophageal varices and/or thrombocytopenia with splenomegaly. Pooled data were extracted and computed into odds ratios (ORs) for clinical outcome and hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival. The final pooled data were composed of 2,285 patients. There were 775 patients with clinically significant portal hypertension (PHT group) and 1,510 patients without clinically significant portal hypertension (non-PHT group). Pooled proportion of mortality was 6.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.032-0.116) in PHT group and 2.8% (95% CI 0.014-0.054) in the non-PHT group. The pooled proportion of morbidity was 41.7% (95% CI 0.274-0.575) in PHT group and 34.7% (95% CI 0.243-0.467) in non-PHT group. Pooled data confirmed a significantly higher postoperative mortality in the PHT group, with OR 3.02 (P
