Objective:To investigate the correlation between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics and intrahepatic recurrence of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Methods:A total of 34 patients with 39 small HCC who underwent RFA were included in our study.MRI characteristics were compared between the recurrence group and the non-recurrence group; and a subgroup comparison was also made between the solitary recurrence group and the multiple recurrence group.Kaplan-Meier test,t-test/Mann-Whitney U test,Fisher's exact test and F-test were used for statistical analyses.Results:The median follow-up period was 25 (4-45) months and recurrence was observed in 19 (55.9%) of the patients.The 12-and 24-month cumulative recurrence-free survival rates were 71.3% and 51.8%,respectively.The recurrence group had a higher prevalence of lack of tumour capsule before RFA (P =0.017),no or disrupted periablational enhancement within 24 hours after RFA (P =0.012),and a smaller ablative margin (P=0.037).Meanwhile,the average apparent diffusion coefficient value within 24 hours after RFA was higher in the multiple recurrence group (1.57 * 10-3mm2/s) than in the solitary recurrence group (1.34 * 10(-3) mm2/s) (P =0.04).Conclusion:MRI can provide early noninvasive findings useful for advanced warning ofintrahepatic recurrence after RFA.
