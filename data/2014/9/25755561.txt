Background:TNF-α promoter polymorphism has been known to be a potential predictive factor in patients with HBV infection. We therefore tried to investigate whether the TNF-α promoter polymorphism at position -238, -857 and -863 was associated with the outcome of HBV infection in a population from Orissa, southern part of East India.Methods:A total of 195 patients recruited for the study were classified into 85 controls and 110 HBV infected cases, which included 34 IC, 30 CLD, 32 LC and 14 HCC patients. The polymorphisms at the respective sites were detected by a PCR-RFLP followed by statistical analysis.Results:The frequency of the genotype -238 GG and the allele -238G in the cases (89.0% and 92.7% respectively) was significantly higher than that in the controls (68.2% and 82.2% respectively) (P Conclusion:The present study established an association of polymorphisms at site -238 and -863 of the TNF-α promoter with the outcome HBV infection and disease progression.
