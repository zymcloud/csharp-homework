Background/aims:We investigated the treatment outcomes and prognostic factors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with obstructive jaundice.Methods:Among 2,861 patients newly diagnosed with HCC between 2002 and 2011, a total of 63 patients who initially presented with obstructive jaundice were analyzed. Only four patients presented with resectable tumors and underwent curative resection. In the other patients who presented with unresectable tumors, 5, 8, 9, and 18 patients received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and combined treatment, respectively. Both the clinical and the treatment factors that affect overall survival (OS) were analyzed.Results:The median OS was 4 months, and the 1-year OS rate was 23%. Patients who received treatment for HCC had a significantly improved OS rate compared with the patients who received supportive care only (1-year OS, 32% vs 0%; pConclusions:Unresectable HCC with obstructive jaundice has a poor prognosis. However, effective biliary drainage and treatment of HCC such as with TACE or radiotherapy improves survival.
