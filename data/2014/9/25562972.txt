Infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) frequently causes chronic viral hepatitis, a major risk factor for the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma or primary liver cancer. The origin of the HCV remains obscure because no closely related animal virus homolog has been identified. Also, efforts to understand the pathogenesis of the HCV have been hampered by the absence of small animal models for this human disease. Since 2011, with application of new sequencing technologies, various non-primate HCV homologs have been identified that will play an important part in understanding the origin and evolution of HCV, as well as establishment of related animal models.
