Although nucleotide/side analogs improve the clinical outcome of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive (HBsAg+) kidney transplant recipients (KTR), a significant proportion of subjects have developed resistance to lamivudine (LAM). We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and tolerability of entecavir (ETV) in HBsAg+ KTR at Queen Mary Hospital during 2005-2013. Twenty-one patients (10 treatment-naïve, 11 with LAM resistance) were included (duration of ETV treatment 34.7 ± 22.9 months, range 6-75 months). ETV treatment led to a decline of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA titer compared to baseline and is more significant in the treatment-naïve group (treatment-naïve: p = 0.028,
