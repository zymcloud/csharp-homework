Hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronically infects about 150,000,000 people worldwide and is a relevant cause of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and death. Antiviral treatment is rapidly moving from interferon (IFN)-based therapy to IFN-free approaches. This review focuses on the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, tolerability, safety and resistance of ombitasvir, which is an inhibitor of the HCV nonstructural protein 5A. The pharmacokinetics of ombitasvir enables its once daily administration. In vivo, in combinations with other oral direct acting antivirals, ombitasvir achieves very high rates of sustained virological response (about 95%) in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection with a good tolerability. Resistance profiling revealed a low barrier to resistance when given as monotherapy. However, coadministration of ombitasvir and other antivirals enhances its barrier to resistance. In conclusion, ombitasvir is a good drug to be used in IFN-free combinations for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.
