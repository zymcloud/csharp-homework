Purpose:The rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing worldwide, including in Egypt. Hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses are major risks. Non-B non-C HCC was reported in some countries. We investigated non-B non-C HCC-independent risk factors and associated profiles in viral hepatitis endemic region.Methods:In a consecutive series, 281 patients were diagnosed with HCC and received for management, at Tanta University Hospitals, within the past 3 years. Demographic variables and environmental exposures were recorded by direct application of a modified questionnaire. Sera were tested for HCV (antibodies by ELISA and RNA by RT-PCR) and HBV (HBs Ag by ELISA and HBV DNA). Antinuclear antibody, serum copper, and iron were assessed in non-viral HCC. Liver biopsy was performed for HCC diagnosis and grading and liver tissue in all patients by histopathological and immunohistochemical methods to assess HBV and/or HCV etiology.Results:Non-B non-C HCC patients were 13.87% of the total and were associated with multiple risks, predominantly pesticides (100%, p Conclusions:Pesticides and smoking heavy exposure can be considered as primary risks for non-B non-C HCC. Phosphate and ammonium sulfate fertilizers were associations. The study will increase awareness for better prevention and management.
