Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is accepted worldwide as an effective treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Although considered relatively safe, TACE has been associated with several complications. Spinal cord ischemia secondary to TACE is an extremely rare but disastrous complication. We report a very rare case of spinal cord injuries after TACE, together with a literature review. During the procedure, the patient suddenly experienced sensory impairment below the T10 dermatome and bilateral lower extremity motor weakness. She was given high-dose steroids and supportive therapy. The sensory deficits nearly improved completely, but motor strength remained unchanged. Thereafter, a chest computed tomography scan showed tumor metastasis to the lungs. The patient is now receiving sorafenib and follow-up.
