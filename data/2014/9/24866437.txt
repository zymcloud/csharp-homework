Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common neoplasms. Curative treatment options include liver resection (LR) and transplantation (LT). Organ shortage leads to discussion whether resectable HCC in cirrhosis should undergo LT or LR.Methods:Systematic review and metaanalysis of studies investigating LR and/or LT were performed. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed. Studies reporting 5-year OS of LR versus LT in an intention-to-treat fashion were included in a metaanalysis.Results:No randomized controlled trial was detected. Seventy publications were eligible for analysis. The 5-year OS revealed a better outcome for LT than LR (60.9 vs. 49.4 %; p Conclusions:A low quality of evidence data suggests the following: resectable HCC should primarily be resected as good alternative to liver transplantation in patients in whom both seem feasible. Randomized controlled trials or at least systematic evaluation of a cohort of patients in which resection and transplantation seem possible should be performed in a registry. This analysis should include intention-to-treat analysis of patients on the waiting list who do not proceed to a potential curative treatment.
