A relationship between hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia has been reported. This is a case of a 75-year-old woman with stable chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, not on treatment with an increased activity of serum alkaline phosphatase and negative liver disease work up. A liver biopsy revealed leukaemic infiltration without evidence of cirrhosis or fatty liver. Four years later, she presented with a rapidly progressive liver mass which was diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma histologically.
