Purpose:To investigate the effects of soluble FGL2 (sFGL2) secreted by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) on immune suppression in cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Serum sFGL2 levels were examined by ELISA in 40 patients with HCC, liver cirrhosis (LC) or chronic HBV (CHB) infection. A double staining of the immunofluorescence analysis of α-SMA and FGL2 was performed in two cirrhotic liver specimens. The expression of FGL2 in the LX2 cell line was analyzed by immunofluorescence, Western blot and flow cytometry. T-cells purified from HCC patients using magnetic beads were cultured with LX2 cells at different ratios with anti-CD3-stimulating or FGL2-blocking antibodies. The proliferation index (PI) of CD8 + T cells was assessed by flow cytometry, and the secretion of IFN-γ was measured by ELISA.Results:sFGL2 levels are significantly higher in patients with HCC or LC compared with those with CHB (p = 0.0039/p = 0.0020). Among HCC patients, those with cirrhosis exhibited significantly higher levels of sFGL2 compared with non-cirrhotic individuals (p = 0.0108). The expressions of FGL2 and α-SMA overlapped in HSCs in liver specimens. FGL2 protein secreted by LX2 cells inhibited T-cell proliferation of HCC patients in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. The PI of CD8 + T cells was significantly enhanced following addition of FGL2 antibody to the culture system (LX2/T-cell ratio of 1:10, p = 0.002). The level of IFN-γ in mixed cultures was inversely correlated with the number of HSCs and was reversed by incubation with FGL2 blocking antibody.Conclusion:sFGL2 protein is a novel effector molecule of activated HSCs, which suppresses CD8 + T cell proliferation and interferon-γ production, and it subsequently might contribute to immune suppression during fibrosis and tumorigenesis in the liver.
