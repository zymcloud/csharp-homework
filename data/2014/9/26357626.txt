Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a worldwide health problem. Chronic hepatitis B can lead to fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Management of the latter two conditions often requires liver transplantation. Treatment with conventional interferon or pegylated interferon alpha can clear the virus, but the rates are very low. The likelihood, however, of viral resistance to interferon is minimal. The main problems with this therapy are the frequency and severity of side effects. In contrast, nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) have significantly lower side effects, but require long term treatment as sustained virological response rates are extremely low. However, long term treatment with NAs increases the risk for the development of anti-viral drug resistance. Only by understanding the molecular basis of resistance and using agents with multiple sites of action can drugs be designed to optimally prevent the occurrence of HBV antiviral resistance.
