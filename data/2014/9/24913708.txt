Our aims were to investigate and establish simple and reliable implanted hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) models in Wistar rats. Concentrated suspensions of CBRH-7919 cancer cell lines were injected subcutaneously into the scapular regions of nude mice. The developing tumor tissues were then implanted into the livers of 45 adult Wistar rats. Dexamethasone (2.5 mg/day) was injected intramuscularly daily for 1 week preoperatively and 2 weeks postoperatively. After 4 weeks of implantation, ultrasonography and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed to identify model rats with liver tumor growth and to analyze the growth and characteristics of the tumors. Five of these model rats were then sacrificed, and the tumors were removed from the liver for pathological examination. Three rats died during the operation; among the remaining 42 rats, 36 possessed a total of 43 liver tumors. The success rate of tumor implantation was 85.7 % (36/42), and the diameters of the tumors ranged from 5 to 10 mm. All tumor specimens were confirmed to be HCC by pathological examination. This study provides a new approach for establishing implanted HCC models in Wistar rats, which can be used for studying numerous biological features of HCC.
