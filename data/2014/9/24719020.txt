Purpose:To evaluate the effect of body composition on outcomes after hepatic resection for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We performed 190 hepatic resections for HCC and divided the patients into 2 groups on the basis of visceral fat area (VFA), assessed by computed tomographic measurement at the level of the umbilicus, into high VFA (H-VFA) (n = 106) and low VFA (L-VFA) (n = 84) groups. We compared the surgical outcomes between the two groups.Results:L-VFA was significantly correlated with a lower body mass index, sarcopenia, lower serum albumin, and liver cirrhosis. There was no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications and mortality between the 2 groups. Patients in the L-VFA group had a significantly poorer prognosis than those in the H-VFA group in terms of both overall (P = 0.043) and recurrence-free (P = 0.001) survival. The results of multivariate analysis showed that sarcopenia rather than L-VFA was an independent and prognostic indicator after hepatic resection with HCC.Conclusions:Body composition is an important factor affecting cancer outcomes after hepatic resection for HCC in Japan.
