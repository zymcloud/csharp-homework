Background/aims:To confirm the relationship between hepatitis B recurrence and Hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence.Methodology:Data from 340 patients undergoing liver transplantation for HBV-related liver disease were retrospectively evaluated. Clinically relevant variables were analyzed using univariate models. Significant variables were subjected to multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify the independent predictors for HBV recurrence. Fifteen samples removed from HCC recurrence patients were stained for HBsAg and HBcAg.Results:The analyzed population included 283 male and 57 female patients. The mean age was 48.5Â±9.33 years and median follow-up was 47 months. Hepatitis B relapsed in 16 patients (4.7%). Univariate analysis indicated that HCC (P=0.022) and HCC recurrence (P=0.000) were associated to post transplantation HB. Multivariate analysis identified HCC recurrence as an independent risk factor for HB recurrence (hazard ratio: 23.262 (95% CI: 3.752, 144.216); P
