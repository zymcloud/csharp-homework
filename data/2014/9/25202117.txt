Aim:To evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of erlotinib treatment in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who had previously experienced severe hepatotoxicity after gefitinib treatment.Patients and methods:Twenty-five NSCLC patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation were initially treated with gefitinib (250 mg/day). However, 7 of these experienced severe hepatotoxicity. After recovery from hepatotoxicity, treatment was switched to erlotinib (150 mg/day) in all 7 patients. Toxicity and efficacy of erlotinib were analyzed.Results:None of the 7 patients reported severe hepatotoxicity with erlotinib despite gefitinib-induced severe hepatotoxicity. All patients achieved response with gefitinib or following erlotinib treatment. The response achieved with gefitinib was maintained after switching to erlotinib. Therefore, an excellent median progression-free survival of 372 days was achieved although gefitinib induced severe hepatotoxicity.Conclusion:Erlotinib treatment was efficient and well-tolerated in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation, despite their severe hepatotoxicity with prior gefitinib treatment.
