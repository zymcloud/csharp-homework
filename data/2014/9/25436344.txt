Background/aims:The aim of this study was to identify the influencing factors related to outcome of patients of colorectal cancer with liver metastasis.Methodology:From January 1999 to January 2009, 293 cases of colorectal cancer with liver metastasis undergoing surgery were analysised retrospectively. Relationships between survival and clinicopathological factors including patient demographics and tumor characteristics were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of patients after resection were 58.3%, 26.4%, and 11.3%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that preoperative CEA level, degree of primary tumor differentiation, resection margin, number of liver metastases, resection of liver metastases were prognostic impacts. The difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). Cox multivariate analysis showed that preoperative CEA level, number of liver metastases, and resection of liver metastases are three separate prognostic factors.Conclusions:Racical resection is the key to improve the long-term survival rate of colorectal cancer with liver metastasis. Important predictive factors related to poor survival are preoperative CEA level and number of liver metastases.
