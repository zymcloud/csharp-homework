The incidence of bone metastasis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has reportedly been increasing. We report a progressive case that presented with a solitary HCC lumbar metastasis. A 44-year-old man was referred to us from a local clinic with a complaint of a painful lump. He was diagnosed with HCC due to liver cirrhosis and lumbar metastasis by contrast abdominal computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Then, he received radiation therapy (3 Gy/ time; total, 39 Gy) and zoledronate. Furthermore, transcatheter arterial embolization and posterior lumbar spinal fusion were performed to treat the lumbar metastasis. This decreased his pain and oxycodone was no longer required. In conclusion, for HCC patients with bone metastasis, combined treatment with radiation, zoledronate, and surgery, may possibly improve their quality of life resulting in a long clinical course.
