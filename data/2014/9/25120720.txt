The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of serum secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (SFRP5), an inhibitor of Wnt signaling, in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated infections and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Serum SFRP5 levels were detected in 147 patients with HBV-associated chronic infection or HCC. Compared with the non-HBV-infected and non-HCC group, the HBV-associated chronic infection and HCC groups exhibited decreased serum SFRP5 levels. A significant inverse correlation between serum SFRP5 levels and HBV DNA levels was identified in the HBV-associated chronic infection and HCC groups. Furthermore, SFRP5 levels differentially decreased in patients with HBV-associated diseases, in a manner which was dependent on liver disease status. Compared with patients exhibiting HBV-associated chronic infection, patients with HCC were found to exhibit lower serum SFRP5 levels. The results of the present study indicated that patients with HBV-associated liver infection and HCC exhibited significantly deceased serum SFRP5 levels, which were found to negatively correlate with HBV DNA levels. Serum SFRP5 levels may present a biomarker for the severity of HBV-associated liver infection, and the risk of HCC initiation and progression.
