We report a case of long-term survival of a patient who received low-dose 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin (FP) systemic chemotherapy and underwent partial resection of the lung for a tumor thrombus in the inferior caval vein (IVC) and multiple lung metastases from recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The patient was a 66-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital for the treatment of a 13-cm liver tumor. He underwent an extended posterior sectionectomy of the liver. Pathological diagnosis revealed moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (vp1, vv1, sm[-, 1.5mm], ch, T3N0M0, stage III). At 3 months postoperatively, computed tomography (CT) revealed a tumor thrombus in the IVC and multiple (>20) lung tumors that were considered HCC recurrences. Low-dose FP systemic chemotherapy was initiated, and the tumors reduced in size. However, a new lesion in the left lung was detected at 13 months postoperatively. Thoracoscopyassisted resection of the tumor that was histologically diagnosed as an HCC metastasis was performed at 26 months postoperatively. The patient is cancer free at 46 months postoperatively. Therefore, low-dose FP systemic chemotherapy is one of the therapeutic options for the treatment of HCC recurrences of IVC tumor thrombi and multiple lung metastases. However, the occurrence of new lesions should be carefully monitored.
