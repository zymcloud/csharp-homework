Resistance to anoikis and Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are two processes critically involved in cancer metastasis. In this study, we demonstrated that after anchorage deprival, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells not only resisted anoikis, but also exhibited EMT process. Microarray expression profiling revealed that expression of miR-424-5p was significantly decreased in anoikis-resistant HCC cells. Ectopic overexpression of miR-424-5p was sufficient to reverse resistance to anoikis, block EMT process and inhibit malignant behaviors of HCC cells. Target analysis showed that a potent β-catenin inhibitor, ICAT/CTNNBIP1 was a direct target of miR-424-5p. Further study demonstrated that miR-424-5p reversed resistance to anoikis and EMT of HCCs by directly targeting ICAT and further maintaining the E-cadherin/β-catanin complex on the cellular membrance. In vivo study further demonstrated that miR-424-5p significantly inhibited the tumorigenicity of HCC cells in nude mice. Clinical investigation demonstrated that miR-424-5p was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues compared with that of the non-cancerous liver tissues, and this decreased expression of miR-424-5p was significantly correlated with higher pathological grades and more advanced TNM stages. Therefore, aberrant expression of miR-424-5p is critically involved in resistance to anoikis and EMT during the metastatic process of HCC, and its downregulation significantly contributes to liver cancer progression.
