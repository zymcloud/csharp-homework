Aims:Rosuvastatin and pitavastatin have been proposed as probe substrates for the organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B, but clinical data on their relative sensitivity and selectivity to OATP1B inhibitors are lacking. A clinical study was therefore conducted to determine their relative suitability as OATP1B probes using single oral (PO) and intravenous (IV) doses of the OATP1B inhibitor rifampicin, accompanied by a comprehensive in vitro assessment of rifampicin inhibitory potential on statin transporters.Methods:The clinical study comprised of two separate panels of eight healthy subjects. In each panel, subjects were randomized to receive a single oral dose of rosuvastatin (5 mg) or pitavastatin (1 mg) administered alone, concomitantly with rifampicin (600 mg) PO or IV. The in vitro transporter studies were performed using hepatocytes and recombinant expression systems.Results:Rifampicin markedly increased exposures of both statins, with greater differential increases after PO vs. IV rifampicin only for rosuvastatin. The magnitudes of the increases in area under the plasma concentration-time curve were 5.7- and 7.6-fold for pitavastatin and 4.4- and 3.3-fold for rosuvastatin, after PO and IV rifampicin, respectively. In vitro studies showed that rifampicin was an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, breast cancer resistance protein and multidrug resistance protein 2, but not of organic anion transporter 3.Conclusions:The results indicate that pitavastatin is a more sensitive and selective and thus preferred clinical OATP1B probe substrate than rosuvastatin, and that a single IV dose of rifampicin is a more selective OATP1B inhibitor than a PO dose.
