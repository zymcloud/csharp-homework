Purpose:The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the elderly population has recently been increasing. In this study, we focused on a recent 10-year survey, and compared the clinicopathological features and postoperative outcomes of HCC in elderly (â‰¥75 years of age) and younger patients (Methods:A total of 255 patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC from 2001 to 2010 at Wakayama Medical University Hospital were reviewed. The clinical characteristics were compared between the elderly and younger patients. The risk factors for postoperative complications and prognostic factors were identified using the multivariate analyses.Results:A total of 66 patients were classified as elderly patients. The incidence of HCC without viral liver disorders was significantly high in the elderly group than in the younger group. The independent risk factors [odds (95% confidence intervals)] for postoperative complications were an ASA score of 3 [2.57 (1.20-5.49)] and the length of the operation [1.41 (1.09-1.81)]. The survival was similar between the two groups, and the only independent prognostic factor for survival in the elderly patients was vessel invasion.Conclusions:HCC derived from non-viral liver disorders was dominant in the elderly patients. Aging itself was not a risk factor for postoperative complications or the survival outcome.
