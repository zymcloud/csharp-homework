Hepatic steatosis is a condition frequently encountered in clinical practice, with potential progression towards chirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Ultrasonography (US) is one of the noninvasive imaging techniques used in the diagnosis of steatosis. We will review the US diagnostic criteria, the US performance in the diagnosis and grading of hepatic steatosis, the US steatosis models, but also its limitations in the diagnosis of steatosis. In addition, we will discuss 2 modern methods of assessing hepatic steatosis using ultrasounds, namely the computerized processing of data forming the US image and the controlled attenuation parameter measured with unidimensional transient elastography.
