The hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with bile duct tumor thrombus (BDTT) usually have no specific clinical symptoms at early stages. HCC with BDTT was usually misdiagnosed when the intrahepatic tumor was small, even undetectable. In this study, 5 cases of HCC with BDTT misdiagnosed as choledocholithiasis and cholangitis in the local hospital are described. We analyzed retrospectively and summarized our experiences of these 5 HCC patients with BDTT misdiagnosed in the local hospital during the past 5 years. The diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of the patients are discussed. Three patients underwent hepatectomy with thrombectomy and T-tube drainage. One patient underwent hepatectomy with the resection of the common bile duct and hepatojejunostomy, and palliative surgery was performed in 1 patient with portal vein tumor thrombus and intrahepatic metastasis. The patients were followed for 6-22 months; 4 patients died of tumor recurrence and metastasis or hepatic failure, despite 3 of these patients having received transhepatic arterial chemotherapy and embolization or radiofrequency ablation therapy. Early and accurate diagnosis of HCC with BDTT is very important. When patients have a history of abnormal recurrent cholangitis, HCC with BDTT should be highly suspected. Intraductal ultrasonography (US), intraoperative US, and histopathological examination are very valuable for the diagnosis. The prognosis of HCC patients with BDTT is dismal. Identification of this type of patient is clinically important, because surgical treatment may be beneficial.
