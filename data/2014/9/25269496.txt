Objective:To explore the technique and effect of liver hanging maneuver in anterior approach for isolated complete liver caudate lobectomy.Methods:We recruited 17 patients with liver caudate lobe tumor (13 primary hepatocellular carcinoma, 3 cholangiocarcinoma and 1 liver metastasis from colorectal cancer). Isolated complete caudate lobectomy with liver hanging maneuver was performed in 17 patients.Results:All 17 patients were successfully received the above-mentioned operation. The operative time was 166-427 (211.5 ± 20.1) min and the intraoperative blood loss was 372-1 208 (472.7 ± 83.6) mL. There was no operative death. The survival rates of follow up for 1, 3 and 5 years were 76.5%, 52.9% and 23.5%, respectively.Conclusion:Liver hanging maneuver for isolated complete resection of the caudate lobe is an ideal approach for liver neoplasms resection.
