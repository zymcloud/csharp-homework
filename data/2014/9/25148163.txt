Objective:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of use of dual-energy CT monochromatic imaging in the late hepatic arterial phase on hyperenhancing focal lesion detection and lesion conspicuity.Subjects and methods:This prospective study included 72 patients imaged with a single-source dual-energy CT scanner. Late arterial phase imaging was performed with dual energies of 140 and 80 kVp, and the portal venous and delayed phases were performed with a single energy of 120 kVp. Two deidentified image sets were created: set A consisted of 77-keV images only, and set B consisted of 40-, 50-, 70-, and 77-keV images and iodine-based contrast material decomposition images. Two independent reviewers identified hypervascular lesions and subjectively scored lesion conspicuity. Contrast-to-noise ratios were calculated, and radiation dose (volume CT dose index) was recorded.Results:The 128 lesions identified had a mean size of 1.7 Â± 1.4 cm. There was no difference in lesion detection between the two reviewers or the two image sets. The contrast-to-noise ratio at 50 keV was 72% greater than that at 77 keV (p Conclusion:Viewing dual-energy CT images may result in the greatest subjective lesion conspicuity and measured contrast-to-noise ratio at 50 keV with equal detection of hyperenhancing liver lesions compared with viewing 77-keV images alone. In addition, the radiation doses of dual-energy CT may be similar to those of single-energy CT.
