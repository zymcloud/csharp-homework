Objective:To clarify the effect of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D (GPIPLD) on hepatoma cells HepG2 and the possible molecular mechanism.Methods:MTT, fluorescent staining and Western blot were applied to analyze the effect and molecular mechanism of GPI-PLD on hepatoma cells by transfected high expression GPI-PLD model. We inoculated HepG2 in nude mice models to further clarify the effect of GPI-PLD on hepatoma cells in vivo.Results:Compared with the control groups, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway activity and proliferation of hepatoma cells were significantly inhibited in the GPI-PLD group. Nude mice models showed that the tumor growth and tumor weight [(1.87 ± 0.09) g] of the GPI-PLD group were significantly less than those of the blank control group [(2.20 ± 0.17) g] and the negative control group [(2.15 ± 0.09) g]. AST, ALT and AFP serum concentration in the GPI-PLD group were significantly lower than those of the control groups (PConclusion:GPI-PLD can inhibit the proliferation of hepatoma cells and growth in vivo, and promote the apoptosis of hepatoma cells by reducing the activity of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.
