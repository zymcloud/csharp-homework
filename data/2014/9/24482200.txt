The association between subtypes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remained inconclusive and evaluated in both case-control and cohort studies. In the case-control study, 397 HCC cases from medical centers were compared with 410 community-based non-HCC controls. All of them were anti-HCV-seropositive, HBsAg-seronegative with serum HCV RNA levels â‰¥1,000 IU/mL. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of HCV subtype after controlling for other HCC risk factors. In the cohort study, 866 anti-HCV-seropositive individuals were followed from 1991 to 2008 to assess the long-term HCC predictability of HCV subtypes. Newly developed HCC cases were ascertained by follow-up health examinations and computerized linkage with national databases. The percentage of HCV 1b subtype was higher among HCC cases than controls (64 vs. 55%, p
