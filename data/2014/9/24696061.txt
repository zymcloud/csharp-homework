Objective:Our objective was to explore the short-term effects of preoperative serum hepatitis B virus DNA level (HBV DNA) on postoperative hepatic function in patients who underwent partial hepatectomy for hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The clinical data of 1,602 patients with hepatitis B-related HCC who underwent partial hepatectomy in our department were retrospectively studied. The patients were divided into three groups according to their preoperative HBV DNA levels: group A 20,000 IU/mL. The rates of postoperative complications, especially the rate of postoperative liver failure, were compared.Results:There were significant differences among the three groups in the rates of postoperative liver failure. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, a high preoperative HBV DNA level was an independent risk factor for postoperative liver failure.Conclusions:Preoperative HBV DNA level was a significant risk factor for postoperative hepatic dysfunction.
