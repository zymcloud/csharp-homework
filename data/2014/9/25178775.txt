Hereditary angio-oedema is characterised by recurrent episodes of laryngeal, intra-abdominal, facial or peripheral oedema. Danazol can be used as prophylaxis for recurrent attacks. Hepatotoxicity is a recognised adverse effect of danazol. We report an exceptional case of a danazol-induced hepatocellular carcinoma in a 75-year-old patient with hereditary angio-oedema.
