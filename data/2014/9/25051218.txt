Background and aims:Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. E-antigen-negative CHB patients, with low liver enzymes and viremia, generally fare better. We determined the proportion of chronic low-replicative hepatitis B patients not meeting guideline-based antiviral therapy criteria nonetheless requiring treatment and increased hepatocellular carcinoma and varices surveillance based on transient elastography (TE), aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), and/or ultrasound (US) findings.Materials and methods:The Ottawa Hospital Viral Hepatitis Database was utilized. Included CHB patients were observed from January 2011 to April 2013, who were at least 18 years of age, e-antigen negative, with hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels below 20,000 IU/ml, normal liver enzymes (alanine transaminase Results:A total of 264 patients met the eligibility criteria and 79 underwent TE. The median age was 41 years (quartiles: 37, 49); 53% were male patients and 95% were immigrants. Races included 47% Southeast Asians, 37% Black, and 11% White. Mean alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase were 34 U/l (SD 13) and 21 U/l (SD 7), respectively. The mean HBV DNA level was 2.15Ã—10 IU/ml. The mean TE score was 4.5 kPa (SD 1.1). One patient had F2 fibrosis by TE. All others were F0-F1. The mean APRI was 0.30 (SD 0.20) with no values greater than 1.5.Conclusion:No patients were identified with advanced fibrosis by TE, APRI, or US meriting HBV antiviral therapy and/or enhanced screening. TE and US have minimal apparent utility in this specific population.
