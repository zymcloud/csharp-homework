Purpose:To analyze image quality and the factors that determine it for cone-beam computed tomography (CT) hepatic arteriography in chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:From September 2009-December 2010, 399 consecutive patients referred for chemoembolization of HCC were scheduled for cone-beam CT scan. There were 12 patients (3%) excluded because of difficulty with breath-hold. Of the 387 patients who underwent cone-beam CT hepatic arteriography, 100 patients were ultimately included in the study according to inclusion criteria. Maximum intensity projection images were scored for image quality of each segmental hepatic artery. Potential determining factors for image quality were diaphragmatic motion, portal vein enhancement, and hepatic artery-to-parenchyma enhancement ratio. The flow rate of contrast media, x-ray delay, and location of the catheter tip were also evaluated.Results:It was possible to trace at least subsegmental hepatic arteries in 625 of 700 segments (89.3%) on cone-beam CT hepatic arteriography. Diaphragmatic motion, prominent portal vein enhancement, and low hepatic artery-to-parenchyma enhancement ratio worsened image quality (P Conclusions:In most cases, the quality of cone-beam CT hepatic arteriography images was good enough to trace subsegmental hepatic arteries at a minimum. Respiratory and cardiac motion, portal vein enhancement, and hepatic artery-to-parenchyma enhancement ratio significantly affected the image quality of cone-beam CT hepatic arteriography.
