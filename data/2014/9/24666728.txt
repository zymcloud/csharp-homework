Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for most cases of liver cancer worldwide; contraction of hepatitis C (HCV) is considered a major risk factor for liver cancer even when individuals have not developed formal cirrhosis. Global, untargeted metabolic profiling methods were applied to serum samples from patients with either HCV alone or HCC (with underlying HCV). The main objective of the study was to identify metabolite based biomarkers associated with cancer risk, with the long term goal of ultimately improving early detection and prognosis. Serum global metabolite profiles from patients with HCC (n=37) and HCV (n=21) were obtained using high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) methods. The selection of statistically significant metabolites for partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model creation based on biological and statistical significance was contrasted to that of a traditional approach utilizing p-values alone. A PLS-DA model created using the former approach resulted in a model with 92% sensitivity, 95% specificity, and an AUROC of 0.93. A series of PLS-DA models iteratively utilizing three to seven metabolites that were altered significantly (p
