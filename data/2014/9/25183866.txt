In May 2014, approximately 200 stem cell scientists from all over world gathered near Copenhagen in Denmark to participate in 'The Stem Cell Niche', part of the Copenhagen Bioscience Conferences series. The meeting covered an array of different stem cell systems from pluripotent stem cells and germ cells to adult stem cells of the lung, liver, muscle, bone and many more. In addition to the stem cell niche, the meeting focused on a number of cutting edge topics such as cell fate transitions and lineage reprogramming, as well as stem cells in ageing and disease, including cancer. This Meeting review describes the exciting work that was presented and some of the themes that emerged from this excellent meeting.
