Background/aims:Although aggressive resection is recommended for the treatment of resectable liver metastasis of colorectal cancer, recurrences often develop in the remaining liver. In our department, perioperative chemotherapy was introduced for the treatment of colorectal cancer associated with resectable synchronous liver metastasis. The results of this treatment are reported herein. The study population was 20 patients (9 men, 11 women) with colorectal cancer associated with resectable synchronous liver metastasis whose data were collected between April 2009 and September 2012.Methodology:The patients received chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6 or XELOX + bevacizumab) for 3 months each before and after hepatectomy following resection of the primary lesion.Results:Preoperative chemotherapy yielded a response rate of 66.7%, and no serious postoperative complications were noted. Although recurrence was found in 9 patients after treatment, 4 have so far remained cancer-free after re-resection. Thus, re-resection of the recurrent lesion resulted in patients maintaining cancer-free status for a prolonged period.Conclusions:The use of perioperative chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer associated with resectable synchronous liver metastasis may improve outcomes after hepatectomy.
