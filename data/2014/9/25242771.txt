Liver retransplantation is the only treatment for patients with hepatic graft failure. Due to the shortage of organs, it is essential to optimize its use. Between 1998-2010, our center performed retransplantations on 48 (12.8%) patients (re-OLT). The data are compared with those for a group of 374 patients who did not receive retransplantations (NO re-OLT). The re-OLT vs NO re-OLT groups did not significantly differ in mean age of recipients (47 vs 51 years), indications for transplantation (hepatitis C virus cirrhosis 54% vs 56%, alcoholic cirrhosis 25% vs 17%, hepatocellular carcinoma 14% vs 22%), mean Model for End-stage Liver Disease (25 vs 20), mean total cold ischemia time (385 vs 379 minutes), or mean age of donors (52 vs 49 years). The main causes of retransplantation were primary graft nonfunction (64%), arterial thrombosis (8%), biliary complications (6%), and hepatitis C virus recurrence (4%). The difference in overall patient survival was not statistically significant. The patient's survival at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years for RE-OLT vs NO-reOLT was 56% vs 63%, 53% vs 60%, 46% vs 57%, and 44% vs 53%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified Model for End-stage Liver Disease≥23 as a predictor factor of retransplantation (P=.04). Other variables predicting outcome included age of donors (≥65 years vs younger group), age of recipients (≥50 years vs younger group), cold ischemia (≥600 vs 6 months). The incidence of re-OLT in the series (12.8%) was comparable to that in the literature, and primary graft nonfunction in the study represents the main cause of retransplantation. Our analysis showed that the indication of the first transplant and the age of the donor were not risk factors for re-OLT. Liver retransplantation is a concrete alternative lifesaver for patients with graft failure.
