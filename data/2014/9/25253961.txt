Aim:To determine significant indicators for the efficacy of sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 46 patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C who received sorafenib for more than 30 d at the Iizuka Hospital from June 2009 to December 2012 were enrolled in this study. Multivariate and univariate analyses were performed to evaluate the associations of hepatic function according to Child-Pugh grade, location and size of the largest tumor and adverse events of sorafenib treatment, such as hand-foot syndrome (HFS), hypertension, diarrhea, and alopecia, with the efficacy of treatment, as measured by overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP).Results:Patients included 39 men and 7 women whose ages ranged from 48 to 85 years (70.6 Â± 9.6 years). HCC was classified according to etiology as follows: hepatitis C virus (n = 26), hepatitis B virus (n = 9), and other (n = 11). Liver function in patients was categorized as Child-Pugh grade A (n = 30) or B (n = 16). Tumors were categorized by size [5 cm (n = 13)] and the location of the largest tumor was used to categorize patients with intrahepatic (n = 28) or extrahepatic (n = 18) HCC. HFS, hypertension, diarrhea, and alopecia were present in 22 (47.8%), 19 (41.3%), 15 (32.6%) and 7 patients (15.2%), respectively. The median OS of all patients was 373 d and the median TTP was 112 d. The etiology of HCC did not correlate with the median OS and TPP. The median OS of patients with tumors Conclusion:Extrahepatic major HCC and HFS are associated with prolonged TTP and are useful indicators for judging the efficacy of sorafenib treatment.
