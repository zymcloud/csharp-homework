Aim:To identify risk factors contributing to the development of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (CHC) in China.Methods:One hundred and twenty-six patients with CHC and 4:1 matched healthy controls were interviewed during the period from February 2000 to October 2012. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each risk factor.Results:Univariate analysis showed that the significant risk factors for CHC development were hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, heavy alcohol consumption, a family history of liver cancer, and diabetes mellitus. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that HBV infection (OR = 19.245, 95%CI: 13.260-27.931) and heavy alcohol consumption (OR = 2.186, 95%CI: 1.070-4.466) were independent factors contributing to the development of CHC.Conclusion:HBV infection and heavy alcohol consumption may play a role in the development of CHC in China.
