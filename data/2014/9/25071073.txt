Background/aims:The role of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) remains uncertain in patients with viable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:A total of 101 patients (April 2007 to August 2010) underwent RFA for residual or recurrent HCC after TACE. We analyzed their long-term outcomes and predictive factors.Results:The overall survival rates after RFA were 93.1%, 65.4%, and 61.0% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Predictive factors for favorable overall survival were Child-Pugh class A (hazard ratio [HR], 3.45; p=0.001), serum Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) level Conclusions:Patients with recurrent or residual HCC who undergo prior TACE show a favorable overall survival, although their tumors seem to recur early and frequently. While good liver function, a low serum AFP level, and recurrent tumors were independent predictive factors for a favorable overall survival, poor response to TACE, a high serum AFP level, and large tumors are associated with early recurrence.
