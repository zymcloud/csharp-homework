Hypoxia regulates the expression of genes that promote tumor growth, angiogenesis and invasion. We previously studied hypoxic tumor cells in vitro and from hepatic metastases of colorectal cancer and determined several potential prognostic factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we evaluated the prognostic impact of the expression of ephrin-A1 (EFNA1) and its receptor, EPHA2, in patients with HCC after curative resection. Samples from a total of 139 HCC patients were analyzed by either microarray alone (n=86) or by microarray and quantitative PCR (n=53). There was no correlation between EFNA1 expression and clinicopathological factors. EPHA2 expression was not significantly correlated with any clinicopathological factors, except for microscopic portal invasion. EFNA1 was an independent prognostic factor for HCC (p=0.0277). These findings suggest that EFNA1 expression may be a useful marker for predicting high risk of recurrence in patients who have undergone curative resection for HCC.
