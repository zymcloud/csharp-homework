New N-substituted sophoridinic acid/ester and sophoridinol derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxic activity in human HepG2 hepatoma cells from the lead sophoridine (1). Among the newly synthesized compounds, sophoridinol 7i displayed a potential antiproliferative activity with an IC50 of 3.1 μM. Importantly, it exerted an almost equipotent effect against both wild MCF-7 and adriamycin (AMD)-resistant MCF-7 (MCF-7/AMD) breast carcinoma cell lines. Its mode of action was to arrest the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, consistent with that of the parent 1. In addition, compound 7i also showed a reasonable ClogP value and favorable pharmacokinetic property with an area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 10.3 μM·h in rats, indicating an ideal druggable characteristic. We consider sophoridinol derivatives to be a novel family of promising antitumor agents with an advantage of inhibiting drug-resistant cancer cells.
