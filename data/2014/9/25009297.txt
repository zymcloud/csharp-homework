Purpose:This study aimed to construct a novel platform for the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to investigate the clinical significance of epithelial cell adhesion molecule mRNA-positive (EpCAM(mRNA+)) CTCs using this platform.Experimental design:An optimized platform for CTC detection was constructed by evaluating different negative enrichment, mRNA isolation, and cDNA synthesis procedures and compared with the CellSearch system. A total of 299 patients with HCC were recruited into this prospective study; of these, 157 who received curative resection, 76 who received transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), and 66 who received radiotherapy were tested using our platform. The diagnostic value of EpCAM(mRNA+) CTCs was investigated in 122 patients with HCC who underwent resection and 120 control subjects.Results:The optimized negative enrichment and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)-based CTC detection platform had high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility and a low sample volume requirement. This platform showed a potential diagnostic value in patients with HCC and exhibited 76.7% consistency with the CellSearch system (r = 0.54, P Conclusions:We established an optimized platform based on negative enrichment and qRT-PCR for highly sensitive, specific, and reproducible CTC detection. This platform might be clinically useful in auxiliary diagnosis, treatment response assessment, and early decision-making to tailor the most effective antitumor strategies.
