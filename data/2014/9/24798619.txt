Background & aims:The nuclear Pregnane X Receptor (PXR, NR1I2) plays a pivotal role in xenobiotic metabolism. Here, we sought to characterize a new PXR isoform (hereafter called small PXR or sPXR) stemming from alternative transcription starting sites downstream of a CpG Island located near exon 3 of the human PXR gene.Methods:Quantitative RT-PCR, western blot, methylation-specific PCR, luciferase reporter assays, electro-mobility shift assays, and stable sPXR overexpression were used to examine sPXR expression and function in hepatocellular cell lines, healthy human liver (n=99), hepatocellular adenomas (HCA, n=91) and hepatocellular carcinoma samples (HCC, n=213).Results:Liver sPXR mRNA expression varied importantly among individuals and encodes a 37kDa nuclear protein consisting of the ligand-binding domain of PXR that behaves as a dominant-negative of PXR transactivation properties. In vitro methylation of the sPXR upstream promoter abolished its activity, while the demethylation agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine increased sPXR mRNA expression in several cell lines. Finally, we observed that sPXR mRNA expression displayed significant differences related to HCA or HCC biology.Conclusions:This novel PXR isoform, displaying a dominant-negative activity and regulated by DNA methylation, is associated with outcomes of patients with HCC treated by resection, suggesting that it represents a key modulator of PXR.
