Background and aims:Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive technique used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It may produce complications. The indocyanine green (ICG) retention rate at 15 min (ICGR15) has been used to predict complications after hepatectomy. In this study, the prediction of the value of ICGR15 for complications of RFA to the patients with HCC was evaluated.Methods:Some 878 cases of HCC treated between June 2009 and June 2013 were evaluated. All patients were treated by percutaneous radiofrequency ablation. Patients were divided into two groups: a complication group (85 cases) and a complication-free group (793 cases). ICGR15 and other baseline characteristics of the two groups were compared. A logistic regression model was used to analyse the merits of assessing liver reserve to predict complications post-RFA.Results:Complications such as intra-abdominal haemorrhage and pleural effusion occurred in 85 (9.68%) patients after RFA. Patients in the two groups did not differ with regard to baseline parameters. Patients in the two groups did differ significantly in ICGR15 and tumour site (p Conclusions:The present results demonstrated that RFA is minimally invasive and suitable for the treatment of HCC. They also showed that ICGR15 did not independently predict for liklihood of post-RFA complications, after controlling for tumour site. Patients with tumours located subcapsularly or near the porta hepatis were found to have significantly higher rates of post-operative complications after RFA than to patients with tumours in the liver parenchyma.
