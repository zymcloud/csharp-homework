Purpose:This study addressed whether age is prognostic for overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).Patients and methods:A total of 20,023 patients from 24 first-line clinical trials in the ARCAD (Aide et Recherche en Canc√©rologie Digestive) database were analyzed. Primary age effects and interactions with age,sex, performance status (PS), and metastatic site were modeled using Cox proportional hazards stratified by treatment arm within study.Results:Of total patients, 3,051 (15%) were age < or =50 years. Age was prognostic for both OS (P < .001)and PFS (P < .001), with U-shaped risk (i.e., highest risk was evident in youngest and oldest patients). Relative to patients of middle age, the youngest patients experienced 19% (95% CI, 7% to 33%) increased risk of death and 22% (95% CI, 10% to 35%) increased risk of progression. The oldest patients experienced 42% (95% CI, 31% to 54%) increased risk of death and 15% (95% CI, 7% to 24%) increased risk of progression or death. This relationship was more pronounced in the first year of follow-up. Age remained marginally significant for OS (P = .08) when adjusted forPS, sex, and presence of liver, lung, or peritoneal metastases, and age was significant in an adjusted model for PFS (P = .005). The age effect did not differ by site of metastatic disease, year of enrollment, type of therapy received, or biomarker mutational status.Conclusion:Younger and older age are associated with poorer OS and PFS among treated patients with mCRC. Younger and older patients may represent higher-risk populations, and additional studies are warranted.
