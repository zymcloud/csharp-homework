MicroRNA molecules have been increasingly regarded as a diagnostic and prognostic marker of certain diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and clinical significance of miR-122 and miR-29 in liver disease related to hepatitis B virus infection. The serum levels of miR-122 and miR-29 in 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 20 patients with liver cirrhosis (LC), 29 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 20 cases of hepatitis B virus carriers (ASC), and 20 healthy controls (HC) were determined by a fluorescence real-time quantitative PCR method and then evaluated by clinical correlation analysis. Compared with the serum levels of miR-122 in the HC, LC, and ASC groups, those in patients with HCC and CHB were significantly increased. The serum levels of miR-29 in LC patients were lower than those in the healthy controls (P
