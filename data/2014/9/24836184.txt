Objectives:Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 (ITIH4) is associated with various diseases. We evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic significance of serum ITIH4 levels in healthy controls and patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver cirrhosis, and HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Design and methods:The study enrolled 300 individuals (50 healthy controls, 50 with CHB, 100 with HBV-associated cirrhosis, and 100 with HBV-associated HCC). Serum ITIH4 levels were determined by western blot analysis and expressed in densitometry units (DU).Results:ITIH4 levels were higher in CHB (mean: 252.96 DU) and liver cirrhosis (mean: 206.43 DU) patients than in healthy controls (mean: 75.92 DU) and HCC patients (mean: 92.86 DU) (P200 ng/mL) and low ITIH4 compared to that among other HCC patients (P=0.041).Conclusions:Serum ITIH4 levels are reduced in HCC patients compared to that in CHB and cirrhosis patients, and low serum ITIH4 levels are associated with shorter survival in HBV-associated HCC patients.
