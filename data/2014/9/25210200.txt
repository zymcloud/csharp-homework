To assess the efficacy of combining radioimmunoconjugate [(131)I] metuximab with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment compared with RFA alone, a single-center randomized controlled trial was conducted on 127 patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system (BCLC) classifications of 0-B stage. Patients received either RFA followed by [(131)I] metuximab (n = 62) or RFA alone (n = 65). The primary outcome was overall tumor recurrence. Statistical tests were two-sided. The one- and two-year recurrence rates in the combination group were 31.8% and 58.5%, whereas those in the RFA group were 56.3% and 70.9%, respectively. The median time to overall tumor recurrence was 17 months in the combination group and 10 months in the RFA group (P = .03). The RFA-[(131)I] metuximab treatment showed a greater antirecurrence benefit than RFA in the metuximab target (ie, CD147)-positive subpopulation (P = .007). [(131)I] metuximab may yield prevention of tumor recurrence after RFA.
