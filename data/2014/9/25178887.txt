We present a 57-year-old Caucasian man with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) twice achieving complete remission with reduced dose sorafenib. His initial diagnosis of HCC rapidly improved with sorafenib and he achieved a complete biochemical and radiographic response within 7 months. Remission lasted only 5 months but we noted that the timing of his relapse was immediately after he incidentally discontinued clopidogrel. It was restarted and within 5 months of restarting clopidogrel he once again achieved complete remission. The course of his remission was followed and temporal association of sorafenib remission with use of clopidogrel was observed.
