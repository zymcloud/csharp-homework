Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) is recently demonstrated to function as an oncogene involved in the development and progression of cancers. However, little is known about GOLPH3 expression and its clinical significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The levels of GOLPH3 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein in HCC cell lines and fresh tissues were determined by quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. Additionally, the protein expression of GOLPH3 was detected in 167 paraffin-embedded HCC samples by immunohistochemistry. GOLPH3 mRNA and protein was overexpressed in HCC cell lines and tissues than the immortalized normal hepatocyte cell line LO2 and the adjacent nontumorous live tissues, respectively. High GOLPH3 expression was positively correlated with high serum AFP level (P = 0.015) and more tumor recurrence or metastasis (P = 0.010). In addition, HCC patients with high GOLPH3 expression had poorer overall survival (hazard ratio (HR), 1.87; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.19-2.94; P = 0.006) and poorer disease-free survival (HR, 1.90; 95 % CI, 1.21-2.98; P = 0.005) than those with low GOLPH3 expression. The cumulative 5-year survival rate was only 35.19 % (95 % CI, 26.18-44.20 %) in the high GOLPH3 expression group, whereas it was 55.93 % (95 % CI, 43.26-68.60 %) in the low GOLPH3 expression group. Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the expression of GOLPH3, tumor size, and tumor multiplicity were independent prognostic predictors for HCC patients. GOLPH3 was overexpressed in HCC at both the mRNA and protein levels, and high expression of GOLPH3 could be served as a novel and potential prognostic biomarker for HCC patients.
