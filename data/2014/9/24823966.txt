Background:Various inflammation-based prognostic scores, including the Glasgow prognostic score (GPS), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), prognostic index (PI), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI), have been associated with survival in patients with several types of cancer. This study compared the ability of these scores to predict recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative hepatectomy.Methods:Data were collected prospectively from 113 patients who underwent curative resection for HCC from January 2003 to December 2012. Clinicopathological variables including preoperative inflammation-based prognostic scores were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors predictive of RFS.Results:Univariate analysis showed that NLR (P Conclusions:Preoperative NLR is an independent predictor of RFS in patients with HCC after curative hepatectomy, and is superior to the other inflammation-based prognostic scores.
