Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a leading cause of liver disease worldwide, with 75% of those affected distributed in the Asia-Pacific region. Approximately one million HBV-infected patients die of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) each year. If left untreated, 6-20% of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients will develop cirrhosis over five years. The cumulative incidence of HBV-related cirrhosis, disease progression, and prognosis are closely associated with serum HBV DNA levels. Antiviral therapy in HBV-related cirrhosis has been documented by several long-term cohort studies to decrease disease progression to hepatic decompensation and HCC. The approval and availability of oral antiviral agents with better safety profiles has greatly improved the prognosis for HBV-related cirrhosis. Here, we discuss the significance of antiviral therapy for HBV-related cirrhosis and the management of HBV-related diseases in the future.
