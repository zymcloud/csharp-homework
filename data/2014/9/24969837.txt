Induction of apoptosis through activation of the TRAIL pathway is considered to be a promising anticancer strategy due to its ability to selectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells. However, the ability of cancer cells to acquire TRAIL resistance has limited the clinical translation of this approach. We previously reported that the TOR signaling pathway regulator-like (TIPRL) protein contributes to the resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the MKK7-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway via MKK7â€‘TIPRL interaction. In the present study, we identified Tussilago farfara L. (TF) as a novel TRAIL sensitizer among 500 natural products using an ELISA system that specifically detects the MKK7-TIPRL interaction, and we validated candidates by GST-pull down assay. Co-treatment of Huh7 cells with TF and TRAIL induced apoptosis via inhibition of the MKK7-TIPRL interaction and an increase in MKK7/JNK phosphorylation. This is the first report to describe TF as a novel TRAIL sensitizer, unveiling a potentially novel therapeutic strategy in cancer therapy.
