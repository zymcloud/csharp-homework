Background/aim:The kinase inhibitor sorafenib is the only approved drug which is effective against late-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mean survival of patients is still less than one year, making new approaches for tumor treatment essential. Oncogenic signaling through β-catenin is frequently overactivated in HCC and therefore a potential target for a combination therapy with sorafenib.Materials and methods:Two hepatoma cell lines were treated with non-cytotoxic concentrations of sorafenib and different β-catenin inhibitors. The tumor-relevant end-points of proliferation, apoptosis, cell migration, and colony formation were assessed in vitro along with the activity of the Wingless/Int-1(WNT)/β-catenin and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.Results:Combined treatment with sorafenib and β-catenin inhibitors synergized in the inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, colony formation ability, and induction of apoptosis.Conclusion:In vitro data suggest that the combination of sorafenib and β-catenin inhibition might be a promising approach for HCC treatment.
