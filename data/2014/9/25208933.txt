Introduction:The angiotensin-converting enzyme gene (ACE) is directly involved in the process of cancer cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and angiogenesis. It also plays a vital role in inducing liver fibrosis and developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and the risk of HCC in a Chinese Dai population.Materials and methods:We conducted a study including 210 patients with HCC and 206 healthy controls in Yunnan Cancer Hospital between January 2012-January 2014. I/D genotypes of ACE were determined with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes.Results:The ACE D allele was more frequent in the HCC cases than in the controls (51.7% vs 44.4%, p=0.036). Individuals with DD genotypes were associated with increased HCC risk compared with those with the II genotypes (odds ratio (OR), 1.911; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.081-3.379; p=0.025). However, the ACE I/D polymorphism were not significantly associated with any clinicopathological characteristics such as the tumor stage, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.Conclusions:The DD genotypes of ACE I/D polymorphism might contribute to the prediction of HCC risk in a Chinese Dai population.
