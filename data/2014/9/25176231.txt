Oleanolic acid (3Î²-hydroxy-olean-12-en-28-oic acid; OA-01), a pentacyclic triterpene, exhibit a wide range of pharmacological and biological activities. We have isolated oleanolic acid from methanolic extract of Periploca aphylla, collected from surroundings of Karachi in the month of February. Furthermore, four known and two new C-28 amino acid conjugates of oleanolic acid were prepared to explore potential of these compounds on HCCs and one breast cancer cell line. Cytotoxic effects revealed that as compare to parent compound (OA-01), two derivatives OA-04 (p
