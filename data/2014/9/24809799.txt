Liver transplantation (LT) is an established treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and sorafenib (SFN) is a validated treatment for patients harboring advanced tumors. It is still not clear whether the combination of the 2 treatments, with SFN used in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or recurrence setting, is useful and cost-effective. This article summarizes the present evidence in favor of and against the use of SFN in the setting of LT for HCC, and it also includes the problem of toxicity, particularly when mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, which play a central role in regulating cellular growth and proliferation, are used as immunosuppressants. Overall, the data do not support the use of SFN in the pre- or post-LT setting as adjuvant therapy, and additional studies are needed to reach sound conclusions on the topic.
