Purpose:Aprepitant, a CYP3A4 substrate, effectively prevents chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Oral aprepitant 1 h before intravenous infusion of docetaxel does not change the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. In practical combination chemotherapy, oral aprepitant is given 3 h before docetaxel infusion. We examined effects of this treatment schedule on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel.Methods:Inhibition constant (K(i)) of aprepitant for CYP3A-mediated docetaxel hydroxylation was estimated with human liver microsomes. A prospective, open-label, triple-crossover study was performed in balanced groups of cancer patients who received three consecutive cycles of docetaxel, consisting of docetaxel alone (A), docetaxel plus aprepitant given 3 h before docetaxel (B1), and docetaxel plus aprepitant given 1 h before docetaxel (B2). Three treatment arms were studied: Arm I, B1 followed by A and B2, respectively; Arm II, B2 followed by A and B1, respectively; and Arm III, A followed by B2 and B1, respectively. Pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and aprepitant were evaluated on day 1.Results:The K(i) value was estimated to be 9.82 ÂµM. Eligible patients (20) were allocated to Arm I (8), Arm II (7), or Arm III (5). On combined analysis of data from all patients assigned to Arms I-III, there were no significant differences among cycles A, B1, and B2 in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of docetaxel or the docetaxel AUC divided by actual dose. Pharmacokinetics of aprepitant showed large interindividual variability.Conclusion:Administration of aprepitant 3 h before docetaxel infusion did not alter the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel.
