Background:Graft local infusion and splenectomy in ABO-incompatible (ABO-I) living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) are associated with high rates of operative complications.Methods:Consecutive ABO-I LDLT patients treated at the National Cancer Centre between January 2012 and February 2013 were identified. The protocol for ABO-I LDLT at the study centre included the administration of rituximab (300 mg/m(2)) at 2 weeks preoperatively, followed by plasma exchanges (target isoagglutinin titre: â‰¤ 1:8), basiliximab (20 mg on the day of surgery and on postoperative day 4), and i.v. immunoglobulin (0.8 g/kg on postoperative days 1 and 4) without graft local infusion or splenectomy.Results:Fifteen patients (11 men and four women) who underwent transplantation for liver cirrhosis (n = 3) or hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 12) were identified. These included 13 patients with hepatitis B virus infection, one with hepatitis C virus infection and one with alcoholic cirrhosis. The mean age, mean Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and mean graft-to-recipient weight ratio (GRWR) of these patients was 51.8 years, 11.5 and 0.84, respectively. The median isoagglutinin titre before plasma exchange was 1:32 (range: 1:4 to 1:256). There were no hyperacute or antibody-mediated rejections. No bacterial or fungal infections were observed. Complications included herpes zoster viral infection in one patient, postoperative bleeding in one patient and extrahepatic biliary stricture in three patients.Conclusions:This simplified ABO-I LDLT protocol showed good graft outcomes without immunologic failure or serious infections.
