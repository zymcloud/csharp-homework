Objective:The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of liver transplantation and resection for very early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, â‰¤ 2 cm) patients with Child-pugh A liver function and portal hypertension.Methods:From 2008 to 2013, 38 patients with Child-pugh class A liver function and portal hypertension were diagnosed as very early HCC, of whom 13 patients who received liver transplantation and 25 patients underwent liver resection. We compared the preoperative characteristics, recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates of two group.Results:The baseline characteristics of two groups were similar. No perioperative mortality and liver failure were observed in both groups. The 1-, 3- and 5-year RFS rates of patients received liver resection and liver transplantation were 92.3%, 92.3% 92.3% and 92.0%, 71.7% and 64.5% respectively (P=0.140). The 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates of two groups were also similar (100%, 91.7% and 91.7% for group T versus 100%, 93.3% and 93.3% for group R, P=0.695).Conclusion:Liver resection can offer satisfactory outcomes for very early HCC patients with well liver function and portal hypertension and should be considered as the first line choice for selected patients.
