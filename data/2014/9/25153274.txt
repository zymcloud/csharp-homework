Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging play critical roles in the diagnosis and staging of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The first article of this two-part review discusses key concepts of HCC development, growth, and spread, emphasizing those features with imaging correlates and hence most relevant to radiologists; state-of-the-art CT and MR imaging technique with extracellular and hepatobiliary contrast agents; and the imaging appearance of precursor nodules that eventually may transform into overt HCC.
