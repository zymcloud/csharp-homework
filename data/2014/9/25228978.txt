Background/aims:Among borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC), group B BRPC patients have findings that are suggestive but not diagnostic of metastasis. In this study, we attempted to validate whether group B could truly be categorized as a borderline resectable group.Methods:We placed the BRPC patients into group A or group B. The survival outcomes were compared between the groups.Results:A total of 53 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma was classified as either group A or B borderline resectable. In group A, 23 (60.5%) of 38 patients underwent pancreatectomy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy, but in group B, only five (33.3%) of 15 patients underwent pancreatectomy, mainly because of the progression of suspected distant metastasis. There was a significant difference in overall survival (OS) between group A and B patients (median OS, 21.2 months vs 10.2 months, respectively; p=0.007). Of the patients who underwent pancreatectomy, group B had a higher recurrence rate compared to group A (recurrence rate: 11 of 23 patients [47.8%] vs five of five patients [100%], respectively; p=0.033).Conclusions:This report is the first to validate the definition of BPRC. Group B had much worse outcomes, and whether group B BRPC can be categorized as BRPC together with group A is questionable.
