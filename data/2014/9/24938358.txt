HBx is a multifunctional regulator that interacts with host factors to contribute to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, to explore the co-localization of HBx and COXIII in HepG2 cells and to investigate the molecular mechanism of HBx in HepG2 cell growth promotion, we first constructed a HepG2 cell line stably expressing the HBx gene in vitro by lentivirus vectors. In addition, we found that HBx co-localized with the inner mitochondrial protein, COXIII, in HepG2 cells by confocal laser scanning microscopy. It led to changes of mitochondrial biogenesis and morphology, including upregulation of COXIII protein expression, increased cytochrome c oxidase activity and higher mitochondrial membrane potential. The upregulation of COX-2 caused by HBx through generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species promoted cell growth. Thus, we conclude that co-localization of HBx and COXIII leads to upregulation of COX-2 that promotes HepG2 cell growth. Such a mechanism provides deeper insights into the molecular mechanism of HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma.
