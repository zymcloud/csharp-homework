The aim of the study described here was to evaluate the significance of the hepatic filling rate of a perflubutane microbubble agent in predicting long-term outcomes and prognoses in 32 patients with cirrhosis (37-76 y, 20 females, Child-Pugh A16, B16). The time from delivery of the contrast agent to the hepatic artery to maximum enhancement of the liver parenchyma on the sonogram was defined as the hepatic filling rate (mean = 18.6 s). Hepatic filling rate did not correlate significantly with the Child-Pugh score or the model for end-stage liver disease score. However, the survival rate was lower (93.3% at 1 y, 60.2% at 3 y) and the rate of occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was higher (13.3% at 1 y, 33.3% at 3 y) in the group with the slow filling rate (â‰¥18 s) than in the group with the rapid filling rate (
