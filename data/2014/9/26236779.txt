The modeling of tracer kinetics with use of low-temporal-resolution data is of central importance for patient dose reduction in dynamic contrast-enhanced CT (DCE-CT) study. Tracer kinetic models of the liver vary according to the physiologic assumptions imposed on the model, and they can substantially differ in the ways how the input for blood supply and tissue compartments are modeled. In this study, single-input flow-limited (FL), Tofts-Kety (TK), extended TK (ETK), Hayton-Brady (HB), two compartment exchange (2CX), and adiabatic approximation to the tissue homogeneity (AATH) models were applied to the analysis of liver 4-phase DCE-CT data with fully continuous-time parameter formulation, including the bolus arrival time. The bolus arrival time for the 2CX and AATH models was described by modifying the vascular transport operator theory. Initial results indicate that single-input tracer kinetic modeling is feasible for distinguishing between hepatocellular carcinoma and normal liver parenchyma.
