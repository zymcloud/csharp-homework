Proteins of the karyopherin superfamily including importins and exportins represent an essential part of the nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery. However, the functional relevance and regulation of karyopherins in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poorly understood. Here we identified cellular apoptosis susceptibility (CAS, exportin-2) and its transport substrate importin-α1 (imp-α1) among significantly up-regulated transport factor genes in HCC. Disruption of the CAS/imp-α1 transport cycle by RNAi in HCC cell lines resulted in decreased tumor cell growth and increased apoptosis. The apoptotic phenotype upon CAS depletion could be recapitulated by direct knockdown of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) and partially reverted by XIAP overexpression. In addition, XIAP and CAS mRNA expression levels were correlated in HCC patient samples (r=0.463; PConclusion:The CAS/imp-α1 transport cycle is linked to XIAP and is required to maintain tumor cell survival in HCC. Moreover, CAS and imp-α1 are targets of p53-mediated repression, which represents a novel aspect of p53's ability to control tumor cell growth in hepatocarcinogenesis.
