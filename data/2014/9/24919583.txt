The effect of diabetes on cirrhosis, its decompensation, and their time relationship in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients remains unclear. We conducted a nation-wide cohort study by using the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database, which is comprised of data from >99% of the entire population. Among having randomly sampled 1 million enrollees, 6,251 adult CHC patients were identified from 1997 to 2009. Diabetes was defined as new onset in CHC patients who were given the diagnosis in the years 1999-2003, but not in 1997-1998. The cohorts of CHC with new-onset diabetes (n=424) and nondiabetes (n=1,708) were followed up from inception point in diabetes and from year 1999 in the nondiabetes cohort until development of cirrhosis or its decompensation, withdrawal from insurance, or December 2009. Kaplan-Meier's survival analysis showed a significantly higher cumulative incidence of cirrhosis (relative risk [RR]=1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.11-2.11; log-rank test; PConclusion:CHC patients who develop diabetes are at an increased risk of liver cirrhosis and its decompensation over time.
