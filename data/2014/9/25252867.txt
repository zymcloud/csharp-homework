Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the main viral causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is associated with lymphoproliferative disorder such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). However, there are only few case reports on concomitantly induced NHL and HCC by HCV. Herein, we report a case of synchronous NHL and HCC in a patient with chronic hepatitis C which was unexpectedly diagnosed during liver transplantation surgery. This case suggests that although intrahepatic lymph node enlargements are often considered as reactive or metastatic lymphadenopathy in chronic hepatitis C patients with HCC, NHL should also be considered as a differential diagnosis.
