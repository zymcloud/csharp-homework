Objective:The detection of possible correlation between ribosomal protein RPS27A and multifunctional YB-1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Design and methods:Tissue microarray slides containing totally 80 cores with 19 tissues of HCC, 1 tissue of hepatocholangiocarcinoma, 10 tissues of liver cirrhosis and 10 normal liver tissues in duplicates were analyzed for expression of RPS27A and YB-1 by immunohistochemistry.Results:Among each of 10 LC and normal liver tissues all (100%) showed RPS27A positive expression but only 11 out of 19 HCC tissues (57.89%) showed RPS27A positive expression with significant difference compared (PConclusion:The present investigation concludes that the ribosomal protein RPS27A was down-regulated in viral induced HCC patients. RPS27A expression was found to have a weak inverse correlation with overexpression of multifunctional protein YB-1 in HCC tissues. This study opens up a new window for YB-1-RPS27A axis in HCC.
