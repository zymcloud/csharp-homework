Aim:The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) aged 75 years or older.Methods:The study included 422 patients with HCC, who were divided into two age groups: 75 years or older (n = 140) and younger than 75 (n = 282). Outcomes were compared between the two groups.Results:The number of elderly patients treated with supportive care alone (33 patients; 24%) was significantly higher than younger patients (30 patients; 11%, P Conclusion:Advanced age is a negative prognostic factor in patients with HCC due to the tendency for frequent use of conservative treatment rather than locoregional or surgical treatment.
