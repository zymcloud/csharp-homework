Objectives:This study was conducted to compare 10-year survivors with patients who survived Methods:A retrospective review of a series of hepatic resections conducted in a referral centre for HCC between January 1987 and October 2002 was conducted.Results:A total of 176 patients were analysed. Twenty-eight patients survived â‰¥ 10 years (Group A) and were compared with the 148 patients who did not (Group B). Group A had smaller tumours (5.7 cm versus 8.2 cm; P = 0.001) and a lower incidence of microvascular invasion (18.5% versus 37.1%; P = 0.004). Recurrence did not differ significantly (Group A 18/28, 64.3% versus Group B 94/148, 63.5%). Median time to recurrence was longer in Group A (70 months versus 15 months; P 2 years after primary resection (P = 0.045) were significantly associated with 10-year survival.Conclusions:Ten-year survival after liver resection for HCC can be expected in approximately 15% of patients. Recurrence does not preclude longterm survival. Recurrence at >2 years after resection, absence of vascular invasion, and absence of perioperative transfusion are independently associated with 10-year survival.
