Purpose:To assess if radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) may influence the evaluation of perfusion parameters obtained with CT-perfusion (CT-p) in HCC treated patients.Materials and methods:Thirty-three consecutive cirrhotic patients with biopsy-proven diagnosis of HCC lesions and candidates to TACE or RFA were included. The CT-p study of hepatic parenchyma and of treated lesions was performed about 1 month after treatment on 16 multidetector CT after injection of 50mL of non ionic contrast agent (350mg I/mL) at a flow rate of 6mL/s acquiring 40 dynamic scans. A dedicated perfusion software which generated a quantitative map of arterial and portal perfusion by means of colour scale was employed.The following perfusion parameters were assessed before and after RFA or TACE treatment: hepatic perfusion (HP), arterial perfusion (AP), blood volume (BV), time to peak (TTP), hepatic perfusion index (HPI).Results:A complete treatment was obtained in 16 cases and incomplete treatment in the 17 remaining cases. The perfusion data of completely treated lesions were: HP 10.2±6.3; AP 10.4±7; BV 4.05±4.8; TTP 38.9±4.2; HPI 9.9±9.2, whereas in partially treated lesions were: HP 43.2±15.1mL/s/100g; AP 38.7±8.8mL/min; BV 20.7±9.5mL/100mg; TTP 24±3.7s; HPI 61.7±7.5%. In adjacent cirrhotic parenchyma, the parameters of all evaluated patients were: HP 13.2±4; AP 12.3±3.4; BV 11.8±2.8; TTP 43.9±2.9; and HPI 17.1±9.8. A significant difference (PConclusion:According to our results, CT-p evaluation is not influenced by TACE or RFA treatments, thus representing a feasible technique that allows a reproducible quantitative evaluation of treatment response in HCC patients.
