The majority of neuroendocrine tumors appear to be sporadic. Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) typically arises in pancreatic, parathyroid and adrenal glands, but rarely arises in salivary glands. NEC of the tonsil is a rare type of tumor and the concurrent presentation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is considered to be more uncommon. There are few case reports of NEC of the tonsil in the literature and to date no studies have been conducted to establish its optimal management. The current study presents a case of a 72-year-old male who presented with left neck and tonsil tumors. A biopsy from the tonsil revealed a NEC, and computed tomography showed liver cirrhosis, multiple liver cancers and portal vein thrombosis, as well as metastasis to the hilar, abdomen and retroperitoneum. Histological examination of the hepatic revealed primary HCC. To the best of our knowledge, this is a condition that has not previously been reported.
