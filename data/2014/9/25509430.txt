Results of combined treatment, using roentgen-surgical interventions, of 58 patients, suffering noncolorectal metastatic affection of the liver, complicated in 20 (34.5%) of them by obturation jaundice, were analyzed. While resectability of the metastases, preoperatively chemotherapy (CHT) or chemoembolization of hepatic artery (CHEHA) in 1 - 2 courses were performed, and then - hepatic resection of various volume, adjuvant regional CHEHA or systemic CHT. Median survival of the patients have constituted 31.2 mo. While presence of nonresectable metastases a regional chemoinfusion via hepatic arteries or CHEHA (2 - 3 courses) were performed. Median survival of this group of patients have constituted 15.3 mo. Application of cytostatics for regional therapy have permitted in 4 (6.9%) patients, in whom partial tumor regression was achieved, to perform radical hepatic resection. Complete answer on the treatment was not achieved in any patient, partial answer was noted in 16 (33.3%), the process stabilization - in 20 (41.7%), the tumor progress - in 12 (25.0%). In total 170 endovascular and 41 transcutaneous transhepatic endobiliary interventions were performed. After operation 1 (12.5%) patient died.
