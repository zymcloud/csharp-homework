Purpose:To evaluate the role of C-arm computed tomography (CT) performed at the proper hepatic artery or equivalent in patients with caudate-lobe hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for the detection of tumor-feeding arteries during chemoembolization.Materials and methods:From July 2009 to June 2012, 1,785 patients received initial chemoembolization at a single institution. Among them, 52 patients with caudate HCC underwent initial chemoembolization with the use of C-arm CT. C-arm CT images were obtained at the proper hepatic artery or equivalent. Two radiologists reviewed the C-arm CT scans and angiograms in consensus. The cumulative local recurrence rate was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:Tumor-feeding arteries were single (n = 31), double (n = 12), triple (n = 6), and quadruple (n = 3). Seventy-nine tumor-feeding arteries and their origins in 48 patients were demonstrated on C-arm CT. In four patients (7.7%), five tumor-feeding arteries were not clearly indicated on C-arm CT because of poor image quality caused by failure of the patients to hold their breath. Selective chemoembolization via tumor-feeding arteries was successful in 45 patients (87%). The cumulative local recurrence rates at 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years were 19.4%, 32.8%, and 35.8%, respectively. Nonselective chemoembolization of tumor-feeding arteries of caudate-lobe HCC was a significantly important factor in higher cumulative local recurrence rates (hazard ratio, 3.916; 95% confidence interval, 1.367-11.216; P = .011).Conclusion:C-arm CT obtained at the proper hepatic artery or equivalent level can demonstrate most tumor-feeding arteries supplying HCCs in the caudate lobe.
