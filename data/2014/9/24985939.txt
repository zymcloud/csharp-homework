Background aims:The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) on tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo and to elucidate the apoptotic and anti-proliferative mechanisms of MSCs on a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) murine model.Methods:The growth-inhibitory effect of MSCs on the Hepa 1-6 cell line was tested by means of methyl thiazolyl diphenyl-tetrazolium assay. Eighty female mice were randomized into four groups: group 1 consisted of 20 mice that received MSCs only by intrahepatic injection; group 2 consisted of 20 HCC mice induced by inoculation of Hepa 1-6 cells into livers without MSC treatment; group 3 consisted of 20 mice that received MSCs after induction of liver cancer; group 4 consisted of 20 mice that received MSCs after induction of liver cancer on top of induced biliary cirrhosis.Results:MSCs exhibited a growth-inhibitory effect on Hepa 1-6 murine cell line in vitro. Concerning in vivo study, decreases of serum alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and albumin levels after MSC transplantation in groups 2 and 3 were found. Gene expression of Î±-fetoprotein was significantly downregulated after MSC injection in the HCC groups. We found that gene expression of caspase 3, P21 and P53 was significantly upregulated, whereas gene expression of Bcl-2 and survivin was downregulated in the HCC groups after MSC injection. Liver specimens of the HCC groups confirmed the presence of dysplasia. The histopathological picture was improved after administration of MSCs to groups 2 and 3.Conclusions:MSCs upregulated genes that help apoptosis and downregulated genes that reduce apoptosis. Therefore, MSCs could inhibit cell division of HCC and potentiate their death.
