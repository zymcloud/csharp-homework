Background:Immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine are prescribed long-term after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) to prevent allograft rejection. Although these immunosuppressants are known to effectively control ulcerative colitis (UC), some post-OLT patients develop exacerbation of preexisting UC or de novo UC. Although aminosalicylates and corticosteroid courses are usually effective to treat such UC, several patients have developed uncontrollable disease and required colectomies.Case report:We have reported a patient who developed de novo UC after OLT to treat liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Existence of the HBV infection made us avoid to increase the corticosteroid dose or to use other immunosuppressants such as azathioprine or infliximab.Conclusions:In this patient, granulocyte and monocyte apheresis was highly effective in terms of inducing remission of de novo UC. No adverse event was noted.
