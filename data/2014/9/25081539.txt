CD112 as an important ligand of CD226 can stimulate the natural killer (NK) cell-mediated target cell lysis. Previous studies have reported that CD112 is involved in cancer initiation and progression. However, its expression and clinical significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have never been investigated. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry to examine CD112 expression in cancer and pericancer tissues from 159 HCC cases. Western blot and immunofluorescence were used to detect CD112 expression in HCC cell lines. Ï‡(2) Test was used to assess the association of CD112 expression with clinicopathological characteristics, whereas Kaplan-Meier survival function and Cox proportional hazards regression model were used to explore the association between CD112 expression and clinical outcome of patients with HCC. Overall, CD112 expression was significantly reduced in HCC tissues when compared with adjacent pericancer liver tissues (P
