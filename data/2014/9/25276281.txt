Significant advances have been made in nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) therapy to treat chronic hepatitis B, and this therapy reduces the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in some patients. However, whether NAs can also prevent recurrence after radical resection of HBV-related HCC remains controversial and is an important question, given that most patients will experience recurrence within a few years of curative surgery. Here we systematically reviewed the literature since 2004 on outcomes after administering NAs to patients with HBV-related HCC following radical resection. We focused on treatment indications, duration, effects on recurrence-free survival and overall survival, and the management of NA resistance. We find that patients with HCC should strongly consider NA therapy if they are positive for HBV-DNA, and that the available evidence suggests that postoperative NA therapy can increase both recurrence-free and overall survival. To minimize drug resistance, clinicians should opt for potent analogues with higher resistance barriers, and they should monitor the patient carefully for emergence of NA-resistant HBV.
