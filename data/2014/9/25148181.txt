Objective:The objective of our study was to prospectively investigate whether nonsmooth margins detected on multiphasic CT images correlate with the presence and location of microvascular invasion (MVI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Subjects and methods:A total of 102 patients with preoperative CT findings of solitary HCC were prospectively enrolled. Tumor size, tumor capsule, tumor margins, and peritumoral enhancement on preoperative CT images were assessed. Histopathologic results including the following were also recorded: tumor differentiation; liver fibrosis score; presence or absence of MVI; and, if present, the location of MVI. Correlation between tumor margin on preoperative CT images and histopathologic location of MVI was determined.Results:Pathologic examination revealed MVI in 60 of the 102 HCC specimens. Although the results of the univariate analysis showed that tumor size, higher Edmondson-Steiner grade, and nonsmooth tumor margins were associated with MVI, multivariate analysis revealed that only nonsmooth margins correlated with the presence of MVI in HCC (p Conclusion:Nonsmooth tumor margins correlated with the histopathologic presence and location of MVI. Therefore, nonsmooth margins detected on multiphasic CT may be predictive of MVI in HCC.
