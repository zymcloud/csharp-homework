Background:Different results are reported for the relationship between regional variation in medical spending and disease prognosis for acute illness and for cancer. Our objective was to investigate the association between hospital medical care spending intensity and mortality rates in cancer patients.Methods:A total of 80,597 patients with incident cancer diagnosed in 2002 were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, Republic of China. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the 5-year survival rates of patients treated at hospitals with different spending intensities after adjusting for possible confounding and risk factors.Results:After adjustment for patient characteristics, treatment modality, and hospital volume, an association was found between lower hospital spending intensity and poorer survival rates. The 5-year survival rate expressed by hazard ratios was 1.36 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.30-1.43, p < .001) for colorectal cancer, 1.18 (95% CI: 1.08-1.29, p < .001) for lung cancer, 1.13 (95% CI: 1.05-1.22, p = .002) for hepatoma, 1.16 (95% CI: 1.07-1.26, p < .001) for breast cancer, and 1.23 (95% CI: 1.10-1.39, p = .001) for prostate cancer.Conclusion:Our preliminary findings indicate that higher hospital spending intensity was associated with lower mortality rates in patients being treated for lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, hepatoma, or head and neck cancer. The cancer stages were unavailable in this series, and more research linked with the primary data may be necessary to clearly address this issue.
