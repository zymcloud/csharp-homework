Background:Opinions on the suitability of repeat hepatectomy for patients with recurrent colorectal liver metastases (CRLMs) vary among studies. We conducted a meta-analysis to establish the criteria for selecting the best candidates for a second hepatectomy.Methods:Database and manual searches were performed to identify comparative or prognostic studies published up to October 2013. Outcomes of interest included disease characteristics, perioperative outcomes, and long-term survival after initial and second hepatectomies for patients with CRLM. Study quality was appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and a modified Hayden's score.Results:A total of 7226 patients from 27 studies were included. Recurrent CRLMs after initial hepatectomy were more likely to be solitary (RR = 0.86, P = 0.045), unilobar (RR = 0.60, P < 0.001), and smaller (WMD = -0.66, P < 0.001). Postoperative morbidity and mortality were comparable between initial and second hepatectomies (RR = 1.10, P = 0.191; RR = 0.78, P = 0.678, respectively). In high-quality studies, patients showed better survival after a second hepatectomy than those after a single hepatectomy (HR = 0.68, P = 0.022). Patients meeting the following six predictors survived longer after second hepatectomy: disease-free survival after initial hepatectomy >1 y (P = 0.034); solitary CRLM at second hepatectomy (P < 0.001); unilobar CRLM at second hepatectomy (P = 0.009); maximal size of CRLM at second hepatectomy â‰¤ 5 cm (P = 0.035); lack of extrahepatic metastases at second hepatectomy (P < 0.001); and R0 resection at second hepatectomy (P < 0.001).Conclusions:Second hepatectomy is a safe and feasible procedure for patients with recurrent CRLM. In fact, in well-selected patients it improves overall survival. The established criteria can help clinicians to select the best candidates for second hepatectomy and to achieve better long-term outcomes after resection.
