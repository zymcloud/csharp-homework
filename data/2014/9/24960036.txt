Objective:To investigate the effects and technical points of laparoscopic splenectomy and esophagogastric devascularization (LS+ED) for portal hypertension (PH) due to liver cirrhosis.Subjects and methods:In total, 204 PH patients who underwent LS+ED from January 2008 to April 2013 in the Southwest Hospital of the Third Military Medical University were enrolled in this study. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data and the key technical points and compared the results with other researchers.Results:LS+ED was successfully carried out on 188 patients. The mean duration of surgery was 232±59 minutes, the mean intraoperative blood loss was 189±137 mL, the rate of blood transfusion was 19.6% (40/204), and no deaths occurred during surgery. The mean postoperative interval to passing of flatus was 3.5±0.9 days, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 8.7±2.2 days. Operative complications occurred in 100 patients, of whom 78 had portal vein system thrombosis (PVST). During a postoperative follow-up period of 2-65 months, 15 cases were lost to follow-up, esophagogastric variceal bleeding re-occurred in 7 patients, encephalopathy occurred in 2 patients, and secondary liver cancer occurred in 3 patients. Five patients died during this period.Conclusions:The technical points of LS+ED include a combined surgical approach, a reasonable surgical procedure, and an appropriate laparoscopic operating plane. LS+ED is a safe and effective treatment for minimal trauma and rapid recovery. PVST is a common and potentially life-threatening complication after LS+ED, and anticoagulation therapy should be given early.
