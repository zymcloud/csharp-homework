Background:Delayed hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroclearance increases the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The effect of metabolic syndrome (MetS) on HBeAg seroclearance in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients remains unclear.Aims:To examine the effect of MetS on HBeAg seroclearance.Methods:A prospective cohort of 413 treatment-naïve HBeAg-positive CHB patients from 2005 to 2012 was studied. Clinical, virological and histological parameters were evaluated. The patients were classified into three groups according to the metabolic characteristics; normal, pre-MetS and MetS based on the International Diabetes Federation criteria. The primary outcome was age at HBeAg seroclearance.Results:The overall HBeAg seroclearance rate was 11.4% per annum during 19 351 patient-months of follow-up with no difference in HBeAg seroclearance rates between 162 treatment-free and 251 patients receiving nucleos(t)ide analogues. Patients with pre-MetS and MetS were older when HBeAg seroclearance occurred (44 ± 12 and 53 ± 7 years, respectively) than the normal patients (37 ± 9 years, all P Conclusion:Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B and with pre-metabolic syndrome or metabolic syndrome have delayed HBeAg seroclearance.
