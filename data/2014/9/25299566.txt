Crizotinib (XALKORI(â„¢), Pfizer) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of ALK, MET, and ROS1, which is currently approved for the second line treatment for ALK-rearranged lung cancer. This work from an expert group, based on the review of the data from the Profile studies, aims to provide practical elements in order to optimize the tolerability of crizotinib. Specific major or frequent side effects of crizotinib are discussed: visual disturbances, cardiac effects, elevated transaminases, and hypogonadism. In the routine practice, patients should be advised about visual disturbances, especially with regard to driving in low brightness. Digestive disorders related to crizotinib are exceptionally persistent or severe. Dietary measures and symptomatic treatments usually control these disorders. It is recommended to perform an electrocardiogram before introduction of crizotinib, to identify prolonged QT interval. Torsades de pointes may produce dizziness or syncope. Hypogonadism should be considered in case of fatigue, decreased libido, and even depression, taking into account that these symptoms may be related to cancer; testosterone serum level should be measured to identify patients that may be eligible to receive a supplementation. Monitoring of liver function tests, including transaminases and bilirubin, is necessary. To conclude, these practical elements are helpful to optimize treatment with crizotinib in patients with ALK-rearranged lung cancer; in the future, academic initiatives should be taken to study these aspects, based on the monitoring of large cohorts of patients treated with crizotinib.
