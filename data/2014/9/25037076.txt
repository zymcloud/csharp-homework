Purpose:The routine use of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) prior to resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not recommended, although its use in the transplant setting is gaining popularity. In the absence of other effective neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment options, TACE may benefit selected patients. The aim was to evaluate the feasibility and outcomes of preoperative TACE for selected patients with HCC.Methods:From November 2010 to October 2012, 23 patients of HCC were selected by a multidisciplinary team to undergo TACE prior to resection.Results:TACE was successful in all patients with no intraprocedural complications. TACE reduced the mean maximum tumor diameter from 9.2 to 8.2 cm and increased the mean future liver remnant (FLR) from 37.7 % to 49.1 %. Nineteen resections were completed with negative margins, of which only three patients (15.8 %) had cirrhosis. Two patients (10.5 %) experienced postoperative bile leaks and six patients (31.5 %) developed postoperative liver failure, two (10.5 %) of which succumbed to grade C liver failure. From the date of surgery, the median follow up time was 17.1 months. Four patients (17 %) did not undergo curative resection due to disease progression in three patients and severe TACE toxicity in one patient. None of the resected patients developed disease recurrence and the overall survival was 21 months.Conclusion:Encouraging outcomes in terms of disease recurrence and overall survival need to be balanced with the risk of surgical drop out and perioperative complications when selecting patients for TACE prior to resection.
