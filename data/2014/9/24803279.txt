Introduction:The identification of microvessel density (MVD) in patients suffering from different types of cancer has become a hot point as an emerging and promising biomarker. The aim of the present study is to clarify the prognostic relevance of MVD in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Relevant articles were screened in PubMed and EMBASE databases. Patients' clinical characteristics, overall survival (OS), disease/recurrence-free survival (DFS/RFS), and MVD levels were extracted for further analysis. The statistical analysis derived from the Kaplan-Meier survival curves was calculated indirectly with the methods developed by Parmar, Williamson, and Tierney. Multivariate Cox hazard regression analysis was used directly in Stata 11.0. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to evaluate the prognostic role of MVD in HCC.Results:Our online literature search identified 12 articles including a total of 1,138 HCC patients. Meta-analysis of all the included studies considering survival outcomes showed a positive correlation between poor prognosis and higher-MVD levels. The pooled HRs (and 95% CIs) for OS and DFS/RFS were respectively 2.08 [1.77-2.45] and 2.64 [2.12-3.29]. Subgroup analyses considering tumor stage (I-II/III-IV), tumor size (Conclusion:Our meta-analysis showed that the available evidence supports the proposition that MVD has a good predictive role in HCC, especially when the patients have late stage, large size, or poorly differentiated tumors.
