Background & aims:Preoperative fine-needle aspiration biopsy (PFNAB) allows obtaining reliable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis before liver transplantation (LT) in doubtful situations, but may result in higher recurrence rates following LT. This study aimed to evaluate whether PFNAB actually jeopardized the outcome of patients with transplantable HCC.Methods:From 2002 to 2012, among 309 HCC patients listed for LT, 80 (26%) underwent PFNAB (PFNAB+). Their characteristics, modalities of recurrence, and survivals were retrospectively compared to those of the 229 (74%) patients without PFNAB (PFNAB-).Results:The two groups (PFNAB+ vs. PFNAB-) were similar in terms of demography, rates of lesions within the Milan criteria (81% vs. 79%, p=0.676), and duration on the waiting list (7.0 vs. 6.9 months, p=0.891). Dropout following tumour progression was similar between both groups (6% vs. 11%, p=0.424). Among the 278 (90%) transplanted patients, pathological analysis revealed that 11 (4%) patients had non-HCC lesions including 10 in PFNAB- patients. Median follow-up was 34 months (12-135) and recurrence after LT was observed in 25 (9%) patients with no difference between both groups (9.3% vs. 8.9%, p=0.904). Parietal recurrence was observed in one PFNAB+ patient and in 2 PFNAB- patients after radiofrequency ablation (p=0.797). On an intention to treat basis, 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survivals (89%, 69%, and 60% vs. 85%, 67%, and 61%, p=0.601) were not significantly different between PFNAB+ and PFNAB- patients.Conclusions:This study supports that preoperative tumour biopsy does not negatively influence the oncologic course of HCC patients eligible for LT. Hence, there is no argument to restrict biopsy in doubtful situations.
