Objective:To evaluate the capacity of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to determine the histological grade of small-sized hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in liver cirrhosis in comparison with T2 weighted imaging.Methods:51 cirrhotic patients with 63 histologically proven HCCs ≤2 cm underwent abdominal MRI, including DWI (b-values 50, 400 and 800 s mm(-2)) and T2 weighted sequences. HCCs were classified into well-differentiated HCCs (n = 37) and moderately differentiated HCCs (n = 26). Relative contrast ratios (RCRs) between the lesions and the surrounding liver were performed and compared between the two groups for T2 weighted images, each b-value and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to compare RCRs in T2 and diffusion-weighted images.Results:We found significant differences in RCRs between well-differentiated vs moderately differentiated HCCs for b = 50, 400 and 800 s mm(-2) and T2 weighted images (1.35 ± 0.36 vs 1.86 ± 0.62; 1.35 ± 0.38 vs 1.82 ± 0.60; 1.27 ± 0.30 vs 1.74 ± 0.53; 1.14 ± 0.18 vs 1.43 ± 0.28, respectively; p Conclusion:The RCR measurement performed in DWI 50, 400 and 800 b-values and T2 demonstrated a significant difference between well-differentiated and moderately differentiated small-sized HCCs. Furthermore, no difference was shown by using either ADC or ADC RCR.Advances in knowledge:DWI with RCR measurement may be a valuable tool for non-invasively predicting the histological grade of small HCCs.
