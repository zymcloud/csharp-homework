Never in mitosis gene A-related kinase (Nek) 6 is a recently identified Nek that is required for mitotic cell cycle progression; however, the role and mechanism of Nek6 activity during hepatocarcinogenesis is not well known. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential roles and internal mechanism of Nek6 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. In the present study, Nek6 was found to be overexpressed in HCC samples and cell lines by florescent real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Furthermore, it was evidenced to contribute to oncogenesis and progression. The ectopic overexpression of Nek6 promoted cell proliferation and colony formation, whereas gene silencing of Nek6 inhibited these phenotypes, as documented in Huh7, PLC/PRF/5, Hep3B and HepG2 HCC cell lines. Mechanistic analyses indicated that Nek6 regulates the transcription of cyclin B through cdc2 activation, and promotes the accumulation of G0/G1-phase cells. In conclusion, the findings of the current study suggested that Nek6 contributes to the oncogenic potential of HCC, and may present as a potential therapeutic target in this disease.
