Background:Alterations of adiponectin (APN), one of the adipokines, have been associated with human cancers. However, the clinical significance and impacts of APN on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain undetermined.Methods:Using immunohistochemistry, expression patterns of APN were semiquantitatively scored and further statistically correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and patient survival. Furthermore, the bioeffects and underlying mechanisms of ectopic APN overexpression were determined in Hep3B and HepG2 cells by XTT, immunoblotting, flowcytometry, and invasion assays with or without chemical inhibitors and neutralization antibody.Results:We found that cytoplasmic APN staining in 85 cancerous lesions was increased and associated with a poor survival rate (P = 0.007), even when using the Cox regression model (OR = 3.590; 95 % CI = 1.240-10.394; P = 0.018). Ectopic overexpression of APN in Hep3B and HepG2 cells increased proliferation and invasion as well as the levels of p-AKT (Ser473), p-STAT3 (Tyr705), and those downstream, i.e., cyclin D1 and Î²-catenin. Similar results were also demonstrated in a stable APN-overexpressing clone, HepG2#136. APN neutralization antibody and LY294002 blocked the APN-mediated effects via inhibition of activated AKT.Conclusions:Our results suggest that increased APN may contribute to HCC at least in part through its activation of AKT signalling and may serve as a prognostic factor in HCC.
