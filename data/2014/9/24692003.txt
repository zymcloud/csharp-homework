Background:Leukocyte subsets in peripheral blood, which include neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes, have not been well established as prognostic factors in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Consecutive patients who underwent curative hepatic resection for HCC at the National Cancer Center, Republic of Korea, from 2001 to 2008 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Clinicopathologic factors, cancer-specific survival (CSS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed with respect to preoperative lymphocyte subsets, especially monocyte ratio.Results:The 603 patients had a median follow-up of 40.0 months and a 5-year overall survival rate of 67.7 %. In univariate analysis of survivals, preoperative lymphocyte ratio ≤35 % and monocyte ratio >7 % were significantly poor prognostic factors. In multivariate analysis, preoperative monocyte ratio >7 %, satellite nodule, and microvascular invasion were independent risk factors for CSS and DFS (hazard ratio of monocyte ratio >7 % = 1.77, p = 0.02 and 1.57, p = 0.006, respectively). Considering monocyte ratio with preoperative α-fetoprotein level, patients with both abnormal α-fetoprotein levels (>12 ng/mL) and monocyte ratio >7 % showed significantly worse CSS and DFS than other groups (p 7 % showed significantly poor CSS and DFS compared with non-cirrhotic patients (p = 0.033 and Conclusions:A preoperative monocyte ratio >7 % of peripheral blood is an independent risk factor for CSS and DFS after hepatic resection for HCC. Preoperative monocyte ratio might be considered as a novel biomarker for HCC.
