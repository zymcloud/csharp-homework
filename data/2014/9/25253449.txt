Background:Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of mortality worldwide. Patients with COPD frequently have systemic comorbidities that often require unscheduled hospitalization for exacerbation and deterioration of physical conditions, and can have a poor prognosis. We verified factors affecting patients' short-term mortality, using a national inpatient database in Japan.Methods:We retrospectively collected data for COPD patients (age: >40 years) with emergency admission between July 2010 and March 2013, using the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database. We performed multivariate logistic analyses fitted with a generalized estimating equation to assess factors associated with all-cause in-hospital mortality.Results:A total of 177,207 patients (mean age: 77.5 years; males: 72.9%) were identified. All-cause in-hospital death occurred in 23,614 patients (13.7%). Higher mortality was associated with older age, male sex, lower body mass index, more severe dyspnea, lower level of consciousness, and worse activities of daily life. Higher mortality was also associated with comorbid conditions, including bacterial pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary embolism, respiratory failure, lung cancer, heart failure, cerebral infarction, liver cirrhosis, and chronic renal failure.Conclusions:Our study demonstrated that all-cause in-hospital mortality in patients with COPD who required emergency hospitalization was associated with deteriorated general conditions and comorbidities at admission. Physicians should take into account these prognostic factors to choose better treatment options for COPD patients.
