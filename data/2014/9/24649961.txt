Background & aims:All outcome studies concerning the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are based on the initial treatment. However, remaining, progressing or recurring tumours (RPRTs) after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) are common; therefore, various second treatments are administered to HCC patients. Here, we investigated the long-term outcomes of second treatments for RPRT after initial TACE.Methods:We enrolled 855 consecutive HCC patients who underwent TACE as the initial treatment at the National Cancer Center, Korea, from January 2004 to December 2010.Results:The median follow-up was 43.4 months, and the median progression-free survival following initial TACE was 4.0 months, being 18.1 and 1.0 months for complete remission and progressive disease respectively. Second treatments were administered to 790 RPRT patients (92.4%); the most common was TACE (56.4%), followed by best supportive care (22.8%), systemic chemotherapy (9.4%), external radiotherapy (4.4%), radiation ablation (RFA; 2.9%), resection (2.0%) and liver transplantation (1.4%). Median overall survival (mOS) for initial TACE was 18.8 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 16.6-21.0 months]; after second treatments, it was 12.4 (95% CI, 10.6-14.2) months, differing significantly by mRECIST assessment, BCLC stage and RPRT type (28.0, 5.0 and 3.9 months for intrahepatic, vascular and extrahepatic RPRT, respectively; P Conclusion:These novel insights into the patterns and long-term outcomes of second treatments for RPRT in HCC patients who underwent initial TACE are expected to aid in formulating treatment strategies for HCC patients.
