FR429, an ellagitannin (a type of polyphenol), is isolated and purified from Polygonum capitatum Buch.-Ham.ex D. Don which is the original herbal medicine of the "Re-Lin-Qing" formula used clinically to treat urinary tract infection in China. FR429 has been investigated for its antitumor potential in tumor-bearing nude mice in vivo, but its in vitro anti-tumor effect in hepatoma cell lines was low. Thus, it was of our interest to investigate its metabolism pathways for supporting its in vivo antitumor potential. The metabolic profiles of FR429 were studied in vitro by liquid chromatography coupled to ion trap time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Total eight metabolites were identified in rat and human liver microsomes, cytosol, and rat primary hepatocytes in vitro. Ellagic acid, a reported anti-angiogenic agent, was one of the main metabolites in these biological matrices. Methylated metabolites catalyzed by catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) were observed mainly in the in vitro incubation with rat liver cytosol, which was verified by using a COMT specific inhibitor entacapone and supported by molecular docking analysis. Methylated and sulfated metabolites were also found in rat primary hepatocytes in a time-dependent manner. In conclusion, the in vitro metabolism pathways of FR429 were hydrolysis, methylation and sulfation. The anti-tumor effects of its major metabolites should be further studied.
