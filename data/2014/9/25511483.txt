Objective:To investigate related clinical factors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients received transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) complicated with hepatogenous diabetes (HD).Methods:Forty eight cases of HCC line after TACE combined HD patients as the case group, and another forty eight cases of HCC line after TACE without HD patients as control group. A case-control study was retrospectively analyzed among two groups. A logistic regression modelwas established.Results:Multivariates analysis showed that family history of diabetes (OR = 3.464, 95% CI 1.100-10.909, P = 0.034), HBV DNA >1 × 10⁵ IU/ml (OR = 5.420, 95% CI 1.235-23.792, P = 0.025), liver function Child-Pugh C (OR = 7.653, 95% CI 1.385-42.301, P = 0.020), major larger tumors >10 cm (OR = 5.347, 95% CI 1.499-19.067, P = 0.010), the initial embolism area > 70% (OR = 9.031, 95% CI 1.782-48.537, P = 0.008), TACE > 3 times (OR = 3.726, 95% CI 1.151-12.065, P = 0.028) were independent risk factors of HD in patients with HCC after TACE.Conclusion:Family history of diabetes, HBV DNA > 1 × 10⁵ IU/ml, Child-Pugh C, major tumors size > 10 cm, the initial embolism area > 70%, TACE > 3 times were independent risk factors of HD in HCC patients after TACE. As for factors to these patients, the blood glucose was monitored promptly in order to early diagnosis and treatment.
