To investigate the clinical significance of 128 slice whole liver four dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) in diagnosis and differential diagnosis of hepatic disease, by characterizing and comparing perfusion maps in two common hepatic tumors: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver hemangioma. 45 patients with HCC and 40 patients with liver hemangioma were subjected to 128 slice 4D CT of the whole liver perfusion scan, perfusion images were obtained, and data were processed by the perfusion software. Four perfusion parameters generated automatically were used to characterize and compare the perfusion of tumor tissue and surrounding hepatic parenchyma: blood flow perfusion (BF), arterial liver perfusion (ALP), portal venous perfusion (PVP), and hepatic perfusion index (HPI). Volumetric CT perfusion data then reconstructed to yield 4D CT angiography. Morphological observation was made regarding to the blood supply of tumor, intrahepatic vasculature. (1) In both HCC and hepatic hemangioma, BF, ALP, HPI were higher (P
