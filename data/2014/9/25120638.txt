In the present study, the effect of Aurora-B inhibition on HepG2 cell invasion and migration in vitro was investigated. A recombinant plasmid targeting the Aurora-B gene (MiR-Aurora-B) was used to inhibit Aurora-B expression in HepG2 cells. Cell migration and invasion were investigated using Transwell migration and invasion assays. The results demonstrated that cell invasion and migration were suppressed by inhibiting Aurora-B. In addition, the effect of Aurora-B inhibition on the activity of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway was investigated by analyzing the protein expression levels of phosphorylated (p)-Akt, Akt, NF-κB p65, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 using western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that the protein expression levels of p-Akt, NF-κB p65, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were reduced significantly by inhibiting Aurora-B. Therefore, inhibition of Aurora-B was shown to suppress hepatocellular carcinoma cell migration and invasion by decreasing the activity of the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway in vitro.
