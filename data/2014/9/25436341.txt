Background/aims:Splenectomy is performed in patients with severe cirrhosis who have a low platelet count. A portal vein thrombus (PVT) is one of the complications associated with splenectomy. This study aimed to identify predictive factors of postoperative PVT following splenectomy.Methodology:Twentyeight patients who underwent splenectomy between April 2003 and March 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups: the PVT(+) group comprising 11 patients who developed postoperative PVT, and the PVT(-) group comprising 17 patients who did not develop postoperative PVT. The patient characteristics of the 2 groups were analyzed. Results: In univariate analysis, the platelet count, rate of simultaneous treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, and preoperative spleen volume were significantly different between the groups (p Conclusions:In patients with severe cirrhosis scheduled to undergo splenectomy, if the preoperative spleen volume is >450 mL, as measured by enhanced computed tomography, preventive administration of anticoagulant therapy is recommended to reduce the risk of PVT development.
