Objective:To compare the effectiveness of percutaneous microwave ablation with those of repeat hepatectomy in the treatment of late recurrent small hepatocellular carcinoma measuring â‰¤ 5 cm (interval of recurrence from initial hepatectomy was > 12 months).Methods:66 patients who underwent initial hepatectomy for primary liver cancer in April 1998 to December 2010, and subsequent initial recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma treated with percutaneous microwave ablation or repeat hepatectomy, were enrolled in the study. Among these patients 39 were treated with percutaneous microwave ablation and 27 were treated with repeat hepatectomy. Technique effectiveness was evaluated by means of contrast enhanced techniques one month after ablation. The overall survival and disease-free survival were evaluated by using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:The technique effectiveness rate determined one month after ablation was 94.9%. The 1, 3, and 5 year overall survival rates were 86.2%, 73.3%, and 62.2%, respectively, for the microwave ablation group and 96.2%, 76.9%, and 61.2%, respectively, for the repeat hepatectomy group (P = 0.471). The corresponding recurrence-free survival rates were 65.8%, 28.0%, and 14.0%, respectively, for the microwave ablation group and 66.7%, 50.7%, and 43.4%, respectively, for the repeat hepatectomy group (P = 0.323).Conclusions:In patients with late recurrent small hepatocellular carcinoma, Percutaneous microwave ablation was efficient, and showed similar long-term survival and recurrence-free survival compared with repeat hepatectomy.
