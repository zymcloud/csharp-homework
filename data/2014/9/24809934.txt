Aim:To investigate whether image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) improves survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) relative to 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT).Methods:Between 2006 and 2011, 187 HCC patients treated with definitive RT were reviewed. Median age was 53(range 51-83). All patients were stage III or IV-A. Concurrent chemoradiation was received by 178 patients (95.2 %). Overall actuarial survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and infield-failure-free survival (IFFS) analyses were performed by Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis. Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare patient characteristics and treatment-related toxicity between the groups.Results:Sixty-five patients were treated with IG-IMRT and 122 patients with 3D-CRT. No significant differences were seen between the groups for all patient characteristics. IG-IMRT delivered higher doses than 3D-CRT (median biological effective dose 62.5 vs 53.1 Gy, P Conclusion:Our findings suggest that IG-IMRT could be an effective treatment that provides survival benefit without increasing severe toxicity in locally advanced HCC.
