Kin17 protein is ubiquitously expressed in mammals and is correlated with vital biological functions. However, little is known about the role of Kin17 in the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the upregulation of Kin17 can promote the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. A series of assays was performed to study the effect of Kin17 in the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. The western blotting results revealed that Kin17 expression was increased in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues compared with that of the corresponding normal tissues. Moreover, ectopic upregulation of Kin17 expression promoted the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. These results indicated that Kin17 is involved in the tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma, and that Kin17 has the potential to serve as a therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma.
