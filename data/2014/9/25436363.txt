Background/aims:Factors contributing to the shift from the hepatic borderline lesion to overt hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were investigated.Methodology:Ninety-five borderline nodules from 69 patients were followed-up for 6-55 (median 24) months. The borderline lesion was diagnosed when the CT image demonstrated low density in the portal phase and lacked enhancement in the arterial phase.Results:The shift to overt HCC was seen in 32 nodules from 27 patients. Using multivariate analysis, only size was a significant factor contributing to the shift to overt HCC (p = 0.009). The cumulative incidence of the shift to overt HCC was higher in nodules of â‰¥13 mm in size than in those of Conclusions:In hepatic borderline nodules diagnosed by CT, greater size, and iso density in the arterial phase and low density in the portal phase may be risk factors associated with the shift to overt HCC.
