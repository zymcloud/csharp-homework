Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary tumor of the liver. It mostly occurs in older age groups (usually those 50 to 60 years old), and rarely in young adults. The survival rate of these young HCC patients is usually very low. The authors report a case of a 22-year old man with diffuse-type HCC who successfully achieved complete remission for 46 months after second transcatheter arterial chemoembolization using gelatin sponge particles (Eric Kang Pharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd. Hangzhou, China) combined with pirarubicin.
