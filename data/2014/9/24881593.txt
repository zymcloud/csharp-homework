Tamoxifen (TAM) is routinely used in the treatment of breast carcinoma. TAM-induced liver injury remains a major concern, as TAM causes hepatic steatosis in a significant number of patients, which can progress toward steatohepatitis. Liver toxicity is generally believed to involve mitochondrial dysfunction and TAM exerts multiple deleterious effects on mitochondria, which may account for the hepatotoxicity observed in patients treated with TAM. Endoxifen (EDX), a key active metabolite of TAM that is being investigated as an alternative to TAM in breast cancer therapy, slightly affects mitochondria in comparison with TAM and this demonstration well correlates with the absence of alterations in the clinical parameters of individuals taking EDX. The steady-state plasma concentrations of TAM and its active metabolites EDX and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHTAM) in patients taking TAM are highly variable, reflecting genetic variants of CYP2D6 involved in TAM metabolism. Besides de genetic polymorphisms, the intake of drugs that influence the enzymatic activity of CYP2D6 compromises the therapeutic efficiency of TAM. The knowledge of the impact of the variability of TAM metabolism in the breast cancer treatment explains the discrepant outcomes observed in patients taking TAM, as well as the individual variability of idiosyncratic liver injury and other sides effects observed. Therefore, and contrarily to the clinical use of EDX, the need of therapeutic drug monitoring and a regular assessment of liver function biomarkers should be considered in patients under therapies with TAM. In this review we focus on the mitochondrial effects of TAM and its metabolites and on the role played by mitochondria in the initiating events leading to TAM-induced hepatotoxicity, as well as the clinical implications.
