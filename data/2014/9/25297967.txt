Aim:CD26 is a membrane glycoprotein that has multiple functions, including dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity. CD26 expression varies in different tumor types, and its role in tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear.Methods:CD26 expression levels were examined in resected HCC and surrounding non-cancerous lesions. The effect of CD26 knockdown on the cellular proliferation of HepG2 or Huh7 cells, both of which highly express CD26, was studied in vitro.Results:CD26 mRNA expression levels were significantly increased in HCC compared with their surrounding non-cancerous lesions. We confirmed that various HCC cell lines, especially HepG2 and Huh7 cells, showed high expression levels of CD26. siRNA-mediated knockdown of CD26 suppressed hepatoma cell growth in vitro. CD26 knockdown induced cell cycle arrest through the upregulation of Cip/Kip family proteins, p21 in HepG2 cells and p27 in Huh7 cells. CD26 knockdown did not affect apoptosis, but it increased expressions of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and Bak and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL, suggesting an addiction of CD26 knockdown cells to Bcl-xL for survival. We thus treated CD26 knockdown cells with ABT-737, a Bcl-xL/-2/-w inhibitor, and observed that the synthetic lethal interaction of combined Bcl-xL and CD26 inhibition induced significant apoptosis and impaired cellular viability.Conclusion:CD26 mRNA was overexpressed in HCC, and its inhibition suppressed cellular proliferation through cell cycle arrest. The combined use of CD26 knockdown with a Bcl-xL inhibitor further elicited substantial apoptosis and therefore may serve as a powerful anticancer combination therapy against HCC.
