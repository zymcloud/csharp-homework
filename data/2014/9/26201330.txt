The prognosis of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poor. For patients with advanced HCC, the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is recommended as the current standard of care. In contrast, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) is one of the recommended treatments in Japan. However, in Japan, the use of sorafenib versus hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy for first-line treatment remains unclear, because there have been no randomized controlled trials comparing HAIC with sorafenib. HAIC can substantially prolong survival in patients with complete and partial response, while non-responders may be suitable candidates for sorafenib therapy. Nonetheless, HAIC non-responders with deteriorated liver function currently have no treatment options. We have shown the efficacy of an alternative therapy, the iron chelator deferoxamine, for advanced HCC patients with deteriorated liver function. Iron chelators may have future therapeutic possibilities in this patient population.
