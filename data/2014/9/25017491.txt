Nü-zhen-zi, the fruit of Ligustrum lucidum Ait., is one of the most frequently used liver Yin tonifying Chinese herbs for the treatment of liver cancer. However, the effect of Ligustrum lucidum fruit on hepatocarcinoma cells remains unknown. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a Ligustrum lucidum fruit extract (LLFE) on human hepatocellular carcinoma Bel-7402 cells. The results showed that LLFE inhibited the proliferation of the Bel-7402 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. LLFE induced apoptosis in Bel-7402 cells accompanied by activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9. LLFE-induced apoptosis was completely abrogated by a pan caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK. LLFE treatment also caused a large and flat morphologic cellular change, positive SA-β-gal staining, and G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest in the Bel-7402 cells, accompanied by upregulation of p21 and downregulation of RB phosphorylation. Specific knockdown of p21 expression by RNA interference partially abrogated LLFE-induced apoptosis, and significantly abrogated LLFE-induced cell senescence. These observations suggest that Nü-zhen-zi is a potential anticancer herb and support the traditional use of Nü-zhen-zi for hepatocarcinoma treatment.
