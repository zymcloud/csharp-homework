Myeloid cells are key regulators of the tumor microenvironment, governing local immune responses. Here we report that tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells and circulating monocytes in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) express ligands for activating the Natural killer group 2, member D (NKG2D) receptor, which cause down-regulation of NKG2D on natural killer (NK) cells. Tumor-infiltrating NK cells isolated from GBM patients fail to lyse NKG2D ligand-expressing tumor cells. We demonstrate that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoform 5 secreted by glioblastoma cells induces NKG2D ligands on monocytes isolated from healthy individuals. Furthermore, sera from GBM patients contain elevated amounts of LDH, which correlate with expression of NKG2D ligands on their autologous circulating monocytes. NKG2D ligands also are present on circulating monocytes isolated from patients with breast, prostate, and hepatitis C virus-induced hepatocellular carcinomas. Together, these findings reveal a previously unidentified immune evasion strategy whereby tumors produce soluble factors that induce NKG2D ligands on myeloid cells, subverting antitumor immune responses.
