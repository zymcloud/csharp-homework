Aim:MiR-506 is a miRNA involved in carcinogenesis of several kinds of cancer. In this study, we explored whether miR-506 played a critical role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Twenty HCC and adjacent normal liver tissue samples were collected. Human hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and H7402 were used for in vitro studies. The expression of miR-506 and transcriptional co-activator YAP was examined using qRT-PCR. Western blot analysis was used to measure the expression of YAP and its target genes. Luciferase reporter gene assay was used to identify YAP as a target gene of miR-506. MTT and EdU assays were carried out for functional analysis.Results:The expression of miR-506 was significantly lower in HCC than in adjacent normal liver tissues. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that YAP mRNA might be one of the targets of miR-506, and miR-506 in HCC tissues was found to be negatively correlated with YAP (r=-0.605). In both HepG2 and H7402 cells, miR-506 dose-dependently down-regulated YAP and its target genes c-Myc and the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Luciferase reporter gene assays demonstrated that miR-506 targeted the wild type 3'UTR of YAP mRNA, but not a 3'UTR with a mutant seed site. Furthermore, miR-506 significantly inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 and H7402 cells, while anti-miR-506 enhanced the cell proliferation, which was blocked by YAP siRNA.Conclusion:MiR-506 suppresses the proliferation of hepatoma cells by targeting YAP mRNA.
