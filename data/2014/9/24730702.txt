Background and aims:Analysis of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels affords limited diagnostic accuracy because of the high false-positive rates, especially in those with active chronic hepatitis B (CHB). We measured AFP levels before and after commencement of oral antiviral therapy and explored the utility of these data in terms of early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with CHB.Methods:A total of 207 patients with CHB who were treated with an oral antiviral agent were consecutively included. Dynamic changes in AFP levels and the diagnostic utility of such changes for HCC detection during the therapy were explored.Results:The proportions of patients showing elevated AFP levels (≥ 20 ng/mL) were 22.2%, 5.5%, and 1.3% at baseline; and at 6 and 12 months after commencement of antiviral therapy, respectively. All patients who did not suffer from HCC exhibited normalization of AFP levels at 12 months. The cumulative incidence of HCC was 9.5% during 36 months of follow-up. If AFP levels were over 20 ng/mL after 12 months of antiviral treatment, the probability of HCC development approached certainty. The positive predictive value for HCC development remained at 100% in patients prescribed long-term (≥ 12 months) antiviral therapy, if AFP levels persistently or abruptly elevated more than 12 ng/mL.Conclusions:In the era of oral antiviral agents, AFP might be a useful biomarker for HCC surveillance in patients with CHB.
