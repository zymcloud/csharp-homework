MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a class of evolutionarily conserved, non-coding small RNAs (18-25 nt) that have emerged as master regulators of several biological processes. Recently, circulating miRNAs have also been reported to be promising biomarkers for various pathological conditions. In the present study, we report the comparative expression profiling of microRNA-101 (miR-101) in serum and tissue samples from chronic hepatitis B (CHB), HBV-associated liver cirrhosis (HBV-LC), and HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-HCC) patients and healthy controls. The serum miR-101 levels were found to be significantly downregulated in the HBV-HCC patients compared with the HBV-LC patients (P
