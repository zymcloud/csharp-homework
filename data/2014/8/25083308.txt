Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common solid tumors in the world. HCC muscle and cutaneous metastases are rare and can occur by hematogenous spread or following surgical procedures performed for diagnostic or therapeutic aims.Case study:We present a 47-year-old man underwent liver biopsy followed by surgical resection for moderately differentiated HCC in January 1999. In February 2010 the patient presented with HCC cutaneous metastases in the surgical scare and with HCC metastases of the right abdominal rectus muscle. En bloc tumor resection with the right abdominal rectus muscle was performed. In March 2011 the patient underwent resection of a locoregional muscle relapse. In November 2011 we started Sorafenib for intraepatic recurrence.Discussion:This case suggests that in the follow-up of patients who underwent surgical resection or diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for HCC should be considered the possibility of abdominal wall metastasis even after many years, particularly in the cases with favorable evolution.
