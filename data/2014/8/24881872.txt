Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Schistosoma mansoni are two major causes of chronic liver disease (CLD). Both immune alteration and thrombocytopenia are common complications in the majority of cirrhotic patients. The current study aimed to monitor the effect of T cell profile and platelets activation on the pathogenesis of liver cirrhosis in patients suffered from single or concomitant schistosomiasis and HCV infections. The subjects were divided into 4 groups: Group I, patients infected with schistosomiasis; Group II, patients infected with HCV; Group III, patients with combined liver diseases and Group IV: healthy individuals. All groups were subjected to full clinical evaluation as well as laboratory examination including ELISA anti-HCV antibodies screening, parasitological examination, and complete blood picture as well as flow cytometry for CD41, CD42, CD62P (P selectin), CD63, CD4 and CD8. The platelets count was significantly decreased in HCV and/or schistosoma infected patients compared to controls. The percentage of the total T-lymphocytes and T-helper was significantly reduced in all infected groups, while the percentage of T-cytotoxic was increased. The patients possessed a significantly higher percentage of the platelets activation markers than control group. There were considerable correlations between the platelets counts and P selectin and MFI. Thrombocytopenia was a common finding in patients with CLD. Patients with CLD showed increased platelets activation which may contribute to the occurrence of thrombocytopenia and play a role in the pathogenesis of CLD. Infected patient showed reduction in the cell-mediated-immunity as evidenced by low T -helper cells.
