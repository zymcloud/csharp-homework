Introduction:Here we report the first systematic evaluation of laparoscopic parenchymal-sparing segmentectomies for the resection of lesions in the central liver segments and the first series of laparoscopic mesohepatectomies.Patients and methods:From 1995 to 2012, 482 laparoscopic hepatectomies were performed. Thirty-two patients underwent isolated resection of IVa and VIII, bisegmentectomies of IVa/IVb and V/VIII, or mesohepatectomy. Sixteen isolated resections of IVb or V were excluded. Data was extracted from a retrolective database and chart review. Complications were classified (Clavien-Dindo) by three independent surgeons. Seventeen patients had colorectal liver metastasis, four had neuroendocrine tumors, five had hepatocellular carcinoma, two had GIST, and one each had esophageal cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma. Fifteen patients underwent anatomic- and 17 non-anatomic wedge resection. Average blood loss was 403 cc (SD 475), and overall operative time was 183 (SD 106) for hepatectomy and 253 min (SD 94) for mesohepatectomies. Major complications were mainly attributable to synchronous procedures. Mortality, transfusion, and morbidity rates were 0, 12, and 37 %, respectively.Conclusion:Parenchymal-sparing laparoscopic central liver resections and mesohepatectomies are feasible, safe, and effective if specific technical details we have learned over time are considered. Concomitant procedures should be an exception. This approach exhibits an alternative to open surgery while avoiding unnecessary sacrifice of functional parenchyma.
