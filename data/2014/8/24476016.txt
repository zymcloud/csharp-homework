Background:Many case reports describe tuberculosis (TB) co-existent with a malignant neoplasm. However, the neoplasm in most of these reports is lung or breast cancer, with only two cases of liver cancer concomitant with TB reported in the literature. Although both TB and cancer are very common diseases, little attention has been given to the pathophysiologic and practical implications of their co-existence.Methods:Case report and literature review.Case report:A 73-year-old female patient with a history of hypertension and hepatitis C presented with abdominal pain of 2 mos duration. Laboratory findings showed an elevated serum concentration of Î±-fetoprotein. A computed tomography scan demonstrated a solitary hypodense tumor in the right lobe of the liver (segment VIII). A pre-operative chest radiograph was within normal limits. The patient underwent an uneventful tumor resection. Histologic examination of a surgical specimen of the tumor demonstrated a moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma co-existent with caseating granulomas.Conclusion:Through this case report, the authors discuss the pathogenesis of the rare association of TB and malignant neoplasm of the liver, and present a review of the current literature on the association of TB and cancer. Further research is required to determine whether a TB infection resembles other chronic infections and inflammatory conditions in having a potential to facilitate oncogenesis.
