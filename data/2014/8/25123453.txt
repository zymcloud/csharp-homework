Background:Whether microRNA-130b(miR-130b) can serve as a prognostic biomarker of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been investigated. In the present study, we investigated the feasibility of miR-130b as a novel prognostic biomarker for HCC.Methods:We retrospectively investigated 97 patients diagnosed with HCC who underwent routine curative surgery between May 2007 and July 2012. miR-130b expression in HCC tissues and paired normal adjacent liver tissues was measured by reverse transcription and real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method and differences in survival rates were analyzed using the log-rank test.Results:miR-130b expression level was significantly higher in HCC tissues compared with normal adjacent liver tissues (PConclusion:The results indicated that high expression of microRNA-130b was correlated with significant characteristics of patients with HCC, and it might be useful as a novel prognostic biomarker for HCC.Virtual slides:The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/13000_2014_160.
