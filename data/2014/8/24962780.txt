Noble-metal nanoparticles (NPs) especially prepared from gold and silver have been combined on the surface of graphene to obtain graphene-based nanocomposites for novel functions in enhanced performance in bio-imaging, cancer detection and therapy. However, little is known about their cellular uptake, especially the intracellular quantity which plays a critical role in determining their functions and safety. Therefore, we prepared covalently conjugated GO/Au and GO/Ag composites by immobilizing Au and Ag nanoparticles on GO sheets pre-functionalized with disulfide bonds, respectively. The cellular uptake of these composites was quantitatively studied by means of an ion beam microscope (IBM) to determine the metal content in human lung cancer cells (A549 cells) and liver hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2 cells). The cell uptake was also studied by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), which is one of the most sensitive techniques being applied to cell suspensions, for comparison. Toxicity, one of the consequences of cellular uptake of GO based composites, was studied as well. The potential toxicity mechanism was also suggested based on the results of intracellular quantification of the nanomaterials.
