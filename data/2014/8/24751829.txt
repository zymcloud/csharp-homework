Background & aims:Genetic polymorphisms modulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. We prospectively assessed the influence of 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TNFα, IL6, and IL1β genes on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with cirrhosis.Methods:TNFα (G-238A, C-863A, G-308A), IL6 (C-174G), and IL1β (C-31T, C-511T) SNPs were assessed in 232 alcoholics and 253 HCV-infected patients with biopsy-proven cirrhosis, prospectively followed-up and screened for HCC. Their influence on HCC development was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:These variants did not influence the risk of HCC in alcoholic patients. Conversely, two variants influenced the risk of HCC occurrence in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis, namely the TNFα-308 (A) allele (HR = 2.4 [1.6-3.7], Log-rank Conclusions:Genetic heterogeneity in the TNFα and IL1β gene promoters influences the risk of HCC in patients with HCV-induced cirrhosis. These genetic data, when incorporated into clinical scores, are able to refine selection of risk classes of HCC.
