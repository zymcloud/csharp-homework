Purpose:To investigate whether serum microRNA-210 (miR-210) level can serve as an indicator of prognosis and a predictor of efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Serum miR-210 level was measured in 113 patients with HCC before transarterial chemoembolization (t1), 3 days after transarterial chemoembolization (t2), and 4 weeks after transarterial chemoembolization (t3) and compared with 39 healthy control subjects. The correlations between miR-210 levels and clinicopathologic factors, tumor responsiveness, and prognosis were analyzed. The modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors assessment was conducted at t3.Results:A higher mean baseline miR-210 level was observed in patients with HCC compared with control subjects (3.69 ± 2.04 vs 1.08 ± 0.45, P Conclusions:Serum miR-210 may represent a novel biomarker for predicting efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization and overall survival for patients with HCC.
