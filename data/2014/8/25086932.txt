Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest growing cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Cirrhosis is the most important risk factor for HCC. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the modality of choice for working up nodules detected at screening, for staging known HCC, and for follow-up. In cirrhotic livers, the combination of tumor arterial phase hyperenhancement plus washout and/or capsular enhancement is highly specific for HCC and can make biopsy unnecessary. Newer imaging techniques may further improve MR imaging sensitivity for HCC and help to characterize tumors with atypical dynamic enhancement patterns.
