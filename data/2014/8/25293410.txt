Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) affects around 16,000 individuals in Denmark of whom about 50% are diagnosed. In the presence of CHC and cirrhosis the annual risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is 1-5%. We report on two patients who presented with disseminated HCC at the time of CHC diagnosis. At the time of diagnosis only non-curative treatment was available. An earlier diagnosis of CHC could potentially have led to a cure and prevention of HCC.
