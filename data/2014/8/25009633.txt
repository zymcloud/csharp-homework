The aim of the present study was to investigate the value of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) measured with magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in evaluating liver fibrosis and curative effects on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with low doses of chemotherapy. In total, 84 patients with HCC not recommended for surgical resection underwent TACE. The patients were divided into small dose (n=46) and conventional dose (n=38) chemotherapy groups, and underwent MR-DWI prior to and following TACE. Examination of the four liver fibrosis indexes, hyaluronate, laminin, human procollagen type-III and collagen type-IV, as well as ADC values (b=600 sec/mm2), was conducted in the two groups. With small dose chemotherapy, the ADC values were not significantly different preoperatively and postoperatively (P>0.05). By contrast, with a conventional dose, statistically significant differences were observed between the preoperative and postoperative ADC values (P<0.01). ADC values in the small and conventional dose chemotherapy groups prior to the first cycle of TACE were 1.613±0.133×10-3 and 1.488±0.248×10-3 mm2/sec, respectively, while following four cycles of TACE, the ADC values were 1.598±0.147×10-3 and 1.206±0.222×10-3 mm2/sec, respectively. With regard to chemotherapy, the ADC values before and after TACE were significantly different (P<0.05). A significant negative correlation was observed between the ADC values and the fibrosis stage (P<0.05). Therefore, hepatic MR-DWI plays a key role in evaluating liver fibrosis following TACE with low doses of chemotherapy, resulting in improved curative effects of TACE.
