Background and purpose:Ibulocydine (IB), a novel prodrug of CDK inhibitor, has been reported to have anti-cancer effect in human hepatoma cells. In order to address its feasibility as a radiosensitizer to improve radiotherapeutic efficacy for human cancers, this study was designed.Material and methods:Human cancer cells of lung and colon were treated with IB and/or radiotherapy (RT). The cellular effects were assessed by CCK-8, clonogenic, flow cytometric, and western blotting assays. In vivo radiotherapeutic efficacy was evaluated using the xenograft mouse model.Results:Combined treatment of IB and RT significantly reduced viability and survival fraction of the cells. Apoptotic cell death accompanied with activation of caspases, decrease in Bcl-2/Bax expression, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) leading to release of cytochrome c into cytosol was observed. Recovery of Bcl-2 expression level by introducing Bcl-2 expressing plasmid DNA compromised the loss of MMP and apoptosis induced by IB and RT. In vivo therapeutic efficacy of combined treatment was verified in the xenograft mouse model, in which tumor growth was markedly delayed by RT with IB.Conclusions:IB demonstrated the property of sensitizing human cancer cells to RT by induction of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that IB deserves to be applied for chemoradiotherapy.
