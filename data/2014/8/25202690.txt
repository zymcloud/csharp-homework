Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In the past few years, the mechanisms of hepato-carcinogenesis have been elucidated and the involvement of a number of pathways, including angiogenesis, aberrant signal transduction, and dysregulated cell cycle control have been demonstrated. Myeloid lineage cells, such as macrophages and monocytes, have been reported to regulate angiogenesis in mouse models. TIE2, a receptor of angiopoietins, conveys pro-angiogenic signals and identifies a monocyte/macrophage subset with pro-angiogenic activity. Recently, one study suggests that TIE2-expressing monocyte/macrophage (TEMs) frequency can be used as a diagnostic marker for HCC.
