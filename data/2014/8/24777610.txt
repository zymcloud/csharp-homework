Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) is a rare primary liver cancer. Our aims were to analyze the demographic, clinical, and pathological characteristics of cHCC-CC at a population level and to investigate the effects of these features as well as different management strategies on the prognosis. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was analyzed for 1988-2009. Data analyses were performed with chi-square tests, analyses of variance, Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox proportional hazards regression. Four hundred sixty-five patients with cHCC-CC, 52,825 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and 7181 patients with cholangiocarcinoma (CC) were identified. cHCC-CC was more common in patients who were white, male, and older than 65 years. Treatment was more frequently nonsurgical/interventional. Patients with cHCC-CC, HCC, and CC had 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival rates of 10.5%, 11.7%, and 5.7% (P
