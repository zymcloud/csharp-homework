Rationale and objectives:To conduct a preliminary evaluation of the use of two-dimensional (2D) enhanced multiecho T2*-weighted angiography (ESWAN) sequence for detection and quantification of siderotic nodules (SNs) in patients with liver disease.Materials and methods:Seventy-four patients with liver cirrhosis SNs confirmed by pathology were imaged using conventional T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), T2*-weighted imaging (T2*WI), and 2D ESWAN. The signal intensity ratio (SIR) and the lesion-to-liver contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated. The quality of SNs identification of the ESWAN images was evaluated.Results:The SIR of SNs on ESWAN was lower than those in any other sequence, whereas the CNR of SNs on ESWAN was significantly greater than those in the other sequences (P < .05). The conspicuity of SNs was shown to be significantly different between every pair of techniques (P < .05). The nodules had the better conspicuity in ESWAN images than in the T1WI, T2WI, and T2*WI. Almost all (97.3%, 72 of 74) patients were considered to have excellent grade 3 conspicuity on ESWAN imaging, compared to 40.5% (30 of 74) for T2*WI. The signal intensity of small hepatic cancer on ESWAN was greater than those of SNs.Conclusions:The detection and conspicuity of SNs is substantially improved using breath-hold 2D ESWAN. Therefore, 2D ESWAN imaging may be an alternative for the accurate detection of hepatic SNs in the future.
