Background:The lung is one of the most common sites for extrahepatic metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to assess the efficacy of surgical resection for pulmonary metastases from HCC.Material and methods:The medical records of 9 patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy from HCC at 2 institutions were retrospectively studied, together with a review of studies reporting the outcomes of at least 5 patients in the Chinese and English languages.Results:There were no perioperative deaths or major complications. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rate after surgery was 100%, 44.4%, and 33.3%, respectively. A total of 19 studies involving 443 patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy for metastasis of HCC were included in the literature review. The median mortality rate was 0% (range, 0-7.1%). The median survival ranged from 10.7 to 77 (median=33.2) months, and the 5-year overall survival rate ranged from 11.5% to 75% (median=36%).Conclusions:Surgical resection is a safe and effective treatment in selected patients with pulmonary metastases from HCC.
