Background:Presently, the role of liver resection (LR) for multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial. However, in many regions worldwide, LR remains the only treatment modality available to such patients which offers the possibility of long-term cure. The aim of this study is to determine the outcomes and prognostic factors of patients with multifocal HCC after LR.Methods:This is a retrospective analysis of 110 patients who underwent potentially curative LR for pathologically proven multifocal HCC between 2000 and 2011.Results:The median age was 64 (range, 18-84) years, and there were 88 males (80.0 %). Sixty-one patients underwent a major hepatectomy, and the overall postoperative mortality was 1.8 %. Sixty-eight patients had liver cirrhosis, of which, 58 were child's A and 10 were child's B. The 1- and 5-year overall survival (OS) was 82 and 44 %, respectively. The corresponding 1- and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 57 and 19 %, respectively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the number of nodules (>3) and presence of microvascular invasion were associated with RFS. Number of nodules (>3), margin positivity, Child-Pugh status, and presence of microvascular invasion were independent prognostic factors of OS.Conclusions:LR followed by treatment of recurrences may result in reasonable long-term survival and should be considered in a selected group of patients with multifocal HCC. Number of nodules (>3), margin positivity, Child-Pugh status, and presence of microvascular invasion, but not tumor size, were independent negative predictors of OS. These findings have potential implications on the AJCC staging for multifocal HCC.
