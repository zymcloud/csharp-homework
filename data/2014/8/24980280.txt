Cell-death-inducing DFF45-like effector B (CIDEB) is an apoptotic host factor, which was recently found to also regulate hepatic lipid homeostasis. Herein we delineate the relevance of these dual roles of CIDEB in apoptosis and lipid metabolism in the context of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. We demonstrate that HCV upregulates CIDEB expression in human serum differentiated hepatoma cells. CIDEB overexpression inhibits HCV replication in HCV replicon expressing Huh7.5 cells, while small interfering RNA knockdown of CIDEB expression in human serum differentiated hepatoma cells promotes HCV replication and secretion of viral proteins. Furthermore, we characterize a CIDEB mutant, KRRA, which is deficient in lipid droplet clustering and fusion and demonstrate that CIDEB-mediated inhibition of HCV is independent of the protein's lipid droplet fusogenic role. Our results suggest that higher levels of CIDEB expression, which favour an apoptotic role for the host factor, inhibit HCV. Collectively, our data demonstrate that CIDEB can act as an anti-HCV host factor and contribute to altered triglyceride homeostasis.
