The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor. It heterodimerizes with aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator, binds to the xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE), and enhances the transcription of genes encoding xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes. AHR also plays important roles in the inhibition of intestinal carcinogenesis and the modulation of gut immunity. It is very important to screen for AHR-activating compounds because those are expected to produce the AHR-mediated physiological functions. Until now, AHR-mediated transcriptional activity represented by the transcriptional activity of CYP1A1 in luciferase assay has been applied as a screening procedure for AHR-activating compounds. However, the AHR-mediated transcriptional activity did not necessarily correspond with the CYP1A1 transcriptional activity. To evaluate AHR-mediated transcriptional activity more specifically, and to screen for AHR-activating compounds, we establish a stable AHR-responsive HepG2 cell line by co-transfection of an AHR expression vector and an AHR-responsive vector (pGL3-XRE) containing a luciferase gene and three tandemly arranged XRE elements into a human hepatoma derived cell line, HepG2. The induction of luciferase activity in the stable AHR-responsive HepG2 cell line by typical AHR activators occurred in time- and concentration-dependent manners. By assessing the AHR target genes CYP1A1, UGT1A1, and ABCG2, an AHR activator-mediated induction was observed at mRNA level. Furthermore, the AHR activator-mediated induction of luciferase activity was positively correlated with the mRNA levels of CYP1A1, UGT1A1, and ABCG2. These findings verified the usefulness of the established stable AHR-responsive HepG2 cell line for the screening of AHR-activating compounds.
