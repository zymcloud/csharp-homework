Background:Recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative resection continues to be a major cause of death. This prospective study is designed to investigate whether histological subclassification of cirrhosis using the Laennec system could predict recurrence in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC after curative resection.Methods:Patients with HBV-related HCC who underwent curative resection and showed Laennec stage 3 to 4 were enrolled and the cases with stage 4 were subclassified histologically into three groups (stages 4A, 4B and 4C) according to the Laennec system. Between February 2006 and August 2009, 92 patients were recruited.Results:Stage 3, 4A, 4B and 4C were identified in 24 (26.1%), 15 (16.3%), 43 (46.7%) and 10 (10.9%) patients respectively. The cumulative incidence rates of recurrence at 1, 2 and 3 years were 24.2%, 40.5% and 55.1% respectively. On multivariate analysis, serum albumin [hazard ratio (HR), 0.528; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.312-0.891; P=0.017] and Edmondson-Steiner grade III-IV (HR, 3.456; 95% CI, 1.123-10.517; P=0.031) were significantly correlated with early recurrence (Conclusions:Histological subclassification of cirrhosis using the Laennec system is a significant predictor of late recurrence in patients with HBV-related HCC after curative resection.
