Purpose:To retrospectively evaluate the conspicuity of liver lesions in a fluoroscopic spoiled gradient echo (GRE) and a balanced steady-state free precession (SSFP) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence.Materials and methods:In all, 103 patients with hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) (41) or liver metastases (67) were treated using MR-guided radiofrequency ablation in a wide-bore 1.5 T scanner. A multislice real-time spoiled GRE sequence allowing for a T1 weighting (T1W) and a balanced SSFP sequence allowing for a T2/T1W contrast were used for MR guidance. The contrast-to-noise-ratio (CNR) of the lesions was calculated and lesion conspicuity was assessed retrospectively (easily detectable / difficult to detect / not detectable).Results:HCC was easily detectable in 33/52% (GRE/SSFP), difficult to detect in 30/18%, and not detectable in 37/30% of the cases. Mean CNR varied widely (9.1 for GRE vs. 16.4 for SSFP). Liver metastases were easily detectable in 58/41% (GRE/SSFP), difficult to detect in 14/21%, and not detectable in 28/38% of the cases. Mean CNR for liver metastases was 11.5 (GRE) vs. 12.7 (SSFP). Twenty percent of all lesions could not be detected with either of the MR fluoroscopy sequences.Conclusion:MR fluoroscopy using GRE and SSFP contrast enabled real-time detectability of 80% of the liver lesions.
