Background and aim:The serpin squamous cell carcinoma antigen complexed with IgM (SCCA-IgM) has been reported as a promising serological marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to further evaluate SCCA-IgM diagnostic accuracy and to determine its prognostic role.Methods:SCCA-IgM levels were determined in 327 sera obtained from 81 HCC patients, 206 cirrhotics and 40 healthy blood donors (controls). Sensitivity, specificity, correlation with clinical and tumor parameters and with survival were evaluated.Results:HCC patients had SCCA-IgM levels significantly higher than controls and cirrhotics (P Conclusions:SCCA-IgM is a sensitive marker of HCC in patients with cirrhosis even though lacking in specificity. The determination of the levels of the marker in HCC patients is highly efficient in predicting the patients' prognosis, identifying those with long overall and progression-free survival and the responders and should be introduced in the clinical practice.
