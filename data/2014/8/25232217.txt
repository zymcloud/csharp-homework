Objective:To explore whether single and fused monochromatic images can improve liver tumor detection and delineation by single source dual energy CT (ssDECT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during arterial phase.Methods:Fifty-seven patients with HCC who underwent ssDECT scanning at Beijing Cancer Hospital were enrolled retrospectively. Twenty-one sets of monochromatic images from 40 to 140 keV were reconstructed at 5 keV intervals in arterial phase. The optimal contrast-noise ratio (CNR) monochromatic images of the liver tumor and the lowest-noise monochromatic images were selected for image fusion. We evaluated the image quality of the optimal-CNR monochromatic images, the lowest-noise monochromatic images and the fused monochromatic images, respectively. The evaluation indicators included the spatial resolution of the anatomical structure, the noise level, the contrast and CNR of the tumor.Results:In arterial phase, the anatomical structure of the liver can be displayed most clearly in the 65-keV monochromatic images, with the lowest image noise. The optimal-CNR monochromatic images of HCC tumor were 50-keV monochromatic images in which the internal structural features of the liver tumors were displayed most clearly and meticulously. For tumor detection, the fused monochromatic images and the 50-keV monochromatic images had similar performances, and were more sensitive than 65-keV monochromatic images.Conclusions:We achieved good arterial phase images by fusing the optimal-CNR monochromatic images of the HCC tumor and the lowest-noise monochromatic images. The fused images displayed liver tumors and anatomical structures more clearly, which is potentially helpful for identifying more and smaller HCC tumors.
