We performed an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and a ruptured common iliac artery aneurysm (rCIAA) in a patient complicated by severe liver dysfunction due to obstructive jaundice resulting from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A 68-year-old male presented with acute lower abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a 4.5-cm infrarenal AAA, a 6.0-cm left rCIAA with retroperitoneal hematoma and a 13-cm mass in the liver, which was suspected to be HCC. His laboratory data showed severe liver dysfunction. An emergency EVAR was done under local anesthesia because of his liver dysfunction. He was transferred to another hospital without any complications.
