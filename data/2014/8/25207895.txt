Background:The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is very high in the world. However, a safe and effective strategy is still under research.Aims:Our aim was to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of Shaoyao Ruangan Formmula (SRF) on the tumor of H22-bearing mice and explore its antitumor mechanisms.Settings and design:Corresponding physiological indexes of H22-bearing mice treated with SRF were compared with that of saline treated mice, which could reflect the tumor-suppressing effect of SRF.Materials and methods:After treatment, tumor weight, survival time, related gene expression levels etc., were recorded or detected.Statistical analysis:Data analyzed using a computer SPSS program.Results and conclusions:Comparing with blank control group, the tumor inhibitor rate (IR) of low, middle and high dose group of SRF was 17.72%, 33.99% and 23.73%, respectively. IR of CTX was 43.95%. The results also showed that each group of SRF could prolong the life span of H22-bearing mice to some extent. In addition, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results revealed that SRF was able to influence related genes expression in the tumor tissues of H22-bearing mice. The expression of TGF-β receptor type II (TBRII) gene was significantly upregulated in each SRF group comparing with normal saline group. On the contrary, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) was significantly downregulated in each SRF group comparing with normal saline group. In summary, SRF showed tumor-suppressing effect on mice with transplanted H22 hepatocarcinoma. The mechanism of antitumor effect may induced by upregulating TBRII expression and down-regulating NF-κB expression.
