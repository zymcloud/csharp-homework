An 82-year-old man died because of squamous cell carcinoma of the right lung with metastasis to the left femoral bone. At the age of 75 years, he was admitted to our hospital because of hematemesis. Widespread type 3 gastric cancer was detected in the lesser curvature. Computed tomography(CT)showed multiple liver metastases. Preoperative chemotherapy with TS-1/cisplatin(CDDP)was administered. TS-1 was orally administered at 80mg/body/day and CDDP was administered by intravenous infusion at 20mg/body/day every week for 3 weeks and this was followed by a drug-free 2-week period as the first course. After the fourth course, gastrectomy was performed for the primary lesion and radiofrequency ablation(RFA)was performed for the liver metastases. The patient survived for more than 7 years with a complete response (CR)and died thereafter because of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.
