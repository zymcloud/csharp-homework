Tripartite motif-containing 3 (TRIM3) is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family and is reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of various cancers. The role of TRIM3 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unknown; thus, the goal of this study was to explore the expression level and prognostic value of TRIM3 in HCC. The expression level of TRIM3 in HCC surgically resected tumors and corresponding nontumorous samples was detected by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. The correlation between TRIM3 expression level and the clinicopathological features and prognosis of HCC patients was also analyzed. We observed that TRIM3 expression was remarkably decreased in tumor tissue samples from HCC patients, relative to matched nontumorous tissue samples, at the mRNA (p = 0.018) and protein level (p = 0.02). Similarly, immunohistochemical analysis showed that 53.4 % of samples had low TRIM3 protein expression. Clinicopathological analysis revealed that low TRIM3 expression was significantly correlated with tumor size (p = 0.034), histological grade (p
