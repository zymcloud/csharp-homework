Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in China with high mortality, high chemotherapy resistance incidence, and poor prognosis. This study aimed to investigate the influence of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) on chemoresistance of HCC cells (HepG2, MHCC97H, and MHCC97L) to cisplatin and to explore the potential molecular mechanism. Cell viability, DNA damage, the expression level and activity of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), p53/Mdm4, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway were measured. The results showed that HBCD and PCBs could significantly reduce the chemosensitivity of HCC cells to cisplatin, increasing the cell viability and decreasing DNA damage. Moreover, HBCD and PCBs could induce the transcriptional activity of NF-κb and suppress the p53 expression in HepG2 and MHCC97H cells. In MHCC97L cells, however, opposite changes for NF-κB protein expression, NF-κB transcriptional activity, and p53/Mdm4 expression were observed after HBCD and PCBs exposure. Further investigation revealed that HBCD and PCBs exposure significantly increased the expression level of p-Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in HepG2 and MHCC97H cells, but reduced that in MHCC97L cells. PI3K inhibitor LY294002 could relieve the influence of HBCD and PCBs on chemoresistance in HepG2 and MHCC97H cells. Taken together, HBCD and PCBs at low concentrations could increase the resistance of HCC cells to cisplatin through modulation on NF-κB pathway activation and p53 function, which is associated with the activity of PI3K/Akt pathway.
