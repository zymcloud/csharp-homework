Purpose:To test the hypothesis that magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can quantify intratumoral superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticle uptake after nanoablation.Materials and methods:SPIO nanoparticles functionalized with doxorubicin were synthesized. N1-S1 hepatomas were successfully induced in 17 Sprague-Dawley rats distributed into three dosage groups. Baseline tumor R2* values (the reciprocal of T2*) were determined using 7-tesla (T) MR imaging. After intravenous injection of SPIO nanoparticles, reversible electroporation (1,300 V/cm, 8 pulses, 100-μs pulse duration) was applied. Imaging of rats was performed to determine tumor R2* values after the procedure, and change in R2* (ΔR2*) was calculated. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used to determine intratumoral iron (Fe) concentration after the procedure, which served as a proxy for SPIO nanoparticle uptake. Mean tumor Fe concentration [Fe] and ΔR2* for each subject were assessed for correlation with linear regression, and mean [Fe] for each dosage group was compared with analysis of variance.Results:ΔR2* significantly correlated with tumor SPIO nanoparticle uptake after nanoablation (r = 0.50, P = .039). On average, each 0.1-ms(-1) increase in R2* corresponded to a 0.1394-mM increase in [Fe]. There was no significant difference in mean SPIO nanoparticle uptake among dosage groups (P = .57).Conclusions:Intratumoral SPIO nanoparticle uptake after nanoablation can be successfully quantified noninvasively with 7-T MR imaging. Imaging can be used as a method to estimate localized drug delivery after nanoablation.
