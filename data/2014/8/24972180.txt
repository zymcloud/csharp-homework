Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most fatal cancers worldwide. In this study, a reversed-phase-strong cation exchange-reversed-phase three-dimensional liquid chromatography strategy was established and coupled with mass spectrometry to investigate the differential proteome expression of HCC and normal liver tissues. In total, 2759 proteins were reliably quantified, of which, 648 proteins were dysregulated more than 3-fold in HCC liver tissues. Some important proteins that relate to HCC pathology were significantly dysregulated, such as NAT2 and AKR1B10. Furthermore, 2307 phosphorylation sites from 1264 phosphoproteins were obtained in our previous phosphoproteome quantification, and the nonphosphorylated counterparts of 445 phosphoproteins with 983 phosphorylation sites were reliably quantified in this work. It was observed that 337 (34%) phosphorylation sites exhibit significantly different expression trends from that of their corresponding nonphosphoproteins. Some novel phosphorylation sites with important biological functions in the progression of HCC were reliably quantified, such as the significant downregulation of pT185 for ERK2 and pY204 for ERK1.
