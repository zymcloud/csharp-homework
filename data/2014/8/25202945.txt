Objective:To investigate the effect of Tip30 on the invasion and metastasis of hepatoma cells.Methods:Recombinant plasmid pAAV-Tip30 was transfected to HepG2 cells by polylactic-coglycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles. RT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). MMP- 2 and MMP-9 protein level in the tumor tissue was detected by Western blot. The proliferation, of hepatoma cells was evaluated by MTS assay and clone formation method. The adhesion and invasion of hepatoma cells were evaluated by adhesion assay and Transwell migration assay, respectively.Results:With RT-PCR and Western blot, we found Tip30 decreased the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9. MTS assay and cell clone formation method showed inhibited proliferation of the HepG2 cells. Chemo invasion assays showed that Tip30 decreased the invasiveness of hepatoma cells. Tip30 attenuated the binding of liver cancer cell line to human umbilical vein endothelial cells and fibronectin.Conclusion:The invasion and metastasis of hepatoma cells can be inhibited by Tip30 gene in vitro.
