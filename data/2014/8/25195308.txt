Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an oncologic emergency caused by intense tumor cell destruction resulting in profound electrolyte abnormalities. It is generally recognized as a consequence of cytotoxic therapy in particularly chemotherapy-sensitive tumors such as hematologic cancers. Despite having been primarily recognized in hematologic malignancies, TLS has been reported in solid tumors as well. We present a case of a 72-year-old female who developed TLS after receiving etoposide and carboplatin for a poorly-differentiated carcinoma with areas of small-cell differentiation metastatic to her liver. She had previously undergone a thoracotomy and resection for a poorly differentiated squamous cell cancer of the lung.
