Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major public health issue because infection may lead to liver failure, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In patients with renal dysfunction, hepatitis C can also worsen the underlying renal disease. Treating HCV infection is thus mandatory in this population. New therapies for hepatitis C have recently been developed, and some have been launched. Most of them are used in combination with the current standard of care, ribavirin and pegylated interferon alfa. Some of them can be used in regimens without ribavirin and/or pegylated interferon. However, few data are available on dosage adjustment for renal function in patients receiving these very new drugs. We reviewed the literature on this subject and gathered information, although scarce, to propose guidelines for using these drugs in patients with chronic kidney disease.
