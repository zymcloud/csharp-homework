Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a dreaded complication of cirrhosis as it is the commonest cause of mortality in these patients. The last few years have seen a dramatic improvement in the management of this tumor as nearly 50-70% of selected patients with early HCC survive for a median period of up to 5 years after liver transplantation, resection or local ablation. Surveillance has been found to be an effective tool to detect early tumors and expand the applicability of these curative treatment options. Semiannual ultrasonogram is recommended for surveillance by the American, European and Asia Pacific liver societies and is the standard of care in many countries. There is increasing evidence that this practice improves survival too. Since the only way to improve the outlook of HCC is its diagnosis prior to commencement of symptoms, providing surveillance becomes a major responsibility of physicians caring for patients with chronic liver disease. This review attempts to discuss the population at risk of HCC, modalities and frequency of surveillance tests, cost effectiveness and also the logistics of its delivery in the Indian context.
