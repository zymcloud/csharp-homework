Background and aim:Previous evidence has shown that microRNA (miR)-224 may function as an onco-miRNA in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells by activating AKT signaling. However, little is known about the clinical significance of the combined expression of miR-224 and phosphorylated-AKT (pAKT) on human HCC. The aim of this study was to investigate the synergistical influence of miR-224 and pAKT on clinical characteristics and prognosis in patients with HCC.Methods:One-hundred and thirty HCC patients who had undergone curative liver resection were selected. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were respectively performed to detect the expression of miR-224 and pAKT in the respective tumors.Results:Compared with the adjacent nonneoplastic liver tissues, the expression levels of miR-224 and pAKT protein in HCC tissues were both significantly increased (both PConclusion:These results indicate for the first time that miR-224 upregulation and AKT activation may synergistically associate with tumor progression of HCC. The combined high expression of miR-224 and pAKT may be a potential indicator for predicting unfavorable prognosis in HCC patients.
