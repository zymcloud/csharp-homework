Glioma-associated oncogene homolog-1 (Gli-1) is considered a marker of Hedgehog pathway activation and is associated with the progression of several cancers. We have previously reported that Gli-1 was correlated with invasion and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the exact roles and mechanisms of Gli-1 in HCC invasion are unclear. In this study, we found that small interfering RNA mediated down-regulation of Gli-1 expression significantly suppressed adhesion, motility, migration, and invasion of both SMMC-7721 and SK-Hep1 cells. Furthermore, down-regulation of Gli-1 significantly reduced expressions and activities of both matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. In addition, we found that down-regulation of Gli-1 resulted in up-regulation of E-cadherin and concomitant down-regulation of Snail and Vimentin, consistent with inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Taken together, our results suggest that down-regulation of Gli-1 suppresses HCC cell migration and invasion likely through inhibiting expressions and activations of MMP-2, 9 and blocking EMT.
