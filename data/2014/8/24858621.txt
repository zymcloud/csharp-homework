Jagged2 is closely associated with numerous congenital diseases and has an important role in multiple malignancies. It has been identified that Jagged2 is a sonic hedgehog‑regulated factor. However, its expression and correlation with Gli1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown. A total of 58 samples of surgically resected paired HCC and normal tumor‑adjacent tissues were collected, and the Jagged2 and Gli1 expression was detected in the samples using immunohistochemical staining. The correlation between Jagged2 and Gli1 protein expression, and their correlation with the clinicopathological features of HCC were analyzed. The protein expression of Jagged2 and Gli1 were significantly upregulated in HCC tissues compared with the normal tumor‑adjacent tissues (P
