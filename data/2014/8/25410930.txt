Objective:To explore the silencing glypican-3 (GPC-3) gene transcription by specific small hairpin RNA (shRNA) on the inhibition of hepatoma cells with high metastatic potentiality and hepatoma growth.Methods:After MHCC-97H cells were transfected with higher effective GPC-3-shRNA, GPC-3 mRNA was analyzed by multiple FG-RT-PCR or protein by Western blot. Cell proliferation was detected by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine and sulforhodamine B assay, its migratory metastasis and invasiveness by wound healing or transwell chamber system and cell apoptosis was detected by Caspase-Glo(®) 3/7 Luminescence assay. Nude mice were subcutaneously injected with stable MHCC-97H cells for observing the forming time or volume of xenograft tumors. And the expressions of GPC-3, β-catenin, p-GSK3β and CyclinD1 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.Results:After shRNA1 transfection with high efficiency (>80%), the expression of GPC-3 was down-regulated to 75.6% (t = 15.473, P Conclusion:Specific shRNA might intervene effectively the GPC-3 gene transcription and inhibit invasion and tumor growth. Thus GPC-3 may become a potential molecular target for hepatoma gene therapy.
