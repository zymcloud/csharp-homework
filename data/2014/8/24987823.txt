Objectives:Artemisinins are antimalarial drugs that exert potent anticancer activity. We evaluated the effects of artesunate, a semisynthetic derivative of artemisinin, on tumor growth, angiogenesis, the unfolded protein response, and chemoresistance in hepatocellular carcinoma.Materials and methods:The effect of artesunate was examined in HepG2 and BWTG3 cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions and in a diethylnitrosamine-induced mouse model. Histology was performed with hematoxylin/eosin and reticulin staining. The expression of chemoresistance-related transporters and angiogenic and unfolded protein response factors was determined. Cytotoxicity was assessed by alanine and aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, water-soluble tetrazolium salt, and caspase-3 activity assays. Small animal imaging was performed using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and choline PET to assess tumor progression.Results:Artesunate dose dependently reduced cell viability (from 50 Î¼mol/l; PConclusion:These findings indicate that artesunate could offer a new approach to the therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma. Clinical trials with artesunate as monotherapy or in combination with current hypoxia-inducing approaches are necessary.
