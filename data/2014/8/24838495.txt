Background:Statins reduce cardiovascular risk. Patients with cirrhosis have decreased hepatic clearance of statins and potentially increased risk for complications. No studies assess mortality in patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis.Aim:Compare mortality in patients with cirrhosis on statins to those not on statins.Methods:A retrospective cohort study evaluated patients from 1988 to 2011 at Partners Healthcare Hospitals. The Partners Research Patient Data Registry identified patients with biopsy-proven cirrhosis on statins at biopsy and at least 3 months following. Controls were matched 1:2 by age, gender and Child-Pugh class. Decompensation was defined as ascites, jaundice/bilirubin >2.5 mg/dL, and/or hepatic encephalopathy or variceal hemorrhage. Primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcome was decompensation in baseline-compensated patients. Chi-square and two-way ANOVA testing compared groups. Cox proportional hazards models for mortality controlled for age, Child-Pugh class, diabetes, coronary artery disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Kaplan-Meier curves graphed mortality.Results:Eighty-one statin users and 162 controls were included. Median follow-up: 36 months in statin users and 30 months in controls. 70.4% of patients were Child-Pugh A. Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), albumin, varices and beta-blocker use were not significantly different between groups. Statin users had lower mortality on multivariate analysis (HR 0.53, p = 0.01), and Child-Pugh A patients had longer survival on Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cox multivariate analysis for decompensation showed lower risk of decompensation with statins while increased decompensation with low albumin, high MELD score and beta-blocker use.Conclusions:In patients with cirrhosis, statin therapy is not associated with increased mortality and may delay decompensation.
