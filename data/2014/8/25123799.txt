Liver resection remains the method of choice for curative treatment for liver tumors. Development in diagnostic and surgical techniques has improved operative results as well as long-term outcomes. In the last decade minimally invasive laparoscopic (LAP) surgery has been increasingly adopted by liver units. The trend in LAP liver resection has been moving from limited resections towards major hepatectomy. This process, however, is relatively slow, which can be due to technical difficulties of the procedure and fear of haemorrhage. Despite having a hard time at the start, major resections become more common. Up to now approximately 6000 LAP liver resections were performed worldwide, number of major hepatectomies is estimated between 700-800. LAP liver resections are feasible with significant benefits for patients consisting of less blood loss, less narcotic requirements, and shorter hospital stay with comparable postoperative morbidity and mortality to open liver resections. It is an accepted management of both benign and malignant liver lesions. There is no difference between LAP and open surgery in late survival after resection for colorectal liver metastases. Overall survival of LAP resected hepatocellular carcinoma cases seems to be superior compared with open surgery.
