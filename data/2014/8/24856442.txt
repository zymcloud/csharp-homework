Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), for which locoregional treatment is not an option, is a candidate for palliative systemic therapy, but an accepted chemotherapy regimen does not exist. We have conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analyses to quantify the benefits of oxaliplatin (OXA)-based chemotherapy in advanced HCC in patients not exposed to sorafenib. Studies that enrolled advanced HCC patients treated with first-line OXA-based chemotherapy were identified using PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials and EMBASE. A systematic review was conducted to calculate the pooled response rate and 95% confidence interval. The pooled median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival, weighted on the number of patients of each selected trials, were also calculated. We tested for significant heterogeneity by Cochran's chi-squared test and I-square index. Thirteen studies were included in this review, with a total of 800 patients analysed. The pooled response rate was 16.8%. The median PFS and overall survival were 4.2 and 9.3 months, respectively, with a 1 year overall survival of 37%. The weighted median PFS/overall survival and response rate were 4.5/11 months and 20% in Western patients. Conversely, in Asiatic studies, the median PFS/overall survival and response rate were 2.43/6.47 months and 13.2%, respectively. OXA-based chemotherapy is effective in advanced HCC and represents a viable option in these patients. A head to head comparison with sorafenib or a second-line agent should be verified in prospective trials.
