Objective:The relationship between apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and chemotherapy has been established. However, whether ADC could be considered as a measure for monitoring response to sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been demonstrated. This study was to investigate the ADC changes of advanced HCC under sorafenib treatment.Methods:Athymic mice with HepG2 xenografts were allocated to two groups: control and sorafenib (40 mg/kg, bid). T2 and diffusion images were acquired at each time point (0, 10, 14, and 18 d post-therapy). Tumor volume and changes in ADC were calculated.Results:Tumor volumes on Days 10, 14, and 18 after treatment showed significant decreases in the sorafenib-treated group compared with the control. Pretreatment ADC values were not significantly different between the control and treated groups. A slow increase in ADC in the peripheral zone of tumors appeared in the treated group, which was significantly higher compared with the control group on Days 10, 14, and 18. In the central part of tumors on Day 10 after treatment, an increase in ADC appeared in the treated and control groups, the ADC of the control group being significantly lower compared with the treated tumors. From Day 10 to Day 14, the ADC map showed a progressive decrease in the central region of tumors in the treated and control groups. However, this change is more significant in the treated groups.Conclusions:Early changes in mean ADC correlated with sorafenib treatment in HCC, which are promising indicators for predicting sorafenib response in this carcinoma.
