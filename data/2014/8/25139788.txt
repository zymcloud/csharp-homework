Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma is the third cause of cancer related death for which new treatment strategies are needed. Targeting DNA repair pathways to sensitize tumor cells to chemo- or radiotherapy is under investigation for the treatment of several cancers with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors showing great potential. The aim of this preclinical study was to evaluate the expression of PARP and PARG genes in a panel of liver cancer cell lines and primary human hepatocytes, their DNA repair capacity and assess the impact on cell survival of PARP inhibitors alone and in combination with radiotherapy.Methods:Quantitative PCR was used to measure PARP-1, -2, -3 and PARG mRNA levels and western blotting for PARP-1 protein expression and ADP-ribose polymer formation after exposure of cells to doxorubicin, a topoisomerase II poison. DNA repair capacity was assessed using an in vitro DNA lesion excision/synthesis assay and the effects on cell killing of the PARP inhibitor ABT-888 alone and in combination with ionizing radiation using clonogenic survival.Results:Although a wide range in expression of the PARPs and PARG was found correlations between PARP-1 and PARP-2 mRNA levels and PARP-1 mRNA and protein levels were noted. However these expression profiles were not predictive of PARP activity in the different cell lines that also showed variability in excision/synthesis repair capacity. 4 of the 7 lines were sensitive to ABT-888 alone and the two lines tested showed enhanced radiosensitivity in the presence of ABT-888.Conclusions:PARP inhibitors combined with radiotherapy show potential as a therapeutic option for hepatocellular carcinoma.
