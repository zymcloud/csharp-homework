Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) plays an important role in the development and progression of cancer. However, the expression of IGFBP-1 remains equivocal, and little is known about its clinicopathological significance and prognostic value in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we evaluated the expression of IGFBP-1 in 90 paired HCC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous liver tissues and analyzed its clinical and prognostic significance. The results showed that IGFBP-1 was detected in cytoplasm as well as cell nucleus, and down-regulated in HCC tissues compared to the adjacent non-cancerous liver tissues. The decreased expression of IGFBP-1 was correlated with tumor differentiation, liver cirrhosis, microvascular invasion or metastasis, TNM stage and poor survival. Moreover, low levels of IGFBP-1 may be an independent prognostic indicator for the survival of patients with HCC. We also evaluated its function by adding recombinant IGFBP-1 to the cultured HCC cell lines HepG2 and MHCC97-H. The result of the invasion chamber assay showed that IGFBP-1 could inhibit the invasion of HepG2 and MHCC97-H. MMP-9 secretion by these cells was significantly decreased when the cells were treated with IGFBP-1. Our results suggest that IGFBP-1 inhibits the invasion and metastasis of HCC cells and that IGFBP-1 may be useful as a valuable marker for the prognosis of patients with HCC.
