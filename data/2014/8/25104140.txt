Background:Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) has been identified as an oncoprotein in various human cancers; however, its role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is unknown. We examined GOLPH3 expression levels and relationship with survival in patients with PDAC to establish the significance of GOLPH3 in the development and progression of PDAC.Methods:Real-time qPCR and Western blotting were performed to analyze the expression levels of GOLPH3 mRNA and protein in paired PDAC tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the expression levels of GOLPH3 protein in paraffin-embedded tissues from 109 cases of PDAC. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify correlations between the immunohistochemical data for GOLPH3 expression and the clinicopathologic characteristics in PDAC.Results:Expression levels of GOLPH3 mRNA and protein were upregulated in PDAC lesions compared to paired adjacent noncancerous tissues. Expression of GOLPH3 was significantly correlated with clinical stage (P = 0.006), T classification (P = 0.021), N classification (P = 0.049) and liver metastasis (P = 0.035). Patients with high GOLPH3 expression had shorter overall survival times compared to those with low GOLPH3 expression (P = 0.007). Multivariate analysis revealed that GOLPH3 overexpression was an independent prognostic factor in PDAC.Conclusions:Our findings suggest that GOLPH3 expression status may be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in PCAC.
