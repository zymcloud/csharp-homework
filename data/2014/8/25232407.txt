Objective:To establish a human hepatoma HepG2 cell line with stable expression of Prolyl hydroxylase domain 3 (PHD3) gene and study its effect of growth and proliferation in nude mice xenograft tumor.Methods:Eukaryotic expression vectors of pcDNA 3.1-PHD3 was constructed. HepG2 cells were transfected with recombinant plasmid pcDNA 3.1-PHD3 and empty vector plasmid pcDNA 3.1 by lipofectamine 2000 as transfected group, control group respectively, while the HepG2 cell without any operation was considered as parental group. Steady expression cells were gotten by G418 selecting. RT-PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis were used to confirm the expression of PHD3 in HepG2 cells and transfection successfully. The growth of these cells in vivo were also observed by injecting three groups of cell into nude mice, and volume were measured and compared.Results:The recombinant plasmid pcDNA 3.1-PHD3 and empty vector plasmid pcDNA 3.1 were successfully transfected into human hepatoma HepG2 cell line and showed stable expression in this cell line. Tumors were observed in nude mice when the transfectant cells were xenografted successfully, The average tumor size of PCDNA (3.1)-PHD3 groups are significant different compared with other two groups (P < 0.001).Conclusion:The PHD3 gene may have negative influence of growth and proliferation on HepG2 cells in vitro. The PHD3 may be a potentially tumor suppressor.
