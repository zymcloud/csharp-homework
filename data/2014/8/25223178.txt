Objective:To observe the clinical effect of Guilu Erxian Glue Cataplasm (GEGC) on carcinoma of the large intestine patients with myelosuppression after chemotherapy, and further to confirm its efficiency and safety.Methods:Totally 60 patients with carcinoma of the large intestine were randomly assigned to two groups. Meanwhile, they all accepted FOLFIRI chemotherapy. Patients in the treatment group were additionally applied at Shenque (RN8), exchanging once per every other day, for 14 successive days. Patients in the control group took placebos with the same dose and dosage as the treatment group. The blood cell counts (WBC, NE, and PLT) were detected before chemotherapy, at day 7, 10, and 14. The TCM symptoms integrals, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), liver and kidney functions were observed before chemotherapy, at day 7 and day 14. Adverse skin reactions were observed each day. And the usage of hematopoietic growth factors was recorded.Results:(1) The KPS score at day 7 was more stable in the treatment group than in the control group; the WBC and NE counts in the peripheral blood at day 14 were higher in the treatment group than in the control group; and TCM symptoms integrals at day 14 was lower in the treatment group than in the control group, all with statistical difference (P < 0.05). (2) Compared with the control group, the PLT count was higher in the treatment group than in the control group, the usage of rhG-CSF and antibiotics was less in the treatment group than in the control group, all with no statistical difference (P > 0.05). (3) No obvious adverse reactions such as liver injury, renal injury, or skin allergy were observed.Conclusions:Adjuvant treatment of GEGC could improve carcinoma of the large intestine patients with myelosuppression to some extent. No relevant adverse reactions were found.
