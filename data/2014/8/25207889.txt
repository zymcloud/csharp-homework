Objective:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Kanglaite (KLT) injection combined with hepatic arterial intervention for treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by meta-analysis.Materials and methods:Computerized bibliographic searching were undertaken to identify all eligible published studies about the KLT injection combined with hepatic arterial intervention for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang databases were all searched to included the suitable trails. The odds ratios (ORs) and its corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated as effect size with fixed-effect or random-effect models according to the heterogeneity test across the studies.Results:Nine trails were finally included in this meta-analysis. The objective response rate (ORR) was significant improved in the group of KLT injection combined with hepatic arterial intervention compared to hepatic arterial intervention alone (OR =1.80, 95% CI:1.18-2.75, P Conclusion:KLT injection combined with hepatic arterial intervention can improve the short-term clinical efficacy, quality of life, and decrease the pain of patients with unresectable HCC.
