Metastatic spread of the primary is still defined as the systemic stage of disease in treatment guidelines for various solid tumors. This definition is the rationale for systemic therapy. Interestingly and despite the concept of systemic involvement, surgical resection as a local treatment has proven to yield long-term outcomes in a subset of patients with limited metastatic disease, supporting the concept of oligometastatic disease. Radiofrequency ablation has yielded favorable outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal metastases, and some studies indicate its prognostic potential in combined treatments with systemic therapies. However, some significant technical limitations apply, such as size limitation, heat sink effects, and unpredictable heat distribution to adjacent risk structures. Interventional and non-invasive radiotherapeutic techniques may overcome these limitations, expanding the options for oligometastatic patients and cytoreductive concepts. Current data suggest very high local control rates even in large tumors at any given location in the human body. The article focusses on the characteristics and possibilities of stereotactic body radiation therapy, interstitial high-dose-rate brachytherapy, and Yttrium-90 radioembolization. In this article, we discuss the differences of the technical preferences as well as their impact on indications. Current data is presented and discussed with a focus on application in oligometastatic or cytoreductive concepts in different tumor biologies.
