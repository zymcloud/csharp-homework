Ethnopharmacological relevance:Codiaeum variegatum, grown in many varieties, has been widely used as a houseplant based on its brightly decorative foliage. In addition, a variety of this plant has been used for a long time against bloody diarrhea by the local population in Cameroon.Aim of the study:In our previous study, the aqueous extract of this plant and an isolated sub-fraction exhibited significant anti-amoebic activity on axenic culture of Entamoeba histolytica. Due to the medicinal value of these extracts, we promptly initiated to investigate their genotoxic and mutagenic potential in order to assure their safe and rationale usage in traditional healthcare system.Material and methods:Both extracts were incubated with L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, primary hepatic cells and HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and their genotoxicity and mutagenicity were evaluated by quantifying DNA damage and chromosomal aberrations through comet assay, micronucleus assay and mouse lymphoma mutation assay.Results:The aqueous extract of Codiaeum variegatum is not cytotoxic up to 2000 µg/mL while the amoebicidal fraction is significantly cytotoxic (≤40-55%) on L5178Y mouse lymphoma and HepG2 cells at concentrations higher than 500 µg/mL. Besides, no significant DNA damage and induction of micronucleus formation were identified at concentrations up to 2000 µg/mL. Moreover, the mutagenic potential of these extracts after short (4 h) and long term (24 h) treatment, revealed no significant gene mutation induction.Conclusion:The aqueous extract of Codiaeum variegatum and the amoebicidal fraction SF9B are neither genotoxic on non-competent or metabolic competent cell lines, nor mutagenic in mouse lymphoma mutation assay and therefore they could be safely used at lower doses for medicinal purpose.
