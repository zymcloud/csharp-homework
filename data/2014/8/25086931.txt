Magnetic resonance (MR) can characterize specific tissue subtypes, thus facilitating focal liver lesion diagnosis. Focal liver lesions that are isointense to hyperintense to liver on T1-weighted images are usually hepatocellular in origin. Chemical shift imaging can narrow the differential diagnosis by detecting the presence of lipid or iron. T2 and heavily T2-weigthed fast spin echo imaging can differentiate solid from nonsolid focal liver lesions. The authors illustrate these MR imaging pearls and the uncommon exceptions (pitfalls). The authors hope that you will find this less traditional contribution to the Magnetic Resonance Clinics of North America helpful in clinical practice.
