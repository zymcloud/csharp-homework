A small proportion of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma harbor FGF3/4 gene amplifications in an 11q13 amplicon. A recent report suggests that the presence of this alteration might enrich for sensitivity to sorafenib. Further, there is growing evidence that interference with the FGF/FGFR axis has therapeutic potential in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
