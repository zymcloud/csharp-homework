Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most deadly cancers worldwide. It is well known that the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway plays a critical role in cellular metabolism, growth and proliferation, and its inhibitors have been used as therapeutic drugs for hepatocellular carcinoma. Cetuximab, a chimerical monoclonal EGFR IgG1 antibody, can block the binding of EGF or other ligands to EGFR and thus inhibit ligands-induced receptor phosphorylation. In the present study, we found that rapamycin could enhance the antiproliferation effect of cetuximab in both HepG2 cells and Huh-7 cells and arrest the cell cycle. Cetuximab in combination with rapamycin had synergistic effects on inhibiting the phosphrylation of proteins in PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. Combination of cetuximab with rapamycin treatment significantly suppressed the HCC development in HepG2 cells-xenografted mice and improved the survival. Cetuximab and rapamycin inhibited the growth of HCC both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that the combination therapy using the inhibitors for both EGFR and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways may be a novel therapeutic approach for HCC.
