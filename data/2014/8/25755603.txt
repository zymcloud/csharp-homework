Diagnosis at advanced disease stage and early vascular invasion are the bane of majority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in India. The currently standardized curative and palliative treatment modalities [surgery, ablative techniques, trans-catheter chemotherapy, systemic chemotherapy] are suboptimal for a significant proportion of disease stages. Interest in radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma has seen a resurgence with revolutionary improvements in targeting radiation doses safely. Encouraging results have been reported with a host of radiation techniques from conformal radiotherapy, stereotactic whole body radiation therapy to charged particle based therapies. The dissemination of this knowledge has been slow across other specialties involved in care of patients with HCC. However the increasing availability of radiotherapy services predicts a hopeful future for wider evaluation of radiotherapy in HCC.
