The objective of this study was to investigate the outcomes of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation as a bridging therapy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who had been wait-listed for deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT). Adult patients with unresectable and unablatable HCCs within the University of California San Francisco criteria who had been wait-listed for DDLT were screened for their suitability for HIFU ablation as a bridging therapy if they were not suitable for transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Treatment outcomes for patients receiving HIFU ablation, TACE, and best medical treatment (BMT) were compared. Fifty-one patients were included in the analysis. Before the introduction of HIFU ablation, only 39.2% of the patients had received bridging therapy (TACE only, n = 20). With HIFU ablation in use, the rate increased dramatically to 80.4% (TACE + HIFU, n = 41). The overall dropout rate was 51% (n = 26). Patients in the BMT group had a significantly higher dropout rate (P = 0.03) and significantly poorer liver function as reflected by higher Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores and higher Child-Pugh grading. Clinically relevant ascites was found in 5 patients in the HIFU group and 2 patients in the BMT group, but none was found in the TACE group (P = 0.01 and P = 0.03, respectively). The TACE and HIFU groups had comparable percentages of tumor necrosis in excised livers (P = 0.35), and both were significantly higher than that in the BMT group (P = 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively). In conclusion, HIFU ablation was safe even for HCC patients with Child-Pugh C disease. Its adoption increased the percentage of patients receiving bridging therapy from 39.2% to 80.4%. A randomized controlled trial for further validation of its efficacy is warranted.
