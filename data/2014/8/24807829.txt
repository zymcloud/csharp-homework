Cell mechanics provides insights in cell responses to external stress, which is an important parameter known to influence a variety of cell functions. Understanding the interdependence between mechanical stimulus, cell shape and function is essential in controlling cell culture microenvironment. In this paper, we report on the effect of cationic and anionic interfaces on cell shape and nanoparticle uptake activity of hepatocellular carcinoma cells HepG2. The shape of HepG2 cells changed from a round-like shape to a spread-like form exhibiting lamellar protrusions by incubating them on coated polystyrene well plates with polystyrene sulfonate and poly-ethylene imine (PEI), respectively. This change in shape of HepG2 cells did not influence the uptake of 49-nm particles (which entered the cells by diffusion). However, the internalization of 240-nm diameter particles was larger on cells seeded on cationic PEI. Particle uptake was measured at 4°C and 37°C; the optimal incubation time was 6 h. Cell shape and particle uptake were monitored by fluorescence and confocal microscopy. Quantification of particle internalization was carried out with flow cytometry.
