50-70% of tumors of the so called "triple negative" subtype of breast cancer express EGFR. We hypothesized that addition of anti EGFR to Taxanes will result in increased effectiveness in EGFR expressing tumors. Here we set out to obtain data regarding the safety, tolerability and also the effectivity of the combination of weekly Taxane treatments with Cetuximab -an anti EGFR antibody in this subgroup of breast cancer. 18 triple negative breast cancer patients were treated with weekly Cetuximab and Taxane therapy. Addition of Cetuximab resulted in controllable Dermatologic toxicity in most patients -with grade 3 in two patients. Some impressive results were noted including one CR, one near CR and regression of chemotherapy and radiation resistance skin metastasis. Median TTF -and overall survival -6 and 12 months. Administration of Taxane Cetuximab weekly therapy for triple negative breast cancer patients is feasible. Use of anti EGFR-Taxane combinations should be assessed in larger clinical trials in this patient population perhaps in a similar manner to the lung cancer patients only in those with strong EGFR expression.
