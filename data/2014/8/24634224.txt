Background:Recent studies have demonstrated that the CC chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) may be involved in tumorigenesis and tumor progression of various human malignancies. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance and prognostic value of CCR6 expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:CCR6 protein levels were evaluated by Western blot in samples from 25 HCC and matched adjacent noncancerous liver tissues. CCR6 protein expression levels were also examined by immunohistochemistry in association with clinicopathologic features and prognosis in 212 HCC patients. The effects of CCR6 on HCC cell proliferation and invasion were examined in vitro.Results:Western blot analysis showed significantly higher CCR6 protein in HCC than that in matched adjacent noncancerous liver tissues. By immunohistochemistry, CCR6 expression correlated with multicentricity (P = 0.014) and vascular invasion (P = 0.009). Importantly, CCR6 expression was an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival of HCC patients [hazard ratio = 3.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.94-4.76, P = 0.013]. In vitro data revealed that CCR6 promoting HCC cell proliferation through regulating p21, p27, and cyclin D1.Conclusions:CCR6 could be used as a molecular marker to predict prognosis for HCC. J.
