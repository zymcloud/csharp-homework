Patients with end stage or terminal HCC are those presenting with tumors leading to a very poor Performance Status (ECOG 3-4) or Child-Pugh C patients with tumors beyond the transplantation threshold. Among HCC patients, 15-20% present with end stage or terminal stage HCC. Their median survival is less than 3-4 months. The management of end stage or terminal HCC is only symptomatic and no definitive tumor directed treatment is indicated. Patients with end stage or terminal HCC should receive palliative support including management of pain, nutrition and psychological support. In general, they should not be considered for participating in clinical trials. This review focuses on palliative care of terminal stage HCC.
