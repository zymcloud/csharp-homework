Aim:To investigate if loss of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is associated with microinvasion in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in the presence of chronic hepatitis B.Methods:The expression of EpCAM, cytokeratin 7 (CK7) and CK19 in 112 hepatic nodules was studied, including 20 HCCs with nodules ≤ 3 cm, 26 HCCs with nodules > 3 cm, 20 high-grade dysplastic nodules, 26 cirrhotic, large regenerative nodules and 20 cases of cirrhosis.Results:Membranes of ductular reaction (DR) hepatobiliary cells, interlobular bile duct and some hepatic cells were positive for EpCAM expression. Active expression of DR/EpCAM was observed in the majority of noninvasive nodules (50/66, 75.76%); however, expression was absent in the major area of invasion in HCCs (42/46, 91.30%). DR/EpCAM loss in HCCs ≤ 3 cm was higher than in high-grade dysplastic nodules (HGDNs) (P 3 cm, 20 HGDNs) with DR/EpCAM expression had a higher overall survival rate (P 0.05). The diagnostic specificity and diagnostic accuracy were both increased when DR/EpCAM, DR/CK7 and DR/CK19 were combined (P Conclusion:DR/EpCAM loss may be a useful marker for determining microinvasion in HCCs ≤ 3 cm, but also for predicting prognosis.
