Objective:Clinical trials suggest that combining transcatheter arterial chemoembolization with sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma shows a superior safety and tolerability profile. Our study aimed to retrospectively analyze the utility and prognostic factors of this combined therapy in these patients.Methods:Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, treated by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and sorafenib subsequently, between February 2010 and September 2012 in our hospital, were retrospectively analyzed. After sorafenib treatment for 12 weeks, abdominal enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate short-term outcomes and clinical benefit rate. Overall survival and adverse events were recorded during follow-up. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify relationships between baseline characteristics and overall survival.Results:Fifty-one advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients were included. Common adverse events for sorafenib were hand-foot skin reaction, alopecia, diarrhea, anorexia and fatigue. The clinical benefit rate was 64% and the median survival time was 7.5 months. Median survival of patients with and without portal vein tumor thrombi was 6.0 months and 10.3 months (P Conclusions:Combining sorafenib and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization was safe and effective for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients with extrahepatic spread but without portal vein tumor thrombi. Portal vein tumor thrombi and cholinesterase level are independent predictors of prognosis following this combined therapy.
