The survival outcomes of patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) differ significantly between individuals. Serum lipids and lipoproteins have been reported to be associated with prognosis in some cancers, but it has not been studied in metastatic NPC. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether serum lipid and lipoproteins could predict the prognosis of metastatic NPC patients. Eight hundred and seven patients with metastatic NPC were analyzed retrospectively, and the values of serum lipids and lipoproteins at baseline were retrieved. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to evaluate the associations of serum lipids and lipoproteins with overall survival (OS). Univariate analysis revealed that higher values of baseline cholesterol (≥4.655 mmol/L), baseline high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (≥0.965 mmol/L), and baseline apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) (≥1.065 g/L) were significantly associated with superior OS (p < 0.001), respectively. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that higher ApoA-I level (vs. lower ApoA-I level, HR 0.64, 95 % CI 0.52-0.80, p < 0.001) was an independent protective factor against progression. In addition, higher body mass index, earlier N stages, single lesion, and absence of liver metastasis were also revealed to be independent protective factors. In conclusion, the elevated baseline ApoA-I level may predict those patients likely to have a favorable OS.
