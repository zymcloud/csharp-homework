Background:The 7th American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) currently classifies combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) into one category. Study outcomes comparing the two carcinomas have shown contrary results. This study was designed to compare the survival and prognostic factors of both carcinomas.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 107 patients with cHCC-CC or ICC who underwent liver resection between January 2000 and December 2009.Results:Thirty patients (28%) were diagnosed with cHCC-CC, and 77 patients (72%) had ICC. Disease-free survival (DFS) was poorer in the cHCC-CC patients (six months), and the overall survival (OS) durations were similar (p = 0.477) between cHCC-CC (58 months) and ICC (45 months) patients. A tumor size larger than 5 cm, vascular invasion and lymph node (LN) metastasis were prognostic factors in all patients. However, tumor size and LN metastasis in cHCC-CC patients and carbohydrate antigen 19-9, differentiation and LN metastasis in ICC patients were found to be independent prognostic factors.Conclusions:Patients with cHCC-CC showed poorer DFS and similar OS rates compared to those with ICC. Our study revealed different prognostic factors in cHCC-CC. To understand more accurately cHCC-CC's prognosis, difference of genetic characteristics and tumor biology should be further evaluated.
