Aim:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tolvaptan to treat refractory ascites in decompensated liver cirrhosis patients with or without further complications, such as hepatorenal syndrome and/or hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Thirty-nine patients (mean age 55 years, males: 32) with decompensated liver cirrhosis and refractory ascites were enrolled. All patients received a combination of tolvaptan (15 mg/d for 5-14 d) and diuretics (40-80 mg/d of furosemide and 80-160 mg/d of spironolactone). The etiology of cirrhosis included hepatitis B (69.2%), hepatitis C (7.7%) and alcohol-induced (23.1%). Changes in the urine excretion volume, abdominal circumference and edema were assessed. The serum sodium levels were also measured, and adverse events were recorded. A follow-up assessment was conducted 1 mo after treatment with tolvaptan.Results:Tolvaptan increased the mean urine excretion volume (1969.2 ± 355.55 mL vs 3410.3 ± 974.1 mL, P Conclusion:Tolvaptan is a promising aquaretic for the treatment of refractory ascites in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis.
