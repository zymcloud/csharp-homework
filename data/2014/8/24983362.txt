Background:The aim of the PROMETEO-01 Study was to define the diagnostic accuracy of imaging techniques in colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRCLM) patients.Methods:Patients referred to Bologna S. Orsola-Malpighi Hospital performed a computed-tomography scan (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), 18F-FDG-PET/CTscan (PET/CT) and liver contrast-enhanced-ultrasound (CEUS); CEUS was also performed intraoperatively (i-CEUS). Every pathological lesion was compared with imaging data.Results:From December 2007 to August 2010, 84 patients were enrolled. A total of 51 (60.71%) resected patients were eligible for analysis. In the lesion-by-lesion analysis 175 resected lesions were evaluated: 67(38.3%) belonged to upfront resected patients (group-A) and 108 (61.7%) to chemotherapy-pretreated patients (group-B). In all patients the sensitivity of MR proved better than CT (91% vs 82%; P=0.002), CEUS (91 vs 81%; P=0.008) and PET/CT (91% vs 60%; P=0.000), whereas PET/CT showed the lowest sensitivity. In group-A the sensitivity of i-CEUS, MR, CT, CEUS and PET/CT was 98%, 94%, 91%, 84% and 78%, respectively. In group-B the i-CEUS proved equivalent in sensitivity to MR (95% and 90%, respectively, P=0.227) and both were significantly more sensitive than other procedures. The CT sensitivity in group-B was lower than in group-A (77% vs 91%, P=0.024).Conclusions:A thoraco-abdominal CT provides an adequate baseline evaluation and guides judgment as to the resectability of CRCLM patients. In the subset of candidates for induction chemotherapy to increase the chance of liver resection, the most rational approach is to add MR for the staging and restaging of CRCLM.
