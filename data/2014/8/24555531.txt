Objective:The purpose of this study was to determine which MRI features observed 24 hours after technically successful percutaneous cryoablation of liver tumors predict subsequent local tumor progression and to describe the evolution of imaging findings after cryoablation.Materials and methods:Thirty-nine adult patients underwent technically successful imaging-guided percutaneous cryoablation of 54 liver tumors (hepatocellular carcinoma, 8; metastases, 46). MRI features pertaining to the tumor, ablation margin, and surrounding liver 24 hours after treatment were assessed independently by two readers. Fisher exact or Wilcoxon rank sum tests (significant p values Results:A minimum ablation margin of 3 mm or less was observed in 11 (78.6%) of 14 tumors with and 15 of 40 (37.5%) without progression (p = 0.012). A blood vessel bridging the ablation margin was noted in 11 of 14 (78.6%) tumors with and nine of 40 (22.5%) without progression (p Conclusion:MRI features at 24 hours after liver cryoablation that were predictive of local tumor progression included a minimum ablation margin less than or equal to 3 mm and a blood vessel bridging the ablation margin. Persistent tumor enhancement is common after liver cryoablation and does not predict local tumor progression.
