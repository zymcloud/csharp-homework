Background & aims:Four gamma-gultamyltransferases (GGT) fractions (b-, m-, s-, and f-GGT) have been identified in human plasma and their concentrations and ratios vary in different pathological conditions. To assess the behaviour of fractional GGT in cirrhotic patients evaluated for liver transplantation.Methods:This was a single-centre, cross-sectional study; GGT fractions were determined by gel-filtration chromatography.Results:264 cirrhotic patients (215 males; median age 54.5 years) were included and compared against a group of 200 healthy individuals (100 males; median age 41.5). Median (25th-75th percentile) total and fractional GGT were higher in cirrhotics, with s-GGT showing the greatest increase [36.6 U/L (21.0-81.4) vs. 5.6 U/L (3.2-10.2), PConclusions:The ratio performs as a sensitive biomarker of the liver parenchymal rearrangement, irrespective of aetiology of cirrhosis and presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, even in patients with total GGT values within the reference range.
