Objective:To study the expressions of β-catenin in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue, adjacent cirrhotic liver tissue and hemangioma-surrounding liver tissue to understand whether their difference in expression will influence on the prognosis and to study the relationship between Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and HNF-1α expression.Methods:50 specimens of HCC, 50 specimens of adjacent cirrhotic liver tissue and 7 specimens of hemangioma-surrounding liver tissue were used to detect the differences in the expression of β-catenin and HNF-1α in them by immunohistochemistry.Results:The expression rate of β-catenin was 74.0% (37/50) in the HCC tissue, 18.0% (9/50) in cirrhotic liver tissue, and 14.3% (1/7) in hemangioma-surrounding liver tissue. The expression rate of β-catenin in HCC tissue was significantly higher than that in the hemangioma-surrounding liver tissue (P = 0.002) and cirrhotic liver tissue (P Conclusions:The occurrence and development of HCC is related to the abnormal β-catenin expression. There is a negative correlation between Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and HNF-1α expression.
