The results of combined treatment in 82 patients for hepatic metastases of colorectal cancer, complicated in 14 (17.1%) of them by obturation jaundice, using roentgensurgical interventions, were analyzed. In case of resectable metastases, preoperative chemotherapy and chemoembolization of hepatic artery was conducted, using 1 - 2 courses of oxaliplatin, and further--hepatic resection in various volume (in 23 patients), adjuvant regional chemoembolization or systemic chemotherapy. Median survival of the patients in this group was 32.2 mo. While unresectable metastases presence (in 59 patients), the treatment with the help of regional chemoinfusion via hepatic artery or chemoembolization of hepatic artery (2 - 3 courses), using oxaliplatin or irinotecan, was conducted. Median survival of patients in this group was 16.7 mo. Application of oxaliplatin for treatment with the help of regional therapy have permitted in 8 (9.8%) patients, while partial efficiency of chemotherapy, to perform radical hepatic resection. Complete answer on therapy was noted in 6 (8.6%) patients, the partial--in 19 (27.1%), the state stabilization--in 37 (52.9%), the disease progress--in 8 (11.4%). In total in 82 patients there were performed 217 endovascular and 24 transcutaneous transhepatic endobiliary interventions. Postoperatively 5 (6.1%) patients died.
