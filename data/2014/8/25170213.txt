Aim:To investigate the roles of Golgi protein (GP) 73 in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis.Methods:Stealth RNAi targeting GP73 gene sequence was used to silence its expression in Hep G2 cells and Bel7402 cells. Stealth RNAi effects were assessed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and ELISA. Cell proliferation assay and cell cycle analysis were assessed by MTT assay and flow cytometry. Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy. Apoptosis-related proteins were assessed by western immunoblot analysis.Results:Stealth RNAi targeting GP73 gene sequence markedly reduced the expression of GP73 gene. The reduction of GP73 in Hep G2 cells and Bel7402 cells inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, however, terminal apoptosis occurred in Hep G2 cells, but early apoptosis occurred in Bel7402 cells. Reduced expression of GP73 gene might lead to a reduction in Bcl-2/Bax ratio, an increase in cytochrome c, but a reduction in capase-3.Conclusion:GP73 might play an important role in proliferation and apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
