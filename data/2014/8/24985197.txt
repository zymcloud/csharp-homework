Pterostilbene, a methoxylated analogue of resveratrol, is a natural compound primarily found in blueberries and several types of grapes. However, little is known about the effect of pterostilbene on the proliferation of hepatoma cells and its modes of actions. This study was undertaken to characterize its ability to suppress the proliferation of hepatoma AH109A cells and the possible mechanism(s) involved. Pterostilbene showed a significant and dose-dependent effect on the anti-proliferative activity against AH109A cells. Pterostilbene exerted little or no effect on the proliferation of rat L6 myoblasts and rat skin fibroblasts. Pterostilbene-loaded rat sera could significantly inhibit the proliferation of AH109A cells, which suggests that pterostilbene could be absorbed through gastrointestinal tract and retain its anti-proliferative activity. Pterostilbene arrested the cell cycle of AH109A cells at G0/G1 phase and reduced the protein expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 dose-dependently. We also found that pterostilbene could significantly increase the intracellular peroxide level of AH109A cells, which may be involved in its anti-proliferative activity.
