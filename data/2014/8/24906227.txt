Background and aim:To explore the expression and role of activating transcription factor 3 in human hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Immunohistochemistry, Western blot assay and Real-time PCR were used to evaluate activating transcription factor 3 protein and gene level in HCC clinical samples.Results:Activating transcription factor 3 expression is lowest in HCC, and the protein level is lower in patients with capsule invasion, while there is no association with other main clinical pathological features.Conclusions:Low expression of ATF3 may function as a tumor suppressor during human hepatocellular oncogenesis and targeting ATF3 pathway might be beneficial for anti-HCC therapy.
