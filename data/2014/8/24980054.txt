A series of N-substituted tetrahydro-β-carbolines were synthesized and screened for antileishmanial activity through an in vitro assay that involves promastigotes and axenic amastigotes of Leishmania donovani, the causative agent for visceral leishmaniasis. The thiophen-2-yl analogs 9b and 11f and naphthyl analog 11h were found to show significant activity against promastigotes with IC50 values of 12.7, 9.1 and 22.1 μM, respectively. Analogs 9b and 11h were also effective against axenic amastigotes with IC50 values of 62.8 and 87.6 μM, respectively. The antileishmanial activity of analogs was then tested in human macrophage cell line infected with L. donovani amastigotes and 2-naphthyl linked analog 11h was found to be effective with IC50 value of 28.3 μM. Several analogs also displayed antitrypanosomal activity against Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent for human African trypanosomiasis. Compounds 11e, 11f and 11h were more effective than others with IC50 values of 1.0, 8.9 and 10.2 μM, respectively. All synthesized analogs were not cytotoxic towards mammalian cell lines including Vero (monkey kidney fibroblasts), HEPG2 (human hepatoma cells), LLC-PK1 (pig kidney epithelial cells) and THP-1 (human macrophages).
