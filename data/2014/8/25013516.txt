Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a globally common neoplasm, with regional metastasis associated with >50% of the tumors. Extrahepatic metastasis is also common, with the lungs, diaphragm, abdominal lymph nodes and bone being the most frequently affected regions. However, to the best of our knowledge, HCC metastasis to the lacrimal gland has not been reported in the literature. Only one case of metastasis to the lacrimal sac from a renal cell carcinoma has been reported. The current study presents the case of a 56-year-old male with ocular symptoms who was eventually diagnosed with HCC. The therapeutic alternatives for such cases are also discussed according to the reviewed literature. Clinicians should be watchful for the appearance of tumors in the lacrimal gland in patients with a history of malignancy.
