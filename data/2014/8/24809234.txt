Background:Data on the current management of inflammatory bowel disease are scarce.Methods:This was a nationwide survey among 65 private gastroenterologists treating patients with inflammatory bowel disease in France in 2012.Results:A total of 375 inflammatory bowel disease patients were analysed: 48% had ulcerative colitis. One third of inflammatory bowel disease patients had a history of hospitalisation, and 40% of Crohn's disease patients had prior surgery. Two thirds of inflammatory bowel disease patients had active disease. Significantly fewer ulcerative colitis patients were treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy than Crohn's disease patients (18.9% vs. 38.9%; p<0.0001). Among patients treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor, only 4.5% were receiving concomitant immunomodulators. Half of inflammatory bowel disease patients had undergone a colonoscopy within the past year. For colorectal cancer screening, random biopsies and chromoendoscopy were performed in 75% and 40% of cases, respectively. An endoscopic score was used for only 10% of inflammatory bowel disease patients. About one third of inflammatory bowel disease patients had imaging studies within the past year (magnetic resonance enterography in 65%). An abdominal computed tomography scan was prescribed for 12% of inflammatory bowel disease patients.Conclusions:Many patients still have active disease in the biologics era, and the number of patients receiving combination therapy is low in private practice. Chromoendoscopy and endoscopy scores are not often used.
