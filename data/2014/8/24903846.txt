Objective:This study aims to analyze the outcomes of patients with Child-Pugh A class cirrhosis and a single hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) up to 5 cm in diameter who underwent liver transplantation vs. resection.Methods:During 2007 to 2012, 282 Child-Pugh A cirrhotic patients with a single HCC up to 5 cm in diameter either underwent liver resection (N = 243) or received liver transplantation (N = 39) at our center. Patient and tumor characteristics and outcomes were analyzed.Results:Patients who underwent liver transplantation had a better recurrence-free survival (RFS) vs. those who underwent liver resection. However, the 5-year survival rates after these two treatments were comparable. Similar results were observed when we analyzed patients with a HCC less than 3 cm, and for patients with portal hypertension. In the multivariate analysis, tumor differentiation, difference of primary treatment, and presence of microvascular invasion were associated with postoperative recurrence. However, only differentiation negatively impacted overall survival after operation.Conclusion:Although more recurrences were observed in Child A cirrhotic patients with a single HCC up to 5 cm after liver resection, liver resection offers a similar 5-year survival to liver transplantation, even for patients with portal hypertension.
