Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) continues to present major challenges in management, which is further complicated by the presence of associated chronic liver disease. Key issues in surgical resection of HCC include the site, size, and number of lesions, the severity of the chronic liver disease, and the size of the functional liver remnant. De novo HCC in the absence of chronic liver disease can be treated by major liver resection with little risk of postoperative liver failure. Liver resection can also be used a bridge to liver transplantation as it affords the possibility of determining the pathologic grade of the tumortumor and its invasiveness, and thereby the prognosis. This review summarizes the current treatment approaches to surgical resection for HCC.
