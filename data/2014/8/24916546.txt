This study aimed to determine the maximum-tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicities of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in combination with temsirolimus (T) in patients with refractory solid tumors. Using a standard "3+3" dose escalation design, 23 patients were enrolled in three dosing cohorts in this phase I study. The starting dose level was PLD at 30 mg/m(2) every 4 weeks and T at 20 mg weekly. Pharmacokinetics (PK) of doxorubicin were evaluated for patients in the expansion cohort. The most common treatment-related adverse events of all grades were mucositis/stomatitis (69.6%), anorexia (52.2%), thrombocytopenia (52.2%), and fatigue (47.8%). The recommended doses of this combination for phase II studies are 25 mg/m(2) PLD and 25 mg T. PK analyses suggested increased exposure of doxorubicin in this combination regimen compared to doxorubicin administered as a single agent, possibly due to PK drug interactions. Out of 18 patients evaluable for a treatment response, two had partial responses (PR) (breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma) and six had stable disease (SD). Two patients remained on treatment for more than 1 year. The combination of PLD and T is tolerable, and the treatment resulted in clinical benefit. The combination regimen should be further explored in appropriate tumor types.
