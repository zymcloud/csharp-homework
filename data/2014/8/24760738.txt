Human beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2-GPI) binds to recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (rHBsAg) and can bind specifically to annexin II, which is located on the cell membrane of human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells. Viral envelope proteins are essential for mediating cellular entry. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of beta2-GPI in the early stages of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses revealed that beta2-GPI expression was upregulated in HepG2.2.15 cells at both the mRNA and protein level and was almost non-existent in 293T and CHO cells. Furthermore, annexin II was expressed at lower levels in HepG2.2.15 cells compared to L02, HepG2, and SMMC-7721 cells. Additionally, ELISA analyses demonstrated that beta2-GPI enhanced the ability of HBsAg to bind to cell surfaces, and there was differential adhesion to L02, HepG2, HepG2.2.15, and 293T cells. Western blot and ELISA were then performed to assess the effects of HBV and the HBsAg domain on beta2-GPI expression in co-transfected 293T cells. This study revealed that HBV and the large HBV envelope protein increased beta2-GPI expression. Further investigation indicated that beta2-GPI colocalized with HBsAg in the cytosol of HepG2.2.15 cells, with sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) on the cell membrane in NTCP-complemented HepG2 cells, and with annexin II in the cytosol of HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. These data suggest that high expression of beta2-GPI enhances HBsAg binding to cell surfaces, thus contributing to virus particle transfer to the NTCP receptor and interaction with annexin II for viral membrane fusion.
