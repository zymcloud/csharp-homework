Objectives:In the era of antiviral therapy, the prognostic significance of serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level as a biological gradient substantially diminished, as most patients can achieve complete virological response (CVR). We aimed to investigate the predictive roles of liver stiffness (LS) for liver-related events (LREs) among patients with CVR.Methods:We analyzed 192 patients with chronic HBV infection who achieved CVR (defined as HBV DNA Results:The median age of the patients was 49 years, and 134 (69.8%) were male. The median LS value at CVR was 8.8 kPa. During follow-up, LREs occurred in 25 (13.0%) patients. When the population was stratified into three groups (13.0 kPa), cumulative LRE incidences increased significantly in association with LS values (log-rank test, P=0.001). Patients with an LS value >13.0 kPa (hazard ratio (HR)=12.336, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.335-114.010; P=0.027) and 8.0-13.0 kPa (HR=8.832, 95% CI 1.092-71.432; P=0.041) were at significantly greater risk compared with those with an LS value Conclusions:LS values at CVR are useful for predicting forthcoming LRE development. Thus, in the era of potent antiviral therapy, tailored surveillance strategies might be established based upon LS values at CVR.
