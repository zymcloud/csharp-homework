Objective:To compare the burden of total hospitalization as a ratio of survival of staging laparoscopy versus prophylactic bypass surgery in patients with unresectable periampullary adenocarcinoma.Background:Periampullary adenocarcinoma is an aggressive cancer with up to 35% of the patients at surgery found to be unresectable. Palliative prophylactic surgical bypass versus endoscopic stenting has been addressed by randomized controlled trials, but none reported on the burden of hospitalization.Methods:From a prospective database all patients with periampullary adenocarcinomas with a preoperative patent biliary stent and absent gastric outlet obstruction, but found unresectable during surgery, were analysed. They underwent a staging laparoscopy only versus prophylactic palliative bypass surgery. In-hospital days of the initial admission as well as all consecutive admission days during the remaining life span were compared both in absolute numbers and as relative impact.Results:The inclusion criteria were met by 205 patients. Of these 131 patients underwent a staging laparoscopy detecting metastases in 21 patients. In 184 laparotomies 54 patients underwent prophylactic palliative bypass surgery for unresectable disease. Median total in-hospital-stay in the Laparoscopy Group was 3 days versus 11 days in the Palliative Bypass Group (p = 0.0003). Patients with metastatic disease found during laparoscopy stayed 3.5% of the remaining life time in hospital vs. 10.0% (p = 0.029) in patients with metastatic disease who underwent bypass surgery.Conclusions:Staging laparoscopy and early discharge in patients with metastatic peri-ampullary carcinoma resulted in reduced hospitalization, both in absolute number of days and as a rate of survival time.
