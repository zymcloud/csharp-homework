Karyopherin Î±2 (KPNA2) functions as an adaptor that transports several proteins to the nucleus. Emerging evidence suggests that KPNA2 plays a crucial role in oncogenesis and early recurrence. In the present study, we evaluated the expression pattern of KPNA2 in 221 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens and matching adjacent, non-tumorous tissues (NT) by immunohistochemical assays. We found that nuclear KPNA2 expression was significantly upregulated (30.3 %, 67/221) in HCC tissues; however, no nuclear expression of KPNA2 in NT tissues was observed. A correlation analysis demonstrated that nuclear KPNA2 expression was positively associated with serum AFP level, tumor differentiation, vascular invasion, BCLC stage and early recurrence (all p
