Alongside current improvements in the performance of computer tomography (CT) systems, there has been an increase in the use of bolus tracking (BT) to acquire arterial dominant phase images for dynamic CT at optimal timing for characterization of liver focal lesions. However, optimal BT settings have not been established. In the present study, methods of contrast enhancement and BT setting values were evaluated using a multicenter post-marketing surveillance study on contrast media used in patients with chronic hepatitis and/or cirrhosis who had undergone liver dynamic CT for diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, conducted by Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. The results suggested the contrast injection method to be clinically useful if the amount of iodine per kilogram of body weight is set at 600 mg/kg and the injection duration at 30 s. To achieve a good arterial dominant scan under conditions where the injection duration is fixed at 30 s or the average injection duration is 34 s using the fixed injection rate method, the scan delay time should ideally to be set to longer than 13 s. If using the BT method, we recommend that the BT settings should be revalidated in reference to our results.
