Hepatic angiosarcomas are rare mesenchymal tumors with few case series and reports describing their imaging findings in the last two decades. The computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings are variable and may appear like hemangioma at one end of the spectrum and hepatoma at the other end. The use of hepatocyte specific contrast on magnetic resonance imaging may also be insufficient in making a reliable imaging diagnosis. These tumors can easily mimic hypervascular liver cancer, atypical hemangioma or metastases. This case report highlights the imaging features of this entity and also underlines that, this tumor should always be considered as a differential diagnosis for hypervascular tumors in cirrhotic patients. The current imaging paradigms for its diagnosis are also discussed.
