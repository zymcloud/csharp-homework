Background & aims:To investigate the safety and adverse event profile of sorafenib plus radioembolization (Y90) compared to Y90 alone in patients awaiting liver transplantation.Methods:20 patients with HCC were randomized to Y90 alone (Group A) or Y90+sorafenib (Group B). Adverse events, dose reductions, and peri-transplant complications were assessed.Results:All patients in the sorafenib group necessitated dose reductions. Seventeen of 20 patients underwent liver transplantation; median time-to-transplant was 7.8 months (range: 4.2-20.3) and similar between groups (p = 0.35). In the sorafenib group, there were 4/8 peri-transplant (Conclusions:The addition of sorafenib to Y90 necessitated dose reductions in all patients awaiting transplantation. Preliminary data suggest that the combination was associated with more peri-transplant biliary complications and potentially trended towards more acute rejections. Caution should be exercised when considering sorafenib in the transplant setting. Further investigation is warranted.
