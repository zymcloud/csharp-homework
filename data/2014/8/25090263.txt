Purpose:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common solid tumors and ranks the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. The purpose of this study was to examine the expression dynamics of GOLPH3 in HCC tissue samples, and explore the correlation between GOLPH3 expression and prognosis in patients with HCC.Methods:The levels of Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) mRNA and protein in liver cancer cell lines and fresh tissues were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Additionally, the protein expression of GOLPH3 was detected by immunohistochemistry.Results:High GOLPH3 expression was positively correlated with serum AFP level (P=0.015) and tumor recurrence or metastasis (P=0.010). In addition, liver cancer patients with high GOLPH3 expression had significantly poorer overall survival (HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.19-2.94; P=0.006) and poorer disease-free survival (HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.21-2.98; P=0.005) than those with low GOLPH3 expression. The cumulative 5-year survival rate was only 35.19% (95% CI, 26.18%-44.20%) in the high GOLPH3 expression group, whereas it was 55.93% (95% CI, 43.26%-68.60%) in the low GOLPH3 expression group. Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the expression of GOLPH3, tumor size and tumor multiplicity were independent prognostic predictors for HCC patients.Conclusion:GOLPH3 was overexpressed in HCC at both the mRNA and protein levels, and the presence of high levels of expression of GOLPH3 could serve as a novel and potential prognostic biomarker for liver cancer patients.
