Background:Immunotherapy is an effective method for preventing metastasis and recurrence of carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy with a high rate of recurrence, and has not successfully been introduced to immunotherapy.Methods:Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood of HCC patients and stimulated to transform into dendritic cells (DCs). These DCs were then transfected with RNA extracted from HepG-2 hepatoma cells to induce expression of specific antigens.Results:The transfected DCs stimulated T lymphocytes to produce cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which specifically attacked HepG-2 cells. Injection of T lymphocytes from HCC patients and transfected DCs into severe combined immunodeficiency mice limited the growth of HepG-2 tumors.Conclusion:A specific immune response against hepatoma can be generated in vivo by administering DCs transfected with RNA from a specific tumor. This method may have therapeutic application in humans to reduce recurrence of HCC.
