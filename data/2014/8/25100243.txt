Background:Alkaline sphingomyelinase (NPP7) is an ecto-enzyme expressed in intestinal mucosa, which hydrolyses sphingomyelin (SM) to ceramide and inactivates platelet activating factor. It is also expressed in human liver and released in the bile. The enzyme may have anti-tumour and anti-inflammatory effects in colon and its levels are decreased in patients with colon cancer and ulcerative colitis. Active NPP7 is translated from a transcript of 1.4 kb, whereas an inactive form from a 1.2 kb mRNA was found in colon and liver cancer cell lines. While the roles of NPP7 in colon cancer have been intensively studied, less is known about the function and implications of NPP7 in the bile. The present study examines the changes of NPP7 in bile of patients with various hepatobiliary diseases.Methods:Bile samples were obtained at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in 59 patients with gallstone, other benign disease, tumour, and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The NPP7 activity was determined. The appearance of the 1.4 and 1.2 kb products in the bile was examined by Western blot. The results were correlated to the diseases and also plasma bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.Results:NPP7 activity in the tumour group was significantly lower than in the gallstone group (p Conclusion:NPP7 activity and the ratio of 1.4/1.2 kb products in bile are significantly decreased in malignancy, particularly in cholangiocarcinoma. The implications of the finding in diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma and 1.2 kb product in hepatobiliary diseases require further investigation.
