Cluster of differentiation 166 (CD166) is critical for liver cancer cell survival. Our previously study demonstrated that CD166 exerts its anti-apoptotic role through interaction with YAP in liver cancer. However, the interaction between CD166 and other cell surface molecules remains unclear in liver cancer cells. In the current study, we found that both mRNA and protein of CD44 expression was significantly inhibited by knocking-down CD166. Moreover, CD166 affected-CD44 expression is dependent of transcription via blocking NF-ÎºB pathway. On the contrary, CD44 promoted up-regulation of CD166 mRNA and protein. And it may be through E3 ubiquitin ligases COP1 and UBC3 to regulate CD166 protein degradation. Collectively, these results suggest that CD166 and CD44 play important roles in liver cancer development. Therefore, CD166 may develop as a potential therapeutic molecule target for the treatment of liver cancer.
