Objectives:Patients with T3-4 gallbladder cancers (GBCs) often require extended surgical procedures, and up to 30% of patients have N2 metastases. This study investigated which patients with T3-4 GBC benefit from resection.Methods:Consecutive patients (n = 78) with T3-4 GBC who underwent resection between 1990 and 2011 were analysed (38 before 2003, 40 in 2003-2011). Forty patients required common bile duct (CBD) resection, 10 pancreatoduodenectomy, 4 right colectomy and 2 gastric resection. Fifty-two (67%) patients had LN metastases, including 22 with N2 metastases.Results:The in-hospital mortality rate was 8%, 11% before 2003 vs. 5% in 2003-2011. The morbidity rate (47%) remained stable during the study. Undergoing liver and pancreatic resection did not increase severe morbidity (0%) or mortality (10%). Sixty-seven (86%) patients had R0 resection. The 5-year survival rate was 17% (median follow-up, 65 months). Survival improved after 2002 (26% vs. 9%, p = 0.04). R1 patients had poor 3-year survival (0% vs. 32%, p = 0.001). N+ patients also had low survival (5-year survival, 10% vs. 32% in N0, p = 0.019), but N1 and N2 patients had similar outcomes. CBD resection and major hepatectomy did not worsen prognosis. Patients requiring pancreatoduodenectomy, gastric or colonic resection had 0% 3-year survival (p = 0.036 in multivariate analysis).Conclusions:Resection of T3-4 GBC is worthwhile only if R0 surgery is achievable. Outcomes improved in most recent years. N2 metastases should not preclude surgery. Good results are possible even with CBD resection or major hepatectomy, while benefits from surgery are doubtful if pancreatoduodenectomy or other organ resection is needed.
