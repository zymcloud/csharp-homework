Aim:Treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma located on the liver surface is frequently difficult because direct puncture of the tumor must be avoided during needle insertion. The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of a no-touch pincer ablation procedure that uses a multipolar radiofrequency ablation (RFA) system for a tumor located on the liver surface.Methods:The experimental animals were three pigs, and RFA was performed with two internally cooled bipolar electrodes. Three ablative procedures were compared: linear insertion at regular 13-mm intervals (pattern 1; virtual target tumor size, Results:For the median transverse and longitudinal diameter to the shaft, with the pattern 1 procedure, the ablative areas were 32 mm × 30 mm, and with the pattern 2 procedure, the ablative areas were 27 mm × 30 mm with carbonization of the liver surface. In contrast, with the pattern 3 procedure, the ablative areas were 45 mm × 26 mm; however, the ablative margin did not reach the surface, and carbonization was not apparent.Conclusion:The no-touch pincer ablation procedure (with an electrode interval of ≤20 mm) may be useful when performed with two internally cooled bipolar electrodes for small nodules that protrude from the liver surface.
