In this study, the authors evaluate the biological effects of irradiation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by internal exposure with (125)I-labeled 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine ((125)I-UdR)-chitosan drug loading nanoparticles ((125)I-UdR-CS-DLN). The authors observed that accumulation of nanoparticles was significantly (p
