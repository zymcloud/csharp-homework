Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) is involved in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10204525 in the 3'-untranslated region (3' UTR) of PD1 gene was shown to be associated with the disease course of HBV infection. This study examined the associations of PD-1 mRNA expression with the clinical and viral profiles and the genotypes of rs10204525 in HBV infection. PD-1 mRNA levels in peripheral blood nuclear cells were determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PD1 rs10204525 was genotyped by bidirectional PCR amplification of specific alleles. The results showed that patients with chronic HBV infection had significantly elevated PD-1 mRNA levels than healthy controls. Patients with chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma had significantly higher PD-1 mRNA levels than healthy controls. HBeAg (+) patients had significantly higher PD-1 mRNA levels than HBeAg (-) patients (P
