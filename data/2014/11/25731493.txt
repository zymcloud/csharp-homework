We report a case of gastric small cell carcinoma with liver and lymph node metastases responding to CPT-11 plus cisplatin (CDDP) chemotherapy. The patient was a 77-year-old woman with advanced gastric cancer, clinically diagnosed as P0H1M1CY0T4aN3. The immunostaining and pathological analysis of a biopsied specimen obtained during a gastrointestinal tract endoscopy indicated small cell carcinoma of the stomach. The patient received the following chemotherapy treatments: 11 courses of CPT-11 plus CDDP, 8 courses of docetaxel plus S-1, and 2 courses of paclitaxel. The patient is alive 2 years after the first chemotherapy treatment. We conclude that the combination of chemotherapy used was effective for treating the patient's small cell carcinoma of the stomach, which is considered to have a poor prognosis.
