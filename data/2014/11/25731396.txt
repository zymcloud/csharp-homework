The patient was a 43-year-old single woman. Her family history included schizophrenia in her mother and manic-depression in her father. RemicadeÂ® (infliximab) had been administered for 3 years to treat rheumatoid arthritis. The patient initially presented to our hospital with dyspnea. Computed tomography revealed left-sided breast cancer associated with multiple bone tumors and multiple pulmonary nodules. A poorly mobile mass with an ulcer was found in left breast. Core-needle biopsy and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)revealed an invasive ductal carcinoma that was positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, 2 +). The clinical diagnosis was Stage IV T4bN3M1 cancer (metastases to the lungs, liver, and bone). Because of the presence of bone metastasis, the patient was admitted and she received complete bed rest as supportive therapy. However, the patient decided to receive treatment on an outpatient basis after carefully discussing the following points: 1) treatment of pulmonary metastasis with dyspnea should receive priority; 2) anticancer agents not causing nausea were required; 3) the risk of bone fractures as a complication (spinal cord injury); 4) how she wanted to spend the limited time available with her family; and 5) how the patient wanted to.
