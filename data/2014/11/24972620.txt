Celecoxib has been shown to have antitumor effect in previous studies but the mechanisms are unclear. The effect of celecoxib on cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)]i) and viability in HA59T human hepatoma cells was explored. The Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent dye fura-2 was applied to measure [Ca(2+)]i. Celecoxib at concentrations of 10-50 μM induced a [Ca(2+)]i rise in a concentration-dependent manner. The response was reduced by 80% by removing Ca(2+). Celecoxib induced Mn(2+) influx, leading to quenching of fura-2 fluorescence. Celecoxib-evoked Ca(2+) entry was suppressed by nifedipine, econazole, SK&F96365, and protein kinase C modulators. In the absence of extracellular Ca(2+), incubation with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump inhibitor thapsigargin nearly abolished celecoxib-induced [Ca(2+)]i rise. Incubation with celecoxib abolished thapsigargin-induced [Ca(2+)]i rise. Inhibition of phospholipase C with U73122 abolished celecoxib-induced [Ca(2+)]i rise. At 1-50 μM, celecoxib inhibited cell viability by less than 20%, which was not reversed by chelating cytosolic Ca(2+) with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N, N, N', N'-tetraacetic acid/acetoxy methyl (BAPTA/AM). Celecoxib (10-50 μM) also induced apoptosis. In sum, in HA59T hepatoma cells, celecoxib induced a [Ca(2+)]i rise by evoking phospholipase C-dependent Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum and Ca(2+) entry via protein kinase C-sensitive store-operated Ca(2+) channels. Celecoxib also caused cell death via apoptosis.
