Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) is a tumor that occurs throughout the body as a relatively uncommon entity. The current study presents two cases of primary malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the liver. The first case was of a 67-year-old male who exhibited no symptoms or abnormal physical signs, and in whom the lesion was found by ultrasound examination during a routine physical examination. The second case was of a 35-year-old male who presented with persistent malaise, weight loss and intermittent right upper quadrant pain. The presence of liver cirrhosis due to hepatitis B virus, which was identified 10 years previously, and the clinical appearance caused MFH to appear as hepatocellular carcinoma at the time of the initial diagnosis. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging scans were the main tools of diagnosis, but the MFH mimicked hepatocellular carcinoma due to the similar morphological characteristics, the rare occurrence of MFH and the underlying diseases of the liver. The first patient underwent a complete resection and recovered well, while the second patient underwent palliative treatment due to the large size of the tumor and the obstructive emboli in the portal vein. The diagnoses of the tumors were confirmed as MFH by histopathology and immunohistochemistry.
