Kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) is the principal receptor that promotes the proangiogenic action of vascular endothelial growth factor and is involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of many malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of KDR have been reported to be with the risk and prognosis of several malignancies. Our aim was to determine whether SNPs in KDR gene are associated with clinical outcomes in HCC patients treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. A total of 192 HCC patients were tested for KDR SNPs, and the SNP results were correlated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The association of the SNPs with the overall survival (OS) of patients was assessed by Kaplan-Meier method, and then Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the variables resulted significant at univariate analysis. No significant differences were found in correlation between KDR SNPs and patients' PFS. Our data showed that genotype AA+TA of rs1870377 and genotype CC+TC of rs2071559 were significantly associated with overall survival of HCC patients (P400 Î¼g/L), existence of portal vein tumor thrombus, and high BCLC stage (HR=0.61; 95% CI, 0.36-0.88; P=0.003 and HR=0.54; 95% CI, 0.40-0.94; P=0.002, respectively). Our results suggest that SNPs rs1870377 and rs2071559 in the KDR gene may serve as independent prognosis biomarkers for unresectable HCC patient, which warranted further validating investigation.
