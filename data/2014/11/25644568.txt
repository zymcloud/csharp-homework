Objective:To evaluate the survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients received prophylactic use of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) after radical resection.Methods:One hundred and forty-three cases of HCC from Ningbo No.2 Hospital were divided into intervention prevention group, chemotherapy prevention group and comprehensive prevention group according to different methods of HCC prevention. All patients were followed-up for more than 5 years after TACE, chemotherapy (FOLPOX4) or TACE+ FOLPOX4. Cox regression model of multiple factors analysis was used for analyzing impact factors on HCC prognosis. Survival rate was compared with Kaplan-meier method.Results:Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was negatively correlated with the survival time of patients, as an independent risk factor with the regression coefficient of 0.01 and the relative risk of 1.00. Prevention of postoperative increased survival time of patients with HCC, which was a protective factor. The regression coefficient for comprehensive prevention was -2.37 and the relative risk was 0.07, the weight of comprehensive prevention on lifetime was higher than that of other two prevention methods, followed by TACE prevention group. One-year, 2-year, 3-year cumulative survival rates in comprehensive prevention group were 78.35%， 69.16%， 24.43%， that in TACE prevention group were 76.87%， 62.48%， 24.72%， and that in chemotherapy prevention group were 62.23%， 43.22%， 19.54%， respectively.Conclusion:AFP was negative correlation with the survival time of postoperative HCC patients, monitored which of postoperative HCC patients can provide a reference for effect and prognosis of surgery. Application of TACE in HCC patients with postoperative effective in reducing mortality, which prolong the survival time of HCC patients might be extended further by combined chemotherapy based on its own advantages and disadvantages.
