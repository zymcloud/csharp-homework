Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) with yttrium-90 is a minimally invasive locoregional therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and involves selective delivery of glass or resin microspheres impregnated with radioactive yttrium-90 into small arteries preferentially supplying the tumor for tumoricidal effect thus sparing the nontumoral liver, or into lobar artery to induce atrophy and contralateral hypertrophy. Clinically, post-TARE a small proportion of cases develop radioembolization-induced liver disease. Histological changes of TARE on nontumoral liver parenchyma have not been well characterized. Herein, we report two cases of liver resections for HCC post-TARE, and describe the histological changes in nontumoral liver parenchyma.
