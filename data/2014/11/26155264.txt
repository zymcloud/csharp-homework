Backgrounds/aims:This study aims to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of two surgical approaches on the treatment outcomes of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for malignant liver tumors.Methods:Fifty-seven patients with malignant liver tumors, hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma and liver metastases, who were candidates for RFA, underwent laparoscopic or open surgical treatments.Results:The patients' characteristics were comparable in the two groups that received open (n=33, 57.9%) and laparoscopic (n=24, 42.1%) surgical treatments. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of recurrence rate (p=0.337) and overall survival (p=0.423). However, patients in the laparoscopic RFA group had significantly shorter hospital stay (14.1 vs. 5.9 days, pConclusions:Laparoscopic RFA can be performed for malignant liver tumors with lower morbidity rates, less invasiveness and lower expense compared to open surgical approach.
