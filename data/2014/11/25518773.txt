Epithelioid Trophoblastic Tumor (ETT) is a distinct but rare variety of gestational trophoblastic tumors. Misdiagnosis delays effective treatment and affects the survival. The case being reported here involved a 43 years old lady presented with 4 months history of intermenstrual per vaginal bleeding and 6 weeks amenorrhea. Workup has revealed pelvic mass. The patient underwent laparotomy with transabdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Histopathology turned out to be clear cell carcinoma of the ovary. Patient was put on chemotherapy but there was progression of disease. Review of histopathology and immunohistochemistry revealed it as Epithelioid Trophoblastic Tumor; serum b-hCG was also raised. The case was really challenging for histopathologist. By the time final diagnosis was made, patient developed extensive metastases in lungs and liver and expired. Such an uncommon yet distinct trophoblastic tumor should be kept in mind by pathologists and treating physicians.
