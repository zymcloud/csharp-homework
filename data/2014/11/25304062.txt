Occult hepatitis C virus infection (OCI) was first described in anti-HCV and serum HCV-RNA negative patients with abnormal values of liver enzymes but who presented HCV-RNA in liver and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Up to now, two types of OCI are recognized: seronegative OCI (anti-HCV and serum HCV-RNA negative) and seropositive OCI (anti-HCV positive and serum HCV-RNA negative). The concept of OCI is still a matter of debate, probably because both types of OCI are not considered as different entities. This review focuses on seronegative OCI. The existence of seronegative OCI has been documented all around the world with the implication of different HCV genotypes (1-4). Seronegative OCI is associated with cryptogenic chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis and it may be involved in the appearance of hepatocellular carcinoma. Also seronegative OCI may increase the histological liver damage in chronic hepatitis B and in HIV-infected patients. It may have a negative influence in the natural history of hemodialysis patients and in immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. Seronegative OCI has been detected also in patients with haematological diseases, among healthy subjects and in drug users. Other publications indicate the potential infectivity of seronegative OCI in the setting of family members, sexual partners and liver transplantation. In summary, seronegative OCI may play a role in liver diseases and other human pathologies and may be present in healthy people but larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.
