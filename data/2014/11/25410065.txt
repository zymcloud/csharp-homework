Synthesis of twelve hitherto unreported esters of abietyl alcohol and screening of these esters against four cancer cell lines including one breast cancer line MCF7 and four hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HCC) Huh7, Hep3B, Snu449 and Plc has been determined using SRB assay. The Cell cycle progression showed changes in cellular behaviour after 48 and 72 hours in MCF7 and Huh7 cell lines. Abietyl alcohol was obtained from the reduction of abietic acid, a tricyclic diterpene, isolated from oleoresin of Pinus longifolia Roxberghii.
