Haemostasis is associated with the development and dissemination of cancer. Whether cancer incidence is increased in haemophiliacs remains uncertain; thus, we aimed to further examine this issue. By using data from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan, we obtained a cohort of 683 patients with haemophilia A, and compared the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of cancer in this cohort with an age- and sex-matched control of 6830 patients. The log-rank test was used to compare Kaplan-Meier curve of the cumulative cancer incidence between two cohorts. Cox regressions were used to identify independent risk factors of cancer in the study patients. The cancer incidence of patients with haemophilia A was significantly higher compared to the control group (IRR 1.95, 95% CI 1.18-3.09, P = 0.008) during the 14-year follow-up period. The non-lymphoma and non-liver cancer incidence in the haemophilia A cohort remained higher than that of the matched control (P = 0.050 by the log-rank test). The multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis indicated that age (per year, HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.06-1.12, P < 0.001) was the only significant risk factor for cancer development in haemophilia patients. Patients with haemophilia A had higher cancer incidence than the age- and sex-matched patients, especially for the elderly. With increasing life expectancy for haemophiliacs, physicians should be aware of their cancer development.
