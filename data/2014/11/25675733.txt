The results of preoperative embolization of portal vein (EPV) in 90 patients, operated on for biliary hepatic tumors, were analyzed. In 47 patients Klatskin tumor was revealed, in 29--peripheral cholangiocarcinoma, in 14--tumor of a gallbladder. In all the patients a radical major hepatic resection was planned, a checking hepatic volume (CHHV) did not exceed 40% of a noninvolved parenchyma. The EPV volume have corresponded generally to the planned resection volume. After performance of EPV a pressure in a portal vein have risen by 75%, and later it have had lowered step by step during 24 h. The CHHV index have raised from (354 +/- 72) up to (462 +/- 118) cm3, or from (33 +/- 7) up to (45 +/- 11)%, permitting to perform radical hepatic resection in 79 (87.8%) patients. Thus, application of EPV in patients, suffering biliary hepatic tumors, have permitted to increase the CHHV index after radical resection, and to raise resectability of such tumors.
