The liver involvement in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) classically ranges from alcoholic steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis or steatohepatitis, alcoholic cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma. The more commonly seen histologic features include macrovesicular steatosis, neutrophilic lobular inflammation, ballooning degeneration, Mallory-Denk bodies, portal and pericellular fibrosis. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a condition with similar histology in the absence of a history of alcohol intake. Although the distinction is essentially based on presence or absence of a history of significant alcohol intake, certain histologic features favour one or the other diagnosis. This review aims at describing the histologic spectrum of alcoholic liver disease and at highlighting the histologic differences between ALD and NASH.
