Background:In the US, approximately 50% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is caused by hepatitis-C virus (HCV) infection. The molecular mechanism of a malignant transformation of hepatocyte induced by HCV infection is still largely unclear. There are several clinical and pathological staging systems for HCC, but none of them include biological parameters as predictors for prognosis and there has not been a standardized molecular classification of HCC. To understand the underlying pathogenic genetic alterations in HCV-associated HCC and aid in molecular classification of HCC and patient prognosis, microarray analysis of DNA copy number alterations in HCC were conducted using whole genome microarray with DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens of both cancer tissues and paired nearby cirrhotic non-neoplastic tissues.Results:Our results show that the most common chromosomal aberrations (>5 Mb) observed in HCC were chromosomal gains of 1q (80%), 8q (60%), 7q (40%), 5p (33%), 7p (33%), Xq (33%), 5q (27%), and Xp (20%), as well as chromosome losses of 17p (40%), 4q21.21-q26 (33%), 8p (33%), 1p36.11-pter (20%), and 9p (20%). Statistically significant smaller copy number alterations (3.9 kb to 644 kb) were identified using STAC algorithm, including losses of FGFR3, RECQL4, NOTCH1, PTEN, TSC2, and/or ASPSCR1 and gains of ETV1and/or MAF. Correlation analysis between genetic data and pathological data showed that gain of 1q21.1-q23.2 and gain of 8q11.1q13.1 are significantly associated with grade 2-4 and moderately or poorly differentiated HCCs, and gain of chromosome 5q was significantly associated with HCCs with vascular invasion, while gain of chromosome 7q is significantly associated with stage I HCCs.Conclusions:This study has provided a detailed map of genomic aberrations occurring in HCV-associated HCC and has suggested candidate genes. In addition, gene enrichment analysis on the recurrent abnormal regions indicated NF- kappaB and BMP signaling pathways in HCC development and progression. This study demonstrated that genomic microarray test can be used to distinguish HCC from non- neoplastic cirrhotic nodules and to identify prognostic factors associated with HCC progression using pathologically characterized FFPE samples. Our data support the utility of genomic microarray test for the diagnosis, risk stratification, and pathogenic studies of HCC.
