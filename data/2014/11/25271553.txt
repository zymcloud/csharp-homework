Discrimination of nodular lesions in cirrhotic liver is a challenge in the histopathologic diagnostics. For this reason, there is an urgent need for new detection methods to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis of liver cancer. Raman imaging allows to determine the spatial distribution of a variety of molecules in cells or tissue label-free and to correlate this molecular information with the morphological structures at the same sample location. This study reports investigations of two liver cancer cell lines, - HepG2 and SK-Hep1, - as well as HepG2 cells in different cellular growth phases using Raman micro-spectroscopic imaging. Spectral data of all cells were recorded as a color-coded image and subsequentially analyzed by hierarchical cluster and principal component analysis. A support vector machine-based classification algorithm reliably predicts previously unknown cancer cells and cell cycle phases. By including selectively the Raman spectra of the cytoplasmic lipids in the classifier, the accuracy has been improved. The main spectral differences that were found in the comparative analysis can be attributed to a higher expression of unsaturated fatty acids in the hepatocellular carcinoma cells and during the proliferation phase. This corresponds to the already examined de novo lipogenesis in cells of liver cancer.
