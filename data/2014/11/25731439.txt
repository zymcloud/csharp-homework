We report the long-term survival of a patient with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), successfully treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE)/hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) combined with long-term administration of sorafenib. A 74-year-old man underwent hepatectomy for a huge hepatocellular carcinoma, measuring 19 Ã— 13 cm. Multiple intrahepatic HCCs that recurred 5 months post-surgery were treated with TACE. After 3 cycles of TACE, however, sorafenib was administered to treat progressive disease. Six months after sorafenib treatment, TACE combined with sorafenib was administered for treatment of refractory intrahepatic lesions. Following further disease progression, TACE was replaced by up to 11 rounds of HAIC. We report successfully treatment of refractory metastatic HCC with sorafenib for more than 30 months along with a review of the literature.
