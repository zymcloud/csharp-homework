Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the recommended treatment of intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Radioembolization with yttrium 90 has overcome the shortcomings of external beam radiation in the treatment of liver cancer. TACE and radioembolization have led to encouraging response, survival, and quality of life outcomes, with reduced toxicity profiles. This result has led to the use of these therapies in patients with hepatic metastases, most commonly from colorectal cancer. This article reviews the current state of the practice of TACE and radioembolization and presents recent scientific data that support their role in the treatment of HCC and hepatic metastatic disease.
