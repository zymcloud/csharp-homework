MicroRNA (miRNA or miR) inhibition of oncogenic related pathways has been shown to be a promising therapeutic approach for cancer. SIRT1 might be a promoter factor on tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanism is unknown. We investigated whether miRNAs regulate the SIRT1 and its downstream SREBP-lipogenesis-cholesterogenesis metabolic pathway in hepatoma cells. Human hepatoma cells were transfected with miR-449 mimics and inhibitors, and the effects of miR-449 on cell proliferation was assessed. We identified the miRNAs, miR-449, that control lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis in hepatoma cells by inhibiting SIRT1 and SREBP-1c expression and downregulating their targeted genes, including fatty acid synthase (FASN) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCR). MiR-449 repressed DNA synthesis, mitotic entry and proliferation of hepatoma cells. Restoration of miR-449 led to suppression of SIRT1 expression and liver tumorigenesis. The newly identified miRNAs, miR-449 represents a novel targeting mechanism for HCC therapy.
