Background:Infant hepatitis B infection increases the risk of chronic infection, cirrhosis or liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) in the adult. Perinatal transmission is a common route of infection.Objectives:To assess the effectiveness and adverse effects of hepatitis B vaccine administered to pregnant women for preventing hepatitis B virus infection in infants.Search methods:We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 August 2014).Selection criteria:Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing hepatitis B vaccination compared with placebo or no treatment during pregnancy for preventing infant infection. Quasi-RCTs and cross-over studies were not eligible for inclusion.Data collection and analysis:Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion. If any studies had been included, we planned to assess the risk of bias, extract data and check the data for accuracy of all included studies.Main results:We did not identify any studies for inclusion.Authors conclusions:We found no RCTs that assessed the effects of hepatitis B vaccine during pregnancy for preventing infant infection. Consequently, this review cannot provide guidance for clinical practice in this area. However, it does identify the need for well-designed randomized clinical trials to assess the effect of hepatitis B vaccine during pregnancy on the incidence of infant infection and to determine any adverse effects.
