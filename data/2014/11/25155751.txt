GTP binding protein overexpressed in skeletal muscle (Gem) is a Ras-related protein whose expression is induced in several cell types upon activation by extracellular stimuli. To investigate the potential roles of Gem in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), expression of Gem was examined in human HCC samples. Western blot analysis showed that compared with primary human hepatocytes and adjacent noncancerous tissue, significant down-regulation of Gem was found in HCC cells and tumor tissues. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis of Gem expression was investigated in 108 specimens of HCC tissues. Clinicopathological data were collected to analyze the association with Gem expression. Expression of Gem was significantly negatively correlated with histological grade (P=0.001), tumor size (P=0.020), and vascular invasion (P=0.005), and Gem was also negatively correlated with proliferation marker Ki-67 (P
