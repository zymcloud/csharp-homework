Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease encompasses a wide spectrum of liver damage including steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, fibrosis and cirrhosis. We have previously reported that creatine supplementation prevents hepatic steatosis and lipid peroxidation in rats fed a high-fat diet. In this study, we employed oleate-treated McArdle RH-7777 rat hepatoma cells to investigate the role of creatine in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism. Creatine, but not structural analogs, reduced cellular TG accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. Incubating cells with the pan-lipase inhibitor diethyl p-nitrophenylphosphate (E600) did not diminish the effect of creatine, demonstrating that the TG reduction brought about by creatine does not depend on lipolysis. Radiolabeled tracer experiments indicate that creatine increases fatty acid oxidation and TG secretion. In line with increased fatty acid oxidation, mRNA analysis revealed that creatine-treated cells had increased expression of PPARα and several of its transcriptional targets. Taken together, this study provides direct evidence that creatine reduces lipid accumulation in hepatocytes by the stimulation of fatty acid oxidation and TG secretion.
