Background:The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis plays a pivotal role in cancer progression and metastases in various epithelial cancer cells. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the localization and correlation between CXCL12/CXCR4 expression and clinicopathological features in gastric cancers.Materials and methods:This study included 111 Japanese patients with primary gastric cancers, which invade submucosa or more, all of whom underwent gastrectomy between 1992 and 1996. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed.Results:A significant correlation was found in the immunoreactivity of nuclear CXCR4 and poor differentiation (p=0.0026), infiltrated pattern (p<0.0001), larger size (p<0.0001), advanced stage (p=0.0342) and reduced 5-year survival rate (30% vs. 61%, p=0.0012). Multivariate analysis revealed that high nuclear CXCR4 immunoreactivity (RR: 3.077, p=0.0329) retained its strength as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival.Conclusion:High immunoreactivity of nuclear CXCR4 in gastric cancer suggests that CXCL12 binds to its unique receptor CXCR4 at the membrane, translocates to the nucleus and then becomes more invasive, and thus can be considered a prognostic factor.
