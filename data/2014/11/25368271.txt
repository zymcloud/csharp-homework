Background/aim:The Kyushu Study group of Clinical Cancer (KSCC) conducted phase II trials (KSCC0802-UMIN000001308) concerning liver resectability after first-line treatment of advanced liver-limited colorectal metastases (CRLM) by a prospective, multi-center study.Patients and methods:Patients received 6 cycles of mFOLFOX6 with bevacizumab followed by evaluating liver resectability. The primary end-point was liver resection rate.Results:The 40 patients enrolled from September 2008 to August 2010. The median number of administration cycles was 6 (range=1-7). The liver resectability cases were 16/40 (40.0 %) and the number of R0 cases was 10 patients (25.0%). An overall response rate was 30.0% (95% CI=15.2%-44.8%). Median progression-free and overall survival of all patients was 9.7 months and 33.0 months), respectively.Conclusion:mFOLFOX6 with bevacizumab regimen is safe and effective for advanced liver-limited CRLM and might lead to high liver resectability.
