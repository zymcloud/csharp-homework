Hepatic tumours in dogs have recently been re-classified to follow a revised human classification system that takes account of identified hepatic progenitor cells. This study investigated the presence and relative frequency of morphological types of feline primary hepatic neoplasms and aimed to determine whether a similar new classification scheme could be applied in cats. Feline primary liver tumours (n = 61) were examined histologically and with a series of immunohistochemical markers. Six cases of nodular hyperplasia and 21 tumours of hepatocellular origin were diagnosed. The latter were subdivided into hepatocellular tumours that were well differentiated and had no evidence of metastases (n = 18) and tumours that showed poorly differentiated areas with marked cellular and nuclear pleomorphism and had intrahepatic and, or, distant metastases (n = 3). These malignant feline hepatocellular tumours maintained their hepatocellular characteristics (HepPar-1, MRP2, pCEA positive) and were negative, or only
