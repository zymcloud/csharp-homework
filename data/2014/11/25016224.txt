Background & aims:The first aim was to extend the validation of FibroTest® (FT) and transient elastography (TE) as markers of occurrence of cirrhosis without complications (F4.1), oesophageal varices (F4.2), and severe complications (F4.3) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The second aim was to validate a previous definition of an inactive carrier based on normal FT and ActiTest® (normal-FT-AT). The third aim was to assess the long-term dynamics of fibrosis in patients with sustained virological response.Methods:The 10-year updated individual data of 1434 patients were pooled from two prospective cohorts.Results:Of the 1312 patients without a history of complications, varices had occurred after 10 years in 14 patients (F4.2, incidence of 1.7%, 95% CI [0.6-2.8]), and severe complications in 25 (F4.3 3.7% [1.8-5.7]), including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 21 (3.7% [1.5-5.8]). Using Cox-multivariate analysis adjusted for treatment, viral load, HBeAg status and ALT, FT, and TE were predictive of liver complications (n=37; AUROC=0.83 [0.71-0.90]; pConclusions:FibroTest® and TE identified three categories of cirrhosis with increasing morbidity. Normal FibroTest® and ActiTest® were better able to identify inactive hepatitis B carriers than the standard definition. Despite virological response, the overall incidence of cirrhosis increased, with a remaining 5.8% risk of HCC.
