Background:DNA hypermethylation plays important roles in carcinogenesis by silencing key genes. This study aims to identify pivotal genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by DNA methylation microarray and to assess their prognostic values.Materials and methods:DNA methylation microarray was performed in 45 pairs of HCC and adjacent nontumorous tissues and six normal liver tissues to identify hypermethylated genes in HCC. Potential prognosis-related genes were selected among hypermethylated genes by analyzing influences of methylation levels on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in 45 patients. Their prognostic values were validated in 154 patients with HCC (including the initial 45 patients) to determine the independent prognostic gene.Results:Altogether, 54 CpG islands in 44 genes were hypermethylated in HCC compared with liver tissues. Among them, methylation levels of ERG and HOXA11 were inversely associated with DFS (both P Conclusions:EYA4 functions as a prognostic molecular marker in HCC. Its aberrant hypermethylation and subsequent down-regulation may promote tumor progression.
