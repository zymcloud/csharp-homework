A 39-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with a history of fecal occult blood.She was diagnosed with advanced sigmoid colon cancer.A colonoscopy indicated a stenosis, and an enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed liver metastasis.The patient was operated on for a total of 337 minutes, and an estimated 35 mL of blood was lost. This is the shortest operating time and lowest amount of blood loss of which we are aware.Although an intra-abdominal abscess occurred, the patient recovered well and was discharged on postoperative day 25.Herein, we describe the case of a patient who underwent simultaneous laparoscopic resection of sigmoid colon cancer and a synchronous liver metastasis.We also review the efficacy of simultaneous laparoscopic resection of colorectal cancer and synchronous liver metastasis in this report.
