Objectives:Acinar cell carcinoma (ACC), including its mixed variants, is a rare pancreatic malignancy. Recent reports have documented its occurrence in Lynch syndrome. Our aim was to evaluate the frequency and clinicopathologic significance of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency in ACCs in general.Methods:Mismatch repair protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in a series of 36 ACC cases that were treated at our institution and had sufficient clinical information and pathologic material.Results:Loss of MMR protein was observed in 5 ACCs (5/36, 14%): 2 lost MLH1/PMS2, 2 lost MSH2/MSH6, and 1 lost MSH6 alone. The 1 MSH6-deficient case and 1 of the 2 MSH2/MSH6-deficient cases had a known history of Lynch syndrome, carrying a germline mutation in MSH6 and MSH2, respectively. None of the 5 tumors showed distinctive morphology. Two of the 5 patients died of disease 6 and 21 months after diagnosis. In contrast, in the MMR-normal group, only 1 of 30 patients died of disease (median follow-up, 32.5 months).Conclusions:Mismatch repair protein deficiency is not uncommon in ACCs, occurring in 14% of the cases in this series. The MMR-deficient ACCs did not show distinctive morphologic features and were clinically no less aggressive than MMR-normal ACCs.
