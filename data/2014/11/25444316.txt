Background:Whether mesohepatectomy should be performed for large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) located in the central part of the liver is controversial, and the safety and long-term survival after this operation remain to be investigated.Methods:Between January 2002 and December 2012, 696 patients with HCC located in the central part of the liver who received liver resection in our hospital were included in this study. These patients were divided into three groups: 158 patients with large HCC (tumor size >5.0 cm) and 192 patients with small HCC (tumor size â‰¤ 5.0 cm) who received mesohepatectomy were classified as the mesohepatectomy for large HCC (MHG-L) group and the mesohepatectomy for small HCC (MHG-S) groups, respectively, and 346 patients with large HCC who received hemihepatectomy or less were classified as the non-mesohepatectomy for large HCC (NMHG-L) group. The operative indications, techniques, and outcomes of the three groups were analyzed retrospectively.Results:There were no substantial differences among the three groups in in-hospital mortality or postoperative complication rates. The overall survival and disease-free survival were not different between the MHG-L group and the NMHG-L group or between the MHG-L group and the MHG-S group. Univariable and multivariable analyses of the MHG-L mesohepatectomy group indicated that cirrhosis, tumor number, and vascular invasion were independent risk factors of poor long-term survival of mesohepatectomy. In the MHG-L and NMHG-L groups, solitary large hepatocellular carcinoma had better long-term survival than nodular large hepatocellular carcinoma.Conclusion:Mesohepatectomy is safe and efficacious for BCLC B/C patients who have centrally located large HCC, especially for solitary tumors, with good survival outcomes.
