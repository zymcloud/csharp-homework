Objective:To evaluate the risk factors for recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation (LT).Methods:One hundred and fifteen small HCC patients, who met Milan criteria (singleResults:Ninety-eight out of 115 small HCC patients were included for analysis, the 1-,3-, 5-year overall survival of patients was 91.8%, 80.6%, 79.6% and DFS was 87.8%, 74.5%, 73.5%, respectively. Survival analysis identified that MVI, macro-vascular invasion, exceeding the Milan criteria and pre-transplant down-staging treatment were related to tumor recurrence (PConclusion:For early HCC patients undergoing LT, the presence of MVI would predict tumor recurrence and can be an indicator for the adjuvant treatment or other salvage treatments.
