The incidence and outcome of moderate-to-severe veno-occlusive (VOD) disease was analyzed in 271 consecutive patients with hematological malignancies who underwent allogeneic SCT (allo-SCT) using the same reduced intensity regimen (RIC). RIC consisted of fludarabine, BU and antithymocyte globulin (ATG). Twenty-four out of 271 patients (8.8%) developed VOD, which was severe in only 4 (1.4%) out of 24 cases. All four patients with severe VOD finally succumbed to their disease. In multivariate analysis, i.v. administration of BU was associated with significant reduced incidence of VOD as compared with per os administration. In conclusion, VOD remains a serious complication of allo-SCT using RIC regimens containing BU. Although the incidence of severe VOD is very low, the overall mortality rate in the group of patients with severe VOD remains extremely high and therefore novel treatment approaches are needed.
