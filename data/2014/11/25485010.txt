Introducton:We wanted to identify the prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in Chinese patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) treated with first-line targeted therapy (sorafenib or sunitinib).Methods:We retrospectively reviewed clinical data from 119 mRCC patients administered sorafenib or sunitinib at the Ruijin Hospital since 2007. OS rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Each variable was investigated univariately and then multivariately using a stepwise algorithm. A multivariate Cox regression model analyzed baseline variables for prognostic significance.Results:The mean patient age was 57 ± 12 years; 37 patients (31%) received sorafenib and 82 (69%) received sunitinib. The mean OS was 22.7 ± 15.6 months (range: 2.8- 68.7). OS rates at year 1, 3 and 5 were 74%, 57%, and 36%, respectively. Univariate analysis identified significant negative prognostic factors (p < 0.05) as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≥2, symptoms, no prior nephrectomy, microscopic necrosis, ≥2 metastatic sites, presence of liver, bone, or pancreas metastasis, hemoglobin less than the lower limit of normal(female <115 g/L, male <130 g/L), and serum alkaline phosphatase greater than the upper limit of normal (126 IU/L) at baseline, as well as a relative dose intensity of targeting agents in the first month (1M-RDI) of <50%. Multivariate analysis of OS identified 4 independent predictors: no symptoms, no bone or pancreas metastasis, and 1M-RDI of targeting agents (≥50%).Conclusions:With targeted therapy, there is some change in the prognostic factors for mRCC and target drug therapies (1M-RDI ≥50%) play an important role in the prognosis of mRCC. Continued progress in the identification of patient-specific prognostic factors for mRCC will require further advances in the understanding of tumour biology.
