Neurological manifestations are common in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. The majority of these patients show hepatic encephalopathy or chronic acquired (non-Wilsonian) hepatocerebral degeneration (CAHD). They characteristically present with dysarthria, ataxia, involuntary movements, and altered mental status. Neuroradiological examination in patients with hepatic encephalopathy often shows abnormal signals in multiple regions of the brain, such as the pallidum, putamen, caudate nucleus, hemispheric white matter, and ventral midbrain. The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy and CAHD is poorly understood and the response to conventional therapies is often poor. We report a male patient with cirrhosis of unknown cause, who developed slowly progressive cerebellar truncal and limb ataxia and slurred speech. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed focal T2 hyperintensity in bilateral dentate nuclei and middle cerebellar peduncles (MCPs). After treatment by obliteration of the portosystemic shunt, clinical manifestations and MRI abnormalities were dramatically improved. He was followed for six years until he died of uncontrollable bleeding due to hepatocellular carcinoma. At the last examination 9 months before death, he showed no apparent aggravation of neurological symptoms, and no abnormal signal intensities in the MCPs and supratentorial compartment. The clinical course and changes of brain MRI findings of this case are extremely rare, suggesting that obliteration of the portosystemic shunt may be effective for CAHD over long term.
