We performed primary lesion resection in a 48-year-old man diagnosed with sigmoid colon cancer showing multiple liver metastases and extensive lymph node metastases. Endocrine cell carcinoma was diagnosed from an excised specimen. In the early postoperative period, orbital metastases and thoracic spine metastasis were detected, while the multiple liver metastases and lymph node metastases worsened markedly. We administered radiotherapy for the orbital and thoracic spine metastases, but it was ineffective. Treatment with anticancer agents was also ineffective. The patient died 56 days after the operation.
