Background:Either palliative distal gastrectomy or gastrojejunostomy are the initial treatment options for locally advanced gastric cancer with outlet obstruction when curative-intent resection is not feasible. Since chemotherapy is the mainstay for unresectable gastric cancer, the clinical value of palliative distal gastrectomy is controversial.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of patients with gastric cancer with outlet obstruction treated at our institution between January 2002 and December 2012. We compared the clinical outcomes of palliative distal gastrectomy with those of gastrojejunostomy patients and the factors affecting overall survival were evaluated.Results:Elective palliative distal gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy were performed in 18 and 25 patients, respectively. The median overall survival times in the gastrojejunostomy and palliative distal gastrectomy groups were statistically equivalent at 8.8 and 8.3 months, respectively (P = 0.73), despite the more locally advanced tumors in the gastrojejunostomy as compared with the palliative distal gastrectomy group. A multivariate Cox regression analysis showed absence of postoperative chemotherapy and higher postoperative complication grade to be associated with worse clinical outcomes.Conclusions:Palliative distal gastrectomy offers neither survival nor palliative benefit as compared to gastrojejunostomy. Minimizing the morbidity of intervention for outlet obstruction, followed by chemotherapy, appears to be the optimal initial strategy for incurable gastric cancer with outlet obstruction.
