Background:The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between serum zinc (Zn) level and clinicopathological profiles in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Furthermore, we investigate the influence of serum Zn level on the long-term prognosis after hepatectomy.Methods:A retrospective analysis was conducted of 310 patients who underwent initial hepatectomy for HCC. The correlation between serum Zn level and preoperative liver functional indicator, pathological features, including the degree of hepatic fibrosis, and perioperative outcome were evaluated. The patients were divided into two groups (serum Zn â‰¤ 65 mg/dL; n = 71 and Zn > 65 mg/dL; n = 239), and their long-term prognosis were compared.Results:There were strong correlations between preoperative serum Zn level and serum albumin (r = 0.47, P Conclusions:Serum Zn level reflects liver function and is useful for predicting the hepatic fibrosis before surgery. The prognosis of patients with HCC was found to be associated with preoperative serum Zn level, especially in patients with HCV-related chronic liver disease.
