A 34 -year-old woman presenting with bloody stools was diagnosed with a rectal tumor. Computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple liver masses in Couinaud segments IV, V, and VII. The lesions were diagnosed as multiple liver metastases from rectal cancer. Right trisegmentectomy of the liver was considered the optimal treatment option for curative resection; however, liver volumetric examination using CT estimated that the remnant liver volume after right trisegmentectomy would be only 24.6% of the total liver volume. Therefore, she underwent resection of the primary lesion followed by systemic chemotherapy for multiple liver metastases. She showed a partial response, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, after 5 courses of capecitabine/oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab. Embolization of the right branch of the portal vein was performed to increase liver volume. Asubsequent liver volumetric examination with CT estimated that the remnant liver volume after right trisegmentectomy would be 38.4% of the total liver volume. Therefore, she underwent right trisegmentectomy of the liver for curative resection of the liver metastases. She had had no signs of recurrence at 3 years and 6 months after initial surgery.
