We report on a 30-year-old man with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP ) who developed advanced sigmoid colon cancer with desmoid tumors. The patient initially presented with melena. FAP advanced sigmoid colon cancer was diagnosed following a laparoscopy-assisted proctocolectomy in 2007. A computed tomography (CT) scan, conducted 7 months later, revealed a tumor around the branch of the common iliac artery. We diagnosed sigmoid colon cancer recurrence and attempted treatment by surgical removal. However, there were many smooth tumors within the patient's abdomen, which were diagnosed as desmoid tumors using rapid intraoperative pathological diagnosis. Although the patient was administered a COX-2 inhibitor and tamoxifen after surgery, the tumor grew. Dacarbazine (DTIC) and doxorubicin (DOX) were subsequently administered to the patient, and after 4 courses, the tumor was reduced by 60% and stable disease (SD) was achieved. In 2009, a CT scan indicated sigmoid colon cancer recurrence in the liver. The patient underwent a left hepatic lobectomy by laparoscopy-assisted surgery. To date, 4 years and 6 months after surgery, we have been unable to find new disease or desmoid tumor growth.
