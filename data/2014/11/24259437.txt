Purpose:To clarify the diagnostic performance of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI for the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in recipients of living related-liver transplantation (LRLT).Materials and methods:This retrospective study group consisted of 15 patients with 61 HCCs who each underwent multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT), gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI, and angiography-assisted computed tomography (CT) before LRLT. The three modalities were compared for their ability to detect HCC. Two blinded readers independently reviewed the images obtained by each modality for the presence of HCC on a segment-by-segment basis using a 5-point confidence scale. The diagnostic performance of the modalities was evaluated in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The area under the ROC curve (Az), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were compared for the three modalities.Results:No significant difference in Az, sensitivity, specificity, or accuracy was obtained among gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI, MDCT, and angiography-assisted CT for both readers. For reader 1, the sensitivity (55.6%) and the accuracy (84.7%) of angiography-assisted CT were significantly higher than those of MDCT (33.3% and 78.0%) (P Conclusion:Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI has a relatively high diagnostic ability to detect HCC even in recipients of LRLT, equivalent to the abilities of MDCT and angiography-assisted CT.
