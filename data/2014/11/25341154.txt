Objective:The objective of our study was to compare the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for viable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) including areas of retained oil after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) versus RFA treatment of viable HCC alone for ablation coverage.Materials and methods:Eighty-five patients with 88 viable HCCs underwent RFA of residual viable HCCs around retained iodized oil after TACE. RFA of both viable HCC and retained iodized oil was performed on 47 viable tumors (group A), and RFA of viable HCC only was used to treat the remaining 41 viable tumors (group B).Results:After initial RFA, the endpoint of ablation was successfully achieved for 45 of 47 tumors in group A and for all 41 tumors in group B. Two residual viable tumors in group A were successfully treated by additional RFA. Major complications occurred after initial RFA treatment of one tumor each in group A (pleural effusion) and group B (collateral damage). During follow-up (mean, 37.1 months; range, 5-116.5 months), local tumor progression of treated lesions was found in 28% in group A and 59% in group B. The respective 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-year local tumor progression rates were significantly lower in group A (15%, 32%, 32%, and 32%) than in group B (43%, 71%, 81%, and 81%) (p = 0.001).Conclusion:In treatment of viable tumors after TACE in patients with HCC, RFA of both viable tumor and retained iodized oil may reduce rates of local tumor progression compared with RFA of viable tumor only.
