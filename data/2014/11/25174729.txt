MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators in cell processes. Emerging evidence has suggested that there is a direct association between miRNAs and cancer. However, the exact regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in tumorigenesis are poorly understood. In the present study, we showed that miR-145 is able to significantly reduce mRNA and protein expression levels of A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) in liver cancer cells (SMMC-7721, BEL-7402 and Huh-7). Dual luciferase reporter assays confirmed that ADAM17 is a direct target of miR-145. Notably, we found that miR-145 inhibits cell proliferation and growth activity in SMMC-7721 cells. These results demonstrated that it may be exert the function of tumor suppression in a particular link of cancer cell growth. Further studies revealed that the silencing of ADAM17 decreased the proliferation and growth activity of SMMC-7721 cells. Moreover, it reduced the expression of MMP-9. In conclusion, miR-145 inhibits liver cancer cell proliferation by directly targeting ADAM17. Thus, it may become a promising biological target in the treatment strategy of hepatocellular carcinoma.
