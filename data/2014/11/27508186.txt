Platelets, the chief effectors of vascular homeostasis, have been identified as important players in the pathogenesis of both acute and chronic liver disease in preclinical models of hepatitis B viral infection. Platelets are thought to promote the accumulation of virus-specific T-cells into the liver parenchyma. Importantly, the inhibition of platelet activation by clinically relevant doses of aspirin and clopidogrel was able to reduce immune-mediated necroinflammatory liver disease, extracellular matrix deposition, and hepatocellular carcinoma development; the same treatment was able to improve overall survival. These results strongly support the design of clinical trials aiming to define the potential of antiplatelet therapy in the prevention of hepatitis B virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma.
