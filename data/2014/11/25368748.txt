Background/aims:Superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SESCC) is being increasingly detected during screening endoscopy. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) allows for en bloc and histologically complete resection of lesions. This study assessed the technical feasibility and long-term outcomes of ESD for SESCCs.Methods:Between January 2005 and August 2012, 27 patients with 28 SESCCs underwent ESD at Pusan National University Hospital. The en bloc and pathologically complete resection rates, complication (perforation and bleeding) rate, incidence of esophageal stricture after ESD, and overall and disease-specific survival rates were evaluated.Results:The en bloc and pathologically complete resection rates were 93% and 83%, respectively. No significant bleeding occurred, and perforation with mediastinal emphysema was observed in two patients (7%). Post-ESD stricture occurred in two patients (7%) who had mucosal defects involving more than three-fourths of the esophageal circumference. During a mean follow-up of 23 months, local tumor recurrence was seen in two of four lesions with pathologically incomplete resection; one was treated by re-ESD, and the other was treated by surgical esophagectomy. The 5-year overall and disease-specific survival rates were 84% and 100%, respectively.Conclusions:ESD seems to be a feasible, effective curative treatment for SESCCs. All patients should be closely followed after ESD.
