Objective:To study the synergistic effect on hepatoma cell(SMMC-7721) and the reduction killing effect on normal liver cells(LO-2) treated with sodium cantharidinate (SCA) in combination with fluorouracil(5-FU) or cisplatin(DDP) as well as the related mechanism.Methods:MTT assay was used to select the best ratio of SCA with 5-FU or SCA with DDP which had less toxicity on LO-2 cell line and had synergistic effect on SMMC-7721 cell line; Flow cytometry assay was used to analyze the apoptosis-induction of the different ratio of drugs on both cell lines; Hoechst-33258 fluorescent staining assay was used to observe the nuclear morphological changes of cells; Immunoblotting assay was used to analyze the Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 signaling pathway and the apoptosis related signaling pathway in both cell lines.Results:MTI assay indicated that the proliferation inhibition of SCA,5-FU and DDP on SMMC-7721 cell line was in a time-and dose-dependent manner respectively. Among them, SCA had a more significant inhibition on SMMC-7721 cell line than on LO-2 after 12 h or 24 h treatment (P Conclusion:These results indicates that 2. 5 µg/mL SCA + 2 µg/mL DDP showed a higher inhibition on the hepatic carcinoma cells and a relatively lower cytotoxicity on normal liver cells. The major anti-cancer mechanism is related with the inhibition on Erk signaling pathway and the induction of apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway.
