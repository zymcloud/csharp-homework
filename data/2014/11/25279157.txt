microRNA (miRNA) expression in organs does not always represent their quantity in serum. A disparity in the expression of miR-181a has been reported in the tissues and serum of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Since hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of HCC and miR-181a has never been studied in HCV, the present study aimed to investigate the miR-181a expression profile in genotype 4 (GT4)-HCV patients to evaluate whether this pattern is also apparent in HCV. RNA was extracted from liver tissues, peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum samples from GT4-HCV-infected patients and healthy donors to evaluate the relative miR-181a expression using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. miR-181a was significantly higher in the serum of naïve patients compared to controls, and an inverse correlation with the viral load and liver enzymes was apparent. By contrast, no difference in miR-181a expression was observed in the liver tissues and PBMCs of patients compared to controls. This expression observed in HCV is conflicting to that previously reported in HCC. The study also demonstrates a significant upregulation of miR-181a post-interferon/ribavirin treatment in the serum of sustained virological responders (SVRs) compared to non-responders and treatment-naïve SVRs. In conclusion, miR-181a may be considered to be a possible prognostic marker in GT4-HCV infection.
