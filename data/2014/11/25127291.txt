The development of therapeutic strategies to attenuate chemotherapy toxicity represents an area of great interest in cancer research, and among them is nutritional therapy based on antioxidants. As research on this topic is still controversial and scarce, we aim to investigate the effects of antioxidant supplementation with vitamin C, vitamin E or pequi oil, a carotenoid-rich oil extracted from pequi (Caryocar brasiliense), on doxorubicin (DX)-induced oxidative damage to normal cells in Ehrlich solid tumor-bearing mice. Tumor weight and volume, histopathology, morphometry and immunohistochemistry were used to assess the treatments' efficacy in containing tumor aggressiveness and regression, while possible toxicity of treatments was assessed by animals' weight, morphological analysis of the heart, liver and kidneys, hemogram, and serum levels of total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, creatinine and urea. Although all the chemotherapeutic treatments increased internal necrosis area and reduced the positive Ki-67 cells compared to non-treated tumors, the treatments with pequi oil provided before tumor inoculation (PTDX) or in continuous and concurrent administration with doxorubicin (PTPDX) were more effective in containing tumor growth, besides increasing lymphocyte-dependent immunity and reducing the adverse side effects associated with DX-induced oxidative damage to normal cells, mainly the PTDX treatment. Vitamins C and E given before tumor inoculation and chemotherapy were not successful against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, besides increasing doxorubicin-induced nephrotoxicity, indicating that, at least for doxorubicin, pequi oil instead of vitamins C and E would be the best option to reduce its adverse effects.
