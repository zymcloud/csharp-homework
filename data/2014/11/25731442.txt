In 35 patients who underwent balloon-occluded transarterial chemoembolization (B-TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) since January 2013, 5 patients (14%) had postoperative cholangitis, 1 of whom required drainage of a liver abscess. Four of these patients(80%)were treated with cisplatin (CDDP)-epirubicin (EPI)-Lipiodol (Lp) emulsion, and 1 was treated with EPI-Lp emulsion.The balloon was located and inflated at the lobar level (C: conventional)in 3 patients (60%) and at the subsegmental or more distal level (SS: superselective) in 2 patients (40%). Chemical vascular damage was considered to cause the cholangitis.We conclude that it is necessary to determine the optimal drug for B-TACE to reduce vascular damage. Miriplatin may be useful because of its lower vascular damage compared with CDDP-Lp and EPI-Lp.
