Many targeted drugs have been studied to target the molecular pathways involved in the development of gastrointestinal cancers. Anti-VEGF, anti-EGFR agents, and recently also multi-kinase inhibitor regorafenib, have already been available for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer patients. To date, Her-2 positive, gastric cancer patients, are also treated with trastuzumab, while the multi-targeted inhibitor, sorafenib, represents the standard treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Finally, sunitinib and everolimus, have been approved for the treatment of the neuroendocrine gastroenteropancreatic tumors. Actually a great number of further drugs are under preclinical and clinical development. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the state of art, focusing on the new emerging strategies in the personalized treatment of gastrointestinal tumors.
