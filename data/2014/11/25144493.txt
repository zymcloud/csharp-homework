Background:Viral hepatitis is major a public health problem affecting millions of people worldwide. Estimates assume 400 000-500 000 people chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Germany. Long-term consequences are the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of the study was to assess the costs for treating patients with chronic HCV in Germany.Methods:We conducted a retrospective multicenter observational study. The design was approved by an ethics committee, and patients were asked for their informed consent. Patients were grouped in four different health states. Healthcare utilization data were extracted from doctor files of six medical centers in Germany.Results:Data of 315 patients with chronic HCV were analyzed. The mean age was 49.4 years, 57.5% were male and 67.9% had a genotype 1 infection. The most common routes of transmission were injection drug use (39.0%) and infection through blood products (15.9%). The average total cost was €19 147 including ambulatory care and diagnostics (€1686), pharmaceuticals (€14 875), inpatient care (€1293), and sick leave (€1293). For patients in stable health states (mild and moderate HCV, compensated cirrhosis), costs did not differ significantly and were mainly influenced by antiviral treatment. For patients with decompensated cirrhosis, inpatient care accounted for the largest part of the costs.Conclusion:Treatment of HCV patients involves high costs, mainly associated with the length of antiviral therapy. Viral eradication can prevent severe disease stages, which are associated with high costs. It is necessary to follow current guidelines and monitor patients closely to avoid unnecessary costs.
