We evaluated posaconazole serum concentrations and hepatotoxicity in 12 leukemia patients who transitioned from posaconazole suspension to tablets. Patients who switched to tablets had significantly increased posaconazole concentrations (median: suspension, 748 ng/ml; tablet, 1,910 ng/ml; P < 0.01) without clinically relevant hepatotoxicity.
