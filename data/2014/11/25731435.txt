We report 3 cases of recurrent hepatic cancer in patients who underwent laparoscopic repeat hepatectomy (LRH). Case 1: A 70-year-old female with ascending colon cancer and liver metastases underwent open right colectomy followed by open S5 resection. Seven months later, the patient experienced a recurrence in the lateral segment and underwent laparoscopy-assisted ( L-A) partial resection. The adhesiolysis around the left liver was performed through a 7-cm upper median incision. Partial resection of the lateral segment was performed by hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) using a median incision. Case 2: A 63-year-old female with metachronous liver metastases from rectal cancer underwent open S4a and S5 resection. Nineteen months later, she experienced a recurrence in S4b and underwent an L-A S4b resection. Adhesiolysis around the previous hepatic transection was performed through a small upper median incision. Mobilization of the liver was performed by HALS. A hepatic transection of S4b was also performed in the upper median incision. Case 3: An 80-year-old female with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence in the lateral segment after open S4 resection underwent L-A lateral segmentectomy. An adhesiolysis, mobilization of the liver, and a hepatic transection were performed by HALS and hybrid technique as described in case 2. In a patient with a history of open hepatectomy, LRH may be extensively indicated by utilizing HALS or a hybrid procedure.
