The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. A significant portion of the morbidity and mortality associated with HCV is a consequence of numerous HCV-associated comorbidities. Type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis, two known complications of the metabolic syndrome, are noteworthy, because HCV has been suggested to play a role in their pathogenesis. In addition, HCV also causes steatosis, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular events. This review summarizes the evidence supporting the association between HCV and steatosis, insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Their diagnostic, prognostic and management aspects are discussed.
