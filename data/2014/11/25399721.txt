Introduction:The impact of foodborne trematode infections is gaining recognition worldwide. Clonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis are some of the most neglected tropical foodborne diseases that pose a significant threat to human health. Persistent or chronic infection of Clonorchis/Opisthorchis often leads to hepatobiliary diseases including cholangitis, cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, hepatic fibrosis, cholangiocarcinoma and liver cancer. Two cases of Clonorchis/Opisthorchis infection in humans in the Central Region of Ghana are reported.Case presentation:Eggs suspected to be from Clonorchis sinensis or Opisthorchis species were detected in the stools of a 29-year-old Ghanaian woman and an 18-year-old Ghanaian woman in two clinics in the Central Region of Ghana. The diagnosis was based on clinical symptoms as well as detection of the eggs of the trematode in the faeces of the patients using light microscopy after staining with Giemsa or Ziehl-Neelsen stains.Conclusions:To the best of our knowledge these are the first documented cases of Clonorchis sinensis or Opisthorchis species infection in Ghana. The detection of this infection in these patients in Ghana should be of concern to clinicians because the infection can be easily misdiagnosed since the accompanying clinical symptoms are malaria-like. Consideration should therefore be given to Clonorchis sinensis and Opisthorchis species when diagnosing patients presenting with malaria-like symptoms.
