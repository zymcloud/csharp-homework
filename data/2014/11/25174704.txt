MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non‑coding, endogenous RNAs that are important in tumor cell biological processes as they regulate gene expression. miR-195 has been demonstrated to be a tumor repressor in numerous types of human cancer. However, the mechanism by which miR‑195 suppresses tumor development remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of miR-195 on the biological functions of HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and identify the association between miR-195 and Wnt3a in HCC. miR-195 mRNA expression levels in HCC tissues and cell lines were measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. miR-195 function was measured with cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis assays following transfection with miR‑195 and anti‑miR‑195 sequences, and the respective controls. Luciferase reporter assay was used to determine whether Wnt3a was a target of miR-195. In addition, Wnt3a expression levels were determined in HCC cells using western blot analysis. The miR-195 expression levels were found to be reduced in HCC tissues and cell lines. miR-195 overexpression resulted in a reduction in cell proliferation. In addition, the overexpression of miR-195 in HCC cells induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest and promoted apoptosis. Furthermore, Wnt3a was demonstrated to be directly targeted by miR-195. These findings suggest that miR-195 is key in regulating cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis through targeting Wnt3a. In addition, overexpression of miR-195 may be a potential therapeutic strategy in the treatment of HCC.
