The hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier rate has decreased in Japan; however, the incidence of HBV infection among hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients has not decreased accordingly. In this study, we aimed to assess the time trends of the clinical characteristics in HCC patients with chronic HBV infection. Between 2000 and 2012, we enrolled a total of 156 HCC patients with chronic HBV infection in our field survey. The HCC risk was evaluated using the HCC prediction score, which is constructed from the characteristics of age, presence of liver cirrhosis and serum levels of albumin, bilirubin and HBV DNA. Lifestyle factors and the presence of diabetes mellitus were also evaluated. The time trends of patient characteristics were analyzed using the Jonckheere-Terpstra proportion trend test. Among HCC patients with chronic HBV infection, the proportion of patients at high risk according to the HCC prediction score significantly decreased during the study period (P=0.0005). Similarly, the proportion of patients with liver cirrhosis, ≤3.5 g/dl serum albumin level, >4 log copies/ml serum HBV DNA level and ≥60 g/day alcohol intake were also significantly decreased. The proportion of male and obese patients was not significantly altered, whereas the proportion of elderly (≥65 years) and diabetic patients tended to increase during the study period (P=0.0654 and P=0.0528, respectively). In this study, we analyzed the time trends of the clinical characteristics in HCC patients with chronic HBV infection and demonstrated that aging and diabetes mellitus may be involved in the hepatocarcinogenesis in patients with chronic HBV infection.
