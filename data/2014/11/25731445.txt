A 70s man with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) (Vp-HCC) in the main trunk (Vp4) was referred to our hospital. He was negative for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV), and his liver function was well preserved. The main tumor was in the right lobe and exceeded 10 cm in diameter. There were no intrahepatic metastases to the left lobe. The patient underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) (48 Gy/4 fractions) to the area of the PVTT. Six days after SBRT, the patient underwent right lobectomy for removal of PVTT. The postoperative course was uneventful, and low-dose 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin(FP)intra-arterial chemotherapy was administered for 3 months. Histopathological findings for the tumor indicated a poorly differentiated HCC, vp4, with moderate to severe tumor necrosis or degeneration in the area that received SBRT. Tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], proteins induced by vitamin K absence [PIVKA-II]) decreased within the normal range, and there was no apparent HCC recurrence 6 months after the hepatectomy. Multidisciplinary treatment combined with preoperative SBRT and radical resection for Vp-HCC was feasible and effective in this case.
