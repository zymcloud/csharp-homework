Paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10) has been identified as a genetic imprinted gene, which is important for apoptosis resistance in cancer cells. Mounting evidence suggests that PEG10 is expressed in the majority of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells with growth-promoting activity. In the present study, we evaluated the correlation between PEG10 expression and the clinicopathological features of lung, breast and HCC tumors, and predicted the relationship between survival and expression levels of PEG10 in lung cancer patients. Furthermore, we chose non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 as a model to analyze the function of PEG10 in proliferation and metastasis in vitro. Our results revealed that expression of PEG10 was closely correlated with clinical TNM grade and patient prognosis in lung cancer. PEG10 enhanced cell proliferation and promoted tumor cell migration and invasion by upregulating the expression of Î²-catenin, MMP-2 and MMP-9, and decreased the expression of E-cadherin in the A549 cells. Our findings provide significant insight into the molecular mechanisms of lung cancer and offer novel ideas for designing new therapeutic targets for lung carcinoma.
