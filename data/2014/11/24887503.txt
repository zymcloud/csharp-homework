Reaction of 4-aminoacetophenone and 4-bromobenzaldehyde in ethanol resulted in the formation of the monodentate V-shaped Schiff base (E)-1-(4-((4-bromo-benzylidene)amino)phenyl)ethanone (L). Interaction of L with different di- and trivalent metal ions revealed disubstituted derivatives. The ligand and its complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, mass, IR and NMR spectrometry. Biological activities of the ligand and complexes against the Escherchia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacterias, and the two fungus Aspergillus flavus and Candida albicans were screened. The cytotoxicity of the compounds were checked as antitumor agents on liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2). They exhibited in vitro broad range of antitumor activities towards the cell line; the [ZnL2(H2O)2](NO3)2 complex was stronger antitumor towards HepG2 cell line as well as two breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and T47D) relative to cis-platin.
