Aim:Previous European and North American studies analyzed the relationship between survival rate and sustained virological response (SVR) to interferon (IFN) therapy in patients with recurrent hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection after liver transplantation (LT). The present study was designed to define the same relationship in Japanese patients who had undergone LT.Methods:Forty-seven patients (genotype 1, 40; genotype 2, 7) with recurrent HCV after LT were treated with pegylated interferon (PEG IFN) or IFN/ribavirin (RBV). In possible, within 3 months after LT, patients started treatment with PEG IFN-α-2b or IFN-α-2b s.c. once weekly combined with RBV (200 mg/day).Results:The SVR rate was 51% (24/47) for all patients, 42.5% (17/40) for genotype 1 and 100% (7/7) for genotype 2. The median follow-up period was 71 months (range, 24-152). The survival rate of 24 patients who achieved SVR was 95% at 5 years and 92% at 10 years. These rates were significantly better than those of 23 patients who did not achieve SVR (82% at 5 years, 58% at 10 years) (P = 0.027). Two patients of the SVR group died during follow up (due to hepatocellular carcinoma in one and chronic rejection in one), while six non-SVR patients died during the same period (three died due to liver failure by recurrent HCV).Conclusion:SVR following IFN therapy contributes to improvement of survival rate in patients with recurrent post-LT HCV infection.
