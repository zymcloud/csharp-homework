The suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) are well-known negative regulators of cytokine receptor signaling. SOCS6 is one of eight members of the SOCS family of proteins. Similar to other SOCS proteins, SOCS6 consists of an uncharacterized extended N-terminal region followed by an SH2 domain and a SOCS box. Unlike other SOCS proteins, SOCS6 is mainly involved in negative regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. SOCS6 is widely expressed in many tissues and is found to be downregulated in many cancers including colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, stomach cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer. SOCS6 is involved in negative regulation of receptor signaling by increasing degradation mediated by ubiquitination of receptors or substrate proteins and induces apoptosis by targeting mitochondrial proteins. Therefore, SOCS6 turns out as an important regulator of survival signaling and its activity is required for controlling receptor tyrosine kinase signaling.
