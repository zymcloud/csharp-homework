The study aim was to investigate how gold nanoparticles (NPs) of different sizes (20 and 100 nm) influence primary hepatocytes, the hepatocyte cell line C3A and macrophage cytokine responses when dispersed in lung or blood relevant fluids. Gold Au NPs induced cytotoxicity in primary hepatocytes at the highest dose of 66 μg/cm2, this effect was modified by the dispersant, the effect was greater with lung lining fluid (LLF). Release of interleukin (IL)-6, Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and IL-1β was enhanced by the Au NPs and the effects were influenced by the particle size and dispersant. In medium, the smallest particle size was most effective at inducing IL-6 release, while in LLF the largest particles were most effective at inducing IL-6 release. Both 20 nm and 100 nm particles enhanced MCP-1 and IL-1β in the presence of LLF. The Au particles had no cytotoxic effects nor did they stimulate the release of cytokines in the C3A hepatoma cell line. The Au NPs had no significant impact on macrophage viability. Particles induced IL-6 and TNF-α release. LLF and serum reduced the IL-6 response while albumin enhanced the TNF-α response compared to medium dispersed Au NPs. The Au NPs did not impact on MCP-1 release, but this cytokine was enhanced by albumin and serum, while it was depressed by LLF. The macrophage responses were lower than those evoked in primary hepatocytes. In conclusion, when assessing the cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory responses induced by Au NPs, the response is influenced by the dispersant, with different dispersants having different effects in different cell types.
