Introduction:The Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) is a multifunctional oncoprotein involved in the proliferation and aggressiveness of cancer cells. The aim of this study was to determine whether strong YB-1 expression in neoplastic cells of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) may have an impact on liver disease-free survival following liver resection.Materials and methods:Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate YB-1 in 66 patients who underwent liver resection for CRLM. YB-1 expression was classified as weak (low-staining intensity) and strong (high-staining intensity).Results:YB-1 expression was observed in the cytoplasm of all CRLM. YB-1 expression was weak in 17 patients (25.8%) and strong in 49 patients (74.2%). Liver recurrence rate was significantly higher in the strong than in the weak expression group: 55.1 vs. 23.5% (p = 0.023). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that YB-1 strong expression was the only independent risk factor for liver recurrence. The 5-year specific liver disease-free survival rate was 76.0% in the weak expression group and 41.5% in the strong expression group (p = 0.034). These results were not influenced by clinical prognostic factors of tumor recurrence.Conclusions:This is the first study showing that the degree of YB-1 expression in tissue specimens of CRLM predicts liver recurrence following liver resection.
