Background and aim:Hepatic iron accumulation is considered to be a cofactor that influences liver injury and hepatocarcinogenesis. Aim of this study is to determine whether serum ferritin (SF) levels relate to overall survival (OS) and time to recurrence (TTR) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Methods:We measured SF levels in 103 HCC patients (median age 70, M/F = 82.5%/17.5%) who underwent RFA between 2005 and 2010. Correlation between SF and other prognostic factors at baseline was analyzed. SF levels were entered into a Cox model and their influence on OS and TTR was evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:SF did not correlate with Î±-fetoprotein (rho: -0.12, P = 0.22), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (rho: -0.1020, P = 0.30), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (rho: 0.18, P = 0.06), Child-Pugh score (P = 0.5), or Barcelona Cancer of the Liver Clinic stage (P = 0.16). A log-rank test found the value of 244 ng/mL as the optimal prognostic cut-off point for SF. Median OS was 62 months (54-78) and survival rate was 97%, 65%, and 52% at 1, 4, and 5 years, respectively. Performance status and SF were the only predictors of OS at multivariate analysis. Median TTR was 38 months (34-49) with a recurrence-free survival rate of 82.5%, 26.2%, and 23.3% at 1, 4, and 5 years, respectively, while SF and age were the only predictors of TTR.Conclusions:SF level, possibly reflecting the degree of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, is a negative risk factor for survival and recurrence after percutaneous RFA in HCC patients.
