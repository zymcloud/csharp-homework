Background:For patients with synchronous liver and lung metastases from colorectal cancer, the invasiveness of adding thoracic to abdominal surgery is an obstacle to concurrent liver and lung metastasectomy. We developed a simple technique to resect lung lesions via a transdiaphragmatic approach without thoracic incision in patients undergoing liver metastasectomy.Methods:Sixteen patients with synchronous liver and unilateral lung metastases underwent transdiaphragmatic wedge resection of lung lesions simultaneous with liver metastasectomy. Short-term operative outcomes were compared with those in 102 patients treated with conventional unilateral wedge resection for colorectal lung metastases.Results:Twenty peripheral (<3 cm from the pleura) lung lesions from various locations in the lung were resected via transdiaphragmatic approach. No conversions to conventional approach were required. The median tumor number and size were 1 (range, 1-3) and 8 mm (range, 3-30 mm), respectively. Transdiaphragmatic resection reduced median operative blood loss compared with conventional resection (0 mL vs 50 mL [P < .001]) and reduced median duration of hospital stay compared with staged liver and lung resection (6 days vs 11 days [P < .001]). Operative duration and rates of lung-related morbidity and positive surgical margin were similar between the transdiaphragmatic and conventional groups (104 minutes vs 105 minutes [P = .61], 13% vs 4% [P = .15], and 6% vs 5% [P = .73], respectively).Conclusion:Simultaneous transdiaphragmatic resection of peripheral lung lesions is safe in patients undergoing liver resection. The low-invasive transdiaphragmatic approach facilitates aggressive operative treatment for synchronous liver and lung metastases.
