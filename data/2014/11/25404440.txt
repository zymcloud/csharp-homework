Objective:To validate a cheaper and more accessible flow cytometry-based method of assessing Asialoglycoprotein Receptor (ASGPR) expression for hepatic functional reserve.Study design:A retrospective analysis.Place and duration of study:Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, from January 2011 to October 2013.Methodology:Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) undergoing major hepatectomy at Beijing Ditan Hospital, during the study period were retrospectively studied. The fraction of hepatocytes expressing ASGPR in liver tissues was assessed by flow cytometry. Patients were grouped according to the presence or absence of postoperative hepatic dysfunction. The correlation between ASGPR expression and pre-operative liver function parameters with the outcomes of hepatectomy were analyzed.Results:Fewer hepatocytes from patients with postoperative hepatic dysfunction expressed ASGPR [63.3 (57.3 - 68.2)] than from patients without postoperative hepatic dysfunction [72.4 (70.6 - 76.3), p Conclusion:Flow cytometric assessment of ASGPR expression may be a useful predictor of liver dysfunction following major hepatectomy for HCC in Chinese patients.
