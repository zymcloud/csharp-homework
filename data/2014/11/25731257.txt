Patients with colon cancer who present with stenosis are treated with emergency surgery. Colostomy or Hartmann's operation are commonly performed, but are associated with an increased risk of complications such as anastomotic leakage, which reduce the quality of life of the patient. In our patient, emergency surgery was avoided by metallic stent placement. Metallic stents can be an effective bridge to surgery in colon cancer patients with ileal symptoms.
