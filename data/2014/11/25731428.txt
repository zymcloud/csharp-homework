A 78-year-old man presented with fever and jaundice. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a hepatocellular carcinoma in the hepatic left lobe as well as right-sided ligamentum teres (RSLT). Extended left hepatic lobetectomy was performed without division at the left Glissonian root in order to preserve the Glissonian branch at segment 8. No complications occurred during the post-operative course of 13 days. Pathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as a combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma. Additional congenital variations can exist in RSLT frequently; therefore, we must take care when performing hepatobiliary surgeries. Recently, advanced imaging modalities, such as multi-detector rowcomputed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI), help us obtain virtual images of vascular architecture and to plan the operative procedure.
