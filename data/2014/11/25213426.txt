Purpose:Retrospective evaluation of intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient survival after undergoing chemoembolization based on the Child-Pugh score.Materials and methods:Data of intermediate-stage HCC patients undergoing chemoembolization were gathered from 43 centers in Japan. Overall survival rates were compared with Child-Pugh scores.Results:Of the 329 patients examined in this study, Child-Pugh scores were 5 (CP-5) in 136 patients (41.3%), 6 (CP-6) in 101 patients (30.7%), 7 (CP-7) in 58 (17.7%), 8 (CP-8) in 22 (6.7%), and 9 (CP-9) in 12 (3.6%). Two-year survival rates were 77.5% in CP-5 patients (p = 0.047 vs. CP-6), 65.1% in CP-6 patients (p = 0.038 vs. CP-7), 51.3% in CP-7 patients (p = 0.30 vs. CP-8, p = 0.034 vs. CP-9), 50.3% in CP-8 patients (p = 0.0065 vs. CP-9), and 16.7% in CP-9 patients. Two-year survival rates were 77.2% in 139 patients meeting the 4 tumors of 7 cm criterion with Child-Pugh class A (B1) (p Conclusion:The Child-Pugh score is a useful prognostic factor to stratify intermediate-stage HCC patients.
