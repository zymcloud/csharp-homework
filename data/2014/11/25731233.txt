Continuous hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) refractory to trans-arterial chemoembolization ( TACE) sometimes adversely affects the quality of life (QOL) of patients. Herein, we report a one-shot intraarterial infusion of cisplatin powder (IA-call®) combined with oral anticancer drugs for recurrent HCC refractory to TACE after liver resection.From July 2013, 4 patients who were diagnosed with recurrent HCC refractory to TACE after liver resection were treated with IA-call® infusions at 1-2 month intervals.Encapsulated tegafur-uracil (UFT-E) or sorafenib were administered sequentially.On average, IA-call® was administered 3.6 times per patient at a mean dosage of 93 mg per treatment. UFT-E was combined with the IA-call® infusion for 3 patients, and a sorafenib combination was used for 1 patient.In terms of the therapeutic effects of these regimens, we observed complete response (CR) in 1 patient, partial response (PR) in 2 patients, and progressive disease (PD) in 1 patient(response rate: 75%). Therefore, one-shot intra-arterial infusion of IAcall ® combined with oral anticancer drugs is an effective therapy for recurrent HCC while maintaining patients' QOL.
