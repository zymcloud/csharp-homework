Background:Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) has emerged as an important cause of bloodstream infections in intensive care units (ICUs). The aim of this study was to determine risk factors for bloodstream infections caused by CRKP as well as risk factors for CRKP-associated mortality among ICU patients after orthotopic liver transplantation (LT).Methods:The study cohort of this observational study comprised 17 ICU patients after LT with CRKP bloodstream infections. The data from these patients were matched with 34 ICU patients (1:2) after LT without CRKP infections. The 2 groups were compared to identify risk factors for development of CRKP infection and risk factors for mortality.Results:Seventeen CRKP bloodstream infections occurred in ICU patients after LT from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2011. In univariate analysis, primary liver disease and especially hepatitis C virus infection or hepatocellular cancer were significant factors for development of CRKP. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score as well as CRKP bloodstream infection were predictors for ICU death (P < .05) in univariate analysis.Conclusions:CRKP bloodstream infections affect immunocompromised post-transplantation patients more. Bloodstream infections with CRKP along with APACHE and SOFA scores were predictors of death in ICU patients after LT.
