Pancreatic cancer (PC; pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma) is characterized by significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 has been known as a PC biomarker, it is not commonly used for general screening because of its low sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a new biomarker for PC diagnosis in the earlier stage of cancer. To search for a novel serologic PC biomarker, we carried out an integrated proteomic analysis for a total of 185 pooled or individual plasma from healthy donors and patients with five disease groups including chronic pancreatitis (CP), PC, and other cancers (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and gastric cancer) and identified complement factor b (CFB) as a candidate serologic biomarker for PC diagnosis. Immunoblot analysis of CFB revealed more than two times higher expression in plasma samples from PC patients compared with plasma from individuals without PC. Immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry analysis confirmed both molecular identity and higher expression of CFB in PC samples. CFB showed distinctly higher specificity than CA 19-9 for PC against other types of digestive cancers and in discriminating PC patients from non-PC patients (p
