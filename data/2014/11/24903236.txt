Background:Performance status is closely linked with survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We evaluated the impact of performance status on patients with small HCC receiving radiofrequency ablation (RFA) versus transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:A total of 424 and 282 patients within the Milan criteria undergoing RFA and TACE, respectively, were analyzed. Patients were classified as performance status 0 (n = 516) and performance status ≥1 (n = 190) groups. A propensity-score matching analysis with preset caliper width was used. A total of 167 and 68 matched pairs were selected from patients with a performance status of 0 and ≥1, respectively.Results:Radiofrequency ablation provided significantly better long-term survival than TACE for patients within the Milan criteria (p Conclusions:For HCC patients within the Milan criteria with a performance status of 0, RFA provides better long-term survival than TACE. RFA should be considered a priority treatment in inoperable HCC patients within the Milan criteria. Performance status is a feasible surrogate marker to enhance treatment allocation.
