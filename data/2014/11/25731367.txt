We report a case of lung and bone metastases of right advanced breast cancer in a 33-year-old woman. Her breast cancer (T4bN1M1, StageIV)was resected in December 2003 (mastectomy [BT] plus axillary lymph node dissection [AX]) after local arterial infusion therapy and subsequent systemic chemo-endocrine therapy was initiated and continued. In June 2007, a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed cardiac tamponade due to pericarditis carcinomatosa. Pericardiocentesis was performed, and the bloody effusion was drained immediately. Subsequently, the sysytemic chemo-endocrine therapy was modified. In 2009, multiple cerebellar metastases were discovered and treated via whole brain irradiation. In 2010, multiple liver metastases appeared, and they were treated by intravenous (IV) administration of nab-paclitaxel. In 2011, superior vena cava syndrome appeared gradually, and it was treated via venous metallic stenting. In 2012, epidural spinal cord compression appeared gradually, and it was treated via irradiation. In November 2012, the patient died because of lymphangitis carcinomatosa; her prognosis was good, as it was approximately 5 years after the pericardiocentesis.
