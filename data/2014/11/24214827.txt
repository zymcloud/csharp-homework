Purpose:To investigate the feasibility that arterial enhancement fraction (AEF) is associated with response of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following intra-arterial therapy (IAT) and to compare AEF response with currently used tumor response metrics.Materials and methods:The AEF, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), modified RECIST (mRECIST), and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) of the largest treated index lesion and AEF of the tumor-free hepatic parenchyma was measured on representative axial images in 131 patients (108 male; mean age, 61.9 years). Clinical measures and patient survival were assessed. Statistical analysis included Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the COX proportional hazards model.Results:After IAT, the mean AEF of the tumor decreased by 22% (66.7-44.8%, P Conclusion:Evaluating the AEF values based on tri-phasic MRI is associated with tumor response in patients with unresectable HCC treated with IAT.
