We report here an experience treating a patient who developed gastric cancer at the same time as a multifocal intrahepatic recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The patient was a 76-year-old woman who underwent partial liver resection after diagnosis of HCC in August 2008. Histopathological examination revealed moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma and stage III pathology. Six months following surgery, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a typeIIa+IIc gastric tumor in the angle of the stomach, which was pathologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma(por2/sig) in the biopsy. Simultaneously, abdominal CT scan revealed multifocal intrahepatic recurrence of HCC, so Lip-TACE as performed. Eight days after TACE, S-1 (80 mg/body) was initiated. About one month after TACE, abdominal CT scan revealed multiple new hepat- ic lesions. The patient was repeatedly treated with a combination of Lip-TACE on day 1 and S-1 80 mg/body/day, administered on days 8 to 35 for 28 days, followed by a 7 day interval as 1 course. After 5 courses of medication of S-1, liver function had deteriorated and thrombocytopenia occurred. Although there was no progression of gastric cancer, medication of S-1 was discontinued. Lip-TACE was performed nine times. About one year after the initial TACE, the patient was admitted to our hospital in order to control ascites, 3 days after admission, she suffered a cerebral infarction and died 3 days later.
