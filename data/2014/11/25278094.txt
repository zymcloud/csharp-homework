Liver resection has become a common treatment for liver tumors and hepatocellular carcinoma over the past decades. However, after surgery, the remnant livers in some patients fail to regenerate. Therefore, there is an urgent medical need to develop drugs that can promote liver regeneration. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the promotive effect of alisol B 23-acetate (AB23A) on liver regeneration in mice following partial hepatectomy (PH), and further elucidate the involvement of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the liver regeneration-promotive effect using in vivo and in vitro experiments. The results showed that AB23A dose-dependently promoted hepatocyte proliferation via upregulating hepatocyte proliferation-related protein forkhead box M1b (FoxM1b), Cyclin D1 and Cyclin B1 expression, and attenuated liver injury via an inhibition in Cyp7a1 and an induction in efflux transporters Bsep expression resulting in reduced hepatic bile acid levels. These changes in the genes, as well as accelerated liver regeneration in AB23A-treated mice were abrogated by FXR antagonist guggulsterone in vivo. In vitro evidences also directly showed the regulation of these genes by AB23A was abrogated when FXR was silenced. Luciferase reporter assay in HepG2 cells and molecular docking further demonstrated the effect of AB23A on FXR activation in vitro. In conclusions, AB23A produces promotive effect on liver regeneration, due to FXR-mediated regulation of genes involved in hepatocyte proliferation and hepato-protection. AB23A has the potential to be a novel therapeutic option for facilitating efficient liver regeneration in patients subjected to liver resection.
