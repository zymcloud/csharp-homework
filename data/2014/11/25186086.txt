Background:In cardiometabolic disorders, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is frequent and presumably associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular risk.Aim:To evaluate the prognostic value of non-invasive biomarkers of liver fibrosis (FibroTest) and steatosis (SteatoTest) in patients with type-2 diabetes and/or dyslipidaemia.Methods:A total of 2312 patients with type-2 diabetes and/or dyslipidaemia were included and prospectively followed up for 5-15 years. The cardiovascular Framingham-risk score was calculated; advanced fibrosis and severe steatosis, were defined by FibroTest >0.48 and SteatoTest >0.69, respectively, as previously established.Results:During a median follow-up of 12 years, 172 patients (7.4%) died. The leading causes of mortality were cancer (31%) and cardiovascular-related death (20%). The presence of advanced fibrosis [HR (95% CI)] [2.98 (95% CI 1.78-4.99); P < 0.0001] or severe steatosis [1.86 (1.34-2.58); P = 0.0002] was associated with an increased risk of mortality. In a multivariate Cox model adjusted for confounders: the presence of advanced fibrosis was associated with overall mortality [1.95 (1.12-3.41); P = 0.02]; advanced fibrosis at baseline [n = 50/677; 1.92 (1.04-3.55); P = 0.04] and progression to advanced fibrosis during follow-up [n = 16/127; 4.8 (1.5-14.9); P = 0.007] were predictors of cardiovascular events in patients with type-2 diabetes. In patients with a Framingham-risk score â‰¥20%, the presence of advanced fibrosis was predictive of cardiovascular events [2.24 (1.16-4.33); P < 0.05].Conclusions:Liver biomarkers, such as FibroTest and SteatoTest, have prognostic values in patients with metabolic disorders. FibroTest has prognostic value for predicting overall survival in patients with type-2 diabetes and/or dyslipidaemia. In type-2 diabetes, FibroTest predicted cardiovascular events and improved the Framingham-risk score.
