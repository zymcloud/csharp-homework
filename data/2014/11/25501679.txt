This study aimed to investigate the association between HBV mutations and intrahepatic HBV status and to determine the clinical features and the contribution of HBV mutations to postoperative prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with HBsAg (+) in China. Using TaqMan fluorescent real-time PCR, HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) and total DNA (tDNA) were both quantified in 106 pairs of tumor tissues (TT) and adjacent non-tumor tissues (ANTT) obtained from HCC patients who received no antiviral treatment before surgical treatment. The prevalence of 19 hot spot mutations was evaluated by Sanger sequencing. HBV cccDNA and tDNA were lower in TT than in ANTT. The loads of cccDNA and tDNA in ANTT were associated with serum HBV DNA and HBeAg. Three Pre-S mutants (A2962G and C2964A in Pre-S1 and C105T in Pre-S2) were associated with higher tumor cccDNA levels (P
