The development of molecular pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is complex and involves alterations in the expression and conformation of assorted oncoproteins and tumor suppressors. Chaperonin containing TCP1 (CCT) is a cytolic molecular chaperone complex that is required for the correct folding of numerous proteins. In this study, we investigated a possible involvement of CCT subunit 8 (CCT8) in HCC development. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed in 102 human HCC samples. High CCT8 expression was detected in clinical HCC samples compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues. The univariate and multivariate survival analyses were also performed to determine their prognostic significance. Western blot confirmed the high expression of CCT8 in HCC compared with adjacent normal tissue. Moreover, the biological significance of the aberrant expression of CCT8 was investigated in HCC cell lines. Expression of CCT8 was correlated directly with the histologic grades and tumor size of HCC and high expression of CCT8 was associated with a poor prognosis. CCT8 depletion by siRNA inhibited cell proliferation and blocked S-phase entry in HuH7 cells. These results suggested that CCT8 might be an oncogene and participate in HCC cell proliferation. These findings provide a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HCC.
