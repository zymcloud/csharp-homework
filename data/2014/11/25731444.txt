A 50-year-old man presented to our hospital with the chief complaint of right hypochondriac pain and a palpable tumor. Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and chronic hepatitis B infection were diagnosed and treated by twice-repeated transcatheterarterial chemoembolization (TACE) followed by administration of entecavir. Two months after the last TACE, alpha-fetoprotein(AFP)and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonistII (PIVKA-II) levels had elevated, and multiple small early enhancing nodules were detected on computed tomography(CT)scan. Based on his age and liver function (Child-Pugh score A5), a full dose of sorafenib (800 mg/day) was administered. The sorafenib dose was decreased after one month to 400mg/day because of hand-foot syndrome. Following sorafenib administration, the lesions shrank markedly, and complete response (CR) according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors(mRECIST)was achieved within 4 months. Six months after sorafenib treatment was begun, recurrent HCC was detected in segment 6, near the previously treated lesion. The decreased size of the main tumor and normalization of AFP levels allowed curative surgical resection. The patient was discharged 5 days after surgery and is currently treated with a half dose of sorafenib. Thirteen months after surgery, a small early enhancing lesion is visible on postoperative CT scan, but AFP and PIVKA-II levels are still keeping in a normal range. This case demonstrates that if sorafenib treatment is effective, then subsequent surgical treatment can be reconsidered in patients with advanced HCC responding to this combined therapy.
