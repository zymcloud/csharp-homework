MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in human cancer. Increasing evidences indicate that deregulation of miRNAs contributes to the hepatocarcinogenesis. In this study, we demonstrated that the levels of miR-543 were dramatically increased in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cell lines. Moreover, forced expression of miR-543 promoted the proliferative and invasive potential of HepG2. We also identified PAQR3 as a direct target gene for miR-543 using a fluorescent reporter assay and western blot. The levels of PAQR3 were dramatically decreased in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cell lines. The mRNA levels of PAQR3 were inversely correlated with the miR-543 expression level.Thus, our finding provides a new insight into the mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis, indicating a therapeutic potential of miR-543 in the treatment of HCC.
