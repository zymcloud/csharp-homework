Few studies investigated the prognosis of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC). This study was aimed to determine the prognostic value of differential blood cell counts including blood white cells, neutrophil, lymphocyte, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet in patients with aHCC. A total of 205 ethnic Chinese aHCC patients receiving non-systematic sorafenib were analyzed retrospectively. The prognostic value of differential blood cell counts and NLR for overall survival (OS) was determined by integration into Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score system using backward elimination model of multivariate Cox regression. As a result, NLR was confirmed to be an independent predictor for OS (p = 0.001) with the rest parameters presented negative results. Then, aHCC patients were dichotomized into two groups according to NLR values ≤ 2.43 or >2.43. Patients with low NLR presented lower CLIP score and higher 6-month survival rate (56.1 vs 25.9%) compared with patients with high NLR level. Besides, low NLR level was associated with favorable prognostic factors such as lower α-fetoprotein, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, as well as decreased incidence of ascites, portal vein thrombosis, and metastasis. Besides, low NLR level was associated less white cells and neutrophil granulocytes, as well as more lymphocyte. In summary, the present study firstly indentified NLR as an independent prognostic factor in aHCC patients receiving no systematic sorafenib.
