Between 15% and 30% of patients infected with HIV in the United States and Europe are coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), and rates of acute HCV infection have been increasing in some populations of HIV-positive patients. Liver disease is now a leading cause of death in HIV-infected patients. Patients with HIV/HCV coinfection have lower rates of spontaneous acute HCV clearance, poorer response to treatment of chronic HCV in the pre-direct-acting antiviral era, more rapid progression to cirrhosis, and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. This article will summarize data on management of HIV/HCV coinfection, discuss the epidemic of acute HCV infection in HIV-infected patients, and examine the many new HCV treatment regimens on the horizon with data on coinfected patients.
