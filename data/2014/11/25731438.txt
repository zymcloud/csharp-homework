The patient was a 79-year-old man diagnosed with a single 9.3-cm hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the medial segment of the liver, and left iliac bone metastasis. Initially, the patient was treated with a hepatic arterial infusion of low-dose FP (cisplatin/5-fluorouracil) at another hospital. Here, the patient received particle therapy for the left iliac bone metastasis at a total dose of 52.8 Gy in 4 fractions. Subsequently, he underwent medial segmentectomy of the liver to treat the primary HCC. Eleven months later, the first intrahepatic recurrence occurred, and the tumor was treated with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA). A second intrahepatic recurrence was detected 39 months later, which was also treated with percutaneous RFA. The patient remains well, with no evidence of tumor recurrence.
