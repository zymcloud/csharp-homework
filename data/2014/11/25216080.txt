Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for the majority of liver cancers. A hypoxic microenvironment is a common feature of HCC, and is associated with malignant invasion, metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) changes. Curcumin is a botanical agent derived from the dried rhizome of Curcuma longa. Although a number of preclinical studies have shown that curcumin has anticancer properties when administered in a normoxic microenvironment, no studies have directly examined the effect of curcumin on preventing HCC invasion and metastasis under hypoxic conditions. This study aimed to determine whether curcumin has effects on the hypoxia-induced malignant biological behavior of HCC. CoCl2 was used to establish a hypoxia model in vitro. The results showed that curcumin significantly decreased hypoxia-induced hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) protein level in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness, as well as EMT changes associated with HIF-1α accumulation generated by a hypoxic microenvironment, were eliminated by curcumin. In conclusion, these data indicate that curcumin may be a viable anticancer agent in the treatment of HCC.
