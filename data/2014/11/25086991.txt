Background:Prognostic influences of hepatic transection by an anterior approach using the liver hanging maneuver (LHM) has not been fully clarified.Methods:We examined 233 patients who underwent major hepatectomy with the LHM (n = 75; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 35, colorectal liver metastasis (CLM) in 10, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) in 14 and perihilar bile duct carcinoma (BDC) in 16) or without it (n = 158; HCC in 78, CLM in 21, ICC in 31 and BDC in 28).Results:In HCC patients, cancer-positive margin rate, blood loss, transection time and prevalence of posthepatectomy ascites in the LHM group were significantly lower than those in the non-LHM group (p Conclusions:Although advantages of LHM improving surgical records in major anatomical liver resections were clarified, oncological advantages in the long-term survival of LHM was still uncertain in the hepatobiliary malignancies.
