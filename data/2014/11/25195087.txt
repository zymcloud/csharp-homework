Background:The evaluation of specific risk factors for early endpoints in the gastric carcinogenesis pathway may further contribute to the understanding of gastric cancer aetiology.Aims:To quantify the relation between smoking and intestinal metaplasia through systematic review and meta-analysis.Methods:Articles providing data on the association between smoking and intestinal metaplasia were identified in PubMed(®), Scopus(®) and Web of Science™, searched until April 2014, and through backward citation tracking. Summary odds ratio estimates and 95% confidence intervals were computed using the DerSimonian and Laird method. Heterogeneity was quantitatively assessed using the I(2) statistic.Results:A total of 32 articles were included in this systematic review and 19 provided data for meta-analysis. Smoking was defined as ever vs. never (crude estimates, six studies, summary odds ratio=1.54, 95% confidence interval: 1.12-2.12, I(2)=67.4%; adjusted estimates, seven studies, summary odds ratio=1.26, 95% confidence interval: 0.98-1.61, I(2)=65.0%) and current vs. non-smokers (crude estimates, seven studies, summary odds ratio=1.27, 95% confidence interval: 0.88-1.84, I(2)=73.4%; adjusted estimates, two studies, summary odds ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval: 0.99-2.25, I(2)=0.0%).Conclusion:The weak and non-statistically significant association found through meta-analysis of the available evidence does not confirm smoking as an independent risk factor for intestinal metaplasia.
