Objective:To compare the therapeutic effects of surgical hepatic resection (HR) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma of 3-5 cm in diameter.Methods:The databases PubMed, CBMdisc, CNKI, WanFang Data and VIP databases were searched for controlled clinical trials on evaluating the efficacy between RFA and HR in treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma of 3-5 cm in diameter published from January 1990 to February 2014. Two reviewers independently screened the literature, extracted the data and assessed the methodological quality of the studies included. Then the meta-analysis was performed by using RevMan5.0 software.Results:Eleven controlled clinical trials were included, including one randomized controlled trial and 10 non-randomized controlled trials. A total of 811 patients were involved: 404 patients were treated with RFA as the initial treatment and 407 patients with surgical resection. Meta-analysis showed that for a single lesion with diameter of 3-5 cm of primary hepatocellular carcinoma, the 3-， 5-year disease-free survival rates in HR group was significantly higher than those in RFA group (all P0.05). For 1-2 nodules with diameters of 3-5 cm of primary hepatocellular carcinoma, the 3-， 5-year disease-free survival rates and 5-year overall survival rates in HR group was significantly higher than those in RFA group (all P0.05). For maximum nodule of 3-5 cm of multiple primary hepatocellular carcinoma, the 5-year overall survival rates in HR group was significantly higher than that in RFA group (all P0.05).Conclusion:For primary hepatocellular carcinoma of 3-5 cm in diameter, HR is better than RFA. For the limitation of quality and quantity of included studies, this conclusion needs to be confirmed by more high quality studies.
