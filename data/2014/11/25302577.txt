Enhanced fucosylation has been suggested as a marker for serologic monitoring of liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We present a workflow for quantitative site-specific analysis of fucosylation and apply it to a comparison of hemopexin (HPX) and complement factor H (CFH), two liver-secreted glycoproteins, in healthy individuals and patients with liver cirrhosis and HCC. Label-free LC-MS quantification of glycopeptides derived from these purified glycoproteins was performed on pooled samples (2 pools/group, 5 samples/pool) and complemented by glycosidase assisted analysis using sialidase and endoglycosidase F2/F3, respectively, to improve resolution of glycoforms. Our analysis, presented as relative abundance of individual fucosylated glycoforms normalized to the level of their nonfucosylated counterparts, revealed a consistent increase in fucosylation in liver disease with significant site- and protein-specific differences. We have observed the highest microheterogeneity of glycoforms at the N187 site of HPX, absence of core fucosylation at N882 and N911 sites of CFH, or a higher degree of core fucosylation in CFH compared to HPX, but we did not identify changes differentiating HCC from matched cirrhosis samples. Glycosidase assisted LC-MS-MRM analysis of individual patient samples prepared by a simplified protocol confirmed the quantitative differences. Transitions specific to outer arm fucose document a disease-associated increase in outer arm fucose on both bi- and triantennary glycans at the N187 site of HPX. Further verification is needed to confirm that enhanced fucosylation of HPX and CFH may serve as an indicator of premalignant liver disease. The analytical strategy can be readily adapted to analysis of other proteins in the appropriate disease context.
