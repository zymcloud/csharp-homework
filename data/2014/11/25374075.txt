Objective:To establish SMMC-7721 human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line stably expressing hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein.Methods:A lentiviral vector containing HCV core gene was constructed and transfected into HEK293T cells to package recombinant lentivirus (rLV-core) containing ZsGreen and HCV core genes. The SMMC-7721 cells were infected with the rLV-core. The expression of HCV core mRNA was examined by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR and the HCV core protein was detected by immunofluorescence cytochemistry and Western blotting. The stably transfected cell line was screened.Results:The lentiviral vector was confirmed by enzyme digestion and sequencing. The green fluorescence was seen under fluorescence microscope 48 hours after virus packaging. The SMMC-7721 cell line stably expressing HCV core protein was obtained after infected with the rLV-core. Real-time PCR showed the expression of HCV core mRNA, and both immunofluorescence cytochemistry and Western blotting verified the expression of HCV core protein.Conclusion:The SMMC-7721 human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line stably expressing HCV core protein has been established successfully.
