Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide. Early-stage HCC can be curatively treated, but the recurrence rate remains high. To date, adjuvant treatments have not proven effective in preventing HCC recurrence after curative treatment. Although early studies explored the potential of vitamin K2, retinoid, chemotherapy, and recently, sorafenib, none of the studies reported successful outcomes. Several new lines of evidence have emerged to support the use of novel antiviral agents for preventing the recurrence of virus-related HCC after curative treatment. In this review, the authors provide a thorough overview of the various adjuvant treatments that have been attempted or are being considered for trial.
