A 81-year-old woman confined to full bed rest due to the effects of a stroke 7 years prior, was brought to our hospital with acute cholecystitis in late April 2013. After PTGBD, her condition improved and she was discharged in early June. However, she was urgently hospitalized at the beginning of August with melena and a fever. A detailed examination revealed aspiration pneumonia, which was resolved with a course of antibiotics. A colonoscopy, conducted to find the cause of the melena, revealed a circumferential type 2 tumor in the ascending colon, and a fiberscope was unable to pass through the stenosis. A biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of signet-ring cell carcinoma. Using abdominal computed tomography, thickening of the ascending colon wall, suggesting infiltration to the periphery, was visible. The adjacent lymph nodes were enlarged, but there were no clear signs of liver metastasis. Cancerous peritonitis was suspected due to the presence of ascitic fluid. Considering the overall condition of the patient, surgery was not performed, and colonic stent was not placed due to the proximity of the stenosis to the ileocecal valve. The patient's family chose best supportive care. The patient's condition worsened and she died 3 months after leaving the hospital.
