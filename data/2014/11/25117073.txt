Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the most common cancers worldwide. HSPA2 has been highlighted as an important marker in many types of cancers. However, little is known about the role of HSPA2 in HCC. The objective of the current study was to investigate the expression pattern and clinicopathological significance of HSPA2 in patients with HCC. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase ploymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was applied to examine HSPA2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in 52 pairs of HCC tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to examine HSPA2 protein expression in paraffin-embedded tissues from 119 HCC patients. Statistical analyses were applied to evaluate the diagnostic value and associations of HSPA2 expression with clinicopathological characteristics. We identified abnormally elevated mRNA expression of HSPA2 in HCC tissues compared to paired adjacent noncancerous tissues (P
