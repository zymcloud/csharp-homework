Background & aims:Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is an autosomal recessive enzyme deficiency resulting in lysosomal accumulation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides. LAL-CL04, an ongoing extension study, investigates the long-term effects of sebelipase alfa, a recombinant human lysosomal acid lipase.Methods:Sebelipase alfa (1mg/kg or 3mg/kg) was infused every-other-week to eligible subjects. Safety and tolerability assessments, including liver function, lipid profiles and liver volume assessment, were carried out at regular intervals.Results:216 infusions were administered to eight adult subjects through week 52 during LAL-CL04. At week 52, mean alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were normal with mean change from baseline of -58% and -40%. Mean changes for low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein were -60%, -39%, -36%, and +29%, respectively. Mean liver volume by magnetic resonance imaging and hepatic proton density fat fraction decreased (12% and 55%, respectively). Adverse events were mainly mild and unrelated to sebelipase alfa. Infusion-related reactions were uncommon: three events of moderate severity were reported in two subjects; one patient's event was suggestive of a hypersensitivity-like reaction, but additional testing did not confirm this, and the subject has successfully re-started sebelipase alfa. Of samples tested to date, no anti-drug antibodies have been detected.Conclusions:Long-term dosing with sebelipase alfa in lysosomal acid lipase-deficient patients is well tolerated and produces sustained reductions in transaminases, improvements in serum lipid profile and reduction in the hepatic fat fraction. A randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial in children and adults is underway (ARISE: NCT01757184).
