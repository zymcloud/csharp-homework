Aim:Sorafenib is the standard treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, although there is no proven therapeutic procedure following the termination of sorafenib, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) may be a treatment option in advanced HCC. The aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of HAIC for patients with advanced HCC as subsequent therapy.Methods:We retrospectively evaluated 27 consecutive patients with advanced HCC who were treated with HAIC following sorafenib between June 2009 and December 2012 at our hospital. Cisplatin (20 mg/m(2) per day) was administered via the hepatic artery for 10 min, prior to the continuous administration of 5-fluorouracil (330 mg/m(2) per day) over 24 h from days 1-5 and 8-12 and the s.c. administration of pegylated interferon α-2b (1 μg/kg) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. A treatment cycle consisted of 28 days of drug administration followed by 14 days of rest.Results:The toxicity profile showed that hematological toxicities were common, and grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed (51.9% and 48.1%, respectively). Five patients (18.5%) experienced device-related complications. No unexpected adverse reactions and no treatment-related deaths were observed. Partial response was obtained in eight patients (29.6%), and stable disease was noted in nine patients (33.3%). Median progression-free survival and median survival time from initiation of HAIC were 4.0 and 7.6 months, respectively.Conclusions:Because HAIC was well tolerated and exhibited moderate antitumor activity, it is a potentially useful treatment procedure in patients with advanced HCC even after failure of sorafenib.
