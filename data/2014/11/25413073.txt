Objective:To compare the outcomes of hand-assisted laparoscopic liver surgery (HALS) and pure laparoscopic liver surgery (PLS).Methods:The clinical data were analyzed for 64 patients undergoing major hepatectomy with HALH (23 cases) and PLS (41 cases) between January, 2010 and December, 2012.Results:The general data of the two groups were comparable. Compared with PLS, HALS was associated with a significantly shorter operative time (240 vs 191 min), less intraoperative blood loss (430 vs 220 ml, PConclusion:HALS is safe for major liver resection with such advantages over PLS as causing less trauma and a lower cost.
