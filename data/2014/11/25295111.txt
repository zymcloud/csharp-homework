A GALNT14 single nucleotide polymorphism, rs9679162, has recently been found to be capable of predicting chemotherapy responses in patients with far-advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, a novel assay was designed and genotyping was performed on 244 surgically removed liver tissues. This assay employed two polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-generated restriction enzyme sites to simultaneously determine the genotypes of two adjacent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs9679162 and rs6752303, on the GALNT14 gene. Genotypes determined by this assay reached 100% concordance with those detected by the direct sequencing method. Clinical analysis showed that the TT genotype of rs9679162 was lower in percentage among patients with virus-originated HCC compared with those with non-viral HCC (22.57 vs. 47.06%, respectively; P=0.023). The proportion of the TT genotype in the 244 HCC patients (24.18%) did not deviate significantly from those of two public-domain (HapMap) Chinese cohorts from Denver, Colorado, USA (28.44%) and Beijing, China (30.15%) (P>0.05). The proportion of the TT genotype was significantly higher in Japanese and African populations (42.11-54.55%; P<0.0001) but significantly lower in an Italian cohort (7.84%; P=0.0004). In conclusion, the novel PCR-generated double restriction enzyme sites method could correctly determine the genotypes of two target SNPs in GALNT14 in liver tissues. The TT genotype was associated with the non-viral etiology of HCC. A marked variation in ethnicity was found for the distribution of this genotype.
