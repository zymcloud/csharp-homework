Tanshinone IIA (TSIIA) is an active constituent of the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Salvia miltiorrhiza that is known to have anti-tumor properties. In order to increase the selectivity of TSIIA's anti-tumor activity, the current study evaluated the tumor-targeting efficacy of TSIIA incorporated into nanoparticles (NPs). TSIIA was loaded into mPEG-PLGA-PLL-cRGD (methoxy polyethylene glycol, polylactic-co-glycolic acid, poly-L-lysine, cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) nanoparticles (TNPs) and used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. Our data demonstrate that TNPs were stable and had an even size distribution as well as an extended TSIIA releasing time, and improved tumor-targeting activity. As a novel drug carrier system, TNPs significantly inhibited the development of liver cancer both in vitro and in vivo, proving to be a novel promising targeted treatment for liver cancer.
