Background:There is conflicting evidence concerning platelet status and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis. We evaluated the prognostic value of platelet-based indices, including platelet count, platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) in HCC after hepatic resection.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed 332 patients with HCC treated with hepatectomy between 2006 and 2009. Preoperative platelet count, as well as demographic, clinical, and pathologic data, were analyzed.Results:Both disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly improved for patients with low platelet count, PLR, and APRI compared to patients with elevated values. On multivariate analysis, APRI, tumor size â‰¥5 cm, noncapsulation, and multiple tumors were all associated with both poor DFS and OS. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year DFS rates were 52, 36, and 32 % for patients with APRI Conclusions:Elevated platelets based inflammatory indices, especially APRI, was associated with adverse characteristic features and poor prognosis in HCC, especially for patients with HBV infection or cirrhosis. Antiplatelet treatment may represent a potential therapy for HBV-induced HCC recurrence.
