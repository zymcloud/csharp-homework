Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is an important cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and a common indication of liver transplantation (LT). Recurrence of hepatitis C occurs universally after LT with an accelerated course of the natural history of CHC in the graft. Treatment of hepatitis C before transplantation is the most effective strategy because it prevents graft reinfection, but applicability is low with pegylated interferon regimens. Treatment after LT is the strategy more frequently used. A sustained viral response (SVR) is achieved by one-third of those treated with dual therapy and is associated with better outcomes after LT. Triple therapy with protease inhibitors after LT has efficacy to 60%-70% of SVR but is associated with higher rates of secondary effects and drug-drug interactions that require an intensified and frequent monitoring of calcineurin inhibitors during treatment. In the near future, interferon-free regimens with new oral antiviral drugs will likely prevent viral reinfection before or after LT, and shorter treatment regimens and less toxicity are expected.
