Microcarrier is an essential matrix for the large-scale culture of anchorage-dependent cells. In this study, chemical cross-linked alginate porous microcarriers (AMC) were prepared using microemulsion and freeze-drying technology. Moreover, chitosan was coated on the surface of microcarriers (AMC-CS) via electrostatic interactions to improve the mechanical strength. The size of AMC can be modulated through adjusting the concentration of alginate, amount of dispersant and stirring rate. The surface chemical characteristics and morphology of AMC-CS were evaluated by Fourier transformed infrared, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscope. Fibronectin (Fn) or heparin/basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was then immobilized on the surface of microcarriers via layer-by-layer technology to improve the cytocompatibility. Our data suggested that the size of AMC can be accurately modulated from 90 μm to 900 μm with a narrow size distribution. Micropore structures of AMC-CS were relatively disordered and the pore size ranged between 20 μm and 100 μm. Using AMC after modified with Fn or bFGF as the cell expansion microcarriers, we showed that the proliferation rates of HepG2 cells increased significantly, reaching to more than 30-fold of cell expansion after 10 days of culture, with minor cellular damage caused by the microcarriers. Moreover, the AMC microcarriers modified with Fn or bFGF can increase albumin secretion of HepG2. We suggest that our new modified AMC-based microcarriers will be an attractive candidate for the large-scale cell culture of therapeutic cells.
