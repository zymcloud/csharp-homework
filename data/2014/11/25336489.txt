Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an established nonsurgical curative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Because of its efficiency and safety, sonography is the most commonly used imaging modality when performing RFA. However, the presence of HCC nodules that are inconspicuous when using conventional sonography is a major drawback of RFA and limits its feasibility as a treatment for HCC. However, a new technology has been developed that synthesizes high-resolution multiplanar reconstruction images using 3-dimensional data and is combined with a position-tracking system using magnetic navigation. With this technology, real-time sonograms can be fused with corresponding computed tomographic, magnetic resonance imaging, or even sonographic volume data; this process is known as real-time image fusion. In this article, we describe this novel imaging method as a useful tool for successful RFA treatment of HCC.
