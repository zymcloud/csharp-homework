Purpose:The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and outcomes of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in treating elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:This was a retrospective analysis of 391 patients with HCC fitting the Milan criteria and treated with RFA for the first time from 1999 to 2012 at the Southwest Hospital, China. The patients were divided into two groups, an elderly group (age â‰¥70 years, n = 102) and a non-elderly group (age Results:The overall survival rates of the two groups differed significantly. The recurrence-free survival rates of the two groups did not differ significantly. There was no significant difference between the two groups. Excluding comorbid diseases related deaths, the overall survival rates of the two groups did not differ significantly.Conclusions:The safety and outcomes of RFA in treating early HCC were similar among elderly and non-elderly patients. Co-morbid diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease, rather than HCC or liver diseases, contributed to the relatively low overall survival rate found in elderly patients.
