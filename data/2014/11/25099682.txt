Background:Solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a good candidate for surgical resection. However, the significance of the size of the tumor in solitary HCC remains unclear.Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of tumor size on overall and recurrence-free survival of patients with solitary HCC.Materials:We retrospectively reviewed 616 patients with histologically confirmed solitary HCC who underwent curative surgical resection between 1994 and 2010. The characteristics and prognosis of patients with HCC were analyzed stratified by tumor size.Results:A total of 403 patients (65 %) had tumors 10 cm. The incidence of microvascular invasion, satellite nodules, and advanced tumor grade significantly increased with tumor size. The 5-year overall and recurrence-free survival rates of HCC 10 cm (53 % and 24 %, respectively). On multivariate analysis, cirrhosis (p = 0.0307), Child-Pugh B (p = 0.0159), indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min >10 % (p = 0.0071), microvascular invasion (p 5 cm was not.Conclusion:Although recurrence rates are high, surgical resection for solitary HCC offers good overall survival. Tumor size was not a prognostic factor. Solitary large HCC >10 cm would be a good candidate for hepatectomy as well as solitary HCC between 5 and 10 cm.
