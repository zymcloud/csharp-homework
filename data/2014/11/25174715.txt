The aim of the present study was to investigate the correlations and possible synergy among the urokinase‑type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) isomer D1D2 and integrin α5β1 expression levels, malignant transformation in hepatic cells and the occurrence of liver cancer. The expression site and concentration of uPAR (D1D2) were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization at the gene level in 60 samples of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, 60 samples of para‑carcinoma tissues and 25 samples of normal liver tissues. The mRNA levels of uPAR (D1D2) and integrin α5β1 were markedly increased para‑carcinoma tissue and liver cancer tissue as compared with those in normal tissue. The grey values of the three groups were significantly different (P
