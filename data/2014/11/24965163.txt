Background and objectives:The purpose of this study was to analyze the patterns of recurrence following intraoperative radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined with hepatic resection for patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM).Methods:Patients undergoing liver resection (with or without RFA) for CLM were examined. Rates and patterns of disease recurrence, as well as overall survival were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox analyses.Results:A total of 174 patients underwent liver resection for CLM (150 without and 24 with intraoperative RFA). RFA was used to treat 41 tumors (median 1.6 cm). The 3-year overall survival was 65.5% and 61.4% (adjusted HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.55-1.88). Median recurrence-free survival was 7.4 versus 12.7 months with RFA versus non-RFA, respectively (adjusted HR 1.51, 95% CI 0.94-4.42). On multivariate analysis, neither survival nor recurrence-free survival was significantly associated with RFA. In total, there were two RFA ablation zone local failures. An ablation site recurrence was the sole site in one patient (4.2%).Conclusion:RFA was used as an adjunct to resection in patients with greater disease burden. Despite this, RFA was not significantly associated with a higher risk of local failure and was not associated with worse survival, when compared with liver resection alone.
