Calpain small subunit 1 (Capn4) has been identified as a major gene that promotes metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanism by which Capn4 promotes progression of HCC is not understood. In this study, we found that Capn4 expression was increased in highly metastatic HCC cell lines and in tumour tissue from HCC patients compared to healthy patient tissue. Over-expression of Capn4 in HCC cells enhanced tumour cell growth in vitro and increased invasiveness, tumourigenicity and lung metastasis in vivo. Protein microarray analyses showed that expression of multiple proteins was regulated by Capn4. Interestingly, Capn4 was found to physically associate with FAK and promoted hyperactivity of the FAK-Src signalling pathway via increased phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues of FAK, Src and p130Cas. Knock-down of Capn4 expression suppressed the malignant behaviour of HCC cells and inhibited the FAK-Src signalling pathway. Furthermore, Capn4-mediated invasion and metastasis of HCC cells required up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) through activation of this signalling pathway. Our clinical data revealed that Capn4 expression correlated well with the levels of phospho-FAK, and over-expression of both Capn4 and phospho-FAK correlates with the poorest survival outcomes in HCC. In conclusion, our data showed that Capn4 can contribute to HCC growth and metastasis via activation of the FAK-Src signalling pathway and MMP2.
