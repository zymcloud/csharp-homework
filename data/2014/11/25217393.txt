Purpose:To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and preliminary efficacy of concurrent hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of floxuridine (FUDR) and systemic modified oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (m-FOLFOX6) in Chinese patients with unresectable hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer.Patients and methods:Thirty-five patients with unresectable liver metastases with or without extrahepatic disease were treated with concurrent HAI and systemic m-FOLFOX6. HAI FUDR was delivered in a 14-day infusion with escalating dose levels, and each cycle was repeated every 4 weeks.Results:The MTD for FUDR was 0.12 mg/kg/day when combined with systemic m-FOLFOX6. The dose-limited toxicities were neutropenia (8.6 %), alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase elevation (5.7 %) and diarrhea (11.4 %). The overall response rate was 68.6 % for hepatic metastases and 14.3 % for extrahepatic metastases. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 8.23 and 25 months, respectively.Conclusion:The recommended dose of FUDR was 0.12 mg/kg/day when combined with systemic m-FOLFOX6. This combination achieved a high response rate in hepatic disease and a high control rate in extrahepatic disease. Further study is needed to assess the potential additional value of HAI therapy in converting patients with hepatic metastases to candidates for resection.
