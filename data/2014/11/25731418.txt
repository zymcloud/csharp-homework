We report a case of advanced lung cancer with recurrence of liver and tracheal metastases that were responsive to multimodality therapy. The patient was a 77-year-old man who suffered from advanced lung cancer with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and alcohol-induced liver cirrhosis. The primary lung cancer was surgically resected. Eight months after resection of the primary lung cancer, a solitary liver tumor appeared and hepatic resection was performed. Histological findings showed that both the primary lung tumor and the solitary liver tumor were squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Subsequently, he developed a recurrence in his trachea 8 months after hepatic resection. Radiotherapy, endobronchial argon plasma coagulation (APC), and systemic chemotherapy were administered. The tracheal tumor remained stable without any liver metastasis for 25 months.
