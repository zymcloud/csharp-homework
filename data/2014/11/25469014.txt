Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing in prevalence and is one of the most common cancers in the world. Chief amongst the risks of attaining HCC are hepatitis B and C infection, aflatoxin B1 ingestion, alcoholism and obesity. The later has been shown to promote non alcoholic fatty liver disease, which can lead to the inflammatory form non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is a complex metabolic disorder that can impact greatly on hepatic function. The mechanisms by which NASH promotes HCC are only beginning to be characterized. Here in this review, we give an overview of the recent novel mechanisms published that have been associated with NASH and subsequent HCC progression. We will focus our discussion on inflammation and gut derived inflammation and how they contribute to NASH driven HCC.
