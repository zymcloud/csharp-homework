Aims:Many studies of human subjects have demonstrated the utility of assessing serum levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and big ET-1 as clinical biomarkers in cardiopulmonary and neoplastic diseases. In this study we explored the feasibility of using serum big ET-1 as a reliable veterinary marker in dogs with various cardiopulmonary and neoplastic diseases.Main methods:Serum big ET-1 levels were measured by ELISA in dogs with cardiopulmonary (n=21) and neoplastic diseases (n=57). Dogs exhibiting cardiopulmonary disease were divided into two groups based on the velocity of tricuspid valve regurgitation (3.0>m/s) measured by ultrasound: without and with pulmonary hypertension. Big ET-1 levels for the dogs with the diseases were compared with levels in normal healthy dogs (n=17).Key findings:Dogs with cardiopulmonary disease (4.6Â±4.6 pmol/l) showed a significantly (PSignificance:These findings point to the potential of serum big ET-1 as a clinical marker for cardiopulmonary and neoplastic diseases in dogs.
