Interferon-gamma (Ifnγ), a known immunomodulatory cytokine, regulates cell proliferation and survival. In this study, the mechanisms leading to the selective susceptibility of some tumor cells to Ifnγ were deciphered. Seven different mouse tumor cell lines tested demonstrated upregulation of MHC class I to variable extents with Ifnγ; however, only the cell lines, H6 hepatoma and L929 fibrosarcoma, that produce higher amounts of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are sensitive to Ifnγ-induced cell death. NO inhibitors greatly reduce Ifnγ-induced ROS; however, ROS inhibitors did not affect the levels of Ifnγ-induced NO, demonstrating that NO regulates ROS. Consequently, NO inhibitors are more effective, compared to ROS inhibitors, in reducing Ifnγ-induced cell death. Further analysis revealed that Ifnγ induces peroxynitrite and 3-nitrotyrosine amounts and a peroxynitrite scavenger, FeTPPS, reduces cell death. Ifnγ treatment induces the phosphorylation of c-jun N-terminal kinase (Jnk) in H6 and L929 but not CT26, a colon carcinoma cell line, which is resistant to Ifnγ-mediated death. Jnk activation downstream to NO leads to induction of ROS, peroxynitrite and cell death in response to Ifnγ. Importantly, three cell lines tested, i.e. CT26, EL4 and Neuro2a, that are resistant to cell death with Ifnγ alone become sensitive to the combination of Ifnγ and NO donor or ROS inducer in a peroxynitrite-dependent manner. Overall, this study delineates the key roles of NO as the initiator and Jnk, ROS, and peroxynitrite as the effectors during Ifnγ-mediated cell death. The implications of these findings in the Ifnγ-mediated treatment of malignancies are discussed.
