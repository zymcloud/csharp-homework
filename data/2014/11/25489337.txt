Background:Fibrin sealants are currently used in a variety of surgical and endoscopic settings to improve time to haemostasis, reduce blood loss and complications. However, the application of sealants (composed of two essential components: fibrinogen and thrombin) is not without difficulties. These sealants are normally applied to the resected area using dual-chamber delivery systems. Administration of these substances with different viscosities and diverse flow rates through a long catheter means that a certain amount of force needs to be applied and clot formation and clogging at the distal end of the catheter can occur.Methods:We designed a novel dual-lumen catheter to facilitate the optimal application of fibrin sealant after diagnostic and therapeutic percutaneous procedures and assessed the efficacy and tolerability of this dual-lumen kit when used in a model of hepatic fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in an in vivo, preclinical porcine study.Results:The experimental was performed on nine pigs (mean body weight 85 Â± 7 kg) and with the exception of one pig, all animals survived in good conditions until the day of hepatectomy and euthanasia. The premature death of this animal was in the veterinarian's judgment caused by a common, non-infective disease. In all nine pigs, bleeding was stopped within 3 minutes of the application of the fibrin sealant and no cases of recurrent bleeding occurred.Conclusions:The new dual aspect catheter increased ease of delivery of the sealant and FNA liver biopsy and RFA procedures were successfully and safely performed.
