Background:There is debate over whether T1b gallbladder cancer (GBC) should be treated by simple cholecystectomy (SC) or by extended cholecystectomy (EC). The aim of this study is to compare and analyze the results of these two procedures.Patients and methods:The archived medical records of 805 patients with GBC who had undergone surgical resection in Asan Medical Center, or were referred from other hospitals after undergoing surgery, between 1997 and 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Of these, 85 patients were diagnosed with pathologic stage T1b (muscular layer) GBC. By using propensity scoring, the EC group and the SC group were matched in the proportion of 1:2; so, 54 patients were enrolled in this study.Results:Among the 54 pathologic stage T1b cancer patients, SC was performed in 36 (66.7 %) and EC in 18 (33.4 %). The mean operation time and hospital stay after surgery of the SC group was significantly shorter than in the EC group (83.2 vs. 356.4 min, 7.8 vs. 15.2 days; both p = 0.000). Disease recurrence was noted in four cases (11.1 %), all in the SC group; 50 % of recurred patients experienced recurrence at the lymph node. There was no significant intergroup difference in the 5-year survival rate (5-YSR) (88.8 % for SC vs. 93.3 % for EC, p = 0.521).Conclusions:In this study, for stage T1b GBC, both EC and SC offered similar cure rates. However, recurrence is associated with SC and inadequate lymph node dissection (LND). Therefore, EC including regional LND may be justified and preferred because of the possibility of lymph node metastasis and the accurate assessment of stage (LN status), except that the patients have a high risk of operation.
