Introduction:Liver transplantation (LT) is a treatment option in select patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the present study was to compare survival in Stage I or II HCC patients undergoing either liver transplant (LT) or a liver resection (LR).Method:The study is a retrospective analysis of the National Cancer Data Base (1998-2011). In total, 148,882 patients with liver cancer were identified, of which 5-year survival data (1998-2006) were available for 64,227 patients. Patients were stratified by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) clinical stage I and II. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used for statistical analysis.Results:3340 HCC patients met analysis criteria. Among stage I HCC, 860 had LT and 871 had LR. Among stage II HCC, 833 had LT and 776 LR. In stage I patients the median survival for LT and LR were 127.9 and 56.7 months, respectively, (P Conclusion:Liver transplantation offers a survival advantage compared with a liver resection among patients with Stage I and II HCC. LT is the best surgical treatment for early stage (I/II) HCC in patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, whereas LR provides equivalent outcomes to LT in patients without advanced fibrosis and should be considered as the first surgical option.
