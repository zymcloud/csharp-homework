Purpose:To evaluate the feasibility of transarterial therapy (transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and transcatheter arterial infusion) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic kidney disease (CKD).Materials and methods:The study enrolled 35 patients who received transarterial therapy. The patients were classified into a CKD group (n = 10 nondialysis chronic kidney disease [NDCKD] and n = 9 end-stage renal disease [ESRD]) or a non-CKD group (n = 16). The survival rates between the two groups were compared using two different starting points: (a) from initial diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and (b) from enrollment in the study. The tolerance of transarterial therapy in patients with CKD was evaluated by comparing the incidence of major adverse events.Results:The 2-year and 5-year survival rates from initial diagnosis were 83.9% and 53.8% in the CKD group and 70.1% and 40.4% in the non-CKD group (P = .478). The corresponding 3-year survival rate from enrollment in the two groups was 25.6% and 41.2%, respectively (P = .995). The 2-year and 5-year survival rates from initial diagnosis were 70.1% and 40.4% in the non-CKD group, 90.0% and 39.4% in NDCKD patients, and 76.2% and 76.2% in ESRD patients (P = .380). The corresponding 2-year survival rates from enrollment in these groups were 54.9%, 48.0%, and 48.6% (P = .943). Severe contrast-induced nephropathy (n = 3) and late-onset death caused by cholesterol crystal embolism (n = 1) were observed in the NDCKD group.Conclusions:Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization is feasible in patients with CKD by instituting periprocedural hemodialysis with similar 2-year and 5-year survival compared with patients without CKD.
