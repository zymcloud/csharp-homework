Objective:To explore the effect of lentivirus-mediated shRNA interference of Cx26 on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion of highly invasive human hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro.Methods:SK-Hep-1 cells were infected with the lentivirus for delivering Cx26 shRNA, and the stably transfected cells were selected by puromycin. The interference efficiency of shRNA-Cx26 was assessed with real-time PCR and Western blotting. The morphological changes of the transfected SK-Hep-1 cells were observed microscopically, and the protein expressions of E-cadherin and vimentin were detected using Western blotting. The effect of Cx26 interference on the invasiveness of SK-Hep-1 cells was determined by Transwell invasion assay.Results:Compared with SK-Hep-1 cells infected with empty EGFP vector and uninfected cells, the cells transfected with shRNA-Cx26 showed significantly reduced mRNA and protein expressions of Cx26 (PConclusion:Targeted down-regulation of Cx26 expression can inhibit the EMT and invasion of SK-Hep-1 cells in vitro.
