Ectopic liver tissue (ELT) is a rare condition, which is usually not diagnosed preoperatively, but coincidentally during abdominal surgery. While the location of ELT can vary, it is usually localized on the gallbladder wall or in close proximity. ELT is associated with various complications, a major complication being extrahepatic hepatocellular carcinoma. A 59-year-old female underwent elective surgery for chronic cholecystitis with stones. During laparoscopic exploration, a 2-cm-diameter ELT was detected in the anterior gallbladder wall and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. The case is presented due to the rare nature of ELT and as a reminder of ELT-related complications.
