A 60-year-old male was referred to Nanjing Drum-Tower Hospital (Nanjing, Jiangsu, China) due to the presence of gastric carcinoma. A biopsy was performed under an electronic gastroscope and the pathological analysis resulted in the diagnosis of gastric small cell carcinoma (GSCC). The mass had invaded the liver and the pancreas according to an enhanced computed tomography scan, thus current surgical methods were considered to be of high risk and highly challenging. Following four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with irinotecan (200 mg, days 1, 21, 41 and 61) and oxaliplatin (120 mg, days, 1, 21, 41 and 61) the patient underwent a D2 gastrectomy and an esophagojejunal Roux-en-Y anastomosis, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The patient experienced survival without progression in the 8-month follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of few cases of GSCC treated with the combination of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy.
