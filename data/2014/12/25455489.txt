Bioactivity-guided study led to the isolation of a natural phenylpropionate derivative, (E)-3-(4-hydroxy-2-methoxyphenyl)-propenoic acid 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl ester from the roots of Mirabilis himalaica. Cellular analysis showed that compound 1 specifically inhibited the cancer cell growth through the S phase arrest. Mechanistically, compound 1 was able to induce the apoptosis in HepG2 cells through mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in which Bcl-2 and p53 were required. Interestingly, the cellular phenotype of compound 1 were shown specifically in cancer cells originated from hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) while compromised influence by compound 1 were detected within the normal human liver cells (L-02). Consistently, the in vivo inhibitory effects of compound 1 on tumor growth were validated by the in xenograft administrated with HepG2 cells. Our results provided a novel compound which might serve as a promising candidate and shed light on the therapy of the hepatocellular carcinoma.
