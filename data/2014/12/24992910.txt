Background:Long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) methylation status, representing global DNA methylation levels, is associated with patient prognosis in several types of cancer. This study was designed to examine the prognostic significance of LINE-1 methylation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the possible mechanisms related to oncogene activation.Methods:Seventy-five HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy between 2006 and 2012 were enrolled in this study. Quantitative pyrosequencing was performed to quantify the methylation level of three CpG sites in the LINE-1 promoter. Clinicopathological variables and prognosis were compared between LINE-1 hypo- and hypermethylation groups. LINE-1-inserted c-MET (L1-MET) gene expression and its correlation with LINE-1 methylation levels also were analyzed.Results:LINE-1 was significantly hypomethylated in tumor tissues compared with nontumor tissues (48.3 ± 12.2 % vs. 68.2 ± 2.0 %, respectively, p Conclusions:LINE-1 hypomethylation is significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with HCC, possibly due to activation of c-MET expression.
