Background:Diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging is commonly used to distinguish between benign and malignant liver lesions.Purpose:To prospectively evaluate the true molecular-diffusion coefficient (D), perfusion-related diffusion coefficient (D*), perfusion fraction (f), and ADC of focal hepatic lesions using a free-breathing intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) DW sequence, and to determine if these parameters are useful for characterizing focal hepatic lesions.Material and methods:One hundred and twenty hepatic lesions (34 metastases, 32 hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], 33 hemangiomas, and 21 liver cysts) in 74 patients were examined. Mean D, D*, f, and ADC values of hepatic lesions were compared among pathologies. ROC curve analyses were performed to assess the performances of D, D*, f, and ADC values for the characterization of liver lesions as benign or malignant.Results:The mean D and ADC values of benign lesions were greater than those of malignant lesions (P Conclusion:D and ADC values have more potential for characterizing focal hepatic lesions than D* or f values, and for the differentiation of malignancy and benignity.
