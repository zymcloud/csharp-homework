Hepatitis C virus infection is one of the most common and chronic in the world, and hepatitis associated with HCV infection is a major risk factor for the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The rapidly growing number of viral-host and host protein-protein interactions is enabling more and more reliable network-based analyses of viral infection supported by omics data. The study of molecular interaction networks helps to elucidate the mechanistic pathways linking HCV molecular activities and the host response that modulates the stepwise hepatocarcinogenic process from preneoplastic lesions (cirrhosis and dysplasia) to HCC. Simulating the impact of HCV-host molecular interactions throughout the host protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, we ranked the host proteins in relation to their network proximity to viral targets. We observed that the set of proteins in the neighborhood of HCV targets in the host interactome is enriched in key players of the host response to HCV infection. In opposition to HCV targets, subnetworks of proteins in network proximity to HCV targets are significantly enriched in proteins reported as differentially expressed in preneoplastic and neoplastic liver samples by two independent studies. Using multi-objective optimization, we extracted subnetworks that are simultaneously "guilt-by-association" with HCV proteins and enriched in proteins differentially expressed. These subnetworks contain established, recently proposed and novel candidate proteins for the regulation of the mechanisms of liver cells response to chronic HCV infection.
