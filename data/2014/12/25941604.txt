Immunotherapy is a promising treatment option for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Indeed, CD8+ T-cell responses against various tumor antigens occur in these patients. However, these antitumoral T cells show a severely impaired effector function. Several immunosuppressive mechanisms contribute to this T-cell failure, including regulatory T cells and inhibitory receptors.
