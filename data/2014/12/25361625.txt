Background:Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been used to curtail tumor vasculature and delay tumor progression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We conducted a phase I trial to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of thalidomide when combined with TACE in patients with advanced HCC.Methods:Between June 2000 and November 2003, 56 patients with unresectable HCC and amenable to TACE were enrolled. The starting dose of thalidomide was 200 mg/day and was escalated every 2 weeks as tolerated to a maximum dose of 1,000 mg/day. Dose reductions and discontinuation were determined by toxicity. TACE was performed 4 weeks after initiation of thalidomide therapy and repeated as necessary.Results:Overall, 47 and 55 patients were evaluable for response and toxicity, respectively; the median dose of thalidomide given was 200 mg/day. Three patients (6.38%) patients achieved complete responses, whereas 10 (21.3%) had partial responses, for an overall response rate of 27.7%, and 27 (57.5%) had stable disease. Median progression-free survival was 7 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5-10 months), and median OS was 21 months (95% CI: 16-28 months) (Fig. 1). Fatigue and lethargy (49.1%), constipation (47.3%), and nausea (43.6%) were common. Grade 3-4 toxicities consisted mostly of increased aspartate aminotransferase (43.6%) and elevated alanine aminotransferase (38.2%) (Table 1).Conclusion:Thalidomide and TACE were commonly associated with nonhematologic side effects, with fatigue and constipation being prominent. With a lack of clear therapeutic benefit, this combination is unlikely to be pursued for HCC.
