Objective:To evaluate the value of MR diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) histogram analysis for predicting tumor progression in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Methods:In a retrospective study, both 35 stable patients and 38 progressive patients with biopsy-proven HCC underwent breath-hold DWI before RFA treatment. The pre-treatment apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were averaged from the lowest to 10th, 30th, 50th, and 100th percentile using DWI histogram analysis software respectively, and were called ADC10, ADC30, ADC50 and ADC100. The ratios of ADC10, ADC30, ADC50 and ADC100 to mean ADC of non-lesional area were calculated, called RADC10, RADC30, RADC50 and RADC100, respectively.Results:Before RFA treatment, the ADC30, ADC50, ADC100, RADC30, RADC50 and RADC100 values of the tumors in the progression group were significantly higher than those of the stable group (P Conclusions:Pre-RFA DWI histogram analysis may serve as a biomarker for predicting tumor progression in patients with HCC treated with RFA.
