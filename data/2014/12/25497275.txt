The Editor and Publisher of "Clinics and Research in Hepatology and Gastroenterology" have decided to withdraw this article because they consider that it has been accepted based upon the positive advice of at least one faked reviewer report. This manipulation of the peer-review process represents a clear violation of the fundamentals of peer review, our publishing policies, and publishing ethics standards.
