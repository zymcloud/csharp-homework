Introduction:Cervical node metastasis of malignant ameloblastoma is extremely rare. Because of its rarity, there is no standard treatment modality in a single lymph node metastasis in malignant ameloblastoma.Materials and methods:Eleven patients of malignant ameloblastoma involving a single cervical lymph node metastasis and one new case were reviewed. Neck treatment was classified into neck dissection and simple excision. Local nodal recurrence, distant metastasis and follow-up periods were investigated.Results:Eight patients were treated with neck dissection (group A) and four patients underwent a simple node excision (group B). Two patients in group A experienced multiple organ metastases such as liver and lung seven months and 13 years after neck dissection respectively. The other patients showed no recurrence and metastasis. In group B, there was no report of a regional neck recurrence and distant metastasis during follow-up of 1-7 years.Conclusion:Multiple nodes metastasis requires a radical neck dissection; however, simple excision with close follow-up may be used in a single node metastasis in malignant ameloblastoma.
