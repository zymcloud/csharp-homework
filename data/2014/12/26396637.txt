Peliosis hepatis (PH) is a rare benign disease that is characterized by multiple blood-filled cystic spaces in the hepatic parenchyma. It is also characterized by a range of radiologic findings that might mimic various diseases, including metastatic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. The findings of PH on (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) are not well reported. We here report two cases of biopsy-proven PH. Both patients had been treated for cancer (advanced gastric carcinoma and rectal adenocarcinoma), and follow-up CT of both cases revealed hepatic lesions with the possibility of metastasis. Examination of (18)F-FDG PET/CT images suggested that the lesions were isometabolic, having metabolism similar to that of adjacent hepatic parenchyma. The outcomes of hepatic core-needle biopsies were consistent with peliosis hepatis.
