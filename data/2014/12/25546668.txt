We aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of hepatic resection and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) less than 5 cm in diameter. A total of 289 patients were diagnosed with a small HCC (a single tumor no larger than 5 cm). Among these patients, 133 underwent hepatic resection, and 156 received RFA. Demographic data, intraoperative data, post-operative recovery data, and the baseline characteristics of the 2 groups of patients were compared. The incidence of post-operative complications; 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates; and tumor recurrence were determined. No statistically significant differences in the baseline characteristics were noted between the 2 groups. By contrast, operation time (P = 0.003), intraoperative blood loss (P = 0.000), and the length of post-operative hospital stay (P = 0.000) were significantly lower in the RFA group compared with the surgical resection group. The 2 groups displayed similar post-operative complication rates (12% or 16/133 in the liver resection group vs. 8.3% or 13/156 in the RFA group, P = 0.395). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates of the patients in the liver resection group were 88.7%, 78.2%, and 66.2%, respectively, whereas the rates in the RFA group were 90.4%, 76.3%, and 66.0%, respectively (P = 0.722). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year tumor-free survival rates of patients in the resection group were 87.2%, 69.9%, and 58.6%, respectively, whereas the rates in the RFA group were 85.9%, 66.0%, and 54.5%, respectively (P = 0.327). In addition, among HCC patients receiving RFA, patients with tumors no greater than 3 cm in diameter exhibited no significant differences regarding overall survival and tumor-free survival rates compared with patients with tumors 3 to 5 cm in diameter (all P > 0.05). RFA is an effective and safe treatment option for small HCCs and may be a preferred choice for HCC patients with small lesions.
