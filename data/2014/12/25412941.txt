Data concerning the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an HBV-free population are currently limited. Therefore, we performed a case-control study to investigate the association between SNPs and the risk of HCC in individuals without chronic HBV infection. A total of 160 Han Chinese patients with HCC and an identical number of healthy controls were enrolled in this study. rs1042522, rs10814325, rs17401966, and rs2279744 genotypes were determined using matrix-associated laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). CG and GG genotypes in rs1042522 and heterozygote and homozygote in rs2279744 were significantly associated with an elevated risk of HCC. Homozygous mutation of rs1081432 conferred a 2.68-fold risk of HCC (95% CI 1.35-5.34); however heterozygosity was not statistically significant. rs17401966 heterozygosity or homozygosity was not significantly associated with a increased risk of HCC. Several polymorphisms associated with a significantly increased risk of HCC were identified. These may serve as biomarkers in evaluating HCC risk in the general population.
