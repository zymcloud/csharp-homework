Purpose:It is important to minimize surgical invasiveness in the therapy of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and consequently laparoscopic hepatic resection is widely performed. However, most anatomical resections, except left lateral sectionectomy, remain difficult technically, and laparoscopy-assisted procedures have been introduced as an alternative approach because of the safety and curative success of the operation. We reported previously pure laparoscopic subsegmentectomy of the liver using puncture of the portal branch under percutaneous ultrasound (US) with artificial ascites. Herein, we describe pure anatomical laparoscopic segmentectomy using the puncture method with indocyanine green (ICG) injection under laparoscopic US.Patients and methods:Pure laparoscopic segmentectomy was planned for 2 patients with HCC of the liver. Identification of the segment was performed by ICG injection for optical imaging using near-infrared fluorescence under laparoscopic US guidance.Results:The procedures were completed successfully, and the postoperative courses were uneventful.Conclusions:Pure laparoscopic segmentectomy for HCC with a conventional puncture technique by ICG injection under laparoscopic US is considered to be a useful procedure featuring both low invasiveness and curative success.
