The role of prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2) in carcinogenesis has been studied in a variety of cancer types. However, the association between PHD2 and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been documented. A total of 220 patients with primary HCC who underwent a curative liver resection were enrolled in this study. The tumor samples were obtained during the surgical procedure from each patient for PHD2 immunohistological staining. All the patients were followed up and the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. We found that that high PHD2 expression was significantly associated with higher stage (stages III + IV) (odds ratio [OR] = 5.576, P 5 cm) (OR = 6.176, P
