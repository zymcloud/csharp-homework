Aims:Our recent proteomic study identified tubulin Î²-III (TUBB3) as a potential tissue marker for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (CCs). This validation study was conducted to see whether or not TUBB3 can serve as a novel immunohistochemical marker for peripheral CCs, using a large cohort (n = 197) covering various liver tumours and premalignant conditions.Methods and results:Immunostaining using a monoclonal antibody demonstrated TUBB3 expression in 14/28 cases of peripheral CCs (50%), while its expression was significantly less common in perihilar CCs (6/40, 15%) (P = 0.002). No significant difference was identified in clinicopathological features between TUBB3-positive and -negative cases. TUBB3 expression was entirely negative in hepatocellular carcinomas, biliary premalignant lesions (i.e., biliary intraepithelial neoplasias, intraductal papillary neoplasms), peribiliary gland hamartomas (bile duct adenomas), and non-neoplastic biliary epithelium. TUBB3 expression was only focally noted in 2/12 cases of mixed hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinomas (Conclusions:This study revealed that TUBB3 is a moderately sensitive and highly specific tissue marker for discriminating peripheral CCs from other primary liver tumours.
