Hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach (HAS) is a rare distinct variant of gastric carcinoma with earlier metastases and worse prognosis compared to the more common intestinal types. It is often misdiagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma, especially when primary HAS is insignificantly anatomically abnormal, produces high alpha-fetoprotein and develops early liver metastasis. In this case we show the significance of dual-time-point (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in accurately diagnosing and staging HAS.
