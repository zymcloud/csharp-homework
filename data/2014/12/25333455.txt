Homo sapiens longevity assurance homolog 2 of yeast LAG (Lass2) catalyzes the synthesis of long-chain ceramide which is an essential element of membranous structures. Deletion of Lass2 is associated with a high risk of spontaneous or DEN-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet the mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we found extensive vesicles in hepatocytes of one-month-old Lass2-knockout (KO) mice. Hepatic biochemical indices were increased and expression of albumin was attenuated in the one‑month Lass2-KO liver. The results indicate that the injuries of the hepatocytes in young Lass2-KO mice, based on the results of Gene Ontology analysis of mRNA microarray of Lass2-KO liver vs. wild-type liver showed 'wounding response' was the mostly possible altered pathway in the Lass2-KO mice. miR-mRNA integrated analysis revealed that miR-694 was downregulated while its target gene tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 3 (Tnfaip3) was upregulated, as confirmed by qPCR. The expression of NF-κB which is negatively controlled by Tnfaip3 was detected by qPCR and was found to be downregulated. Herein, we first report that Lass2 deficiency caused the downregulation of miR-694 and the upregulation of its target gene Tnfaip3 in vivo in mice, which may be related to a high risk of occurrence of HCC.
