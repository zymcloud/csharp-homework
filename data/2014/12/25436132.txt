Sorafenib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that acts on many targets including RAF kinases, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 1, 2, 3, platelet derived growth factor and c-kit receptor and is currently FDA approved for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Trebananib (AMG 386) is an angiopoietin 1/2 antagonist and acts as anti-angiogenic agent and may possess synergistic effects with sorafenib. Here we report a case of a 66-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C, and a 22 pack year (PY) smoking history with unresectable multifocal HCC who was placed on both therapies for an extended period of time with an excellent clinical response but ended up developing bilateral critical limb ischemia requiring above knee amputations.
