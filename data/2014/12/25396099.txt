Chronic liver disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Current strategies for assessing prognosis and treatment rely on accurate assessment of disease stage. Liver biopsy is the gold standard for assessing fibrosis stage but has many limitations. Noninvasive biomarkers of liver fibrosis have been extensively designed, studied, and validated in a variety of liver diseases. With the advent of direct acting antivirals and the rise in obesity-related liver disease, there is a growing need to establish these noninvasive methods in the clinic. In addition, it has become increasingly clear over the last few years that noninvasive biomarkers can also be used to monitor response to antifibrotic therapies and predict liver outcomes, including hepatocellular carcinoma development. This review highlights the most well-established noninvasive biomarkers to-date, with a particular emphasis on serum and imaging-based methodologies.
