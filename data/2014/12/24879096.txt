Diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) has been known for its efficacy to eradicate bancroftian filariasis in Egypt and other countries in the world. One of the known effects was to decrease the level of circulating filarial antigen in the patient's serum. The target of this study was to examine the effect of DEC, excretory-secretory (ES) material from the filarial parasite Setaria equina or a combination of both on the status of oxidative stress and pathogenesis of rat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) induced by diethylnitrosamine and 2-acetylaminofluorene. This could be tested in vitro using nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test for measuring the level of superoxide anion (O₂(•-)) released from rat peritoneal macrophages. For in vivo test, a single dose before induction of carcinogenesis or continually repeated doses with DEC, ES or DEC + ES was used. Exposure of macrophages to ES could lead to a significant decrease (p
