Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) in the biliary system is a poorly differentiated, high-grade neuroendocrine tumor. These tumors exhibit aggressive behavior and an increased tendency for early nodal and distant metastases. Herein, we report an unusual case of a pure primary LCNEC of the common bile duct (CBD). A 75-year-old female presented with nausea and jaundice. The patient underwent a CBD excision with lymph node dissection. Upon histological and immunohistochemical examination, the tumor exhibited pure large cell-type neuroendocrine features. Metastases were noted in two of the eight lymph nodes. The patient was administered adjuvant chemotherapy. The patient's cancer recurred 7 mo after surgery, and the patient died from liver failure 5 mo after recurrence. The prognosis of LCNEC of CBD remains poor despite curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. The role of additional therapies, such as multimodal treatment including radiation therapy, must be further studied to improve the prognoses of patients.
