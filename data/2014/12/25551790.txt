Background:Variations at DEPDC5 gene have been recently reported as genetic markers associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression in chronic HCV-infected patients. This study was conducted to assess the association of DEPDC5 variants with advanced liver cirrhosis and HCC development among chronic HCV-infected patients in Saudi Arabian population.Methods:Six-hundred and one HCV-infected patients were genotyped for DEPDC5 polymorphisms (rs1012068 and rs5998152), in comparison with 592 non-infected healthy control subjects. The allelic frequency and genotype distribution of both DEPDC5 polymorphisms were determined followed by haplotype frequency estimation and multiple logistic regression analysis.Results:The frequency of the risk alleles of both rs1012068 and rs5998152 was shown to be more in healthy control subjects than in patients (p = 0.0001, OR = 0.704, CI = 0.591-0.839; p = 0.002, OR = 0.761, CI = 0. 0.639-0.907, respectively). Also, our results revealed that GT for SNP rs1012068 (OR =1.715; 95% CI 1.132-2.597; p = 0.0104) and CT for SNP rs5998152 (OR = 1.932; 95% CI 1.276-2.925; p = 0.0017) showed significant association with development of cirrhosis compared with the GG and CC genotypes, respectively. The data also revealed that subjects with the T allele of both SNPs appeared to have a lower susceptibility to HCV-related cirrhosis/HCC than those with the G allele of rs1012068 (p = 0.038, OR = 1.353, 95 % CI 1.017-1.800) and C allele of rs5998152 (p = 0.043, OR = 1.342, 95 % CI 1.010-1.784). Haplotype analysis showed that a combination of T-T alleles of rs1012068 and rs5998152 was significantly associated with liver cirrhosis (frequency = 71.3% and p = 0.027) and with cirrhosis/HCC (frequency = 71.4% and P = 0.045). Also, multiple logistic regression analysis showed that rs5998152 (OR = 2.844, 95% CI 1.333-6.069 and p = 0.007), rs1012068 (OR = 2.793, 95% CI 1.316-5.928 and p = 0.010), age (OR = 1.029, 95% CI 1.001-1.057 and p = 0.041) and HCV genotypes (OR = 0.247, 95% CI 0.097-0.630 and p = 0.003) were independently associated with chronicity of HCV infection.Conclusion:Genetic variations in DEPDC5 gene region may influence HCV-associated liver cirrhosis and/or HCC development.
