Objective:To evaluate the clinical feasibility and safety of a new technique for liver resection using a new saline-coupled bipolar sealing device (Aquamantys®) that has shown high performance in the animal setting.Patients and methods:Twelve Child-Pugh A cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma underwent partial hepatectomies using Aquamantys®. Our primary end-point was to observe occurrence of early specific surgical complications as bleeding, biliary leakage and abscess development. Our secondary end-point was to evaluate local recurrence along resection margin after a minimum follow-up of 1 year.Results:One bisegmentectomy, five monosegmentectomies and six atypical resections were performed. Mean resection time was 45 minutes (range, 30-100 min). Mean blood loss was 20 mL (range 5-80 mL). Mean post-operative stay was 6 days (range 5-16 days). All specimens presented negative margins (R0) at pathological examination. No blood transfusion were required both intra-operatively and post-operatively. No mortality was observed within 30-days post-operatively. One fluid collection occurred after 6-7 bisegmentectomy and was successfully treated by ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage. At 1 year follow-up two patients died: one because of new lesions into the liver and one because of distant metastases and multifocal new liver disease. Ten patient are alive disease free at 1 year follow-up.Conclusions:Liver resection using Aquamantys® is feasible and safe and allows to achieve almost bloodless parenchymal division with minimal necrosis and negative margins even in atipycal resection. Comparative trials are needed to confirm our preliminary results.
