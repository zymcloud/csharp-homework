Accessory liver lobes are a rare condition and appear to be due to excessive development of the liver. The presence of an accessory hepatic lobe is often diagnosed incidentally and sometimes revealed if it develops torsion, especially in pedunculated forms. In most cases, the accessory lobe is located below the liver, i.e., infrahepatic. Riedel's lobe is the best-known example of an accessory lobe, corresponding to hypertrophy of segments V and VI. While accessories lobes can simulate tumors, there have also been reports of hepatocellular tumor(s) that developed in these accessory lobes. Based on a review of the literature, this update focuses on accessory hepatic lobes.
