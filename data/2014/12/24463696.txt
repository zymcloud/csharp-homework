Background:Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) may worsen the clinical course of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The aim of this study was to investigate whether HTLV-1 coinfection influences the clinical characteristics of patients with HCV infection.Methods:This retrospective study included 523 consecutive patients from January 2001 to December 2010 with chronic liver disease due to HCV infection, in whom serum anti-HTLV-1 antibodies were examined. Among these patients, 265 were diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Results:The seroprevalence of anti-HTLV-1 antibodies was significantly higher in patients with HCC (21.1%) than those without HCC (10.5%, P = 0.001). This significant difference was observed in female patients (29.5 vs. 8.5%, P Conclusions:HTLV-1 coinfection may contribute to the development of HCC in patients with chronic HCV infection, especially in females.
