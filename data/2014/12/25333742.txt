Jiedu Xiaozheng Yin (JXY) is a Chinese herbal decoction used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previous studies have demonstrated that JXY can inhibit HCC cell proliferation via induction of G0/G1 phase arrest. In this study, we investigated whether the inhibitory effect of JXY on HCC cells is associated with the inhibition of the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway and the polycomb gene product Bmi1. Ethyl acetate extract from JXY (EE-JXY) was prepared. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) and colony formation assays were used to measure cell proliferation. Immunofluorescence was used to analyze the expression and location of β-catenin and Bmi1. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), c-myc and cyclin D1. β-catenin, Bmi1, c-myc, cyclin D1 and p16INK4A mRNA levels were detected by RT-PCR. The results demonstrated that EE-JXY inhibited the expression of PCNA, c-myc, cyclin D1 and Bmi1, and upregulated the expression of p16INK4A. We also found that EE-JXY could facilitate β-catenin translocation from the cytoplasm and nuclei to the cytomembrane. Finally, suppression of cell proliferation and expression of Bmi1 and Wnt/β-catenin by EE-JXY was confirmed in a mouse xenograft model of HCC. Thus, EE-JXY can inhibit the proliferation of HCC partially via suppression of the Bmi1 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways.
