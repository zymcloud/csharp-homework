Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most important health problems in China.Objectives:This study analyzed expression of high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) and inhibitor of apoptosis protein-2 (c-IAP2) proteins in HCC compared to paired para-tumor tissue samples to assess the association with HCC pathogenesis and progression.Materials and methods:Sixty-eight HCC and para-tumor tissue samples were collected for Western blot, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses of HMGB1 and c-IAP2.Results:HMGB1 and c-IAP2 proteins were highly expressed in HCC tissue samples [85.3% (58/68) and 82.4% (56/68), respectively] compared to para-tumor tissue samples [32.3% and 27.9%, respectively]. Furthermore, expression of HMGB1 was significantly associated with enhanced c-IAP2 expression in HCC tissue samples (r = 0.878, P Conclusions:Expression of HMGB1 and c-IAP2 proteins was associated with HCC development and progression, and the expression of HMGB1 and c-IAP2 proteins in HCC were significantly associated with each other. Additionally, these proteins may show promise as biomarkers to predict HCC progression.
