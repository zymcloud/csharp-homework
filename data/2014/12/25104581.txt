Background:Evidence continues to accumulate regarding the association between health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and survival across chronic diseases. The objectives of the current study were to investigate the prognostic value of HRQoL in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma after adjusting for sociodemographics, disease-related factors, and treatment-related factors.Methods:A total of 321 patients diagnosed with hepatocellular or cholangiocarcinoma were administered the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary instrument. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed to test the association between the 5 domains of HRQoL and survival.Results:Using Cox regression, overall HRQoL was found to be significantly associated with survival (P = .003) after adjusting for demographics, disease-specific factors, and treatment. Subscales of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary, including the Physical Well-Being (P = .02) and the Symptoms and Side Effects subscales (P = .05), were also found to be significantly associated with survival after adjusting for demographics, disease-specific factors, and treatment.Conclusions:HRQoL was found to be prognostic of survival in patients with hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma while covarying for demographics, disease-specific factors, and treatment. Stratifying patients based on HRQoL when testing novel treatments may be recommended. Health-related quality of life was found to be prognostic of survival in patients with hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma while controlling for demographics, disease-specific factors, and treatment-related factors.
