Aim:The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical outcome and identify prognostic factors following treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and extrahepatic metastasis with sorafenib.Methods:Sixty-one HCC patients with extrahepatic metastasis who were treated with sorafenib were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study.Results:The median survival time (MST) of all patients was 11 months. The median time to radiological progression was 4.2 months. The response rates (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and modified RECIST were 3.0% and 8.0%, respectively, while the disease control rates (CR + PR + stable disease) were 49% and 49%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified T factor (intrahepatic tumor stage, T 0-2), response to disease control and des-Î³-carboxy prothrombin (Conclusion:In HCC patients with extrahepatic metastasis who are treated with sorafenib, intrahepatic tumor stage was a significant and independent prognostic factor.
