We report a 57-year-old male who was treated with high-dose danazol for hereditary angioedema for more than 30 years; he developed hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of cirrhosis. Despite surgical resection, he had a recurrence and received sorafenib, but had a poor skin tolerance. Such tumors arising after danazol are infrequent, and this case is highly unique due to the minor lesions found on the liver.
