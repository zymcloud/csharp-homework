Aim:This retrospective study aimed to compare the efficacy of and tolerance to two center-related conventional transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) strategies in the management of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:All HCC patients in whom TACE was initiated in the two centers from June 2008 to July 2011 were included. The TACE strategy performed in center 1 was "on demand" with selective injections of idarubicin, whereas the TACE strategy in center 2 was based "on scheduled" non-selective injections of epirubicin. Toxicity was evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0.Results:One hundred and fifty HCC patients were included. Median time to treatment failure was significantly higher in center 1, 13.1 months vs. 7.9 months in center 2 (hazard ratio, 2.32; pConclusion:Our results failed to show any significant survival differences between two center-related TACE strategies but showed a significantly smaller proportion of grade â‰¥ 3 adverse events and shorter hospitalisation for the overall treatment when the "on-demand" strategy was used.
