Objective:This meta-analysis evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of positive serum Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) for diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Material and methods:Articles listed on Embase, PubMed, Wanfang, Weipu Periodical Database or the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and published up to July 10, 2013, were searched in either English or Chinese. The pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive and negative likelihood ratios (PLR and NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curve were calculated to summarize the overall test performance.Results:Four articles (6 studies) provided DKK1 diagnostic data. The pooled SEN, SPE, PLR, NLR, DOR and area under the sROC curve of DKK1 for the diagnosis of HCC were 0.65 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.52-0.76), 0.94 (95% CI, 0.82-0.98), 10.1 (95% CI, 3.68-27.74), 0.38 (95% CI, 0.28-0.51), 26.90 (95% CI, 10.45-69.19) and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.81-0.87), respectively. Three articles (5 studies) provided DKK1 and Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) combined test data. The pooled SEN, SPE, PLR, NLR, DOR and area under the sROC curve of combined detection for the diagnosis of HCC were 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.85), 0.85 (95% CI, 0.78-0.91), 5.52 (95% CI, 3.76-8.10), 0.22 (95% CI, 0.19-0.27), 24.60 (95% CI, 17.69-34.19) and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.85-0.91), respectively.Conclusion:Both DKK1 and DKK1 plus AFP had high diagnostic accuracy for diagnosis of HCC.
