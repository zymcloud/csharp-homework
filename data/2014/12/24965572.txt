Background:Signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) mediates the intracellular effects of interleukin-12, leading to the production of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and natural killer cells cytotoxicity. However, the clinical significance of STAT4 expression in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains virtually unknown.Methods:A total of 66 HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy were enrolled in this study. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine STAT4 and IFNG mRNA expression levels. Tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry was performed to examine CD8(+) T cells, STAT4, and INF-γ proteins.Results:STAT4 was differentially expressed in tumor and nontumor tissues (P = 0.001) and positively correlated with IFNG expression (R (2) = 0.506, P Conclusions:Downregulation of STAT4 in HCC indicated aggressive tumor behavior and predicted a worse clinical outcome. STAT4 might be a useful biomarker to identify patients at high risk of recurrence after hepatectomy.
