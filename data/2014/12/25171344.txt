Backgrounds and objective:There is controversy regarding liver function of non-B, non-C hepatocellular carcinoma (NBNC-HCC) patients, the biological behavior of their tumors, and the outcome after surgical treatment. The aims of the present study were to compare clinicopathologic data and long-term clinical outcomes between NBNC-HCC patients and hepatitis B virus HCC (HBV-HCC) patients from non-cirrhotic liver after curative hepatectomy.Methods:Data for HBV-HCC patients (n = 360) and NBNC-HCC patients (n = 103) were retrospectively reviewed.Results:The median age of patients in the NBNC group was significantly higher than that of the HBV group (63 years vs. 53 years, P Conclusion:For patients with non-cirrhotic liver, clinical outcomes for NBNC-HCC were comparable to those for HBV-HCC after curative hepatectomy.
