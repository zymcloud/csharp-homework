Background:During the last 20 years, relevant diagnostic procedures and advanced treatments have been progressively introduced in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the present study was to assess up-to-date survival trends for HCC in southern Switzerland, a region with one of the highest incidence rates in the country.Methods:HCCs diagnosed in 1996-2009 were selected by the Ticino Cancer Registry. Cancer-specific survival (CSS) analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method by calendar period: 1996-2000, 2001-2005 and 2006-2009. The log-rank test was used to detect differences in survival curves. Simultaneous assessment of prognostic factors was performed by a multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional-hazards regression model.Results:619 HCCs were analysed. There was a significant increase of patients undergoing transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE), whereas patients undergoing curative or palliative supportive treatments remained unchanged (p Conclusions:The current population-based report describes a major increase in HCC survival. Simultaneously an increased use of TACE has been detected, probable cofactor of the observed survival increase. Possibly additional efforts could be made to decrease the HCC stage at diagnosis through active surveillance of cirrhotic patients to allow an increase in curative treatments. For sure efforts should be made to comply with a standardised staging system for HCC, particularly for comparative population-based issues.
