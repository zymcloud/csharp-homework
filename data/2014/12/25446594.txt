Ethnopharmacological relevance:Ginseng (Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer) has a beneficial role in the treatment of various diseases including liver disorders like acute/chronic hepatotoxicity, hepatitis, hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.Materials and methods:Tissue culture raised mountain ginseng adventitious root (TCMGARs) extract with ginsenosides in abundance was used as an experimental material. 'Sprague-Dawley' male rats were used as experimental systems and were fed with TCMGARs extracts at doses of 30, 100, 300mg/kg body weight for two weeks to test the effect on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced acute liver damage. Field cultivated Korean ginseng root extract fed rats (100mg/kg) were used as positive control. Plasma enzyme levels, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were assessed. Glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations were also evaluated.Results:TCMGARs extracts remarkably prevented the elevation of ALT, AST, ALP and liver peroxides in CCl4-treated rats. Hepatic glutathione levels were significantly increased by the treatment with the extracts in experimental groups.Conclusion:The TCMGARs rich in varied ginsenosides can afford protection against CCl4-induced hepatocellular injury.
