The most common sites of metastases in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are lung and bone. However, unusual sites, including the stomach, are characteristic of RCC.This article presents a case of a metastatic RCC (lung and liver) with a symptomatic gastric metastasis treated by a laparoscopic wedge resection (LWR).A 66-year-old woman, diagnosed with RCC underwent a right nephrectomy. During her follow-up, an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy showed an ulcerated lesion at the stomach. A biopsy of the specimen revealed metastatic RCC. The patient underwent a palliative LWR and was discharged home 8 days after surgery.Therefore, LWR is a relatively simple technique with the advantages of minimal invasive access in the treatment of palliative cases.
