Stereotactic body radiotherapy(SBRT)is defined as the management and delivery of image-guided high-dose radiation therapy with tumor ablative intent within a short course of treatment. SBRT was more effective than 3D-CRT. In the phase II JCOG0403 trial for T1N0M0 non-small-cell lung cancer, the 3-year overall survival rate was 76% for operable patients and 59.9% for inoperable patients. Several authors reported the treatment results in various dose-fractionation schedules. However, the optimal dose, fractionation regimen, and the dose reference method are yet to be determined. Clinical trial s comparing SBRT and sublobar resection were planned but too few cases were enrolled to provide definitive evidence. SBRT for hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) is a standard treatment option for patients who are ineligible for resection or radiofrequency ablation. A phase II trial for untreated non-metastatic primary HCC is ongoing in Japan which is expected to provide more supporting evidence.
