Background and aim:The immune modulatory drug lenalidomide has shown promising anti-tumor activity in a clinical trial of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study explored whether lenalidomide can enhance the anti-tumor activity of sorafenib, the standard molecular targeted therapy for HCC.Methods:The anti-tumor efficacy of single-agent or combination treatment was measured by change in tumor volume and animal survival using an orthotopic liver cancer model. Distribution of T-cell subpopulations in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and splenocytes derived from tumor-implanted mice was measured by flow cytometry. Depletion of relevant T-cell subpopulations or cytokines was done by co-administration of relevant antibodies with study drug treatment. Tumor cell apoptosis and tumor angiogenesis were measured by transferase deoxytidyl uridine end labeling assay and immunohistochemical study, respectively.Results:Combination of sorafenib and lenalidomide produced significant synergistic anti-tumor efficacy in terms of tumor growth delay and animal survival. This synergistic effect was associated with a significant increase in interferon-Î³ expressing CD8(+) lymphocytes in TILs and a significantly higher number of granzyme- or perforin-expressing CD8(+) T cells, compared with vehicle- or single-agent treatment groups. Combination treatment significantly increased apoptotic tumor cells and vascular normalization in tumor tissue. The synergistic anti-tumor effect was abolished after CD8 depletion.Conclusions:Lenalidomide can enhance the anti-tumor effects of sorafenib in HCC through its immune modulatory effects, and CD8(+) TILs play an important role in the anti-tumor synergism.
