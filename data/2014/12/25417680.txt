Pancreatic disorders, such as chronic or acute pancreatitis, and carcinoma may be infrequently accompanied or preceded by panniculitis or polyarthritis. This triad is known in the literature as the pancreatitis, panniculitis, and polyarthritis syndrome. Although the pancreatic disease of pancreatitis, panniculitis, and polyarthritis syndrome usually includes pancreatitis, here we review the literature with report of 1 additional case of polyarthritis and panniculitis occurring in the presence of pancreatic carcinoma. Given that the diagnosis is often difficult when abdominal symptoms are absent, knowledge of the association between panniculitis and polyarthritis with pancreatic disease may lead to a prompt diagnosis and management. The histopathology of the skin lesions can be a valuable clue for focusing attention to a pancreatic disease.
