The principal reason of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma is chronic viral hepatitis all over the world. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has some mutagenic effects on the host genome. HBV may be exhibiting these mutagenic effects through integrating into the host genome, through its viral proteins or through some epigenetic mechanisms related with HBV proteins. This review aims to summarize the molecular mechanisms used by HBV for effecting host genome determined in the last decade. The focus will be on the effects of integration, HBV proteins, especially HBV X protein and epigenetic mechanisms on the host genome. These interactions between HBV and the host genome also forms the underlying mechanisms of the evolution of hepatocellular carcinoma.
