Percutaneous cryoablation is a potential cure for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study reviewed retrospectively clinical data from 14 patients who underwent cryoablation of huge HCC (long diameter >7 cm). The side effects of cryosurgeries and liver function reverse were recorded and compared everyday. All the patients survived cryosurgery and none died before leaving hospital 2 weeks later. Despite liver-protective treatment before cryosurgery, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels were increased significantly, but returned to preoperative levels 2 weeks post-cryosurgery. Before cryosurgery, mean total bilirubin (T.BIL) and direct bilirubin (D.BIL) levels were normal; 8-10 days after cryosurgery, they increased more than two-fold, but returned to the preoperative level 2 weeks post-cryosurgery. Serum transaminase and bilirubin levels were compared between hepatitis B positive and negative patients. The hepatitis B negative group's AST level increased significantly 1 day post-cryosurgery (mean, 186 U/L) and decreased to the preoperative level at day 14. In the hepatitis B positive group, means transaminase and bilirubin reached peak values at different days post-cryosurgery. Overall, ALT and AST are valuable indicators of liver function impairment following cryosurgery. In patients with hepatitis B virus, close attention to the serum bilirubin level should be paid 8-10 days after cryosurgery. Liver-protective treatment may alleviate liver function impairment caused by cryosurgery of huge HCC.
