Aim:This review sought to systematically appraise the literature to establish the role of hepatectomy in treating renal cell carcinoma hepatic metastases.Method:Medline and EMBASE were systematically searched for papers reporting survival of patients who underwent hepatectomy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.Results:Six studies containing 140 patients were included. There were no randomised controlled trials. Perioperative mortality was 4.3%, with reported morbidity between 13 and 30%. Patients with metachronous presentation, and a greater time interval between resection of primary tumour and development of metachronous metastases, appeared to have better survival. There was no difference in survival between patients with solitary and multiple metastases.Conclusion:Few patients with hepatic metastases from renal cell carcinoma are suitable for hepatectomy as metastatic disease is usually widespread. Selected patients may experience a survival benefit, but identifying these patients remains difficult.
