Body mass index (BMI) was 26.7 and ASA score was 2. No previous abdominal surgery. According with our multidisciplinary group we suggest a laparoscopic left lobectomy for the patient. Pringle manoeuvre was not performed. Operation time was 193 min and blood loss estimation was 100 cc. No transfusion was required. Post-operative course was uneventful, grade I of Clavien-Dindo Classification. Patient was discharged in day 8. In our experience laparoscopic resection in cirrhotic liver should be performed in selected patients and in an experienced team.
