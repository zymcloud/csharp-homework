The objective of this work is to compare the outcomes between the Child-Pugh score 5 (A5 group) and Child-Pugh score 6 (A6 group) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Whether HCC patients with A5 and A6 groups have different prognoses is still obscure. We enrolled 2462 consecutive treatment-naive HCC patients from 2007 to 2012. Among them, 1486 patients had Child-Pugh grade A, including 1016 in the A5 group and 470 in the A6 group. Factors in the prognoses were analyzed by multivariate analysis. Compared with those in the A6 group, patients in the A5 group were younger, had higher proportions of tumors within the Milan criteria, and more of them underwent curative therapies. The cumulative survival rates at 5 years were 51.3% and 37.1% for patients in the A5 and A6 groups, respectively (P 45 U/L, Î±-fetoprotein > 20 ng/mL, multinodularity, tumor size > 3 cm, vascular invasion, and noncurative therapies, but not the Child-Pugh numeric score. The Child-Pugh numeric score had a significant prognostic effect only in patients who had tumors beyond the Milan criteria and received noncurative therapies. HCC patients with A5 group had a better overall survival rate than those with A6 group due to the early tumor stage and higher rate of receiving curative treatments. Tumor factors and treatment modalities were more important than the Child-Pugh numeric score.
