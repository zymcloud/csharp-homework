Objective:Over half of colorectal cancer patients will develop liver metastases.Background:Thermal ablation with or without associated liver resection for colorectal hepatic metastasis has been suggested as an alternative method to improve survival if radical surgical resection is not achievable. A retrospective case series of patients treated with microwave ablation(MWA) associated with hepatic resection in one step procedure, was reviewed to analyze the clinical outcome.Materials and methods:In a group of 40 patients surgically cured for liver tumors in our Department, 5 patients with technically unresectable disease underwent combined treatment LR-MWA.Results:Four patients were treated with multiple segmentectomies and MWA and one patient received a left lobectomy (S2-S3) and MWA. Only 1 patient (20%) developed post surgical complication which was a liver abscess (grade II of Dindo classification).Conclusions:Hepatic resection combined with MWA expanded indications for operative treatment of multiple bilobar liver metastasis. This procedure promise to have good long-term outcomes.
