Background:We describe the burden of HCV infection and estimate the effect of four different treatment strategies to reduce HCV-related morbidity and mortality.Methods:Baseline model parameters were based upon literature review and expert consensus, focusing on New Zealand data. Four scenarios were modelled: Scenario 1 estimated the impact of increased treatment efficacy, while Scenario 2 estimated the effect of increased treatment efficacy and gradual increases in numbers treated. Scenarios 3 and 4 estimated the impact of deferred introduction of new DAAs for either 1 or 2 years.Results:Prevalence of HCV infection peaked in 2010 (50,480 cases). Peak prevalence of cirrhosis and HCC will occur after 2030. Scenario 2 resulted in sizeable decreases in HCV-related morbidity and mortality. The impact of Scenario 1 was smaller. Deferring funding for new DAA treatments for a further 1 or 2 years resulted in an 18-36% increase in liver-related deaths in 2030.Conclusions:While prevalence of chronic HCV infection may have peaked, disease burden continues to grow. Increased treatment uptake and efficacy combined with efforts to reduce disease transmission, will help prevent advanced liver disease and deaths.
