Recent studies have shown that some mammalian microRNAs (miRNAs) play a role in antiviral defence. However, little is known about the role of miRNA-323b in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-host interaction. We explored whether single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of miRNA-323b affects HBV replication in a Korean HBV cohort. Genotyping was performed in a total of 1439 subjects composed of 404 spontaneously recovered (SR) subjects as normal controls and 1035 chronic carriers (CC) of HBV who were further classified into 313 patients with chronic hepatitis, 305 patients with liver cirrhosis and 417 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. To confirm the effect of SNP of miRNA-323b on HBV replication in vitro, HepAD38 cells were transfected with miRNA-323b wild type or miRNA-323b SNP plasmid vectors, and HBV replication was induced for 5 days. HBV DNA was isolated and quantified using real-time PCR. The polymorphism rs56103835C>T in the pre-miRNA region of miRNA-323b revealed significant minor allele frequency (0.273). rs56103835C>T SNP showed significantly affect persistence of HBV in CC group compared with SR group (OR = 1.29, P = 0.009 in a codominant model; OR = 1.29, P = 0.03 in a dominant model; and OR = 1.78, P = 0.03 in a recessive model). In vitro, the total intracellular HBV DNA content was significantly reduced by miRNA-323b wild-type plasmid vector transfection (P = 0.014). The polymorphism of miRNA-323b was significantly associated with persistence of HBV by the enhancement of HBV replication (P = 0.021). Our findings provide a novel perspective on the role SNP of miRNAs in host-virus interactions in HBV infection.
