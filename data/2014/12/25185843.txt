Purpose:In patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and synchronous colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) potentially candidates to combined liver (LR) and colorectal resection (CRR), the extent of LR and the need of hepatic pedicle clamping (HPC) in selected cases are considered risk factors for the outcome of the intestinal anastomosis. This study aimed to determine whether intermittent HPC is predictive of anastomotic leakage (AL) and has an adverse effect on the clinical outcome in patients undergoing combined restorative CRR and LR.Methods:One hundred six LR have been performed for CRLM in our unit from July 2005. Patients who received CRR with anastomosis and simultaneous intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS)-guided LR/ablation for resectable CRLM were included in this study. CRR was performed first. Intermittent HPC was decided at the discretion of the liver surgeon. The perioperative outcome was evaluated according to occurrence of AL and overall postoperative morbidity and mortality.Results:Thirty-eight patients underwent simultaneous IOUS-guided LR/ablation and CRR with intestinal anastomosis; 19 underwent intermittent HPC (group ICHPY) while 19 did not (group ICHPN); the mean ± SD (range) duration of clamping in group ICHPY was 58.6 ± 32.2 (10.0-125.0) min. Postoperative results were similar between groups. One asymptomatic AL occurred in group ICHPY (5.2 %). Major postoperative complications were none in group ICHPY and one (5.2 %) in group ICHPN, respectively. One patient in group ICHPY died postoperatively (5.2 %).Conclusions:This study suggests that intermittent HPC during LR is not predictive of AL and has no adverse effect on the overall clinical outcome in patients undergoing combined restorative colorectal surgery and hepatectomy for advanced CRC.
