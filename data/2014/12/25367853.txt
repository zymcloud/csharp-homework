Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prototype of liver cancer, which is closely related to manifested metabolism of lip and glucose. Upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1) is an important transcription factor in human genome, and it regulates the expression of multiple genes associated with lipid and glucose metabolism. This study aims at investigating the correlation between seven common USF1 polymorphisms (i.e., -1994 G>A, -202 G>A, 7998 A>G, -844 C>T, 9042 C>G, 9441 T>C, and -2083 G>A) and the risk of HCC. Elucidation of the interaction might be of vital importance to the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC. One hundred and fifty-five HCC patients and 160 healthy controls from a Chinese Han population were involved in this study. Tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified with reference to CBI-dbSNP and HapMap databases. DNA was extracted from blood samples, and matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was conducted to determine the polymorphisms of USF1. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval were applied to evaluate the difference of genotype distribution. Seven SNPs were selected to be representatives. No significant difference was observed concerning -1994 G>A, 7998 A>G, 9042 C>G, 9441 T>C, and -2083 G>A polymorphisms (all P > 0.05). A significantly elevated genotype frequency regarding -202 G>A polymorphism was observed in HCC patients [AA vs. GG: OR 2.13 (1.13-4.01), P = 0.019; AA vs. GG+GA: OR 2.22 (1.32-3.75), P = 0.003; A allele vs. G allele: OR 1.46 (1.07-2.01), P = 0.018]. Subjects carrying mutant -844 C>T genotypes also had a higher risk of HCC [CT vs. CC: OR 1.88 (1.17-3.04), P = 0.009; CT+TT vs. CC: OR 1.83 (1.17-2.86), P = 0.008; T allele vs. C allele: OR 1.49 (1.06-2.09), P = 0.020]. Further studies are recommended to validate our findings in different ethnicity and to clarify the functional relationship between USF1 polymorphisms and the susceptibility of HCC.
