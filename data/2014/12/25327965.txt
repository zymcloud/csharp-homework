Background:Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is a standard treatment for unresectable, intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Survival after TACE, however, can be highly variable, with no suitable biomarker predicting therapeutic outcome. The inflammation-based index (IBI) has previously been shown to independently predict overall survival (OS) in all stages of HCC.Aim:To explore the prognostic ability of IBI as a predictor of survival after TACE.Methods:Baseline staging, biochemical and clinicopathological features including IBI were studied in a derivation set of 64 patients undergoing TACE for intermediate stage HCC. Dynamic changes in IBI before and after TACE were studied as predictors of survival using both a univariate and multivariate Cox regression model and further validated in two independent patient cohorts from Korea (n = 76) and Japan (n = 577).Results:Pre-treatment IBI predicted for OS in the derivation set (P = 0.001). Other univariate predictors of OS included radiological response to TACE (P 5 cm (P = 0.05) and AFP â‰¥400 (P Conclusions:Normalisation of IBI after TACE is shown to be an independent predictor of survival and may be integrated into the retreatment criteria for repeat TACE in intermediate stage HCC. IBI and its dynamic changes after treatment are validated as a biomarker allowing the stratification of patients with a significant survival advantage following initial TACE.
