Background:The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is recognized to be responsible for cancer progression in several human cancers. In this study, we investigated the clinical impact of RAGE expression in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatectomy.Materials and methods:Sixty-five consecutive patients who underwent initial hepatectomy for HCC were investigated. The relationships between immunohistochemical expression of RAGE and clinicopathologic features, clinical outcome (overall survival [OS], and disease-free survival [DFS]) were evaluated.Results:The cytoplasmic expression of RAGE in HCC cells was observed in 46 patients (70.8%) and correlated with histologic grade (poorly differentiated versus moderately differentiated HCC, P = 0.021). Five-year OS in RAGE-positive and RAGE-negative groups were 72% and 94%, respectively, whereas 5-y DFS were 29% and 55%, respectively. There were significant differences between OS and DFS (P = 0.018 and 0.031, respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated that RAGE was an independent predictor for both OS and DFS (P = 0.048 and 0.032, respectively).Conclusions:Our data suggest for the first time a positive correlation between RAGE expression and poor therapeutic outcome. Furthermore, RAGE downregulation may provide a novel therapeutic target for HCC.
