Aim:It has been highly controversial whether elevated serum Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) level before hepatectomy predicts recurrence and mortality of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or not. This study is to identify whether the index predicts recurrence and mortality after hepatectomy in HCC.Methods:Of 568 consecutive patients, 342 with normal liver function (Child-Pugh score, 5) and no macrovascular invasion were enrolled between April 2000 and March 2013. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).Results:In multivariate analysis, the elevated serum AFP level was an independent risk factor for DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.9; P Conclusion:Serum AFP was a highly reliable index for DFS and OS.
