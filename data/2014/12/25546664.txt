MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the miRNAs influence the function of mature miRNAs and may contribute to cancer development. Studies investigating the association between miR-146a rs2910164 and miR-196a2 rs11614913 polymorphisms and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk reported inconsistent results. We performed a meta-analysis of all available studies to summarize this situation. Eligible studies were identified by search of electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library for the period up to August 2014. The association of miR-146a rs2910164 and miR-196a2 rs11614913 polymorphisms and HCC risk was assessed by odds ratios (ORs) together with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Finally, a total of 12 studies with 4171 cases and 4901 controls were included for miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism and 10 studies with 4687 cases and 4990 controls were available for miR-196a2 rs11614913 polymorphism. With respect to miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism, statistical significant increased HCC risk was found when all studies were pooled into the meta-analysis (GG+CG vs CC: OR = 1.097, 95% CI 1.005-1.197, P = 0.037). In subgroup analyses by ethnicity, source of control, and HWE in controls, significant increase of HCC risk was found in Asians, population-based studies, and studies consistent with HWE, but not in Caucasians, hospital-based studies, and studies inconsistent with HWE. With respect to miR-196a2 rs11614913 polymorphism, no significant association with HCC risk was found in the overall and subgroup analyses. The results suggest that the miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism contributes to increased HCC susceptibility, especially in Asian populations. Further large and well-designed studies are required to validate this association.
