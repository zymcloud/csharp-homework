Adjuvant therapy after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is limited. Here, we evaluated the effects of postoperative sorafenib on recurrence and survival in HCC patients. Recurrence-free survival and overall survival were analyzed as the main endpoint, recurrence rate, and mortality rate were analyzed as second endpoint. Furthermore, post-recurrence survival was also analyzed. Clinicopathological factors were compared between sorafenib and control groups. Seventy-eight patients were eligible for final data analysis (46 in control group; 32 in sorafenib group). Sorafenib did not significantly prolong recurrence-free survival (11.0 months in the control group vs. 11.7 months in the sorafenib group, p = 0.702), but significantly prolonged overall survival (32.4 vs. 25.0 months, p = 0.046). Sorafenib did not reduce recurrence rate (67.7% vs. 78.3%, p = 0.737), but significantly reduced mortality rate (28.1% vs. 60.9%, p = 0.004). The increased post-recurrence survival (22.2 vs. 4.4 months, p = 0.003) may have contributed to the survival benefit after recurrence in the sorafenib group. Adjuvant sorafenib did not decrease tumor recurrence, but significantly reduced mortality and prolonged overall survival of HCC patients after curative resection, probably by inhibiting tumor growth after tumor recurrence.
