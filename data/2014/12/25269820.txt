MicroRNAs (miRNAs), as gene expression regulators, have been identified to be closely associated with tumorigenesis. Thus a loss-of-function study is more likely to reveal the biological roles of endogenous miRNAs. Genetic knockout, antisense oligonucleotide inhibitors, and miRNA sponge (miRâ€‘SP) are usually performed to inhibit the activities of miRNAs of interest. In the present study, we utilized the miR-SP method, which has long-term rather than short-term effects of antisense oligonucleotide inhibitors, to generate a microRNA-122 sponge (miR-122-SP) mediated by lentivirus, and identified its silencing role in the Huh7 hepatoma cell line and U2OS osteosarcoma cell line. The results showed that miR-122-SP effectively sequestered ectopic miR-122 and restored the expression of miR-122 which targets cyclin G1 (CCNG1), Bcl-w and disintegrin and metalloprotease 10. Moreover, miR-122-SP overexpression rescued the effects of ectopic miR-122 on suppressing proliferation, inhibiting cell migration and invasion, arresting cell cycle at G1 phase, and activating caspase-3/7, not only in Huh7 human hepatoma cells, but also in U2OS osteosarcoma cells. miR-122-SP also knocked down endogenous miR-122 expression in Huh7 and promoted tumorigenesis in vivo. miR-122-SP therefore is a useful tool that may be utilized to study the functions of miR-122 with regard to liver development and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo.
