Nucleoside and nucleotide analogs (NAs) have been successfully used for treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication is now recognized as the key driver of liver injury and disease progression, so the primary aim of treatment for chronic HBV infection is to maximize sustained suppression of HBV replication to undetectable levels. The long-term treatment has also been shown to achieve substantial histological improvement and regression of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, and reduction of hepatocellular carcinoma. This paper has reviewed the necessity, clinical benefits, and the management of long-term treatment for chronic hepatitis B.
