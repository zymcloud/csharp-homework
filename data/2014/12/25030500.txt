Purpose:The purpose of this study was to clarify the clinicopathological features of extrahepatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after hepatectomy in order to schedule optimal treatment strategies for better long-term outcomes.Methods:A cohort of 206 patients who had undergone curative hepatectomy for HCC was analysed; 133 patients had developed relapse. Among them, 101 patients had intrahepatic recurrence only (IHR), and 32 patients had extrahepatic recurrence (EHR). Clinicopathological and survival data were compared between the two groups.Results:The overall survival rate after hepatectomy was better in the IHR than in the EHR group (pConclusions:EHR of HCC was associated with early recurrence, and risk factors for the occurrence of EHR included the presence of high PIVKA II, large tumours, and microscopic portal vein invasion. Resection of recurrent tumour and local control of concomitant IHR may improve the prognosis of EHR patients.
