Background:An important model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that has been described in southeast Asia includes the transition from chronic hepatitis B infection (CHB) to liver cirrhosis (LC) and, finally, to HCC. The genome-wide methylation profiling of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has not previously been used to assess HCC development. Using MethylCap-seq, we analyzed the genome-wide cfDNA methylation profiles by separately pooling healthy control (HC), CHB, LC and HCC samples and independently validating the library data for the tissue DNA and cfDNA by MSP, qMSP and Multiplex-BSP-seq.Results:The dynamic features of cfDNA methylation coincided with the natural course of HCC development. Data mining revealed the presence of 240, 272 and 286 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) corresponding to the early, middle and late stages of HCC progression, respectively. The validation of the DNA and cfDNA results in independent tissues identified three DMGs, including ZNF300, SLC22A20 and SHISA7, with the potential for distinguishing between CHB and LC as well as between LC and HCC. The area under the curve (AUC) ranged from 0.65 to 0.80, and the odds ratio (OR) values ranged from 5.18 to 14.2.Conclusions:Our data revealed highly dynamic cfDNA methylation profiles in support of HBV-related HCC development. We have identified a panel of DMGs that are predictive for the early, middle and late stages of HCC development, and these are potential markers for the early detection of HCC as well as the screening of high-risk populations.
