Objective:The purpose of this study was to investigate the overall survival, efficacy, and safety of small (100-300 µm) versus large (300-500 and 500-700 µm) doxorubicin drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization (DEB TACE) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Ninety-four consecutive patients with unresectable HCC who underwent 269 DEB TACE procedures in 48 months were studied. DEB TACE procedures were performed using different DEB sizes: 100-300 µm (Group A, 59 patients) and with mixed 300-500 and 500-700 µm DEB (Group B, 35 patients). Survival rates were compared between the groups.Results:The overall median survival in groups A and B were 15.1 and 11.1 months, respectively (p=0.005). Both groups were similar in demographics, tumor burden, and differential staging (p>0.5). Substratification of overall survival according to Child-Pugh class and Okuda, Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP), and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging were significantly higher in group A than in group B (pConclusion:TACE with 100-300 µm sized DEB is associated with significantly higher survival rate and lower complications than TACE with 300-500 and 500-700 µm sized DEB.
