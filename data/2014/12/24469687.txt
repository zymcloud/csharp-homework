Background:We aimed to retrospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of transarterial treatment for the recurrence of ovarian cancer, limited to one or two gross regions, in a palliative setting as third-line and beyond therapy.Methods:Twenty-six consecutive patients were enrolled to undergo transarterial treatment of target lesions that were life-threatening or influenced their quality of life. Transarterial infusion via each feeding artery using 20-40 mg cisplatin and 20-40 mg docetaxel per patient was repeated every 4-6 weeks. Superabsorbent polymer microspheres were added for embolization after drug infusion, especially in hepatic or pelvic treatments. Univariate and multivariate Cox's proportional hazards models were used to assess the correlations between overall survival and individual parameters.Results:A total of 63 feeding arteries (median 2 per patient; range 1-5) were treated for 36 target sites (liver, 12; pelvis, 8; abdominal cavity, 7; lymph node, 3; other, 6) at the initial treatment. Of the 128 total sessions, the only grade 3/4 toxicity was neutropenia (3.8 %). The target lesion response rate by RECIST ver.1.1 was 50.0 % (11.5 % complete response; 38.5 % partial response). After a median follow-up of 30 months, the median overall survival was 16 months. Among 10 tumor-associated symptomatic patients, 7 showed symptom improvement. Multivariate analyses shows that the only independent prognostic factor was target lesion response (hazard ratio 18.7; 95 % CI 1.9-183.4; p = 0.01).Conclusions:Transarterial treatment for ovarian cancer achieves a high local response and good symptom control, and significantly contributes to survival for patients with local control after multiple relapses.
