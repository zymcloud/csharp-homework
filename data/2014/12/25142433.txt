Serum fibrosis markers, such as the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test, have been suggested as alternatives for liver biopsy (LB) in assessing liver fibrosis. We investigated the efficacy of the ELF test in predicting development of liver-related events (LREs) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A total of 170 patients (103 men; 60.6%) with CHB who underwent LB and serological tests for determining ELFs were enrolled. All patients were followed up to monitor LRE development, defined as hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and/or liver-related death. The mean age was 45.3 years. During the follow-up period (median, 41 months), 39 (22.9%) patients experienced LREs. In patients with LREs, age, proportion of male gender, ELF test results, age-spleen-platelet ratio (ASPRI), liver stiffness (LS) value, and proportion of histological cirrhosis were significantly higher than those in patients without LREs (all P Conclusion:ELF is useful in a noninvasive prediction of LRE development. Transient elastography showed a statistically similar prognostic performance for LREs as the ELF, but other noninvasive tests were inferior.
