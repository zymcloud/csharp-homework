Overcoming metastasis is one of the most important issues with lung cancer. Since metastasis arises through complex steps, a suitable animal model is indispensable for investigation of metastasis. To establish an animal model reflecting human metastatic lung cancers, we used NOD/SCID/Jak3null (NOJ) mice, which exhibit deficiencies in NK cell activity, macrophage and dendritic cell function, and complement activation, as well as T and B cell deficiencies. After screening twenty human lung cancer cell lines through expression patterns of E-cadherin and vimentin according to epithelial mesenchymal transition features, an H1975 cell line carrying EGFR mutations, L858R and T790M, was selected for investigation. Inoculation of the cells into the dorsal flanks caused systemic metastases after one month in lymph nodes, liver, lung, and peritoneum, suggesting that metastases occurred both lymphogenically and hematogenously. We confirmed the existence of H1975 cells in metastatic lesions by detection of T790M and L858R using the mutation-biased PCR and quenching probe (MBP-QP) system previously established in our laboratory. In addition, tumor-derived plasma DNA could be detected using the MBP-QP method. The amount of tumor-derived DNA was associated with tumor volume, whereas an unrelated large amount of tumor-derived DNA was circulating in the presence of metastasis. We present a novel animal model with systemic metastasis with human lung cancer cells. The amount of tumor derived DNA would be related with tumor volume and tumor progression such as metastasis.
