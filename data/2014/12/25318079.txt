The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G is a "nonclassical" major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ib gene, located at chromosome 6, in the 6p21.3 region. The HLA-G presents immunomodulatory functions essential in pregnancy for the tolerance of the semi-allogenic fetus, but an abnormal expression of HLA-G has been observed in numerous pathological conditions, such as tumors, autoimmune diseases and viral infections. In recent years, numerous studies have assessed the clinical relevance of HLA-G expression in different types of cancer: in general, a higher HLA-G expression correlates with a lower survival rate or a shorter disease-free survival. Altered expression of HLA-G has been found in both HCV and HBV infection, and some genetic polymorphisms have been associated with altered susceptibility/disease development for these infections, however, whether the biologic role of HLA-G in HCV and HBV infection is beneficial or hazardous, it is not completely clear. In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma, HLA-G has shown a potential diagnostic role, moreover a prognostic value in HCC patients has been also attributed to HLA-G molecules. We revise here the role of HLA-G in hepatotropic HBV/HCV infections and in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
