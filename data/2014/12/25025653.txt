Introduction:Placement of self-expanding metallic stents has been a standard palliative treatment for patients with inoperable biliary malignancy, aiming at improving quality of life via a minimally invasive procedure. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of percutaneous placement of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene/fluorinated ethylene propylene-covered metallic stents for palliation of inoperable biliary malignancy.Material and methods:Between February 2012 and April 2013, 11 patients with inoperable malignant biliary obstruction were treated with stent implantation. Serum bilirubin and liver enzyme levels were measured before/immediately after stent placement and at one, three, and six months. Patient survival and stent patency were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis.Results:No migration occurred. Patients showed clinical improvement immediately and one month after stent placement, with a significant reduction in mean serum bilirubin level (p < 0.05). At six months, bilirubin levels were <1.5 mg/dL in all cases. One patient developed acute liver failure four days after stent implantation, leading to death. Survival rates were 90% at three months and 70% at six months. Primary patency rates were 100%, 100%, and 90% at one, three, and six months, respectively.Conclusion:Percutaneous placement of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene/fluorinated ethylene propylene-covered metallic stents offered an effective palliative therapy for patients with inoperable biliary malignancy.
