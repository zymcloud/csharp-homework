Penile squamous cell carcinoma is a rare malignancy seen more frequently in developing nations. Metastasis occurs in a predictable manner, with superficial lymph node involvement occurring first, followed by deep lymph node involvement, and then distant spread. Brain, lung, liver, and bone are the typical sites of distant metastasis. We present the unusual case of an 81-year-old man with penile squamous cell carcinoma requiring total penectomy who developed a confluent red to violaceous, indurated suprapubic plaque with satellite papules and bulky inguinal lymphadenopathy. The shield-like clinical presentation and infiltrating strands and cords on histology resembled carcinoma en cuirasse, a rare form of cutaneous metastasis frequently associated with breast cancer but not reported with penile squamous cell carcinoma.
