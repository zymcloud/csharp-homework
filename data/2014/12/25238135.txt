Yttrium-90 is a radioelement which has found wide use in targeted radionuclide therapy because of its attractive physical and chemical properties. Radioembolisation of hepatocellular carcinoma with radiolabelled Lipiodol is a method of choice. We have synthesised a series of alkyldithiocarbamate yttrium complexes, easily extracted into Lipiodol due to their high lipophilicity. Among the prepared series, a new radioconjugate, which is stable over an extended period of time, has been prepared, and could represent a potential treatment procedure for hepatocellular carcinoma.
