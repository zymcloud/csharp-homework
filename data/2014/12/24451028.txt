Aim:This study aimed to investigate the presence of plasma minichromosome maintenance complex component 6 (MCM6) mRNA and protein levels in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and evaluate their diagnostic value for HCC.Methods:Blood samples were collected from 61 HCC and 29 cirrhotic patients, and 30 healthy individuals. Circulating RNA was extracted from plasma of all samples. The mRNA for MCM6 were amplified and quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Plasma MCM6 and Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) protein levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Results:In HCC patients, MCM6 mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased over the cirrhotic and healthy controls. The levels of MCM6 mRNA and protein in the plasma of HCC patients correlated to vascular invasion (P Conclusion:Our results suggest that MCM6 mRNA and protein levels in plasma can be promising independent biomarkers for HCC, especially in AFP negative and small HCC patients.
