This paper describes a visual sensor array for pattern recognition analysis of proteins based on two different optical signal changes: colorimetric and fluorometric, by using two types of novel blue-emitting collagen protected gold nanoclusters and macerozyme R-10 protected gold nanoclusters with lower synthetic demands. Eight proteins have been well-discriminated by this visual sensor array, and protein mixtures after one-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis also could be well-discriminated. The possible mechanism of this sensor array was illustrated and validated by fluorescence spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), fluorescence lifetime, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) experiments. It was attributed to that the adsorption of proteins onto the surface of gold nanoclusters (Au NCs), forming the protein-Au NCs complex. Furthermore, serums from normal and hepatoma patients were also effectively discriminated by this visual sensor array, showing feasible potential for diagnostic applications.
