Purpose:The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of radiation therapy (RT) following incomplete transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods and materials:The study was designed as a prospective phase 2 multicenter trial. Patients with unresectable HCC, who had viable tumor after TACE of no more than 3 courses, were eligible. Three-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT) was added for HCC treatment with incomplete uptake of iodized oil, and the interval from TACE to RT was 4 to 6 weeks. The primary endpoint of this study was the tumor response after RT following incomplete TACE in unresectable HCC. Secondary endpoints were patterns of failure, progression-free survival (PFS), time to tumor progression (TTP), overall survival (OS) rates at 2 years, and treatment-associated toxicity. Survival was calculated from the start of RT.Results:Between August 2008 and December 2010, 31 patients were enrolled. RT was delivered at a median dose of 54 Gy (range, 46-59.4 Gy) at 1.8 to 2 Gy per fraction. A best objective in-field response rate was achieved in 83.9% of patients, with complete response (CR) in 22.6% of patients and partial response in 61.3% of patients within 12 weeks post-RT. A best objective overall response rate was achieved in 64.5% of patients with CR in 19.4% of patients and PR in 45.1% of patients. The 2-year in-field PFS, PFS, TTP, and OS rates were 45.2%, 29.0%, 36.6%, and 61.3%, respectively. The Barcelona Clinic liver cancer stage was a significant independent prognostic factor for PFS (P=.023). Classic radiation-induced liver disease was not observed. There were no treatment-related deaths or hepatic failure.Conclusions:Early 3D-CRT following incomplete TACE is a safe and practical treatment option for patients with unresectable HCC.
