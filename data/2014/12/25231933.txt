Cell metabolism abnormalities are closely related to tumor occurrence and development. Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is the key molecule for catalyzing fatty acid synthesis. Increasing evidence indicates that FASN is highly expressed in a number of malignant tumors; it can promote the synthesis of endogenous fatty acids in tumor cells and then the synthesized fatty acids provide energy for the proliferation of tumor cells. However, there has been no systematic study focusing on FASN expression and function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the present study was to verify the high expression of FASN in HCC cells at the histological and cellular levels, and to construct FASN shRNA eukaryotic expression vector for interfering FASN expression in HCC cell line SK-Hep-1, in an effort to explore the role of FASN in the proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration of HCC cells. In the present study, we demonstrated that FASN was highly expressed in HCC tissues compared with tumor-adjacent tissue and normal liver cell line 7702 (P
