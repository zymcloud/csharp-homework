Purpose:The aim was to evaluate prognostic factors and factors associated with the resectability of advanced gallbladder cancer (GBC).Methods:This was a single-institution retrospective review of 274 consecutive surgically-treated cases of advanced GBC (excluding incidental GBC and early GBC). Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to assess prognostic variables. R0 resection and survival rates were investigated for each local extension factor.Results:Long-term survival was uncommon among patients with multiple liver metastases (H2-3: n = 22; 2-year survival, 0 %), dissemination (P1-3: n = 16; 3-year survival, 0 %), invasion through the hepatoduodenal ligament (Binf3: n = 45; 5-year survival, 4.6 %), or group 3 lymph node (LN) metastasis including of the para-aortic LN (N3: n = 52; 13.7 %). Long-term survival rates did not differ significantly between patients who did and did not undergo bile duct resection or pancreaticoduodenectomy. Survival did not differ significantly according to the type of hepatectomy performed.Conclusion:Surgery may not be indicated for patients with multiple liver metastasis, dissemination, Binf3, or visible para-aortic LN metastasis. Furthermore, it is important to achieve R0 surgery in cases of GBC.
