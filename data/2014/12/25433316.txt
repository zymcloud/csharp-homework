Aim:The main goal of this study was to compare the biochemical and histopathological findings in patients with sustained virological response (SVR) before and two years after the therapy with pegylated interferon α-2a and ribavirin in chronic hepatitis C.Subjects and methods:The study was conducted at the Department of Internal Medicine and the Clinic for Infectious Diseases of the Clinical Hospital Mostar. The study included 48 patients whose treatment for chronic hepatitis C with pegylated interferon α-2a and ribavirin was finished two years prior to the achieved SVR at the end of the treatment. The main criterion for inclusion was a negative result of HCV RNA, determined by the RealTime HCV assay. After taking a history, physical examination, laboratory tests: AST, ALT, GGT, a liver biopsy were performed with the help of the ultrasound. The assessment of necroinflamatory score was determined by histologic activity index (HAI) score, and the stage of fibrosis according to Knodell's numerical score.Results:The values of AST and ALT levels were statistically significantly decreased after the successful treatment (pConclusion:Virological and biochemical responses in patients with SVR may not reflect the histopathological effects of the treatment and therefore these patients should be monitored for the possible development of the liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
