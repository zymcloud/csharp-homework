Objective:To explore the eff ect of Fasudil on the invasion and metastatic abilities of human high metastatic liver cancer cells (HCCLM3) and the underlying mechanisms.Methods:HCCLM3 cells were incubated with 100 Î¼mol/L Fasudil. Fluorescence staining for F-actin and Transwell assay were performed to observe the invasion ability of HCCLM3 cells. HCCLM3 cells were divided into 3 groups: a negative control group, a Fasudil group and a BTB/ POZ domain containing 7 (BTBD7)-siRNA group. Western blot assay was performed to detect the expression levels of BTBD7, ras homolog family member C (RhoC) and Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2), matrix metalloproteinases 2 (MMP2) and MMP9. Zymogram analysis method was performed to detect the expression activities of MMP2 and MMP9. The BTBD7-siRNA group was served as a positive control.Results:In HCCLM3 cells treated with Fasudil, the invasion ability was significant decreased compared with the control group, concomitant with the down-regulated expression levels of BTBD7, RhoC and ROCK2 protein as well as the decreased activities of MMP2 and MMP9.Conclusion:Fasudil plays an important role in interfering BTBD7-ROCK2 signaling pathway and suppressing the invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma.
