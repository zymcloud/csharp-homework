Objective:To explore the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic radical coloproctectomy and hepatectomy for resectalble colorectal cancer with liver metastases (CRCLM), and evaluate the survival outcomes of short-middle term for these patients.Methods:Totally 36 cases of CRCLM which were evaluated to undergo laparoscopic coloproctectomy and hepatectomy preoperatively, were enrolled from January 2009 to January 2014, including 28 synchronous and 8 metachronous CLM respectively. Laparoscopic colorectal resection and hepatectomies were performed in 35 cases, including 24 male and 11 female patients, with a mean age of (64 ± 12) years and a median age of 67 years (ranging from 35 to 80 years). Management strategies were made by a board of multi-disciplinary team. Intra-operative ultrasonography was used to detect the metastases in all cases. Overall survival and disease free survival were calculated by Kaplan-Meier curve.Results:Radical total colectomy, right hemicolectomy, left hemicolectomy, sigmoidectomy, and proctectomy and were performed in 1 case of familial adenomatous polyposis with transverse colon cancer, 5 cases of cecal or asending colon cancer, 1 case of descending colon cancer, 14 cases of sigmoid colon cancer, and 14 cases of rectal cancer respectively. Metastasectomy only, anatomic hepatectomy only, and metastasectomy plus anatomic hepatectomy were done in 21, 10 and 4 cases respectively. Totally 35 colorectal tumors and 62 liver lesions were removed. The mean blood loss of colorectal and liver surgery were (80 ± 32) and (212 ± 153) ml, the median blood loss was 70 ml and 150 ml respectively. Colorectal and hepatic specific complications were not observed in all cases except a case of biliary leakage following right hemihepatectomy. Relapses were observed in 15 cases during a mean follow-up of (26 ± 16) months (median follow-up of 22 months). Four cases died of late-stage cachexia. The 1- and 3-year cumulative overall survival rates were 92.9% and 79.4% respectively. The 1- and 3-year cumulative disease free survival rates were 61.1% and 49.4% respectively.Conclusions:Laparoscopic coloproctectomy and hepatectomy for resectable CRCLM in carefully selected cases is safe and feasible, which makes simultaneous surgery possible. The oncologic outcome of short-middle term is acceptable, and long-term survival is expected.
