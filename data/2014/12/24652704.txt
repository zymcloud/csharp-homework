Background:Currently, the use of mushrooms as functional foods, nutraceuticals or phytopharmaceuticals source has risen. In contrast, the possible cellular cytotoxicity and immunostimulatory activity of Pleurotus eryngii (DC. ex Fr.) Quel protein (PEQP) is unknown. Here we report extraction, anti-tumorigenic and immunostimulatory activity of PEQP in vitro.Results:PEQP was extracted from the dried fruiting bodies of P. eryngii, purified and characterised. Its in vitro antiproliferative activity was then evaluated in human non-small cell lung cancer A549 (NSCLC), stomach adenocarcinoma BGC-823, hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 and gastric carcinoma HGC-27 cell lines using conventional cancer drugs (paclitaxel, doxorubicin and mitomycin C) as positive controls. The protein fractions (PEQP 1, 2, 3 and 4) obtained inhibited tumour cell proliferation dose-dependently with fraction PEQP 2 having significant (P Conclusion:Based on these results, P. eryngii protein has a potential application in functional foods as a natural anti-tumour agent with immunostimulatory activity.
