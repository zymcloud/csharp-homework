Recently, Kamiyama et al. performed N-glycan profile in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using the quantitative N-glycomics procedure by way of glycoblotting technology and using an automated glycan purification system. The study showed significant differences of N-glycans profile between healthy volunteers and liver cancer patients. The glycomic approach showed us the usefulness of new tools for identification and application of a new biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and treatment. These findings reveal a new field for future markers discovery.
