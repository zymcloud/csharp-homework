Simple cysts (SCs) of the liver are not associated with the biliary malformations in intrahepatic bile duct biliary. Seen in 0.1% to 7% of adult population, biliary malformations are more common in women. The levels of glycoprotein-like tumor markers (carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9) in the cysts and serum could be high. Although studies regarding CA 19-9 exist, sufficient data on cancer antigen (CA) 15-3 are not available. This case is about a 76-year-old woman who complained of painless intra-abdominal mass. The patient with a giant simple cyst extending from the gallbladder to the pelvis had preoparative CA 19-9 and CA 15-3 serum levels of 87.3 IU/L and 37 IU/L respectively. It was observed that CA 19-9 levels had decreased to 36 IU/L and CA 15-3 to 28.1 IU/L in blood samples taken in the third month after the surgery. There is a need for comprehensive studies to investigate the relationship between the size of the cyst and biomarkers (including markers such as CA 15-3) in the assesment of liver SC.
