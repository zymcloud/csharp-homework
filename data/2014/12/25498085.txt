Arterial complications are a major cause of graft lost after liver transplantation (LT). The aim of our study was to assess the clinical impact of systematic early postoperative injected computed tomographic (CT) scans after LT rather than its performance on demand in the event of abnormalities. Two series of consecutive transplantation patients in different periods (1997-1999, 231 patients versus 2008-2010, 250 patients) were analyzed. During the first period, an injected CT scan was only performed in the event of clinical, biological, or ultrasound abnormalities revealed by tests performed daily during the first week after surgery. During the second period, in addition to standard follow-up examination, an injected CT scan was performed systematically at approximately postoperative day 7. During the first (versus the more recent) period, both recipients (whose ages were 46 ± 13 years versus 50 ± 12 years; P = .004) and donors (whose ages were 42 ± 17 versus 52 ± 17 years; P = .0001) were younger and end-stage liver disease was more common (34% versus 12%; P = .0001), but hepatocellular carcinoma (7% vs 26%; P = .0001) and retransplantation (2% versus 7%; P = .01) were less frequent. Postoperative mortality was higher during the first period (14% versus 4%; P = .0003). The incidence of early arterial thrombosis (
