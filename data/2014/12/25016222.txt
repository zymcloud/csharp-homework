Background & aims:We aimed to establish an objective point score to guide the decision for the first treatment with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:277 patients diagnosed with HCC and treated with transarterial treatments between 1/2002 and 12/2011 at the Medical Universities of Vienna (training cohort) and Innsbruck (validation cohort) were included. We investigated the impact of baseline liver function and tumour load on overall survival (OS, log-rank test) and developed a point score (STATE-score: Selection for TrAnsarterial chemoembolisation TrEatment) in the training-cohort (n=131, Vienna) by using a stepwise Cox regression model. The STATE-score was externally validated in an independent validation cohort (n=146, Innsbruck) and thereafter combined with the Assessment for Retreatment with TACE (ART)-score to identify patients who are (un)suitable for TACE.Results:The STATE-score starts with the serum-albumin level (g/L), which is reduced by 12 points each, if the tumour load exceeds the up-to-7 criteria and/or C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are â©¾1 mg/dl (maximum reduction: 24 points). The STATE-score differentiated 2 groups (Conclusion:The STATE-score identifies patients who are (un)suitable for the first TACE. The START-strategy identified the best candidates for multiple TACE sessions.
