The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics of sal-like protein 4 (SALL4)-immunopositive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Solitary HCCs that were surgically treated at the University of Tokyo Hospital between 2000 and 2008 were the subject of this study. Diffuse, non-punctate nuclear immunoreactivity to SALL4 was observed in 47 of 337 HCCs (13.9%). Compared to patients with SALL4-negative HCC, patients with SALL4-positive HCC were younger (mean 59.2 years vs. 65.2 years), more frequently female (44.7% vs. 18.3%) and positive for hepatitis B virus angigen (42.6% vs. 18.6%). They had much higher serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (median 3976.5 ng/ml vs. 14.0 ng/ml) (P
