Objective:Hepatitis B virus infection is still one of the leading causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Liver biopsy is the gold-standard method to assess the severity of liver fibrosis, but the invasive nature of this method limits its usage. Currently, noninvasive parameters are utilized to estimate liver histology. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the severity of fibrosis and red blood cell distribution width (RDW), platelet distribution width (PDW), mean platelet volume (MPV), and MPV and red blood cell distribution width to platelet ratio (RPR) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Design:A total of 229 biopsy-proven naïve CHB cases were included in the study. The complete blood count variables including white blood cell, hemoglobin, hematocrit value, platelet count, RDW, MPV and PDW, as well as aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, albumin, and other routine biochemical parameters were tested. Liver biopsy samples were examined using the Ishak scoring system. Data analyses were carried out using SPSS 15 software. Statistical significance was set at a P-value of less than 0.05.Results:Of the 229 cases, 210 (91.7%) were men and 19 (8.3%) were women. The mean age of the patients was 30.9 years, and 85 cases (37.1%) had HBeAg positivity. Fibrosis scores of 41 cases (17.9%) were greater than or equal to 3, whereas 188 cases (82.1%) had fibrosis scores less than 3. There was a significant difference between these two groups for MPV (group 1=7.98±1.20, group 2=8.77±1.44, PConclusion:MPV and RDW values are significantly higher in hepatitis B virus-infected patients, associated with severity, and can be defined as independent predicting factors in hepatic fibrosis. Further studies are required to determine the associations between MPV and the severity of fibrosis in hepatitis B patients.
