In this issue of Cancer Cell, Tummala and colleagues demonstrate that unconventional prefoldin RPB5 interactor (URI) expression in hepatocytes leads to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development by interacting with L-tryptophan/kynurenine/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) metabolism. The results suggest that supplementation of NAD(+) may be a prophylactic or therapeutic approach in HCC.
