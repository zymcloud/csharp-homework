Bi-phenotypic neoplasm refers to tumors derived from a common cancer stem cell with unique capability to differentiate histologically into two distinct tumor types. Bi-phenotypic hepatocellular carcinoma-cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-CC), although a rare tumor, is important for clinicians to recognize, since treatment options targeting both elements of the tumor are crucial. Imaging findings of bi-phenotypic HCC-CC are not specific and include features of both HCC and CC. A combination of imaging and immuno-histochemical analysis is usually needed to make the diagnosis.
