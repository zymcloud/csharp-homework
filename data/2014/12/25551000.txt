Focal fatty change of the segment IV of the liver has been attributed to local systemic venous inflow replacing the portal venous supply, which could develop or be accentuated after gastrectomy. However, focal fatty change due to aberrant pancreaticoduodenal vein that developed after cholecystectomy has never been reported. We report a 30-year-old man with such a rare lesion, which was initially misdiagnosed as a hepatocellular carcinoma, but was confirmed on computed tomography during selective gastroduodenal arteriography. The lesion disappeared 12 mo later without any intervention.
