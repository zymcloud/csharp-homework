Background:The peripheral morphologic characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) reflect tumor growth patterns. Computed tomography (CT) perfusion is a new method to analyze hemodynamic changes in tissues. We assessed the relationship between CT perfusion and histopathologic findings in the periphery of HCC lesions.Methods:Non-contrast CT, enhanced dual-phase CT, and CT perfusion were performed on 77 subjects (47 patients and 30 controls). Based on the imaging findings of enhanced dual-phase CT, the tumor edges were classified into three types: type I (sharp); type II (blurry); and type III (mixed). The CT perfusion parameters included hepatic blood flow, hepatic arterial fraction, hepatic arterial perfusion, and hepatic portal perfusion. The tissue sections from resected specimens were subjected to routine hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining for CD34. The correlations between microvessel density (MVD) and the CT perfusion parameters were analyzed using Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient. Changes in the perfusion parameters in tumor edges of different tumor types were evaluated.Results:Type I (sharp): the pathologic findings showed fibrous connective tissue capsules in the tumor edges, and an MVD â‰¤30/mm2. Type II (blurry): the histology showed that the edges were clear with no capsules and an MVD>30/mm2. Type III (mixed): the pathology was similar to that of types I and II, and an MVD>30/mm2. Hepatic blood flow, hepatic arterial fraction, hepatic arterial perfusion, and hepatic portal perfusion were significantly increased in the tumor edges of HCC patients compared to those of the controls (PConclusion:CT perfusion imaging of tumor edges may be helpful in revealing histopathological features, and indirectly reflect angiogenic changes of HCCs.
