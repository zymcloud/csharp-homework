Background:The rate of recurrence after liver resection for colorectal liver metastases (CLM) is high, and repeat resection (RR) is reserved with curative intent in selected patients. This study evaluated the benefit of RR for recurrence after liver resection for CLM.Methods:Data were collected on 287 consecutive patients who underwent primary curative hepatectomy between January 1999 and October 2008 for CLM at our institution.Results:After median follow-up of 63 months, 211 patients (73 %) developed recurrence and RR was conducted in 102 (48 %) patients. Five-year overall survival (OS) was significantly higher in the RR group than in those patients not selected for RR (70 vs. 45 %, P = 0.002). On multivariate analyses, RR was identified as an independent factor for good prognosis. According to the first recurrence sites, 5-year OS after recurrence was significantly better in patients with liver or lung only recurrence (55, 51 %, respectively) than in locoregional/lymph node metastases and other/multiple sites recurrence (33, 9.0 %, respectively). In patients with liver- or lung-only recurrence, 5-year OS after recurrence was significantly higher in RR patients than in those without RR (liver; 67 and 0 %, lung; 88 and 24 %, respectively; P < 0.001).Conclusion:Given similar indication criteria as the primary CLM, nearly half of all recurrence cases after liver resection for CLM could be salvaged by RR. In patients with liver-or lung-only recurrence, RR warrants a favorable outcome.
