Introduction:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a common cause of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prevalence of HCC significantly declines among patients achieving a sustained virological response (SVR) after antiviral therapy with pegylated(PEG)-interferon (IFN) and ribavirin. However, up to 5% of patients with SVR may develop HCC.Patients and methods:We investigated the epidemiological, clinical, biochemical and virological characteristics of a small cohort of patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) who developed HCC after being successfully treated with PEG-IFN-α and ribavirin.Results:Between September 2000 and January 2003, 598 patients with CHC underwent a complete course of treatment with PEG-IFN-α and ribavirin; 221 out of 598 (37%) patients obtained a SVR. Throughout the 10-year post-treatment follow up, 13 of 221 ( 5.8% ) SVR patients developed HCC. All 13 patients were male and were affected with Child A liver cirrhosis; in addition, at baseline they were significantly older (p Conclusions:The risk of developing HCC after achieving SVR persists in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis. As a consequence, these patients should continue to undergo long-term surveillance for HCC, in order to early detect and treat it.
