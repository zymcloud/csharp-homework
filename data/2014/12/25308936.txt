Medical ultrasound imaging using synthetic aperture sequential beamforming (SASB) has for the first time been used for clinical patient scanning. Nineteen patients with cancer of the liver (hepatocellular carcinoma or colorectal liver metastases) were scanned simultaneously with conventional ultrasound and SASB using a commercial ultrasound scanner and abdominal transducer. SASB allows implementation of the synthetic aperture technique on systems with restricted data handling capabilities due to a reduction in the data rate in the scanner by a factor of 64. The image quality is potentially maintained despite the data reduction. A total of 117 sequences were recorded and evaluated blinded by five radiologists from a clinical perspective. Forty-eight percent of the evaluations were in favor of SASB, 33% in favor of conventional ultrasound and 19 % were equal, that is, a clear, but non-significant trend favoring SASB over conventional ultrasound (p = 0.18), despite the substantial data reduction.
