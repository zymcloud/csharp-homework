Two new phenylbenzofuran-type stilbenoids named stemofurans X and Y (1, 2) were isolated from the roots of Stemona pierrei and S. tuberosa, respectively, together with ten known compounds. These compounds were stemanthrenes B-C (3, 4), (+)-syringaresinol (5), maistemonine (6), isomaistemonine (7) and sesamin (8) from S. pierrei, and stemophenanthrenes A-C (9-11) and isopinosylvin A (12) from S. tuberosa. Stemofurans X-Y (1, 2) showed moderate cytotoxicity against the four cancer cell lines KB (human epidermal carcinoma), MCF7 (human breast carcinoma), SK-LU-1 (human lung carcinoma), and Hep-G2 (hepatocellular carcinoma).
