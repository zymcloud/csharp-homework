Background:Men are 4 to 8 times more likely to develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than women. Preclinical models have suggested a role for sex hormones in the development of HCC. In the current study, the authors investigated the impact of age, sex, race, and ethnicity on the survival of patients with HCC using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.Methods:Patients diagnosed with HCC from 1988 through 2010 were identified from the SEER registry. Hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival (OS) were derived using the Cox regression model adjusted for race, year of diagnosis, marital status, treatment, birthplace, tumor differentiation, and tumor size.Results:A total of 39,345 patients were identified; 76% were men and 34% were women (50% white, 12% African American, 21% Asian, 16% Hispanic, and 1% Native American). The median age at the time of diagnosis was 61 years for men and 67 years for women. Approximately 84% of patients had liver-limited disease and 16% had metastatic disease. Treatment information was available for patients diagnosed after 1998 (34,674 patients): 11% received liver-directed therapy, 11% underwent surgical resection, and 7% underwent liver transplantation. The HR for the OS of women versus men was 0.83 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.77-0.88) for patients aged 65 years.Conclusions:Sex appears to be associated with survival in patients with HCC. The role of androgens and estrogens in the development and progression of HCC warrants further investigation.
