Introduction:There is controversy regarding the role of yttrium-90 (90Y) radioembolization in the management of advanced, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Forty-five consecutive patients underwent resin-based 90Y radioembolization for unresectable, HCC between 2006 and 2013 in Sydney, Australia. All patients were followed up with imaging studies at regular intervals until death. Radiologic response was evaluated with the Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Clinical toxicities were prospectively recorded. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and potential prognostic variables were identified on univariate and multivariate analysis.Results:Follow-up in the complete cohort was 7.8 (range, 0.1-41.8) months. The median survival after 90Y radioembolization was 27.7 months with a 36-month survival of 26%. By RECIST criteria of the 40 patients followed-up beyond 2 months, a complete response (CR) to treatment was observed in 1 patients (3%), partial response (PR) in 18 (45%), stable disease (SD) in 11 (22%) and progressive disease (PD) in 10 (25%). On multivariate analysis only radiological response to treatment was independently associated with improved survival: CR/PR to treatment vs. SD vs. PD; p Conclusion:Radioembolization with 90Y is a safe and effective treatment for unresectable HCC.
