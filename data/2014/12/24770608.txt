Purpose:To evaluate the feasibility and technical aspects of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for non-resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using a 3.5-French (Fr) catheter system.Methods:This study included 328 consecutive cases of HCC among 232 patients who underwent TACE procedures using both a 3.5-Fr catheter system and a microcatheter fitted to a 3.5-Fr system between April 2009 and November 2011. We assessed the ability to reach the catheter into the proper hepatic artery (PHA), main hepatic branch, segmental artery, and subsegmental or sub-subsegmental artery. The feasibility was rated according to the following factors: (1) the number of arteries that could be used to reach the target artery/total number of procedures using the 3.5-Fr system, (2) the rate of successful completion of the procedures without changing over to the 4-Fr system and (3) the reasons for changing over the 4-Fr system.Results:TACE of the PHA (27 sessions), RHA/LHA (103 sessions), segmental (31 sessions), or subsegmental/sub-subsegmental arteries (162 sessions) was performed. The rate of successfully reaching the target artery using the 3.5-Fr system was 93% (306/328 sessions). We were unable to reach the target artery in 22 sessions, including 11/8/3 procedures targeting the sub-subsegmental artery, subsegmental artery, and RHA/LHA, respectively. We changed over to the 4-Fr system in six sessions; therefore, the rate of successful completion of the procedures without changing over to the 4-Fr system was 98% (322/328 sessions).Conclusions:TACE of the target artery can be successfully performed using the 3.5-Fr system in most patients with HCC.
