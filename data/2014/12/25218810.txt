The most common type of liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), affects over 500,000 people in the world. In the present study, liver tumor resections were used to prepare tissue arrays to examine the intensity of fluorescence of IHC stained stem cell markers in liver tissue from malignant HCC tumors and accompanying surrounding non-tumor liver. We hypothesized that a correlation exists between the fluorescence intensity of IHC stained HCC and surrounding non-tumor liver compared to liver tissue from a completely normal liver. 120 liver resection specimens (including four normal controls) were placed on a single slide to make a tissue array. They were examined by digitally quantifying the intensity of fluorescence using immuno-histochemically stained stem cell markers and protein quality control proteins. The stem cell markers were OCT3/4, Nanog, CD133, pEZH2, CD49F and SOX2. The protein quality control proteins were FAT10, UBA-6 and ubiquitin. The data collected was used to compare normal liver tissue with HCCs and parent liver tissue resected surgically using antibodies to stem cell markers and quality control protein markers. The measurements of the stem cell marker CD133 indicated an increase of fluorescence intensity for both the parent liver tissue and the HCC liver tissues. The other stem cell markers changed as follows: Nanog and OCT3/4 were decreased in both the HCCs and the parent livers; PEZH2 was reduced in the HCCs; SOX2 was increased in the parent livers compared to the controls; and CD49f was decreased in HCCs only. Protein quality control markers FAT10 and ubiquitin were downregulated in both the HCCs and the adjacent non-tumor tissue compared to the controls. UBA6 was increased in both the HCCs and the parent livers, and the levels were higher in the HCCs compared to the parent livers.
