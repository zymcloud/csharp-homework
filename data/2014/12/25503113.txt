Palliative therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) include transcatheter arterial embolic therapies, radiation therapy and systemic chemotherapies such as sorafenib. Conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (cTACE) is the golden standard for the treatment of intermediate-stage HCC, and involves the administration of chemotherapuetic drugs, with or without lipiodol, by means of a catheter directly to the feeding artery of the targeted tumor followed by administration of embolic agents, while the concept of drug-eluting bead TACE (DEB-TACE) builds on the rationale for cTACE. DEB-TACE has been demonstrated to substantially improve the pharmacokinetic profile of TACE, providing levels of consistency and repeatability in patients that are not available with cTACE. On the other hand, the technique of radioembolization therapy for HCC involves the delivery of high-dose radiation via the hepatic artery. In the present review, we summarize the current status of these transcatheter arterial embolic therapies in HCC.
