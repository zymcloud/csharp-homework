A 77-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma was admitted to our institution. Computed tomography revealed two nodules, one at the surface and one within the liver, â‰¤3 cm in diameter. We performed laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation using a bipolar system with a "no-touch ablation" procedure using multiple applicators for insertion, not into the tumor directly, but to the perimeter of the tumor. A sufficient ablated area was obtained regardless of tumor location. No operative complications were encountered and adequate therapeutic effect was achieved safely. Laparoscopic multipolar radiofrequency ablation is a feasible procedure for treating hepatocellular carcinoma.
