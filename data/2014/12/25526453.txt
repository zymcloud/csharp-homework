The number of elderly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is expected to rise. We analyzed the impact of age on clinical presentations, treatment allocation, and long-term survival between elderly (â‰¥75 years) and younger (0.05). Among the elderly, the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score provided the lowest Akaike information criterion value. In conclusion, advanced age is not associated with inferior treatment result in HCC patients receiving different therapeutic modalities. Elderly HCC patients should be encouraged for active treatment when indicated. The CLIP is an optimal prognostic model for outcome assessment.
