Objective:The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the diagnosis efficacy of plasma interleukin 17 (IL-17) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Thirty-nine patients with confirmed HCC and 41 healthy controls were retrospectively analyzed in this study. The serum level of IL-17 was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. And the plasma level of carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) were arrayed by radioimmunoassay. The plasma level of IL-17, CEA and AFP between HCC and healthy control group were compared. And the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for IL-17, CEA and AFP in patients with HCC was calculated using the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software.Results:The plasma level of IL-17, CEA and AFP were 2.88 ± 1.75 (ng/L), 2.99 ± 2.12 (μg/L) and 6.91 ± 4.56 (mg/L) in healthy control group and 5.57 ± 1.59 (ng/L), 8.31 ± 5.40 (μg/L) and 190.50 ± 79.08 (mg/L) in HCC group. Plasma level of IL-17, CEA and AFP in HCC group was statistical higher than in healthy control group (all P Conclusion:Plasma IL-17 was significant elevated in patients with HCC compared to healthy control group which could be a potential biomarker for diagnosis of HCC.
