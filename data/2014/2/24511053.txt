Background:The prognosis of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poor despite treatment with sorafenib or other anti-angiogenic targeted-therapies. Patients with advanced HCC with prolonged survival may exhibit unique clinical characteristics.Patients and methods:We reviewed patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C HCC, who were enrolled in six clinical trials for first-line anti-angiogenic targeted-therapy between May 2005 and December 2010 in a single Institute. Patients with prolonged survival were identified as those who exhibited overall survival (OS) of more than two years; their clinical variables were analyzed.Results:Of the 189 enrolled patients, 22 (11.6%) patients with prolonged survival were identified. Their median OS was 58.7 (range=24.6-88.4) months, compared to an OS of 7.1 months for the overall patient cohort. A multivariate analysis showed that the patients with prolonged survival were less likely to have chronic hepatitis B virus infection, Î±-fetoprotein level >400 ng/ml, and liver involvement than were the remaining patients. In addition, the patients with prolonged survival experienced significantly higher response rates (50.0%) and disease control rates (86.4%) to the first-line targeted-therapy, and received more additional therapies than did the other patients. Seven patients remained disease-free for a median of 27.0 (range, 4.5-64.6) months after receiving additional locoregional therapies.Conclusion:Patients with advanced HCC who experienced prolonged survival exhibited certain clinical features and strong treatment responses to first-line anti-angiogenic targeted-therapies. Additional locoregional therapies could contribute to the long-term disease-free status in selected patients.
