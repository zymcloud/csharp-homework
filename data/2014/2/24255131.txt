Aberrant sialylation is closely associated with malignant phenotypes of tumor cells, including invasiveness and metastasis. This study investigated sialylation with regard to the modification of invasive properties and chemosensitivity in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and the association between the sialyltransferase gene family and clinicopathological characteristics in HCC patients. Using mass spectrometry analysis, we found that the composition profiling of sialylated N-glycans differed between MHCC97H and MHCC97L cells with different metastatic potential. The expressional profiles of 20 sialyltransferase genes showed differential expression in two cell lines, transitional and tumor tissues, from the same patients. Two genes, ST6GAL1 and ST8SIA2, were detected as overexpressed in MHCC97H and MHCC97L cells. The altered expression levels of ST6GAL1 and ST8SIA2 corresponded to a changed invasive phenotype and chemosensitivity of MHCC97H and MHCC97L cells both in vitro and in vivo. Further data indicated that manipulation of the expression of the two genes led to altered activity of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway. Targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway by its specific inhibitor wortmannin or by Akt RNA interference resulted in a reduced capacity for invasion and chemoresistance of MHCC97H cells. Our results imply that sialylation may function as an internal factor, regulating the invasion and chemosensitivity of HCC, probably through ST6GAL1 or ST8SIA2 regulation of the activity of the PI3K/Akt pathway.
