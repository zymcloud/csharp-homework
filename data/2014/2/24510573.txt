Objective:To assess the association of rs9272346 polymorphism of HLA-DQA1 gene with clinical outcome of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in ethnic Han population from Hubei, China.Methods:A case-control study was conducted, which have involved 1028 unrelated subjects including 238 asymptomatic HBV carriers (AHC), 173 acute liver failure (ALF), 292 liver cirrhosis (LC) and 325 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Genotypes of rs9272346 were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction with a TaqMan MGB probe. Statistical results were analyzed using Chi square test, student's t test and unconditional logistic regression.Results:No significant differences were detected in the frequencies of G allele between ALF, LC, HCC and AHC groups (P= 0.312, 0.314, 0.264). Compared with the AA genotype, the GG and GA genotypes were not associated with the patients groups under the dominant model: ALF group vs. AHC group (adjusted OR= 1.08, 95%CI: 0.7-1.68), LC group vs. AHC group (adjusted OR= 1.11, 95%CI: 0.87-1.26), HCC group vs. AHC group (adjusted OR= 0.93, 95%CI: 0.65-1.33). For women, the GG and GA genotypes have conferred a protective effect for the outcome of ALF (OR= 0.30, 95%CI: 0.1-1.87).Conclusion:Our results suggested that rs9272346 polymorphism of HLA-DQA1 may not independently influence the outcome of HBV infection in ethnic Han Chinese in Hubei, while the GG and GA genotypes may confer a protective effect against ALF in women.
