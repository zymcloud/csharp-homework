Purpose:The aim of the present study was to investigate the technical feasibility of flat-panel cone-beam CT (CBCT)-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of very small (Materials and methods:Patients included were candidates for hepatic percutaneous RFA as they had single biopsy-proven hepatic tumors sized â‰¤ 1.5 cm and poorly defined on ultrasonography. Following apnea induction, unenhanced CBCT scans were acquired and used to deploy the RF electrode with the aid of a virtual navigation system. If the tumor was not clearly identified on the unenhanced CBCT scan, a right retrograde arterial femoral access was established to carry out hepatic angiography and localize the tumor. Patients' lesions and procedural variables were recorded and analyzed.Results:Three patients (2 male and 1 female), aged 68, 76, and 87 years were included; 3 lesions (2 hepato-cellular carcinoma and 1 metastasis from colorectal cancer) were treated. One patient required hepatic angiography. Cycles of apnea used to acquire CBCT images and to deploy the electrode lasted Conclusion:Percutaneous CBCT-guided liver RFA with or without arterial hepatic angiography is technically feasible.
