Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in the world. Ubiquitin-proteasome system has been shown to play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of HCC and other malignancies. UBE2Q1 is a putative E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, and may be involved in the regulation of cancer-related proteins. In this study, we investigated the expression pattern of UBE2Q1 in HCC cell lines and human HCC specimens, and its potential clinical and biological significance in HCC. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that UBE2Q1 was significantly upregulated in HCC tumorous tissues compared with the adjacent noncancerous ones. Next, univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed to determine the prognostic significance of UBE2Q1 in HCC. The results showed that upregulated expression of UBE2Q1 was positively correlated with high histological grades of HCC and predicted poor prognosis. In addition, the expression of UBE2Q1 was progressively increased in serum-refed HCC cells. UBE2Q1 depletion by small interfering RNA inhibited cell proliferation and led to G1 phase arrest in HepG2 and BEL-7404 cells. Furthermore, we showed that cells transfected with UBE2Q1-targeting siRNA resulted in significant increase in the levels of p53, p21 in HepG2 and BEL-7404 cells. These data imply that UBE2Q1 is upregulated in liver cancer cell lines and tumorous samples and may play a role in the development of HCC.
