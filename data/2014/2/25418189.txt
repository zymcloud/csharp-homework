The time to complete or partial (objective) response to radiotherapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is variable; thus, the reported frequency of these responses depends on the length of follow-up. However, the optimum follow-up duration is unknown. We sought to determine the optimal follow-up duration by analyzing the medical records of 25 patients with 39 HCC lesions who received definitive helical tomotherapy at a daily dose of 2 to 4 Gy at 5 fractions per week, for a total dose of 40 to 60 Gy, between January 2008 and January 2013. We determined the time to objective treatment response and local recurrence after radiotherapy and assessed several predictors of delayed treatment response. The median follow-up duration was 15.2 months (range, 7.8 to 52.1 months). Among all 39 lesions, objective responses were observed for 36 (92.3%). The median time to objective response was 3.9 months (range, 1.5 to 9.8 months). The objective response rates increased over time from 15.4% at 3 months to 71.8% at 6 months and 87.2% at 9 months. Age 60 years old or older and post-radiotherapy Î±-fetoprotein concentrations higher than pre-radiotherapy concentrations predicted delayed treatment response. The objective response rate continued to increase over 9 months. Therefore, to fully evaluate the treatment response of HCC, we recommend continuous observation for at least 9 months after radiotherapy.
