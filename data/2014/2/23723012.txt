Purpose:To determine if intra-voxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) parameters, including free molecular-based (D) and perfusion-related (D*, f) diffusion parameters, correlate with the degree of tumor necrosis and viable tumor in colo-rectal cancer (CRC) metastasis.Materials and methods:Fifteen patients referred for resection of liver metastases from CRC were retrospectively included in this Institutional Review Board approved study. An IVIM-DWI sequence was performed on a 1.5 Tesla MR imaging system, with 10 b factors (0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 80, 100, 200, 400 and 800 s/mm(2) ). Mean D, D*, f and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were determined in metastases with a longest diameter above 10 mm. Correlations between the diffusion parameters and the degree of liver tumor necrosis and viable tissue were determined (Spearman).Results:Correlation between diffusion parameters and histopathological findings was performed in 35 hepatic metastases with a diameter of more than 10 mm (mean size of 17.9 mm; range, 1-68 mm). Both D (r = 0.36; P = 0.035) and ADC (r = 0.4; P = 0.02) correlated with the degree of tumor necrosis but not with viable tumor.Conclusion:ADC variation observed in CRC metastases following systemic chemotherapy reflects a specific increase in free-molecular diffusion (D), in itself correlated to the degree of metastasis necrosis.
