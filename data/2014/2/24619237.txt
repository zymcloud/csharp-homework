Objective:To evaluate the effect of Bear Bile Powder(, BBP) on the growth and apoptosis of HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and investigate the possible molecular mechanisms mediating its anti-cancer activity.Methods:HepG2 cells were treated with 0.4-1.0 mg/mL of BBP for 24, 48 and 72 h. The viability of HePG2 cells was determined by MTT assay. Cellular morphology was observed via phase-contrast microscopy. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis with Annexin-V/propidium idodide and 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethyl-benzimidazol-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1) staining was performed to determine cell apoptosis and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, respectively. Activation of caspase-9 and -3 was evaluated by a colorimetric assay.Results:The treatment with 0.4-1 mg/mL of BBP for 24, 48, or 72 h respectively reduced cell viability significantly by 7%-60%, 20%-90% or 25%-98%, compared with the untreated control cells (PConclusions:BBP could inhibit the growth of HepG2 hepatocellular cancer cells through mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis, which may, in part, explain its anti-cancer activity. BBP may be a potential novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
