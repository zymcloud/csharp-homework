Background and objectives:Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is simple, inexpensive, and has been proposed to be predictive in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Europe and Asia. We aimed to evaluate whether NLR at presentation in a Western center provides any prognostic value compared to other common prognostic scores.Methods:NLR was calculated for 75 consecutive patients at presentation with HCC and regression models were used to analyze its value for predicting treatment strategy and short-term survival with Child-Pugh and Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD).Results:NLR was not predictive of future treatment regimens with hepatectomy, liver transplant, or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE; odds ratio [OR]: 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71-1.02, P = 0.079) as compared the predictive value of MELD (OR: 0.81, CI: 0.72-0.93, P = 0.002) or Child-Pugh (OR: 0.48, CI: 0.34-0.69, P Conclusions:This study does not support the prognostic value of NLR to guide therapy for HCC in a Western center, whereas MELD and Child-Pugh score were more predictive.
