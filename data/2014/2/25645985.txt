The role of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) prior to curative therapy is still unclear. The aim of our study was to elucidate the survival of single hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and also to clarify whether TACE plus sequential curative therapy provides benefits in single HCC. A total of 470 patients with a diagnosis of single HCC between 2005 and 2010 were studied. The factors associated with clinical outcomes were analyzed. The outcomes between patients who underwent neoadjuvant TACE and those who did not were also compared. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of all patients were 92.6%, 73.3%, and 59.6%, respectively. Child-Pugh class A [HR: 2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.277-3.254, p = 0.003], very early stage Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) (HR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.021-4.025, p = 0.043), tumor size
