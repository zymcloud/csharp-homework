Background & aims:We aimed to assess the association between the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing-3 (PNPLA3) I148M polymorphism, liver histology and long-term outcome in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients.Methods:We enrolled 531 consecutive treatment na√Øve CHB patients diagnosed from 1985 to 2012 with an available liver biopsy for reassessment, and sample for genetic testing. Data on all-cause mortality and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at long-term follow-up were obtained from national database registries.Results:The prevalence of steatohepatitis increased with PNPLA3 CC (14%), CG (20%) and GG (43%) (P Conclusions:In this cohort of biopsied CHB patients, PNPLA3 was independently associated with steatosis, steatohepatitis, lobular inflammation and iron depositions, but not with advanced fibrosis, HCC development or all-cause mortality. The effect of PNPLA3 on steatohepatitis was particularly pronounced among female patients without severe overweight.
