Background:Gender disparity is well known in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). SRY is a critical sex-determination gene involved in embryonic development.Aim:The potential relevance of SRY to HCC progression was evaluated.Methods:SRY expression in HCC cell lines and tissues was evaluated. Invasion and wound healing assays were used to evaluate the role of SRY in HCC cell migration. The prognostic value of SRY for HCC patient survival was evaluated.Results:SRY was highly expressed in HCC cell lines and tumor tissues. Downregulation of SRY expression decreased migration and invasion potential of HCC cells. High SRY levels correlated with poor HCC patient survival. Additionally, neither spatial position nor expression intensity of SRY was correlated with HCC gender disparity.Conclusions:High levels of SRY expression correlated with cancer progression and poor HCC patient survival. However, high SRY levels are not significantly correlated with HCC sex bias.
