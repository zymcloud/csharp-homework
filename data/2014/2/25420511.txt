When assessing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it is important to examine prognostic factors in the background normal liver tissue and consider malignant aspects of the primary lesion. Candidate genes were extracted from the background normal liver samples via multiarray analysis. Control samples, termed supernormal (SN) liver, were obtained from 11 cases of metastatic liver cancer. Corresponding normal (CN) liver tissue was surgically obtained from a typical HCC patient with chronic hepatitis C background for comparison. Expression profile and methylation array demonstrated that Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene expression was increased by 2.378‑fold in the CN tissue. Methylation array reported a lower value for CN (0.125) than SN tissues (0.748). We then investigated JAK2 expression by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in 100 consecutive resected HCC cases. The average expression level of JAK2 (normalized to GAPDH) was significantly lower in CN (9.24±6.43, n=100) than in SN (35.21 ± 21.38, n=11) tissues (P
