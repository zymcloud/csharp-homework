Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has been described in the context of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. The influence of LVH on survival of liver transplant (LT) recipients has not been clarified. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of LVH on survival in LT recipients. In total, data from 352 LT patients were analyzed. LVH was diagnosed by echocardiographic measurement of left ventricular wall thickness before LT. Patients were followed up for a mean of 4.2 yr. LVH was diagnosed in 135 (38.4%) patients. Patients with LVH had significantly more frequently male gender (p = 0.046), diastolic dysfunction (p Conclusion:LVH is frequently diagnosed in patients on the waiting list and influences survival after LT.
