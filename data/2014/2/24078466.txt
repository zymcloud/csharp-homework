Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Such deaths are due, in large part, to its propensity to metastasize. We have examined the effect of alternol on human HCC cells and the underlying molecular mechanism. Therapeutic effects of alternol on cancer cell migration and invasion were analyzed with Boyden chamber and wound healing assays. Effects of alternol on the levels of various proteins involved in cancer cell migration and invasion were determined with gelatin zymography, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting. As shown, treatment with alternol has resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of cell migration and invasion of HepG2 cells. The inhibition of HCC invasion by alternol was associated with the suppression of MMP-9 expression and reversal of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The above results indicated that alternol has the ability to inhibit the migration and invasion of human HCC cells by reversing the process of EMT, suggesting that alternol may be developed as an alternative drug for the treatment of HCC.
