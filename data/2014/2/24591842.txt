Purpose:Celecoxib, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), was investigated for enhancement of chemotherapeutic efficacy in cancer clinical trials. This study aimed to determine whether celecoxib combined with 5-fluorouracil or sorafenib or gefitinib is beneficial in HepG2 multicellular spheroids (MCSs), as well as elucidate the underlying mechanisms.Methods:The human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 MCSs were used as in vitro models to investigate the effects of celecoxib combined with 5-fluorouracil or sorafenib or gefitinib treatment on cell growth, apoptosis, and signaling pathway.Results:MCSs showed resistance to drugs compared with monolayer cells. Celecoxib combined with 5-fluorouracil or sorafenib exhibited a synergistic action. Exposure to celecoxib (21.8 μmol/L) plus 5-fluorouracil (8.1 × 10(-3) g/L) or sorafenib (4.4 μmol/L) increased apoptosis but exerted no effect on COX2, phosphorylated epidermal growth-factor receptor (p-EGFR) and phosphorylated (p)-AKT expression. Gefitinib (5 μmol/L), which exhibits no growth-inhibition activity as a single agent, increased the inhibitory effect of celecoxib. Gefitinib (5 μmol/L) plus celecoxib (21.8 μmol/L) increased apoptosis. COX2, p-EGFR, and p-AKT were inhibited.Conclusion:Celecoxib combined with 5-fluorouracil or sorafenib or gefitinib may be superior to single-agent therapy in HepG2 MCSs. Our results provided molecular evidence to support celecoxib combination-treatment strategies for patients with human hepatocellular carcinoma. MCSs provided a good model to evaluate the interaction of anticancer drugs.
