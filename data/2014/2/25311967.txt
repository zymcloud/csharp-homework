Purpose:To present in vitro loading and release characteristics of idarubicin with ONCOZENE (CeloNova BioSciences, Inc, San Antonio, Texas) drug-eluting embolic (DEE) agents and in vivo pharmacokinetics data after transarterial chemoembolization with idarubicin-loaded ONCOZENE DEE agents in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.Materials and methods:Loading efficacy of idarubicin with ONCOZENE DEE agents 100 µm and DC Bead (Biocompatibles UK Ltd, Farnham, United Kingdom) DEE agents 100-300 µm was monitored at 10, 20, and 30 minutes loading time by high-pressure liquid chromatography. A T-apparatus was used to monitor the release of idarubicin from the two types of DEE agents over 12 hours. Clinical and 24-hour pharmacokinetics data were recorded after transarterial chemoembolization with idarubicin-loaded ONCOZENE DEE agents in four patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.Results:Idarubicin loading in ONCOZENE DEE agents was > 99% at 10 minutes. Time to reach 75% of the release plateau level was 37 minutes ± 6 for DC Bead DEE agents and 170 minutes ± 19 for ONCOZENE DEE agents both loaded with idarubicin 10 mg/mL. After transarterial chemoembolization with idarubicin-loaded ONCOZENE DEE agents, three partial responses and one complete response were observed with only two asymptomatic grade 3 biologic adverse events. Median time to maximum concentration for idarubicin in patients was 10 minutes, and mean maximum concentration was 4.9 µg/L ± 1.7. Mean area under the concentration-time curve from 0-24 hours was equal to 29.5 µg.h/L ± 20.5.Conclusions:ONCOZENE DEE agents show promising results with very fast loading ability, a favorable in vivo pharmacokinetics profile with a sustained release of idarubicin during the first 24 hours, and encouraging safety and responses. Histopathologic and clinical studies are needed to evaluate idarubicin release around the DEE agents in tumor tissue and to confirm safety and efficacy.
