Purpose:In patients undergoing transarterial radioembolization (RE) of malignant liver tumors, hepatopulmonary shunts (HPS) can lead to nontarget irradiation of the lungs. This study aims at analyzing the HPS fraction in relation to liver volume, tumor volume, tumor-to-liver volume ratio, tumor vascularity, type of tumor, and portal vein occlusion.Materials and methods:In the presented retrospective study the percentage HPS fraction was calculated from SPECT/CT after infusion of Tc-99m macroaggregated albumin (Tc-99m MAA) into the proper hepatic artery of 233 patients evaluated for RE.Results:HPS fractions correlate very weakly with liver volume (r=0.303), tumor volume (r=0.345), and tumor-to-liver volume ratio (r=0.340). Tumors with strong contrast enhancement (HPSmedian(range)=11.7%(46.3%); n=73) have significantly larger shunt fractions than tumors with little enhancement (HPS=8.3%(16.4%); n=61; pConclusion:The degree of hepatopulmonary shunting depends on the type of liver tumor, tumor vascularity, and portal vein perfusion. There is little to no correlation of HPS with liver volume, tumor volume, or tumor-to-liver volume ratio.
