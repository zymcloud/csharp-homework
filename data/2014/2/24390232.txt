The X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) gene, one of over 20 genes that participate in the base excision repair pathway, is thought to account for differences in susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma. To assess the relationship between the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we performed a meta-analysis. All the relevant studies were extracted from PubMed, Embase, the Chinese biomedicine databases, the Chinese national knowledge infrastructure, and the Wanfang databases (prior to August 2012). The meta-analysis was performed using all eligible studies, which covered a total of 2,554 cases and 3,320 controls, to examine the association between XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism and the risk of HCC. Our analysis suggested that the variant genotypes of the XRCC1 Arg399Gln gene were associated with a significantly increased risk of HCC in a co-dominant model (Arg/Gln vs. Arg/Arg, odd ratios [OR] 1.39, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.79; Gln/Gln vs. Arg/Arg, OR 1.26, 95 % CI 1.04-1.52) and a dominant model (Arg/Gln + Gln/Gln vs. Arg/Arg OR 1.36, 95 % CI 1.07-1.72), whereas no association was observed in the recessive model (Gln/Gln vs. Arg/Gln + Arg/Arg, OR 1.05, 95 % CI 0.91-1.21). The results of the subgroup analysis by ethnicity indicated that the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism was associated with increased risk of HCC in Asian populations using the co-dominant model (Arg/Gln vs. Arg/Arg, OR 1.41, 95 % CI 1.06-1.87) and the dominant model (Gln/Gln vs. Arg/Gln + Arg/Arg, OR 1.35, 95 % CI 1.03-1.76). Our analysis provides evidence that the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism may be associated with a higher risk of HCC, especially among Asian populations.
