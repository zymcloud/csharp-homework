Background and aim:The inclusion criteria for liver transplantation (LT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are being expanded, and the Hangzhou criteria are the most accepted criteria in China. The aim of our study was to evaluate the Hangzhou criteria for LT in HCC with respect to the Milan criteria.Methods:We retrospectively collected data of 298 cases of LT in HCC in our center from August 2000 to December 2010, and then divided these patients into three groups according to the tumor characteristics: the Milan criteria group (n=97), the Hangzhou criteria group (n=172), and the out of Hangzhou criteria group (n=126). We compared the baseline characteristics and outcome of these three groups of patients.Results:Baseline patient characteristics showed no significant difference among the three groups, except for younger age in the out of Hangzhou group (PConclusion:Although the Hangzhou criteria lead to lower overall survival and tumor-free survival rates compared with the Milan criteria, the Hangzhou criteria indicate more HCC patients for LT and are associated with a considerable long-term outcome. The Hangzhou criteria should be accepted as the inclusion criteria for LT in HCC.
