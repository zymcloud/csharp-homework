Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease-1 (APE-1) is a key enzyme responsible for DNA base excision repair and is also a multifunctional protein such as redox effector for several transcriptional factors. Our study was designed to investigate APE-1 expression and to study its interaction with cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression and VEGF production in the esophageal cancer. The expression of APE-1, COX-2, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, CC-chemokine receptor (CCR)2, and VEGF were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 65 human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues. Real-time PCR and Western blotting were performed to detect mRNA and protein expression of APE-1 and p-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) expression in MCP-1-stimulated ESCC cell lines (KYSE 220 and EC-GI-10). siRNA for APE-1 was treated to determine the role of APE-1 in the regulation of COX-2 expression, VEGF production, and antiapoptotic effect against cisplatin. In human ESCC tissues, nuclear localization of APE-1 was observed in 92.3% (60/65) of all tissues. There was a significant relationship (P = 0.029, R = 0.49) between nuclear APE-1 and cytoplasmic COX-2 expression levels in the esophageal cancer tissues. In KYSE 220 and EC-GI-10 cells, MCP-1 stimulation significantly increased mRNA and protein expression of APE-1. Treatment with siRNA for APE-1 significantly inhibited p-STAT3 expression levels in MCP-1-stimulated cells. Furthermore, treatment of siRNA for APE-1 significantly reduced COX-2 expression and VEGF production in MCP-1-stimulated esophageal cancer cell lines. Treatment with APE-1 siRNA significantly increased apoptotic levels in cisplatin-incubated KYSE 220 and EC-GI-10 cells. We concluded that APE-1 is overexpressed and associated with COX-2 expression and VEGF production in esophageal cancer tissues.
