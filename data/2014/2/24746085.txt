Objective:To explore the surveillance and diagnostic values of ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-ups in malignant transformation of cirrhotic nodules so as to improve the diagnostic accuracy of early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with liver cirrhosis.Methods:Retrospective analyses were conducted for US, CT and MRI features of 96 HCC patients confirmed by pathological examination or treatment.Results:All patients (145 lesions) underwent US, CT, MRI examinations during follow-ups.US detected 62 lesions (42.6%) and 90 lesions on enhanced CT (62.1%) presented "fast-in fast-out" enhancement, pseudocapsule, progressive enlargement or increasing numbers in a short time. And 138 nodules on MRI (95.2%) manifested as decreased T1WI signal, increased T2WI and DWI signal, "nodule in nodule" on T2WI, fatty degeneration, change of enhancement patterns, pseudocapsule, progressive enlargement or increased number in a short time.Conclusion:MRI offers obvious advantages over CT and US (P
