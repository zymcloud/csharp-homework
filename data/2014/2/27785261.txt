Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent cancers which are found in many Asian and African countries. There are several risk factors that may develop to HCC. Along with several other factors contributing to HCC, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection also accounts for a major cause. HBV infection represents a major health problem worldwide. Among all of HBV genes, HBx is believed to play a prominent role in carcinogenesis, although the actual mechanism is not yet fully understood. The HBx gene of HBV is the most common open reading frame that may undergo mutations and may develop into HCC. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the most important roles of HBx gene that may lead to the development of HCC.
