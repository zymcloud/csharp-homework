Background:The reported treatment outcomes of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-CC) are inconsistent and the clinicopathological factors influencing treatment outcome remain to be defined.Patients and methods:Patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC-CC undergoing surgical treatment at our institution between January 1997 and September 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to identify independent clinicopathological factors affecting surgical outcome.Results:A total of 390 patients with HBV-related HCC-CC were included in this study; there were 328 men and 62 women, with a median age of 49 years (range 21-77 years). Among these patients, 74.4% had underlying liver cirrhosis. The median tumor size was 6.5 cm (range 1.3-33 cm) with 68.7% microvascular invasion and 12.3% lymphatic metastasis. The median survival after surgical resection was 1.68 years and the cumulative survival at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years was 62.1, 46.4, 32, and 25.5%, respectively. The disease-free survival at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years was 36.1, 22.3, 15, and 11.3%, respectively. Independent predictors for decreased survival were male sex, tumor number (≥2), major thrombus, microvascular thrombus, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) over 60 U/l, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level. Independent negative factors affecting disease-free survival included tumor size (>5 cm), major thrombus, and GGT over 60 U/l.Conclusion:Long-term surgical survival of HBV-related HCC-CC seemed to be influenced by sex, tumor-related factors (tumor number, major thrombus, and microvascular thrombus), serum GGT, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level. Tumor size, major thrombus, and serum GGT level tended to be associated with disease-free survival.
