{2-[1-(3-Methoxycarbonylmethyl-1H-indol-2-yl)-1-methyl-ethyl]-1H-indol-3-yl}-acetic acid methyl ester (MIAM) is a novel indole compound. Our previous studies showed that MIAM possessed activity against many cancers xenografted in mice without significant toxicity. In this study, we determined the effect of MIAM on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by both in vitro and in vivo assays. In in vitro assay, the experiments were performed in the hypoxic incubator. MIAM inhibited HCC growth with dose-dependent manner. The effects of MIAM on HCC might be due to its activities in induction of apoptosis, arrest of cell cycle in G0/G1 phase. Further studies showed that MIAM might exert its actions through multiple mechanisms. MIAM could reduce intracellular ATP, increase levels of p53/p21 and SIRT3/SOD2/Bax. MIAM also had the activity of reducing HIF1Î± and hexokinase II (HK II) in HCC. MIAM had the activity of increasing cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HCC. However, the increase of ROS might not be its main mechanism in inhibition of HCC. MIAM might inhibit HepG2 growth through induction of apoptosis. We determined the relationship between level of SIRT3 and cell viability in the MIAM-treated cells. MIAM treatment resulted in increase of SIRT3 in HCC. Further, HepG2 cells infected with human SIRT3 were more sensitive to MIAM than the cells without infection of SIRT3. These results suggested that MIAM might inhibit HCC growth through upregulation of SIRT3. Importantly, the effect of MIAM was confirmed in the HepG2 xenografts bearing in mice. MIAM treatment did not induce significant toxicology to mice. Together, MIAM could be developed as potential agent for treatment of HCC.
