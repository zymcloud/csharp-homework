A 58-year-old man had undergone laparoscopic radical nephrectomy for right renal cell carcinoma. The histopathological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma, grade 2ï¼ž3, pT1b. Two years and 10 months postoperatively, computed tomography scans demonstrated an enhanced mass on the right adrenal gland. As we could not detect other metastatic lesions, it was diagnosed as solitary adrenal metastasis of renal cell carcinoma. Albeit metastasectomy was planned with curative intent, right hemihepatectomy was also required for surgical removal because the tumor was adherent to the right lobe of the liver broadly and had indistinct margins. So we started neoadjuvant therapy with sunitinib. Eight courses of treatment shrunk the metastatic tumor enough to allow it to be removed completely without partial hepatectomy. Neoadjuvant therapy with the molecular targeted drugs may provide an effective option for metastasectomy in renal cell carcinoma regarding increased curability and decreased the risk of an operation.
