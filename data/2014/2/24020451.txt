A detailed comparative study on chemical and bioactive properties of wild and cultivated Ganoderma lucidum from Serbia (GS) and China (GCN) was performed. This species was chosen because of its worldwide use as medicinal mushroom. Higher amounts of sugars were found in GS, while higher amounts of organic acids were recorded in GCN. Unsaturated fatty acids predominated over saturated fatty acids. GCN revealed higher antioxidant activity, while GS exhibited inhibitory potential against human breast and cervical carcinoma cell lines. No cytotoxicity in non-tumour liver primary cell culture was observed for the different samples. Both samples possessed antibacterial and antifungal activities, in some cases even better than the standard antimicrobial drugs. This is the first study reporting a comparison of chemical compounds and bioactivity of G. lucidum samples from different origins.
