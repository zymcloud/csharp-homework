We report for the first time that Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-2-like 1 (RACK1) formed a complex with Annexin A7. Hca-F and Hca-P are a pair of syngeneic mouse hepatocarcinoma cell lines established and maintained in our laboratory. Our previous study showed that both Annexin A7 and RACK1 were expressed higher in Hca-F (lymph node metastasis >70%) than Hca-P (lymph node metastasis
Annexin A7 (ANXA7); Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-2-like 1 (Gnb2l1); Lymph node metastasis (LNM); Receptor of activated protein kinase C 1 (RACK1).
