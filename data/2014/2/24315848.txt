Background:The objective of this study was to assess trends in overall and in stage-specific 5-year relative survival rates of the Czech cancer patients between periods 2000-2004 and 2005-2008.Methods:All Czech cancer patients diagnosed between 1995 and 2008 were included in the analysis. Period analysis was employed to calculate 5-year relative survival for 21 cancers.Results:Significant improvements in crude 5-year relative survival for 14 of 21 assessed types of cancer, including the most frequent diagnoses, such as, colorectal, prostate, breast, lung, kidney, pancreatic, and bladder cancer and melanoma, were identified. Moreover, in case of colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer, improvement in stage-specific 5-year relative survival was confirmed as statistically significant for all clinical stages. No diagnosis showed significant decrease in the 5-year relative survival. However, the 5-year relative survival remained poor in patients with metastatic cancers at diagnosis, particularly in case of liver, pancreatic, lung, and oesophageal cancer.Conclusions:The cancer-specific outcomes in the Czech Republic are improving. Nevertheless, despite the overall significant improvement in 5-year relative survival of most of the cancer diagnoses, the high proportion of patients primarily diagnosed with metastatic cancer still represents a substantial challenge for prevention and early detection.
