In recent years, various treatment options have become available for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) according to the degree of background liver damage, tumor diameter and other factors associated with disease progression. Therapy has also shifted toward evidence-based treatment. Policies for the management of HCC with portal vein tumor thrombus, which has been considered an intractable condition, have not been established. Surgical resection was previously positioned as the treatment of choice, but the outcomes after resection alone were found to be disappointing. At present, multiple interdisciplinary treatments, combining resection with intra-arterial chemotherapy, radiotherapy, systemic chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy, are used on a trial-and-error basis since no standard regimens have been developed. Clinical trials of surgery combined with transarterial chemoembolization, hepatic arterial infusion of chemotherapy and radiation have obtained improved 5-year survival rates of 21.5-56 %. The safety of surgical resection in HCC with major portal vein tumor thrombus has improved, but the optimal type(s) and timing of auxiliary therapy to use in combination with resection remain to be defined.
