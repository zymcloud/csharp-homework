Objective:To investigate the safety and efficacy of trastuzumab administered concurrently with anthracycline-containing adjuvant regimen for breast cancer.Methods:It is a prospective, randomized and controlled trial. Participants were randomized to receive trastuzumab administered concurrently or sequentially with anthracycline-containing adjuvant regimen. The primary endpoint was cardiac safety. The second endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).Results:One hundred and nine breast cancer patients were enrolled and randomized in this trial. Fifty-five participants received trastuzumab administered concurrently with anthracycline-containing adjuvant regimen and 54 patients received trastuzumab administered sequentially with anthracycline. The primary cardiac event was asymptomatic decrease in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). There was no significant difference between concurrent and sequential groups in cardiac event rates (9.1% vs13.0%, P = 0.556), neither of LVEF values at basline or at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months during trastuzumab treatment (P > 0.05). Four patients (7.3%) in the concurrent group suffered local recurrences or distant metastases, and 6 participants (11.1%) in the sequential group had distant metastases. There was no significant difference between the two groups in DFS (P = 0.724). There was no death in both groups.Conclusions:Trastuzumab administered concurrently with anthracycline is a safe adjuvant regimen for breast cancer and does not increase cardiac events. Further research is needed to determine the efficacy of this treatment regimen.
