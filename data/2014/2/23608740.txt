Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of death by cancer worldwide. The prognosis of patients with metastatic HCC remains limited, with an expected median survival lower than 50% at 1 year. Here, we report the case of a 63-year-old man who suffered from a small HCC in the liver and a large unique metastasis in the right adrenal gland. A surgical resection of both lesions was performed. Seven months later, HCC recurred with an isolated right renal metastatic lymphadenopathy and a high alpha-fetoprotein level. HCC was brought under control by sorafenib; the alpha-fetoprotein level was greatly reduced but remained moderately elevated and stable over 2 years after the onset of chemotherapy. Additional external radiotherapy on the metastatic lymphadenopathy led to a normalization of the alpha-fetoprotein level and discontinuation of sorafenib treatment. One year after the end of radiotherapy, a second isolated metastasis occurred in the right lung. This tumor was surgically removed. Twenty-one months after this second surgical procedure, i.e., more than 5.5 years after the initial diagnosis of metastatic HCC, the patient was asymptomatic and tumor free.
