Rationale and objectives:The aim of the present study was to characterize the kinetics of two nanoparticle-based contrast agents for preclinical imaging, Exitron nano 6000 and Exitron nano 12000, and the iodinated agent eXIA 160 in both healthy mice and in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Semiautomatic segmentation of liver lesions for estimation of total tumor load of the liver was evaluated in HCC mice.Materials and methods:The normal time course of contrast enhancement was assessed in 15 healthy C57BL/6 mice. Imaging of tumor spread in the liver was evaluated in 15 mice harboring a transgenic HCC model (ASV-B mice). Automatic segmentation of liver lesions for determination of total tumor burden of the liver was tested in three additional ASV-B mice before and after an experimental therapy.Results:In healthy mice, clearance of the contrast agent from blood was completed within 3-4 hours for eXIA 160 and Exitron nano 6000, whereas complete blood clearance of Exitron nano 12000 required about 24 hours. eXIA 160 provided maximum liver contrast at 1 hour post injection (p.i.) followed by a continuous decline. Enhancement of liver contrast with Exitron nano 6000 and Exitron nano 12000 reached a plateau at about 4 hours p.i., which lasted until the end of the measurements at 96 hours p.i. Maximum contrast enhancement of the liver was not statistically different between Exitron nano 6000 and Exitron nano 12000, but was about three times lower for eXIA 160 (P Conclusions:Both nanoparticle-based contrast agents provided stronger and longer lasting contrast enhancement of healthy liver parenchyma. Exitron nano 12000 allowed automatic segmentation of tumor lesions for estimation of the total tumor load in the liver.
