Purpose:To investigate a simple semiquantitative method to estimate yttrium-90 ((90)Y) dose delivered with radioembolization to infiltrative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:In a prospective study, patients with infiltrative HCC and portal vein thrombosis (PVT) underwent glass-based (90)Y radioembolization including technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin ((99m)Tc-MAA) hepatopulmonary shunt study before therapy and bremsstrahlung single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) after (90)Y radioembolization. Baseline magnetic resonance imaging was coregistered with (99m)Tc-MAA and bremsstrahlung SPECT/CT imaging separately. Unit tumor activity ((90)Y radioactivity delivered to each cubic centimeter of tumor) was estimated based on a lobar infusion approach. Correlation between proportions of (99m)Tc-MAA and (90)Y delivered to the tumor was investigated. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimations.Results:(90)Y therapy was administered in 18 consecutive patients (median age, 55.3 y; mean tumor volume, 588 cm(3)). Higher intratumoral (90)Y dose predicted prolonged survival, with 13.2-month median survival in patients with HCC and mean (90)Y dose of ≥ 100 Gy versus 4.6-month median survival for other patients (P Conclusions:The findings in this study suggest that approximately 50% of administered (90)Y dose is taken up by targeted infiltrative HCC with PVT. Intratumoral (90)Y dose ≥ 100 Gy in unresectable infiltrative HCC via a lobar intraarterial approach is a positive prognostic factor for survival.
