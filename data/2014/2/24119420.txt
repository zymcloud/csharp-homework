Cancer associated with venous thromboembolic disease has been recognized since Trousseau, but a link between cancer and iterative arterial thrombosis is rarely described. We report three cases of patients with iterative bypass thrombosis in whom cancer was subsequently diagnosed: lung cancer in one patient and hepatocarcinoma and bladder cancer in the others. Smoking and hypertension were risk factors in both patients. The link between arterial thrombosis and cancer is probably multifactorial. In case of iterative arterial bypass thrombosis, the search for cancer is as useful as the control of cardiovascular risk factors and the search for antiphospholipid syndrome, since patient management can be affected.
