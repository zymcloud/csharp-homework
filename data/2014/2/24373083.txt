Long-lasting HBV-DNA suppression is considered to be the best surrogate end-point of antiviral therapy in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) related chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, and it is a prerequisite to prevent liver-related complications and improve survival. Treatment with oral antiviral drugs in patients with HBV cirrhosis is effective in restoring liver function and improving survival even in those with decompensated cirrhosis. These agents are generally well-tolerated for long-term treatment, and several evidences have demonstrated that they are able to reverse liver fibrosis and prevent the occurrence of HCC.
