Objective:To compare and analyze the positron emission tomography (PET) images with other multi-modalities in the diagnosis of hepatic tumors.Methods:A total of 158 patients undergoing (18)F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET were enrolled along with another 55 cases with (11)C acetate-PET (AC-PET) imaging within 1 week. The pathological results were taken as the golden criteria. Tumor marker, contrast ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results were collected.SPSS 19.0 was used for statistical analysis.Results:Contrast MRI, ultrasound and CT were more effective than PET in the differential diagnosis of hepatic tumor.FDG-PET showed a better accuracy in the diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, metastasis and rare primary hepatic carcinoma. AC-PET was a good complementary method to FDG-PET. Consideration of tumor size, amount, laboratory results and history could improve the diagnostic accuracy of PET and enhanced CT.Conclusion:PET must be combined with other image modalities to differentiate hepatic tumors more effectively and accurately.
