Background:Barrett's oesophagus is a premalignant condition, predisposing to oesophageal adenocarcinoma. However, some adenocarcinoma may arise in columnar lined oesophagus without goblet cells. Our aim was to evaluate the biological properties of non-goblet columnar lined oesophagus only and elucidate its relationship with Barrett's oesophagus and associated neoplasia.Methods:Endoscopic biopsies from patients with Barrett's oesophagus (n=30), non-goblet columnar lined oesophagus (n=14), Barrett's oesophagus associated high grade dysplasia (n=6) and adenocarcinoma (n=4) were selected. Immunostaining for villin, claudin 3 and MUC4 was performed. Statistical analysis was performed and a p value <0.05 was considered significant.Results:Villin and MUC4 were positive in 42%, 100% each and 50% in non-goblet columnar lined oesophagus, Barrett's oesophagus, high grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma respectively, while claudin 3 was 100% positive in all the groups. In non-goblet columnar lined oesophagus, six cases that were villin immunopositive, showed positive expression for claudin 3 and/or MUC4 and there was no difference from the high grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma (p>0.05).Conclusion:Our results indicate that a subset of non-goblet columnar lined oesophagus shows an intestinal phenotype representing an early stage of Barrett's oesophagus. This subset probably harbours the potential to change into adenocarcinoma in the long term.
