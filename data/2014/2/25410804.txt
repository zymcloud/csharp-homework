In this paper, we have established for the first time, the terrific efficiency of aqueous extract of agricultural waste dried peel of sugar apple (Annona squamosa) in the rapid synthesis of stable SnO2 nanoparticles. In topical years, the deployment of secondary metabolites from plant extract has emerged as a novel technology for the synthesis of various nanoparticles. In this paper, we have studied the potential of SnO2 nanoparticles assembly using agricultural waste source for the first time. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized and confirmed as SnO2 nanoparticles by using UV-visible spectroscopy, XRD, and TEM analysis. The motivation of this study was to examine cytotoxicity study of SnO2 nanoparticles against hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2). SnO2 nanoparticles inhibited the cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 148 Î¼g/mL. The treated cells showed an altered morphology with increasing concentrations of SnO2 nanoparticles. Our result shows that the SnO2 nanoparticles exhibit moderate cytotoxicity towards the hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) at tested concentrations.
