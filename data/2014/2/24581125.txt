The efficacy was evaluated according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors assessment. Survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. Safety was evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.Results:Among the 10 patients, 2 achieved complete response, 3 achieved partial response, 3 achieved stable disease, and 2 experienced progressive disease. The median overall survival of the cohort was 29.5 months. Different degree of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurred in 9 patients but all were at grade 3 or lower. The most common ADRs were hand-foot skin reaction (7/10) and diarrhea (6/10).Conclusion:The combination of sorafenib and TACE is an effective and safe treatment for HCC.
