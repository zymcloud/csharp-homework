Purpose:A growing body of evidence has shown the possible relevance of survivin -31G>C (rs9904341) promoter polymorphism to the genetic susceptibility of cancer. Because of the lack of available conclusive data, we performed a meta-analysis of all relevant available studies to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship.Methods:A comprehensive literature search of Medline electronic database was conducted to collect relevant studies until August 18, 2013. References of the retrieved articles were also screened. The extracted data were statistically analyzed, and pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to estimate the association strength using Stata version 11.2 software.Results:A total of 29 studies with 7,473 cancer cases and 9,086 controls were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled analysis revealed that suvivin -31G>C polymorphism was significantly associated with increased cancer risk under multiple genetic models (CC vs. GG: OR = 1.37, 95 % CI 1.06–1.76; CC vs. CG: OR = 1.27, 95 % CI = 1.10–1.46; CC vs. CG + GG: OR = 1.31, 95 % CI = 1.10–1.57). In subgroup analysis with different cancer types, the -31G>C polymorphism significantly increased the risk of colorectal, gastric, and urothelial cancers, while this SNP remarkably decreased the susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma. Further stratification analysis by ethnicity showed an increasing cancer risk in the Asian population (CC vs. GG: OR = 1.61, 95 % CI 1.17–2.21; CC vs. CG: OR = 1.31, 95 % CI 1.12–1.53; CC vs. CG + GG: OR = 1.43, 95 % CI 1.16–1.77) but not in Europeans.Conclusions:The survivin -31G>C polymorphism is associated with elevated cancer risk, especially among colorectal, gastric, and urothelial cancers and Asian populations.
