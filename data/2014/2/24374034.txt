Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) can activate expression of a broad range of genes in response to hypoxia. It has been shown that the levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) are influenced by changes in oxygen tension, and PPARγ plays a critical role in metabolism regulation and cancers. In this research, we observed an increased PPARγ mRNA and protein levels in company with increased HIF-1 protein levels in HepG2 cells in hypoxia as compared with in normoxia. Enforced expression of HIF-1α induced PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 expression, while knockdown of HIF-1α by small interference RNA deduced PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 expression in HepG2 cells under hypoxic conditions. By dual-luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay we confirmed a functional hypoxic response element (HRE) localized at 684bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS) of PPARγ1 and a functional HRE localized at 204bp downstream of the TSS of PPARγ2 in HepG2 cells. Additionally we observed an increase and co-presence of PPARγ and HIF-1α, and a highly positive correlation between PPARγ expression and HIF-1α expression (r=0.553, p
