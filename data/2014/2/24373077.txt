In recent years, several studies have clearly shown that sustained virological response (SVR) achieved by interferon-based therapies may delay or reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, liver decompensation and all-causes of mortality in all categories of patients with HCV-related cirrhosis, a condition characterized by a wide heterogeneity of clinical features, especially in patients with compensated disease. Unfortunately, the advanced fibrosis stage has been shown to be associated with poor SVR rates and poor tolerance with Peg-interferon and ribavirin. Therefore, on the basis of its risk/efficacy evaluation, most patients are considered to be ineligible for antiviral therapy with these molecules. Recently, improvement in the knowledge of the HCV life-cycle, has resulted in the rapid development of many direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Two first generation DAAs, boceprevir (BOC) and telaprevir (TVR), have been approved, and more than 40 new small molecules are still in development. However, only a few individuals with compensated cirrhosis were included in the phase III studies assessing the safety and efficacy of BOC or TVR in na√Øve and chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 patients in whom treatment had failed, and patients with either decompensation or end-stage liver disease were excluded. Therefore, the information available in these patients, which have shown significantly lower SVR compared with patients with mild to moderate fibrosis, are not fully reliable. In addition, in real practice, some studies that have not yet been fully published have shown that triple therapy with these two molecules was associated with low SVR and high serious adverse events (SAEs).
