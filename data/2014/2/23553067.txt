The safety, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of the multikinase inhibitor regorafenib in Japanese patients was assessed in this multicenter, single-arm, phase I trial. Fifteen patients with treatment-refractory advanced solid tumors received regorafenib 160 mg once daily for the first 3 weeks of each 4-week cycle until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or investigator or patient decision to stop. The median duration of treatment was 2.1 months (range, 0.9-20.1 months). At data cutoff, one patient was still receiving regorafenib in cycle 21. Reasons for treatment discontinuation were disease progression (n = 12) and adverse events (liver enzyme elevation n = 1; anemia n = 1). Adverse events necessitated dose reduction in six patients, interruption of daily treatment in seven patients, and cycle delay in four patients. All patients experienced at least one drug-related adverse event, particularly gastrointestinal (87 %), dermatologic (73 %), or hematologic (67 %) events. There was no significant change in time to maximum concentration or terminal half-life of regorafenib and its active metabolites M2 and M5 between single dosing and 21-day continuous dosing. The area under the concentration-time curve was 2.1-fold higher for regorafenib, 5.2-fold higher for M2, and 37.3-fold higher for M5, and the maximum concentration was 2.0-fold, 4.8-fold, and 36.0-fold higher, respectively, after continuous dosing than after single dosing. One patient had a partial response (duration 10.5 months) and seven patients had stable disease. This study indicates that regorafenib 160 mg orally once daily (21 days on/7 days off treatment) can be given to Japanese patients who have solid tumors, without undue toxicity.
