Background:Real-time tissue elastography is an innovative tool that informs the surgeon about tissue elasticity by applying the principle of ultrasonography. The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of intraoperative real-time tissue elastography (IORTE) for the detection and characterization of liver tumours.Methods:Between October 2010 and November 2011, IORTE was performed for liver lesions after the completion of routine B-mode intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS). The elasticity images of all tumours, except those of cysts, were classified into six categories according to modified criteria (types 1-6), according to the degree of strain contrast with the surrounding liver. The concordance of IORTE with pathological examination of the tumour, B-mode IOUS and clinical diagnosis after follow-up was assessed.Results:Images were obtained from 92 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), 92 adenocarcinomas, 19 other malignant tumours and 18 benign tumours in 158 patients. Using a minilinear probe, 73 of 88 HCCs were classified as having a 'HCC pattern' (type 3, 4 or 5), resulting in a sensitivity of 83·0 per cent, a specificity of 67·2 per cent and an accuracy of 73·7 per cent. Some 66 of 90 adenocarcinomas were classified as 'adenocarcinoma pattern' (type 6), resulting in a sensitivity of 73·3 per cent, specificity of 95·1 per cent and accuracy of 85·9 per cent. IORTE detected seven new lesions (8 per cent).Conclusion:IORTE is useful for the detection and characterization of liver tumours.
