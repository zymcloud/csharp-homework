The abnormal lipid metabolism is considered as a hallmarker of tumorigenesis. Liver is the central organ for metabolic homeostasis. Hence, the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) always exhibits alterations of metabolism. MicroRNAs emerge as key post-transcriptional modulators of gene expression in physiologic and pathologic states. Here, we aim to explore the mechanism of abnormal lipid metabolism of hepatoma cells. Previously, our group reported that miR-205 as a tumor suppressor was down-regulated in HCC. Therefore, we supposed that miR-205 might be involved in the event. Interestingly, in this study we uncover that miR-205 deregulates lipid metabolism in HCC through targeting acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (ACSL1) mRNA, which is an important and abundant lipid metabolism enzyme in liver. We identified that miR-205 was able to down-regulate ACSL1 via targeting its 3'UTR in the cells. Oil red O staining showed that miR-205 disordered the lipogenesis in hepatoma cells and anti-miR-205 resulted in the accumulation of triglyceride in the cells depending on ACSL1. Moreover, we validated that the low levels of miR-205 were negatively related to high levels of ACSL1 in clinical HCC tissues. The expression levels of ACSL1 and its metabolite triglyceride levels were remarkably increased in hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx)-induced liver cancer tissues from the HBx transgenic mice model. Thus, we conclude that miR-205-targeted ACSL1 may contribute to the abnormal lipid metabolism of liver cancer. Our finding provides new insights into the dysregulation of lipid metabolism in HCC mediated by miR-205 targeting ACSL1 mRNA.
