Recently, it has been reported that tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) methylation was frequently detected in a variety of human cancers. However, the relationship between the TIG1 methylation and the characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. The aim of present study was to observe the promoter methylation of TIG1 in HCC tissues and assess its prognostic significance for HCC. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction were used, respectively, to examine the mRNA expression and methylation status of TIG1 in 91 pairs of HCC and adjacent noncancerous tissues. The mRNA expression level of TIG1 was significantly lower in HCC tissues than in adjacent noncancerous tissues. The rate of TIG1 promoter methylation was significantly higher in HCC tissues than in adjacent noncancerous tissues (P
