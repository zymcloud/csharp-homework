Objective:To explore the computed tomographic (CT) manifestations and their values in the diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHC) and improve the understanding of IHC.Methods:A total of 58 IHC patients confirmed pathologically from January 2006 to December 2012 were reviewed.Results:On plain CT scans, all lesions were of low density with lower density region (n = 37), retraction of liver capsule (n = 11), dilation of intrahepatic biliary duct (n = 22), bile duct calculus (n = 13) and atrophy of liver lobe (n = 14).On enhanced scans, most tumor showed obvious circular enhancement on arterial phase, stripe and network enhancement of internal region on portal phase and obvious enhancement on delayed phase.Conclusion:CT manifestations of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are specific for its diagnosis.
