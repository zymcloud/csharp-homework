Purpose:To evaluate the effectiveness comparing the combination of TACE with local ablative therapy and monotherapy on the treatment of HCC using meta-analytical techniques.Methods:Randomized controlled trials and clinical studies comparing TACE plus local ablative therapy with monotherapy for HCC were included in this meta-analysis. Response rate, 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year survival rate, and overall survival (OS) were analyzed and compared.Results:Eighteen studies included a total of 2,120 patients with HCC 1,071 and 1,049 patients for treatment with combination therapy and monotherapy, respectively. The combination therapy group had a significantly better survival in terms of 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year survival rate (RR 1.10, 95 % CI 1.03–1.18, P = 0.005; RR 1.20, 95 % CI 1.10–1.30, P Conclusions:The meta-analysis indicates that the combination of TACE with local ablative therapy was superior to monotherapy in the treatment for patients with HCC.
