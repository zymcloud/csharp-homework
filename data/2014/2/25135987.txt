Although percutaneous radio frequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma is a minimally invasive therapy, there are some complications reported; major complications include hemorrhage (0.477%), hepatic injuries (1.690%), and extrahepatic organ injuries (0.691%). We, for the first time, described a rare complication of delayed bronchobiliary fistula and cholangiolithiasis in common bile duct following radio frequency ablation and the salvage treatment in a patient with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Surgeons should be aware of severe and rare complications before deciding the ablation area and when performing radio frequency ablation, and should be aware of the relevant salvage treatment.
Radio frequency ablation; cholangiolithiasis; delayed bronchobiliary fistula; hepatocellular carcinoma; salvage treatment.
