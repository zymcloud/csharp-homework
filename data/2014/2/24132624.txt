Background:In patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections, differences in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between those with liver cirrhosis and those without cirrhosis have not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to compare clinicopathological characteristics and survival between noncirrhotic and cirrhotic patients and to determine prognostic factors for tumor recurrence after hepatectomy in patients with HBV and HCC.Methods:Between 2005 and 2010, 441 curative hepatectomies for HCC in patients with cirrhosis and 454 for HCC in patients without cirrhosis were performed.Results:Cirrhotic patients had lower platelet counts, protein induced by vitamin K antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) levels, and tumor size than noncirrhotic patients. HCC differentiation in noncirrhotic patients was poorer than in cirrhotic patients. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year disease-free survival rates were 72.0, 65.6, and 61.0% in noncirrhotic patients, and 68.6, 56.5, and 51.5% in cirrhotic patients, respectively (P = 0.013). However, the 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival rates were 92.4, 85.5, and 81.7% in noncirrhotic patients, and 91.9, 86.1, and 82.4% in cirrhotic patients, respectively (P = 0.683). Risk factors for tumor recurrence in each group varied in multivariate analyses. Increased age, high platelet counts, microvascular invasion, serosal invasion, and intrahepatic metastasis predisposed to tumor recurrence in noncirrhotic patients, but elevated PIVKA-II and alkaline phosphatase levels, low serum albumin levels, portal vein invasion, intrahepatic metastasis, and tumor size were predisposing factors for recurrence in cirrhotic patients.Conclusions:The clinicopathologic characteristics and risk factors for tumor recurrence in cirrhotic and noncirrhotic HCC patients with HBV infection differ.
