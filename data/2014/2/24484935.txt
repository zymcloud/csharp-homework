Background:In this study we aimed to determine the need for 18F-flourodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in the preoperative staging of rectal carcinoma in our large patient group according to level and location of tumor.Method:Totally, 97 patients diagnosed with primary rectal adenocarcinoma between May 2009 and July 2011 were included in the study. Preoperative staging was performed by evaluating contrast-enhanced thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic computed tomographies. After staging by conventional methods, all patients underwent an 18F-FDG PET/CT. In all cases, the relationship between 18F-FDG uptake and gender, tumor height at the anal canal, localization in the rectal wall, plasma carcinoembryonic antigen levels, histopathological tumor type, and tumor stage were examined.Results:While the ceCT was normal in 4 (4%) patients, it was positive for the rectum in 93 (95%), pelvic lymph nodes in 22 (22%), and distant metastases in 14 (14%) (liver (8), lung (8), bone (2), distant lymph nodes (6), and uterus (1)). Using computed tomography, disease stages were determined as stage 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 in 4, 8, 48, 23, and 14 patients, respectively; 18F-FDG PET/CT was normal in two (2%) patients. The mean SUVmax of FDG-positive rectal tumors was calculated as 17.31 Â± 9.37. Additionally, 18F-FDG uptake was seen in pelvic lymph nodes in 15 (15%) patients and in distant organs in 24 (24%) patients (liver (9), lung (12), bone (5), distant lymph nodes (11), uterus (1), and sigmoid colon (1)). According to an 18F-FDG PET/CT, 2, 7, 47, 20, and 21 patients were staged as stage 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. In 14 patients (14.4%), the stage of the disease was either changed, and there was a need to make adjustments to the patient's treatment strategy (n = 10), or the type of operation was changed (n = 4). In seven patients (0.7%), findings from 18F-FDG PET/CT images did not require any changes of the treatment plan.Conclusion:F-FDG PET/CT provides new findings in addition to conventional techniques in the staging of primary rectal cancer. These findings could change the patients' treatment strategies.
