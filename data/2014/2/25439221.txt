Background:MicroRNA 138 (miR-138) is recently shown to inhibit tumor growth and block cell cycle arrest of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by targeting cyclin D3 (CCND3). The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of miR-138 and CCND3 in human HCC, which remains unclear.Methods:Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to detect the expression levels of miR-138 and CCND3 messenger RNA (mRNA) in 180 self-pairs of HCC and noncancerous liver tissues.Results:Compared with noncancerous liver tissues, the expression levels of miR-138 in HCC tissues were significantly downregulated (P Conclusions:Our data suggest that the combined expression of miR-138 and its direct target CCND3 may be correlated with significant characteristics of HCC. MiR-138 downregulation and CCND3 upregulation maybe concurrently associated with prognosis in patients with HCC.
