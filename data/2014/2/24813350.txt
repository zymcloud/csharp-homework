Although the incidence of new hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has fallen, HCV-related complications are on the rise.

Included were all adult hospital discharges with HCV-related ICD-9 codes. Incremental hospital charge, in-hospital mortality and length of stay (LOS) were estimated using n = 1000 bootstrap replicates clustered by unique hospital identifier. A total of 123 939 (0.38%) discharges were related to HCV (primary or secondary diagnosis). In-hospital mortality increased from 1.7% (2005) to 2.6% (2009) (P
