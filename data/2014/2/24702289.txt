Introduction:The incidence of HCC is growing all over the word. Liver resection and transplantation are the methods of choice in only 25% of patients, representing radical treatment approaches. TACE is a method of palliative treatment in patients with primary unresectable disease.Material and methods:35 patients (27 men and 8 women) of an average age of 73.4 ± 7.2 years with HCC of average cumulative diameter 83.8 ± 36.3 mm were treated by TACE DEB with Doxorubicin. Solitary and multiple lesions were presented in 28 and 7 patients, respectively. 31 patients were classified as Child A, and 4 as Child B. One year overall survival, disease-specific, disease-free interval and their correlation with patients age, gender, as well as the number and cumulative diameter of tumours and complications after procedure were evaluated.Results:30-day mortality and morbidity rate was 0 and 8.6%, respectively. The so-called postembolization syndrome developed in 25.7% of patients. Repeated TACE was performed in 14 (40%) patients due to tumour progression. In two patients (5.7%) we performed liver resection after TACE. According to the RECIST criteria there was no complete response, partial response was presented in 17.1, stable disease in 37.1 and progression of disease in 25.7% of patients. One year overall survival, tumour-specific survival and disease-free survival was 69.7%, 88.9 and 49.3%, respectively. Better overall survival (p Conclusion:TACE is the method of palliative treatment in patients with unresectable HCC. There is no progression of HCC in one-half of patients after TACE. Better results are achieved in younger patients and in patients with no complications of procedure.
