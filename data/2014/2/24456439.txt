Vulvar cancer is an uncommon malignancy of the female genital tract in developing countries, accounting for 3% of gynaecological cancers. Here, cervical cancer is an everyday problem; ovarian cancer is the second commonest gynaecological cancer; endometrial is less common and vulvar cancer is rare. It is advanced at admission, though is a visible cancer. Records of women who had histopathologically proven vulvar cancer over 24 years were analysed for epidemiological status and preventive possibilities. During the analysis period, 9,419 total cancer cases were diagnosed; 4,726 (50.17%) were in women. A total of 39.52% (1,868 of 4,726) were gynaecological; 18 cases were vulvar (0.38% of the 4,726 women with cancer) and 0.96% of the 1,868 gynaecological cancer cases. Decreasing trends were 2.25% between 1984 and 1988, down to 0.33% between 2004 and 2008. Leading presenting complaints were: dyspareunia, 88.88% (16 of 18 patients); pruritus 13; ulcers 14; vulvar swelling 12 and urinary problems 13. Dystrophy was present in 8 of 18 cases. Overall, four had stage I, one stage II, three stage III and four stage IV disease at admission; all at labia majora or minora, some too advanced to know origin. Four women with metastasis in the lungs, liver and bones could only be given palliation. While vulvar cancer is uncommon, advanced disease at admission is a concern. Awareness is essential. Research is needed as to why cervical cancer is common and vulvar uncommon, as HPV plays a major aetiological role, so that cervical cancer can be prevented, with early diagnosis, management of vulvar cancer should also be available.
