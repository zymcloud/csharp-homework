Introduction:A high percentage of older patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are potential candidates for percutaneous ablation.Material and methods:We prospectively assessed data from patients older than 70 years with HCC. We determined their demographic and clinical characteristics, the treatment provided and the response, complications and survival among those treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and/or percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI).Results:Of 194 patients with HCC, 84 were older than 70 years (43.3%). The mean age was 76.8 ± 4.5 years. Seventy-five percent were male and 91.7% had cirrhosis. Cancer was initially identified by a surveillance program in 61.9%. According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system, 60.7% were classified as having early stage cancer (0-A), 19% as stage B, 12% as stage C, and 8.3% as stage D. Potentially curative initial treatment was provided in 38.2% (surgical resection in 4.8%, PEI in 22.6%, RFA in 4.8%, PEI+RFA in 6%), transarterial chemoembolization in 20.2%, and sorafenib in 3.6%. Twenty-five percent of patients were not treatment candidates and 13% refused the recommended treatment. The median follow-up after percutaneous ablation was 23 months (IQR 14.2-40.6). The mean number of sessions was 3.5 ± 2.2 for PEI and 1.8 ± 1.6 for RFA. The complications rate per session was 4%. Remission was achieved in 35.7%. The overall median survival was 45.7 months (95% CI 20.8-70.6).Conclusions:Almost half of the patients with HCC in our sample were elderly and more than half were diagnosed at an early stage. Percutaneous ablation was performed in one-third of the sample, achieving remission in 37.5%. There were few complications. Therefore, these patients should be assessed for percutaneous ablation.
