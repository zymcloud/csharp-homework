Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most commonly diagnosed form of liver cancer with high morbidity and mortality. Copy number variation (CNV) analysis of human HCC revealed that leukocyte-specific protein 1 (LSP1) had the highest number of cases with CNV. LSP1, a F-actin-binding protein, is expressed in hematopoietic cells and interacts with kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR), a scaffold for the extracellular signal-related kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Expression of LSP1 in liver, and its role in normal hepatocellular function and carcinogenesis, remains unknown. Therefore, LSP1 messenger RNA and protein levels were analyzed in normal hepatocytes in culture, rat liver following partial hepatectomy (PHx), and hepatoma cell lines. In culture and after PHx, LSP1 increased after the termination of hepatocyte proliferation. To investigate LSP1 function in HCC, short hairpin RNA was utilized to stably knock down LSP1 expression in the JM1 rat hepatoma cell line. Loss of LSP1 in JM1 cells resulted in dramatic up-regulation of cyclin D1 and phosphorylated ERK2, increased cell proliferation, and migration. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analysis displayed an interaction and colocalization between LSP1, KSR, and F-actin in JM1 cells and liver during regeneration. Conversely, expression of LSP1 in the JM2 rat hepatoma cell line led to decreased proliferation. Enhanced expression of LSP1 in mouse hepatocytes during liver regeneration after injection of an LSP1 expression plasmid also led to decreased hepatocyte proliferation.Conclusion:LSP1 is expressed in normal hepatocytes and liver after PHx after termination of proliferation. In rat hepatoma cell lines and mouse liver in vivo, LSP1 functions as a negative regulator of proliferation and migration. Given the high frequency of LSP1 CNV in human HCC, LSP1 may be a novel target for diagnosis and treatment of HCC.
