Objective:To explore the clinical application of serum GP73 in the diagnosis and progress of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was employed to quantitatively detect serum GP73 in 59 HCC patients, 23 cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis and 33 normal controls. The relationship between GP73 and diagnosis as well as progress of HCC was examined.Results:Significant differences existed when serum GP73 was categorized by Child-Pugh class A and B (P Conclusion:GP73 may become a potential serum marker for diagnosing HCC. And a combination of AFP yields better outcomes. The exact relationship between mRECIST and GP73 as well as AFP shall be proved by large-scale clinical trials.
