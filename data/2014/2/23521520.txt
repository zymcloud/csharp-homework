Aim:Radiofrequency ablation therapy (RFA) combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) (combination therapy) is effective for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to compare the long-term effects of combination therapy with supportive care alone for intermediate HCC.Methods:The study included 58 patients with intermediate HCC who received combination therapy (n = 34) or supportive care alone (n = 24). The inclusion criteria were a single nodule of more than 50 mm in diameter or two to three nodules, each measuring more than 30 mm in diameter, or more than three nodules, no vascular invasion and no extrahepatic metastasis.Results:The overall survival rates at 1, 2, 3 and 5 years of the combination therapy group (91%, 65%, 53% and 27%, respectively) were significantly better (P Conclusion:The combination of TACE and RFA is a safe and effective therapy in patients with intermediate HCC.
