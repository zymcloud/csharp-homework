Purpose:To assess whether MR perfusion and diffusion parameters taken before concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) are useful imaging biomarkers for predicting progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Twenty patients with locally advanced HCC who had no treatment before CCRT underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) and diffusion-weighted MRI. Mean values of the volume transfer constant (K(trans) ), reflex constant (Kep ), extravascular extracellular volume fraction (Ve ) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were estimated on a region of interest. The best cutoff value for each factor was assessed to differentiate between patients who had PFS shorter or longer than the median PFS. Patients were dichotomized in terms of the cutoff value. The survival outcome of the two groups and the predictive ability of each factor on PFS were evaluated.Results:Median time to PFS was 179 days. The best cutoff values for ADC, K(trans) , Kep , and Ve was 1.008 Ã— 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) , 0.108 min(-1) , 0.570 min(-1) , and 0.298%. Patients with higher ADC had significantly longer PFS than those with lower ADC(P Conclusion:The ADC of HCC acquired before CCRT correlated with PFS and was valuable in the prediction of the clinical outcome of HCC treated with CCRT.
