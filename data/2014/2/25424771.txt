Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. On the basis of virus-host interactions, the natural history of HBV carriers can be divided into four chronological phases. In the first immune tolerance phase, HBV carriers are positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and have high HBV replication activity, normal ALT levels as well as minimal liver disease. Ample evidence has shown that patients in the immune tolerance phase have very low viral evolution and minimal risk of fibrosis progression. However, recent immunological studies argued that HBV-specific immune responses already exist in a proportion of immune-tolerant patients and the immune activities are comparable to those in the immune clearance phase. Regarding antiviral therapy, whether these immune-tolerant patients are indicated for treatment remains debated. Previous studies showed that HBeAg-positive patients with normal or near-normal ALT levels, who are assumed to be in the immune tolerance phase, have a lower HBeAg seroconversion rate receiving either pegylated interferon or nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment. The latest clinical trial focusing on-treatment response of immune-tolerant patients with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-based therapy also confirmed the results. The HBeAg seroconversion rates are
HBV; HBeAg; HBsAg; immune clearance; immune tolerance.
