Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a recognized indication for liver transplantation (LT) as it can at the same time provide a radical oncological resection and prevent its recurrence treating the hepatic disease. However the shortage of donors and the long time on waiting list forces the hepatologists and transplant surgeons to adopt bridging locoregional treatments to prevent the drop out and to perform downstaging treatments to offer a chance of radical intervention to more patients. The therapeutical strategies for patients suffering from HCC are various and different choices should be considered according to each patient's clinical situation according to prognostic and staging systems. Recently recommendations have been published on Lancet Oncology about this topic. These guidelines are very helpful in choosing among the different therapeutic options and in the management of patients in waiting list. Here we briefly summarize and comment the main features covered in the recommendations.
