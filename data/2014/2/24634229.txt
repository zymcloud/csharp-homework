XRCC1 (human X-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cell 1) gene is considered a potentially important gene influencing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our analyses detected two allelic variants of XRCC1, c.910A>G and c.1686C>G. We aimed to investigate whether these polymorphisms influence the risk of HCC. The association between the XRCC1 polymorphisms and the risk of HCC was analyzed in 719 patients and 662 controls by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Our data suggested that the genotypes and alleles of c.910A>G and c.1686C>G polymorphisms were statistically associated with the risk of HCC. For c.910A>G, the GG genotype was associated with increased risk of developing HCC compared with the AA wild genotype (OR = 1.95, 95%CI = 1.40-2.70, P G, the risk of HCC was significantly higher for the GG genotype compared with the CC wild genotype (OR = 1.89, 95%CI = 1.375-2.599, P G and c.1686C>G may contribute to the risk of HCC (G versus A: OR = 1.40, 95%CI = 1.20-1.64, P G and c.1686C>G polymorphisms of XRCC1 are associated with the risk of HCC in the Chinese population.
