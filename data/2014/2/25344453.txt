Background:This phase I/II study determined the maximal tolerable dose, dose limiting toxicities, antitumor activity, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ruthenium compound NAMI-A in combination with gemcitabine in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer patients after first line treatment.Methods:Initial dose escalation of NAMI-A was performed in a 28 day cycle: NAMI-A as a 3 h infusion through a port-a-cath at a starting dose of 300 mg/m(2) at day 1, 8 and 15, in combination with gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) at days 2, 9 and 16. Subsequently, dose escalation of NAMI-A in a 21 day schedule was explored. At the maximal tolerable dose level of this schedule an expansion group was enrolled of which 15 patients were evaluable for response.Results:Due to frequent neutropenic dose interruptions in the third week, the 28 day schedule was amended into a 21 day schedule. The maximal tolerable dose was 300 and 450 mg/m(2) of NAMI-A (21 day schedule). Main adverse events consisted of neutropenia, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, transient creatinine elevation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, fatigue, and renal toxicity.Conclusion:NAMI-A administered in combination with gemcitabine is only moderately tolerated and less active in NSCLC patients after first line treatment than gemcitabine alone.
