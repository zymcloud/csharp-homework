Background:High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a widely applied to treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. However, insufficient HIFU can result in rapid progression of the residual tumor. The mechanism of such rapid growth of the residual tumor after HIFU ablation is poorly understood.Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate the dynamic angiogenesis of residual tumor, and the temporal effect and mechanism of the HIF-1, 2α in the residual tumor angiogenesis.Methods:Xenograft tumors of HepG2 cells were created by subcutaneously inoculating nude mice (athymic BALB/c nu/nu mice) with hepatoma cells. About thirty days after inoculation, all mice (except control group) were treated by HIFU and assigned randomly to 7 groups according to various time intervals (1st, 3rd, 5th day (d) and 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th week (w)). The residual tumor tissues were obtained from the experimental groups at various time points. Protein levels of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, VEGF-A, and EphA2 were quantified by immunohistochemistry analysis and Western Blot assays, and mRNA levels measured by Q-PCR. Microvascular density was calculated with counting of CD31 positive vascular endothelial cells by immunohistochemical staining.Results:Compared with the control group, protein and mRNA levels of HIF-1α reached their highest levels on the 3rd day (PConclusion:Insufficient HIFU ablation promotes the angiogenesis in residual carcinoma tissue over time. The data indicate that the HIF-1, 2α/VEGFA/EphA2 pathway is involved.
