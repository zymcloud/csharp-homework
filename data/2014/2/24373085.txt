The template of hepatitis B virus transcription, the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), plays a key role in the life cycle of the virus and permits the persistence of infection. It has been suggested that hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) quantification reflects the concentration of cccDNA in the liver. In hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive chronic hepatitis B, HBsAg levels are higherduring the immune tolerance phase than during the immune clearance phase. During the natural history of chronic hepatitis B, serum HBsAg declines progressively from the immune-tolerant to the low replicative phase. In HBeAg negative patients, the combination of low hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA (
