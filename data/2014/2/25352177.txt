microRNA‑99a (miR‑99a) was reported to be among the most frequently downregulated miRNAs in numerous types of human cancers, including prostate, bladder, hepatocellular and ovarian carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, squamous cell lung carcinoma as well as childhood adrenocortical tumors. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of miRNA‑99a on cell proliferation, colony formation ability, migration and invasion in prostate cancer. Following transfection with miRNA‑99a, cell viability, colony formation, cell migration and cell invasion assays were performed on prostate cancer cell lines, as well as western blot analysis and luciferase assays. miRNA‑99a inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation ability, migration and invasion in DU145 and PC‑3 cells, therefore indicating that miRNA‑99a may have a tumor suppressive role in prostate cancer. In addition, the present study provided the first evidence that the mechanism of action of miRNA‑99a may proceed by directly targeting fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 in prostate cancer. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that miRNA‑99a may have potential use as a therapeutic target for the treatment of prostate cancer.
