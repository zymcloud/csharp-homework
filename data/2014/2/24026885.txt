Several polymorphisms in the interleukin-18 (IL-18) and nterleukin-28B (IL-28B) genes have been reported to influence hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, the published findings have been conflicting. We conducted meta-analyses of randomized, controlled trials to address the association of IL-18 or IL-28B polymorphisms and the outcomes of HBV infection. Weipu, Wanfang, CNKI, MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were employed to search for citations using the MeSH terms as "interleukin-18"/"interleukin-28B" AND "HBV" AND "gene" AND "polymorphism" without any restriction in language and publication year. Meta-analysis was conducted by RevMan 5.0 software. The results showed that the IL28B rs8099917 AA genotype (AA vs AC + CC: odds ratio (OR) = 0.63, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.46-0.87) was associated with a decreased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Carriage of IL28B rs12979860 CC genotype was associated with an increased risk for developing liver cirrhosis among patients with HBV infection (CC vs CT + TT: OR = 1.39, 95 % CI = 1.04-1.85). Further well-designed large studies are warranted to confirm the mechanisms by which these are involved in these outcomes of HBV infection.
