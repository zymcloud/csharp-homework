A 57-year-old man was admitted for careful examination of lower limb edema. Abdominal computed tomography(CT) showed hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC), 2 cm in diameter, arising in liver segment S6. Posterior segmentectomy was performed, and histological examination of the specimen revealed poorly differentiated HCC. Nine months after surgery, a metastatic tumor was detected in the left scapula, and the patient gradually began to show a high blood concentration of hemoglobin and erythropoietin(Epo). Sorafenib was started but was discontinued because of intractable diarrhea. The patient died of the metastatictumor 15 months after surgery. This is the first case report of a patient with metastaticHCC developing erythrocytosis associated with a high concentration of Epo.
