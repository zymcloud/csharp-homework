Background:To determine the accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in differentiating malignant and benign venous thrombosis complicating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Fifty patients (M:F = 41:9; age range 46-83 years) with HCC and venous thrombosis [portal vein (PV) in 45 and hepatic vein (HV) in 5] detected on CT or MR scan were evaluated with CEUS. Reference standard of malignant and benign thrombosis was based on serial clinicoradiologic follow-up (n = 43) or pathology (n = 7). Two independent, blinded readers retrospectively recorded the enhancement features of the venous thrombosis and diagnosed as benign or malignant thrombosis with a five-point confidence scale. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated to determine the diagnostic performance of CEUS in differentiating malignant from benign thrombosis. Confidence level ratings were also used to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for the diagnosis of malignant thrombosis. Inter-reader agreement was calculated using κ statistics in each assessed finding. Gray scale and Doppler characteristics of primary tumor and thrombosis were also assessed.Results:Of the 50 patients, 37 were malignant (33 with PV thrombosis and 4 with HV thrombosis) and 13 were benign (12 with PV thrombosis and 1 with HV thrombosis). In ROC curve analysis for differentiating malignant from benign thrombosis, Az was 0.947 (CI 0.841-0.991) for reader 1 and 0.958 (CI 0.861-0.995) for reader 2 with excellent inter-reader agreement (κ = 0.86). When the confidence level ratings of 1 or 2 were considered malignant thrombosis, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV in differentiating malignant from benign thrombosis were 100%, 83%, 95%, and 100% for reader 1 and 100%, 92%, 97%, and 100% for reader 2.Conclusion:CEUS is useful to differentiate malignant and benign venous thrombosis associated with HCC with high diagnostic accuracy.
