Purpose:This paper aimed to obtain information on the levels of anxiety and depression among cancer patients in China. The factors influencing these psychological problems were also analyzed.Methods:A total of 1,217 cancer patients were interviewed, and each participant was asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire. The anxiety status, depression status, disease stage, tumor site, pain status, and performance status of the patients during the week prior to the interview were assessed.Results:The anxiety and depression prevalence rates were 6.49 and 66.72 %, respectively. The prevalence rates of depression were 60.62 % for head and neck cancer, 77.19 % for lung cancer, 57.9 % for breast cancer, 75.81 % for esophagus cancer, 63.40 % for stomach cancer, 68.42 % for liver cancer, 54.37 % for colorectal cancer, and 71.13 % for cervix cancer. The factors influencing depression of patients were performance status (P < 0.0001), pain (P = 0.0003), age (P < 0.0001), and education level (P < 0.0001). The risk factors of anxiety were performance status (P = 0.0007), age (P < 0.0001), and gender (P < 0.0001).Conclusions:Depression was a more important psychological problem than anxiety in cancer patients. Compared with 3.8 % of the prevalence of depression in normal population, depression level was high among Chinese cancer patients. Patients with lung, esophagus, and cervix cancers were the high-risk groups for depression. Poor performance status, pain, old age, and low-level education were the predicting factors for depression.
