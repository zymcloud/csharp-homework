Background:The objective of this study was to validate current recommendations for the selective use of staging laparoscopy in patients with radiological resectable pancreas head and peri-ampullary tumors.Methods:Data from a prospectively collected database (2007-2013) of 136 patients with peri-pancreatic head cancer were analyzed.Results:Over a 6 year time period, 136 patients were evaluated, 126 patients were deemed radiological resectable and underwent laparotomy and 10 patients were characterized radiological unresectable. There were 111 patients with pancreas head resection and 15 without resection (8 due to extensive vascular involvement and 3 due to peritoneal/liver metastases). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of pre-operative radiological imaging in determining unresectability due to liver/peritoneal metastases were 42%, 100%, 100% and 94.7% respectively. There was a significant difference in CA 19-9 values between metastatic and non-metastatic disease (p = 0.020). ROC curve analysis calculated the optimal CA 19-9 cutoff point for predicting metastasis at 215.37 U/ml with a sensitivity of 72.7%, a specificity of 58.3%, PPV of 15.1% and NPV of 95.5%. Tumor diameter was not a significant factor in predicting resectability. Laparoscopy would have been useful in only 5.3% of patients in the present series.Conclusion:High CA 19-9 values (>215 U/ml) and not tumor size should select patients with radiological resectable peri-pancreatic cancer for staging laparoscopy.
