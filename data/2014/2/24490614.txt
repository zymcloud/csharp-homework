Prognosis of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poor and is largely influenced by associated liver comorbidities. Moreover, effective treatment alternatives are limited; with the exception of the multitargeted inhibitor sorafenib, established options in the treatment of advanced HCC no longer amenable with ablative or locoregional procedures are lacking. In light of the limited efficacy of chemotherapy in this setting, great efforts have been made in the definition of targetable molecular pathways with a central role in the progression of HCC. Targeting angiogenesis, growth factor receptors, intracellular transduction pathways, or mechanisms of gene-expression regulation represents the main way to improve patient outcome. At the same time, identifying clinical and biological factors, which may help selecting patients with higher chances of benefit, is essential in order to hasten drug development and maximize treatment efficacy.
