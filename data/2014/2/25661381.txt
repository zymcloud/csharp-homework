The drug-carrier system used as innovative haemostatic dressing with oncostatic action is studied. It is obtained from CDDP (cisplatin) doped SWCNT (single walled carbon nanotubes), modified and purified by H2O2 in hydrothermal treatment process. In the in vivo nephron sparing surgery (NSS) study we used 35 BALB/c nude mice with induced renal cancer using adenocarcinoma 786-o cells. Animals were divided into four groups: CDDP(M-), CDDP(M+), CONTROL(M-) and CONTROL(M+). In CDDP(M-) and CDDP(M+) groups we used, intraoperatively, carbon nanotubes filled with cisplatin (CDDP). In CONTROL(M-) and CONTROL(M+) groups carbon nanotubes were used alone. During NSS free margin (M-) or positive margin (M+) was performed. In the CDDP(M-) group, we do not observe local tumor recurrences. In Group CDDP(M+) only one animal was diagnosed with tumor recurrence. In control groups the recurrent tumor formation was observed. In our study, it is shown that CDDP filled SWCNT inhibit cancer recurrence in animal model NSS study, and can be successfully applied as haemostatic dressings for local chemoprevention.
