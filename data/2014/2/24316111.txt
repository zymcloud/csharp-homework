Background:The role of surgery in the management of large hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) is controversial. Advanced age and comorbidities are taken into account when major surgery is considered.Purpose:To compare the outcomes of liver resection (LR) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for resectable HCC in patients aged 70 years or older.Patients and materials:This study included 70 patients aged 70 years or older treated for large HCCs (≥5 cm) between January 2007 and December 2012: 37 underwent LR and 33 underwent TACE. The outcomes of these patients were retrospectively analyzed. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were established. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated, and survival data were compared using the log-rank test.Results:Hospital stay was significantly longer in the LR group than in the TACE group (10 days vs 8.5 days; P = 0.003). Treatment-related complications were more frequent in the TACE group, but this difference was not statistically significant. LR was associated with a better disease-free survival rate, median survival rate and cumulative overall survival rate.Conclusion:Our results showed that LR could be a safe and effective treatment option for HCC tumors ≥5 cm in patiets aged 70 years or older.
