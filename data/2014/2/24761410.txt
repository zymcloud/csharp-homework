Purpose:We evaluate the operative outcome and oncologic outcome of laparoscopic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and compare with open liver resection.Methods:From January 2004 to December 2012, clinical data of 70 patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resection for HCC (laparoscopic liver resection group, lapa-group) were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Control group (open liver resection group, open-group) were retrospectively matched, and compared with lapa-group.Results:Laparoscopic major liver resections were performed in 4 patients. Laparoscopic anatomical resections and nonanatomical resections were performed in 39 patients, and 31 patients, respectively. Mean operative time was shorter in lapa-group (215.5 ± 121.84 minutes vs. 282.30 ± 80.34 minutes, P = 0.001), mean intraoperative transfusion rate and total amount were small in lapa-group (24.28%, 148.57 ± 3,354.98 mL vs. 40.78%, 311.71 ± 477.01 mL). Open conversion occurred in 6 patients (8.57%) because of bleeding, inadequate resection, invisible mass on intraoperative ultrasonography, and tumor rupture. In lapa-group and open-group, 3-year disease-free survival rates were 58.3% ± 0.08%, and 62.6% ± 0.06%, respectively (P = 0.773). In lapa-group and open-group 3-year overall survival rates were 65.3% ± 0.8%, and 65.7% ± 0.6%, respectively (P = 0.610).Conclusion:Laparoscopic liver resection for HCC is feasible and safe in a large number of patients, with reasonable operative and oncologic results.
