Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is an aggressive malignancy and is one of the most devastating cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. The molecular mechanisms contributing to the pathogenesis of these cancers are not well understood. The recognition and distinction of these cancers from other tumors such as perihilar or extrahepatic distal cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma are important in defining the pathogenesis. New insights into molecular mechanisms contributing to disease pathogenesis are emerging from recent epidemiological, genome-wide profiling and laboratory based studies. These have contributed to an improved understanding of risk factors, genetic mutations and pathophysiological mechanisms that are associated with these tumors. The contribution of well-established risk factors such as biliary tract inflammation and key signaling pathways involved in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are being further defined. These new insights have several important implications for both molecular diagnosis and therapy of these cancers.
