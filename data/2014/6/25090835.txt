Background and study aims:Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a serious global health problem affecting 150 million individuals worldwide. Although infection rates are decreasing, an aging population with progressing disease is expected to result in increased burden of advanced stage disease with high associated costs. This analysis describes the current and projected future economic impact of HCV sequelae in Belgium.Methods:A previously described and validated model was populated with Belgian inputs and calibrated to project the current and future health and economic burden of HCV. Monte Carlo and sensitivity analyses were run to quantify uncertainty. All estimates exclude the cost of antiviral therapy.Results:Costs associated with HCV were projected to peak in 2026 at Euro126M (Euro30M-Euro257M), while decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma costs were projected to increase until 2031 and 2034. The projected 2014-2030 cumulative cost of HCV under current conditions was Euro1,850M. Scenarios to reduce the burden of HCV could result in Euro70M-Euro400M in cumulative cost savings. Starting treatment (1,000 patients) in 2015 could result in Euro150M cost savings. The lifetime cost of HCV increases with life expectancy, with highest future costs projected among young females with early stage disease.Conclusions:The economic burden of HCV and advanced stage disease were projected to further increase. Cost reductions are possible with timely interventions aimed at minimizing the health burden of advanced stage disease.
