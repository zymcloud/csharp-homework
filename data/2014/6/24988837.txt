Nasopharyngeal cancer is unique among head and neck cancers. Despite definitive treatment, there is a high rate of recurrence, most commonly in the bone, lung or liver.

We present a case of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma with brain metastases and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis in the absence of local recurrence and systemic metastases.
