Aim:To compare the morbidity and mortality in young and elderly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing liver resection.Methods:We retrospectively enrolled 1543 consecutive hepatitis B (HBV)-related HCC patients undergoing elective hepatic resection in our cohort, including 207 elderly patients (≥ 65 years) and 1336 younger patients (＜ 65 years). Patient characteristics and clinical outcomes after liver resection were compared between the two groups.Results:Elderly patients had more preoperative comorbidities and lower alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels. Positive rates for hepatitis B surface antigen (P ＜ 0.001), hepatitis B e antigen (P ＜ 0.001) and HBV DNA (P = 0.017) were more common in younger patients. Overall complications and their severity classified using the Clavien system were similar in the two groups (33.3% vs 29.6%, P = 0.271). Elderly patients had a higher rate of postoperative cardiovascular complications (3.9% vs 0.6%, P = 0.001), neurological complications (2.9% vs 0.4%, P ＜ 0.001) and mortality (3.4% vs 1.2%, P = 0.035), and had more hospital stay requirement (13 d vs 12 d , P Conclusion:Hepatectomy can be safely performed in elderly patients. Age should not be regarded as a contraindication to liver resection with expected higher complication and mortality rates.
