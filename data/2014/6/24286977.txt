Persistent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease including fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is also a problem in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly in those on haemodialysis. Excessive iron in the liver of CHC patients contributes to hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis and finally HCC, while iron depletion is beneficial. In CHC patients without CKD, in HCV-infected experimental animals and in cell culture studies, serum hepcidin levels and/or cellular hepcidin expression are low and directly suppressed by HCV, radical oxygen species, growth factors and/or transcription factors. In contrast, antiviral therapy (e.g. with pegylated interferon-alpha combined with ribavirin) raises hepcidin levels and reduces iron overload in patients with CHC. Hepcidin directly inhibits HCV replication mediated by STAT3 activation. HCV circumvents hepatic innate antiviral defence by lowering hepcidin. If hepcidin is also low in CKD patients with CHC, iron supplementation should be avoided even in CKD patients with CHC treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.
