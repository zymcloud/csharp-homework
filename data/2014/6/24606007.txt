The optimum primary treatment strategy for early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with multiple nodules remains unclear. We aimed to compare the outcomes of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) with that of liver resection (LR) for early Child-Pugh A HCC patients with multiple nodules meeting the Milan criteria. From January 2007 to July 2012, 67 of 375 patients with early HCC in our centre fulfilled the inclusion criteria (group LDLT, n = 34 versus group LR, n = 33). Patient and tumour characteristics, operative data, postoperative course and outcomes were analysed retrospectively. The postoperative mortality and rate of major complications were similar in both groups. The 5-year overall survival (OS; 76.5% vs. 51.2%, P = 0.046) and recurrence-free survival (RFS; 72.0% vs. 19.8%, P = 0.000) were better in group LDLT than that in group LR. The 5-year OS and RFS were similar between patients with tumours located in the same lobe (TSL) and those in the different lobes (TDL) after LDLT, whereas the 5-year RFS was better in patients with tumours in TSL (30.6% vs. 0%, P = 0.012) after LR. In conclusion, primary LDLT might be the optimum treatment for early HCC patients with multiple nodules meeting the Milan criteria.
