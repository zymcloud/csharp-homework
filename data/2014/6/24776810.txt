Radioembolization (RE) is a selective internal radiotherapy technique in which yttrium-90 blended microspheres are infused through the hepatic arteries. It is based on the fact that primary and secondary hepatic tumors are vascularized mostly by arterial blood flow whereas healthy hepatocytes obtain their blood supply mostly from the portal network. This enables high radiation doses to be delivered, sparing the surrounding non-malignant liver parenchyma. Most of the complications are caused by unexpected particles passing into the gastrointestinal tract through branches originating from the main hepatic arterial supply. Knowledge of this hepatic arterial network and of its variations and the technical considerations this raises are required in preparation for treatment. This work describes the specific anatomical features and techniques for this anatomy through recent literature illustrated by cases from our own experience.
