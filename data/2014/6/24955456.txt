Background and aim:The purpose of the present study was to determine whether lamivudine in combination with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) could reduce hepatitis B virus (HBV) activation and improve the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:From July 2008 to October 2011, a total of 181 consecutive HBV-related HCC patients undergoing TACE were randomized to two groups (92: lamivudine, 89: control). Follow up was every 3 months. Primary and secondary end-points were time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS), respectively, both of which were evaluated by the Kaplan Meier technique and summarized by the hazard ratio.Results:The level of HBV-DNA became undetectable in 42 (45.6%) patients in the lamivudine group, compared with 10 (11.2%) in the control group (P Conclusion:Lamivudine therapy could reduce HBV activation and improve survival of HCC patients treated with TACE. Lamivudine therapy and AFP level are two independent factors affecting OS.
