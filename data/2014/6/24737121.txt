Mucin1 (MUC1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a key role as an oncogene in the tumorigenesis of many human adenocarcinomas. However, the role of MUC1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression remains unclear. In the present study, we silenced MUC1 to investigate its effect on the human HCC cell line SMMC-7721 and found that knockdown of MUC1 signiﬁcantly inhibited cell proliferation, enhanced cell-cell aggregation and induced apoptosis. No significant differences were found in in vitro migration or invasion. We also observed that knockdown of MUC1 decreased the translocation of β‑catenin to the nucleus, reduced the activity of T cell factor and blocked the expression of cyclin D1 and c-Myc. In addition, MUC1 knockdown enhanced the expression of E-cadherin, a molecular chaperone of β‑catenin that plays an important role in cell-cell aggregation. In vivo assays demonstrated that there was no tumor growth in mice injected with MUC1-silenced cells. Global gene expression analysis showed that a series of genes encoding molecules in the Wnt/β‑catenin, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), insulin, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathways were all influenced by the knockdown of MUC1, and these may contribute to the phenotypic alterations observed. Collectively, our results indicate that MUC1 plays a key role in HCC tumorigenesis.
