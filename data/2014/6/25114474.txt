On evaluation he was found to have space occupying lesion in the right lobe of the liver. USG Guided FNC done showed a Hepatocellular Carcinoma with predominant steatosis. He underwent Right Hepetectomy for the same and Histopathological examination revealed a Steatohepatitic Hepatocellular Carcinoma with background liver showing minimal steatosis and no significant fibrosis. This case is reported to provide better insight into the understanding of pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome as an etiological agent for development of HCC.
