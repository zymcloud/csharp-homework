Objective:To evaluate the feasibility, safety and long-term outcomes of laparoscopic repeat hepatectomy for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following previous resection.Methods:Between January 2003 and January 2011, 14 patients with recurrent HCC were carefully selected to undergo repeat laparoscopic hepatectomy, among which 9 patients were male, 5 patients were female, and the average age was 54 years. Prior to re-resection, all patients had undergone at least one open hepatectomy for HCC. The perioperative and long-term outcomes of these patients were retrospectively analyzed.Results:Repeat laparoscopic hepatectomy for these 14 patients were successfully performed without major perioperative complications. The mean operative time, intraoperative blood loss and hospital stay were (124 ± 82) minutes, (112 ± 43) ml and (7 ± 4) days, respectively. The mean follow-up period was 23 months (range 14 to 42 months). At the time of follow-up, 11 patients were still alive, among which 3 patients developed recurrent disease and 8 patients remained disease free. One patient died of liver dysfunction at 21 months, and another 2 patients died of tumor recurrence at 17, 31 months, respectively.Conclusion:Laparoscopic surgery for recurrent HCC remains a viable option for repeat hepatectomy in selected patients who have undergone open hepatectomy.
