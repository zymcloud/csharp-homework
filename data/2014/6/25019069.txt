It is reported that nuclear receptor co-activator 5 (NCOA5) is a possible susceptibility gene to both type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The link between these two diseases is an important area of study with the growing prevalence of T2D. Thus, discovery of a genetic link may have great impact on the field. The group used NCOA5 (+/-) mice to observe the effects of the gene's haploinsufficiency on the symptoms of T2D and HCC and claimed NCOA5's regulation of IL-6 in the pathogenesis of the diseases.
Nuclear receptor co-activator 5 (NCOA5); hepatocarcinoma; type 2 dibetes (T2D).
