Objective:To explore inhibition effects of veliparib as PARP inhibitor combined doxorubicin for BEL-7404 proliferation of human liver cancer cell line.Methods:BEL-7404 was taken as the object of study and conventional culture was performed. It was treated by doxorubicin and (or) veliparib after 24 h. Cell proliferation rate was detected by four methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay, cell apoptosis was measured with annexin V-FITC/PI double staining method by flow cytometry, DNA damage degree evaluation by single cell gel electrophoresis assay, and cytosolic C levels of the mitochondrial and cytosol by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Western blotting).Results:Cell proliferation rate of doxorubicin combined veliparib group was lower than that of the control group and doxorubicin alone treated group significantly (PConclusions:Veliparib, PARP inhibitor could inhibit PARP activity, block tumor cell DNA repair, and have significant sensitizing effect for hepatocellular carcinoma cell line BEL-7404 treated with doxorubicin. This might provide a new target for clinical treatment of hepatic carcinoma.
