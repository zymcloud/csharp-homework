Background/aims:The current study aims to investigate the risk factors and clinical implications of bile duct injury after performing transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for the treatment of patients with hepatic malignancy.Methodology:A total of 2340 patients with hepatic malignancies underwent 5656 TACE procedures without any radiographic evidence of biliary abnormalities pre-TACE. Of these, 40 patients developed bile duct injuries 3 weeks to 3 months after TACE.Results:TACE-induced bile duct injuries occurred in 30 out of 348 patients with liver metastatic tumors (8.6%) and in 10 out of 1992 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (0.5%). Bile duct injuries, including focal (n = 12) and multiple intrahepatic bile duct dilatation (n = 16), along with cystic lesions or bilomas (n = 12), were identified during follow-up post-TACE imaging. In addition, 6 patients with multiple bile duct injuries presented mild jaundice, and 8 patients with large biloma showed associated serious bacterial infections. The remaining 26 patients were asymptomatic. Biliary injury-related mortality occurred in 4 patients (10%).Conclusions:Knowledge of TACE-induced bile duct injury imaging findings can help interventional radiologists in providing correct diagnosis and treatment. Awareness of patients with high-risk factors may also reduce post-TACE ischemic biliary injuries.
