Aim:To review the usefulness of endoscopic biliary stenting for obstructive jaundice caused by hepatocellular carcinoma and identify problems that may need to be addressed.Methods:The study population consisted of 36 patients with obstructive jaundice caused by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent endoscopic biliary stenting (EBS) as the initial drainage procedure at our hospital. The EBS technical success rate and drainage success rate were assessed. Drainage was considered effective when the serum total bilirubin level decreased by 50% or more following the procedure compared to the pre-drainage value. Survival time after the procedure and patient background characteristics were assessed comparatively between the successful drainage group (group A) and the non-successful drainage group (group B). The EBS stent patency duration in the successful drainage group (group A) was also assessed.Results:The technical success rate was 100% for both the initial endoscopic nasobiliary drainage and EBS in all patients. Single stenting was placed in 21 patients and multiple stenting in the remaining 15 patients. The drainage successful rate was 75% and the median interval to successful drainage was 40 d (2-295 d). The median survival time was 150 d in group A and 22 d in group B, with the difference between the two groups being statistically significant (P Conclusion:EBS is recommended as the initial drainage procedure for obstructive jaundice caused by HCC, as it appears to contribute to prolongation of survival time.
