Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the advanced form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which is often accompanied by obese and/or type II diabetes mellitus. Approximately one-third of NASH patients develop hepatic fibrosis. Hepatic stellate cells are the major effector cells during liver fibrogenesis. Advanced liver fibrosis usually proceeds to cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma, leading to liver failure, portal hypertension and even death. Currently, there are no approved agents for treatment and prevention of liver fibrosis in human beings. Curcumin, the principal curcuminoid of turmeric, has been reported to show antitumor, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties both in in vitro and in vivo systems. Accumulating data shows that curcumin plays a critical role in combating liver fibrogenesis. This review will discuss the inhibitory roles of curcumin and update the underlying mechanisms by which curcumin targets in inhibiting hepatic stellate cell activation.
