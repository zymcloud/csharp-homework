Chronic hepatitis B infection is associated with the development of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and finally liver-related mortality. Each year, approximately, 2%-5% of patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related compensated cirrhosis develop decompensation, with additional clinical manifestations, such as ascites, jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The outcome of decompensated HBV-related cirrhosis is poor, with a 5-year survival of 14%-35% compared to 84% in patients with compensated cirrhosis. Because the risk of disease progression is closely linked to a patient's serum HBV DNA level, antiviral therapy may suppress viral replication, stabilize liver function and improve survival. This article briefly reviews the role that antiviral therapy plays in cirrhosis complications, particularly, in decompensation and acute-on-chronic liver failure.
