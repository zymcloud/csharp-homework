Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the main causes of chronic liver diseases that may progress to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Host immune responses are important factors that determine whether HBV infection is cleared or persists. Natural killer (NK) cells represent the main effector population of the innate immune system and are abundant in the human liver. Recently, it has been demonstrated that NK cells not only exhibit antiviral functions but may also regulate adaptive immune responses by deletion of HBV-specific CD8(+) T cells. It is well-established that HBV-specific CD8(+) T cells contribute to virus elimination. However, the mechanisms contributing to CD8(+) T cell failure in chronic HBV infection are not well-understood. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge about NK cells and CD8(+) T cells and illustrate their contribution to viral clearance and persistence in HBV infection. Moreover, novel immunological in vitro model systems and techniques to analyze HBV-specific CD8(+) T cells, which are barely detectable using current multimer staining methods, will be discussed.
