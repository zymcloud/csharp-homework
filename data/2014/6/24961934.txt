Background:Recent advances in surgical techniques and perioperative management have led to improved surgical outcomes, especially perioperative outcomes. The aim of this study was to review our experience with hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) over a ten-year period to determine how to improve long-term surgical outcomes.Methods:From January 1996 to December 2007, 610 patients underwent curative resection for HCC at Yonsei University Health System, Seoul, Korea. Prognostic factors for disease-free and overall survival were identified, and surgical outcomes were compared between two time periods: before 2003 and after 2003.Results:The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 90.1%, 74.9% and 64.4%, respectively. The patients after 2003 tended to have improved overall survival. The survival rate after recurrence in patients with tumors > 3 cm was significantly greater after 2003. (P = 0.044).Conclusions:The improved survival rates after 2003 may be explained by better selection of surgical candidates, a reduced perioperative transfusion rate due to improved surgical techniques, and active multimodal treatment for recurrent HCC.
