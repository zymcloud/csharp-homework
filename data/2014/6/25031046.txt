Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer. Hepatic resection has long been considered a main treatment option for HCC, but the high rate of recurrence after hepatic resection remains a problem that impacts the prognosis and survival of patients with HCC. Thus, clarifying the factors for survival and risk factors for tumor recurrence after hepatic resection is crucial. Imaging studies are currently emphasized before selecting a treatment and predicting the prognosis for patients with HCC. Recently, laboratory testing of des-gamma-carboxyprothrombin (DCP), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), indocyanine green 15 min after administration (ICG-R15), and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP) has garnered attention as a way to select treatment and predict the prognosis of patients with HCC. γ-GTP in particular has critical clinical significance as an indicator of prognosis. This indicator helps to predict prognosis and it helps with the selection of further treatment, as was revealed by studies based on different subgroups of patients published in the past 5 years. The reason for the association between γ-GTP and early recurrence and poor survival is being investigated. Preoperative laboratory results (DCP, AFP, ICG-R15, and γ-GTP) may warrant attention and need to be fully evaluated before selecting a treatment and predicting prognosis in order to improve the prognosis for patients with HCC.
