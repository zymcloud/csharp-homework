Purpose:To estimate the limit of functional liver reserve for safe application of hepatic irradiation using changes in indocyanine green, an established assay of liver function.Materials and methods:From 2005 to 2011, 60 patients undergoing hepatic irradiation were enrolled in a prospective study assessing the plasma retention fraction of indocyanine green at 15-min (ICG-R15) prior to, during (at 60% of planned dose), and after radiotherapy (RT). The limit of functional liver reserve was estimated from the damage fraction of functional liver (DFL) post-RT [1-(ICG-R15pre-RT/ICG-R15post-RT)] where no toxicity was observed using a beta distribution function.Results:Of 48 evaluable patients, 3 (6%) developed RILD, all within 2.5 months of completing RT. The mean ICG-R15 for non-RILD patients pre-RT, during-RT and 1-month post-RT was 20.3%(SE 2.6), 22.0%(3.0), and 27.5%(2.8), and for RILD patients was 6.3%(4.3), 10.8%(2.7), and 47.6%(8.8). RILD was observed at post-RT damage fractions of â‰¥78%. Both DFL assessed by during-RT ICG and MLD predicted for DFL post-RT (pConclusion:The DFL as assessed by changes in ICG during treatment serves as an early indicator of a patient's tolerance to hepatic irradiation.
