Glaucocalyxin H (GLH) is a new compound isolated from a traditional Chinese medical herb Isodon japonica var. glaucocalyx which has been used for folk medicine. This study was carried out for the first time to investigate the potential role of GLH in anti-hepatoma activity and underlying mechanisms in it. GLH could inhibit the growth of tumor in mice and induce HepG2 cells to death as assessed by the tumor reduction assay, toxic assay, morphological change, and survival rate assay. Many antitumor drugs originated from plants could inhibit the growth of tumor by inducing cells to apoptosis. The morphological changes of HepG2 cells treated with different concentrations of GLH under fluorescence and electron microscope and apoptotic rates were detected to verify its effect on apoptosis. As shown in the study, GLH could induce HepG2 cells to apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Bcl2 and Bax proteins played important roles in apoptosis and the disequilibrium between Bcl2 and Bax might result in apoptosis. The expression of Bax protein was upregulated and Bcl2 protein was downregulated in HepG2 cells treated with GLH assessed by Western blotting, and they were in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, GLH can inhibit the growth of hepatoma cells in vivo and in vitro by inducing cell apoptosis due to the decreased Bcl2 and increased Bax proteins suggesting that GLH could be a potential candidate as an anti-hepatoma agent for the therapeutic treatment of hepatoma.
