Liver metastases represent the major cause of death in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Recent studies have suggested that the chemotactic responses of tumor cells are necessary for metastatic spread to the liver, and CCL20 and CXCL8 have a strong association with CRC metastasis. The aim of our study was to identify the mechanisms by which CCL20 and CXCL8 synergize to promote metastatic progression and evaluated their potential as prognostic markers for CRC patients. The abilities of CCL20 and CXCL8 to promote CRC cell progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition(EMT)phenotype were analyzed in vitro. Possible signaling pathways were investigated with specific pathway inhibitors and small interfering RNA (siRNA). 213 Patients with CRC who underwent surgery were enrolled for analysis of CCL20, CXCL8 and E-cadherin expressions in tumor tissues. Prognostic factors were then identified. CCL20 or CXCL8 alone was not sufficient to induce complete EMT in CRC cells, but both of them could coordinately induce EMT-like phenotype that was required to maintain CRC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. PI3K/AKT-ERK1/2 pathway crosstalk was demonstrated to be responsible for this process. Coexpression of CCL20 and CXCL8 was negatively correlated with E-cadherin expression in human CRC tissues. CRC patients with coexpression of CCL20 and CXCL8 were more likely to develop liver metastases and both coexpression was an independent high-risk factor for a most poor prognosis. CCL20 and CXCL8 synergize to promote CRC metastatic progression by coordinated induction of EMT via PI3K/AKT-ERK1/2 signaling axis. Detection of both coexpressions can be used to predict clinical outcomes in CRC patients.
