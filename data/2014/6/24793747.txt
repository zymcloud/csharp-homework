The objective of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the clinical outcomes of 110 consecutive Japanese patients who received at least two cycles of sunitinib as first-line therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) in a routine clinical setting. Initially, 50 mg of sunitinib was administered once daily on a 4 weeks on, followed by 2 weeks off dosing schedule; however, dose modification was required in 102 patients, and the relative dose intensity was 62.6 % throughout this series. As the best responses to sunitinib, 2, 28, 65 and 15 were judged to show a complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) following the treatment with sunitinib were 7.8 and 33.2 months, respectively. Multivariate analyses of several factors identified the following independent predictors of PFS and OS: Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) classification and C-reactive protein (CRP) level for PFS and liver metastasis, MSKCC classification and CRP level for OS. The common adverse events related to sunitinib corresponding to â‰¥grade 3 were thrombocytopenia in 59, leukopenia in 23, fatigue in 22, hand-foot syndrome in 15 and hypertension in 12. Quality of life (QOL) analysis using 36-Item Short Form revealed no significant differences in any scale scores between surveys performed before and 3 months after the treatment with sunitinib. Collectively, these findings suggest that the introduction of sunitinib as a first-line agent can lead to favorable disease control with acceptable tolerability, resulting in improvement in the prognosis and QOL of Japanese patients with mRCC.
