Background:This study examined the effects of peretinoin, an acyclic retinoid, on the survival of patients with hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who had completed curative therapy and participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.Methods:This study was an investigator-initiated retrospective cohort study. Subjects were all patients who were administered the investigational drug (peretinoin 600 mg/day, peretinoin 300 mg/day, or placebo) in the randomized trial. Survivals between the groups were compared using the log-rank test, and hazard ratios were estimated by Cox regression.Results:Survey data were collected from all patients (n = 392) who participated in the randomized trial, all of whom were then divided into the peretinoin 600 mg/day (n = 132), peretinoin 300 mg/day (n = 131), and placebo (n = 129) groups. At the median follow-up of 4.9 years, 5-year cumulative survival rates for patients in the 600 mg/day, 300 mg/day, and placebo groups were 73.9, 56.8, and 64.3 %, respectively. Comparison of overall survival among patients classified as Child-Pugh A revealed that survival of the 600 mg/day group (n = 105) was significantly longer than that of the placebo group (n = 108) (hazard ratio 0.575, 95 % CI 0.341-0.967; P = 0.0347).Conclusions:Administration of 600 mg/day peretinoin to patients with hepatitis C virus-related HCC who have completed curative therapy may improve survival for those classified as Child-Pugh A, for whom liver function is relatively stable.
