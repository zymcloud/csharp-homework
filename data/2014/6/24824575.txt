The nanoparticulate photocatalyst β-SnWO4 is transfected into human liver carcinoma cells (HepG2). CLSM images and MTT assays validate a high phototoxicity under artificial daylight illumination at low systemic cytotoxicity and without long-term effects. β-SnWO4 offers multifunctionality, including high colloidal stability and intrinsic fluorescence.
