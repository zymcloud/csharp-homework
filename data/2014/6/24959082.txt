Purpose:As prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hypersplenism is rarely reported, this study examined prognostic factors for patients who underwent surgery for this condition.Patients and methods:This study retrospectively analyzed prognostic factors in 181 consecutive HCC patients using univariate and multivariate analyses, as well as subgroup analyses for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of two groups: one group who received splenectomies (Sp) and one group who did not (non-Sp).Results:1, 3, and 5 year OS rates were 88.4%, 67.1%, and 52.8%, respectively; corresponding DFS rates were 67.0%, 43.8%, and 31.6%, respectively. Age ≥55 years old, cigarette smoking, tumor size ≥5 cm, microvascular invasion, and Child-Pugh grade B (versus A) correlated significantly with OS (PConclusion:Hepatectomy without concomitant splenectomy can contribute to improved DFS of TNM stage I HCC patients with hypersplenism, whereas simultaneous hepatectomy and splenectomy can prolong OS for patients at TNM stage II.
