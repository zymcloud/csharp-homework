Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with poor prognosis and often recurs even after curative hepatic resection (HR) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA). In fact, recurrence is the most frequent cause of postoperative death in patients with HCC; it can arise through intrahepatic metastasis by the primary tumor or through the emergence of de novo tumors. Even though studies have examined numerous adjuvant therapies and chemotherapies for their ability to prevent recurrence, no consensus recommendations exist about their clinical application. To gain a comprehensive picture of clinical options, we identified 39 randomized controlled trials, involving 4113 participants, which explore the efficacy of adjuvant or chemotherapies to prevent HCC recurrence after potentially curative HR or RFA. The available evidence suggests a significant improvement in recurrence-free survival and overall survival when transarterial chemoembolization is used for patients who are at high risk for recurrence, lamivudine for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC (>500 copies of HBV DNA/ml), and interferon-α for patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected HCC. In contrast, available evidence does not definitively establish clinical benefits of interferon-β for patients with HCV-related HCC, interferon-α for patients with HBV-related HCC, or any of the following therapies for patients with HCC: iodine-125 brachytherapy, autologous tumor vaccination, adoptive immunotherapy, or therapy involving acyclic retinoid, vitamin K2 analog, iodine-131-labeled lipiodol, sorafenib, heparanase inhibitor PI-88, or capecitabine. Though the findings of our review should be interpreted with caution because of clinical heterogeneity and small sample size in the included trials, they highlight gaps in the evidence base, and therefore, may guide future research.
