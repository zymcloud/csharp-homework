Purpose:To evaluate the technical feasibility and safety of robot-assisted laparoscopic partial caudate lobe resection using the robotic surgical system.Materials and methods:This is a report of the use of robot-assisted laparoscopic partial caudate lobe resection on 2 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.Results:Robot-assisted laparoscopic partial caudate lobe resection was completed successfully in these 2 patients. The operating time was 137 and 150 minutes, respectively. The blood loss was 137 and 150 mL, respectively. They were able to tolerate liquids on the second postoperative day. Both patients recovered from the operation. They were discharged 4 and 5 days after the operation, respectively. The resected margins of both specimens were tumor free (R0 resections).Conclusions:Robot-assisted laparoscopic partial caudate lobe resection is a feasible and safe procedure. Our results demonstrate the advantages of robotic system on short-term outcomes and suggest the extended indication of minimally invasive hepatectomy even in the technically challenging anatomic area.
