The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a widespread human pathogen and chronic HBV infection is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Some cellular microRNAs are emerging as important regulators of virus-host interaction, indirectly or directly modulating HBV replication and pathogenesis. miR-125a binds the viral transcript encoding the surface antigen and interferes with its expression, thus inhibiting viral replication. Intriguingly, liver miR-125a expression has been found increased in patients with high levels of hepatic HBV-DNA. The present study investigates the mechanism by which liver exposure to HBV induces the expression of miR-125a. The analyses were first performed on liver biopsies from HBV patients, showing that the expression of the viral transactivator X protein (HBx) paralleled the increase of miR-125a expression. Then, transfection of HCC cell lines with an HBx-expressing vector showed a substantial increase of miR-125a expression. Overall, the available data depict a self-inhibitory feedback loop in which HBV, through HBx, increases the expression of miR-125a, that in turn interferes with expression of HBV surface antigen, thus repressing viral replication.
