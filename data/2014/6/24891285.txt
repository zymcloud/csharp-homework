Aim:To retrospectively analyze patients treated by renal tumor and venous tumor thrombus (VVT) removal and to introduce a less stressful and safer surgical method without thoracotomy in Neves level 3 cases.Methods:From 2002 to 2011, 33 patients underwent surgery for renal cell cancer combined with tumor thrombus of the inferior vena cava. Preoperative symptoms, tumor-node-metastasis classification of tumors, thrombus extension classified by Neves and Zincke system, types of surgical interventions, complications, postoperative management, and survival results were analyzed.Results:Ten patients had level 1, 17 had level 2, and 6 had level 3 thrombi according to Neves and Zincke. In 5 patients with level 3 thrombi, the liver was mobilized without thoracotomy and in 1 patient endoluminal occlusion was utilized. There was no intraoperative mortality. The median survival time of 10 patients who died during follow-up period was 36.6 months (range, 0-121 months).Conclusion:Renal cell cancer complicated with tumor thrombus without metastasis can be curable by performing a complete resection. The thrombus level determines the surgical approach and method. Our results confirm that level 3 caval vein tumor thrombus can be safely surgically treated by laparotomy with liver mobilization. Thoracotomy, use of cardiopulmonal bypass, and hypothermic circulatory arrest can be avoided with adequate liver- and vascular surgery methods.
