Background:Extended hemihepatectomy is usually recommended to treat large centrally located hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the morbidity and mortality are high because of the postoperative liver failure. Mesohepatectomy is seldom used because of its technical complexity. This study aimed to evaluate the short-term and long-term curative effect of mesohepatectomy.Methods:From January 2002 to September 2008, a total of 198 consecutive patients with centrally located HCC underwent hepatectomy in our department. According to the surgical procedures, they were divided into mesohepatectomy (group M, n=118), extended right hemihepatectomy (group RE, n=47) and extended left hemihepatectomy (group LE, n=33) groups. The surgical techniques, clinical pathological characteristics and outcomes were compared between group M, group RE and group LE.Results:The operative time of group M was significantly longer than that of the other two groups (P0.05). The morbidity rate in group M was significantly lower than that in group RE (37.3% vs 55.3%, P=0.034), but not in group LE (37.3% vs 24.2%, P=0.163). The biliary leakage tended to be more common in group M (10.2%, P>0.05). The incidence of postoperative liver failure in group M was significantly lower than that in group RE (1.7% vs 10.6%, P=0.032), but not in group LE (1.7% vs 6.1%, P=0.208). The 1-, 3- and 5-year tumor-free survival rates and the overall survival rates after mesohepatectomy were 53.4%, 30.5% and 16.9% and 67.8%, 45.5% and 28.9%, respectively.Conclusions:Mesohepatectomy is a safe and effective technique for centrally located HCC patients. Compared with extended right hemihepatectomy, mesohepatectomy can retain residual liver volume to the maximum limit and reduce postoperative liver failure rate. But no significant advantage was found compared mesohepatectomy to extended left hemihepatectomy.
