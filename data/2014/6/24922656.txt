Background:Inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase enhances the radiosensitivity of some cancer cells. We investigated the effect of RAD001, an mTOR inhibitor, on irradiated oral cancer cell lines.Materials and methods:Clonogenic assays were performed to determine the radiosensitivity of SCC4 and SCC25 cells after treatment with RAD001. Target protein phosphorylation, apoptosis, and cell-cycle progression were assessed in SCC4 cells treated with RAD001 with and without ionizing radiation.Results:RAD001 increased the radiosensitivity of SCC4 cells without affecting cell death; it also inhibited phosphorylation of mTOR, S6, and factor 4E binding protein 1 and reduced the clonogenic survival of irradiated cancer cells. RAD001 combined with radiation increased G2 arrest by activating CHK1, which phosphorylates CDC25C at Ser216, thereby inhibiting CDC2-cyclin B 1 complex formation.Conclusion:RAD001 enhances the radiosensitivity of SCC4 cells by inhibiting mTOR signaling and inducing G2 cell-cycle arrest through disruption of the G2 checkpoint.
