Objective:To investigate the correlation between carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatectomy.Methods:This study retrospectively analyzed the surgical outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 562 patients who underwent hepatectomy between January 2002 and December 2009 in the Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Postoperative prognostic factors were analyzed using univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model.Results:The sensibility of serum CEA and CEA-AFP combined in the detection of HCC was 7.1% (40/562) and 55.3% (311/562), respectively. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates and disease free survival rates of CEA-negative group (CEAConclusions:Serum CEA-positive expression is correlated to alcoholism and HCC multiple occurrences. Although serum CEA detection has limited value for HCC diagnosis, its positive expression does affect poor prognosis. Higher serum CEA level is an independent prognostic factor for poorer disease free survival.
