Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has a close relationship with cancer and is abnormally activated in many human cancers. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, but the molecular mechanisms of HCC are still poorly understood. Current studies indicate that Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays a key role in the development and progression of HCC. Validating the role and mechanism of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in HCC will provide a theoretical basis for early diagnosis and treatment of HCC. In this review, we summarize the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in HCC and the progress of current researches.
