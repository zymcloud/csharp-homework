Background:The complete removal of adenomatous polyps is important for reducing interval cancer after colonoscopy.Aims:To identify factors affecting the completeness of colonoscopic polypectomies and to evaluate the experience level of fellows who achieve competence compared with that of experts.Methods:Medical records of 1,860 patients who underwent at least one polypectomy for an adenomatous polyp at Seoul National University Hospital between March 2011 and February 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 3,469 adenomatous polyps were included. The lateral and deep margins of the resected polyps were evaluated to check the resection completeness.Results:Of the 3,469 adenomatous polyps, 1,389 (40.0 %) were removed by two experts and 2,080 (60.0 %) were removed by seven fellows. In the expert-treated group, larger size [odds ratio (OR) 2.81 for â‰¥20 mm, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.64-4.84, P < 0.001] and right-sided location (OR 1.31, 95 % CI 1.05-1.63, P = 0.019) were associated with incomplete resection. In the fellow-treated group, not only polyp characteristics [right-sided location (OR 1.41, 95 % CI 1.18-1.69, P < 0.001)], but also the cumulative number of procedures was also related to resection completeness. After 300 polypectomies, the complete resection rate of the fellows was comparable to that of the experts.Conclusions:In the fellow-treated group, the level of procedure experience was closely associated with the polypectomy outcomes. Meticulous attention is critical to ensure the completeness of polypectomies performed by trainee endoscopists during the training program.
