MicroRNAs have been suggested to play a vital role in regulate tumor progression and invasion. However, the expression of miR-335 in colorectal cancer (CRC) and its clinical significance are not known. Here, we report that miR-335 is a tumor suppressor by regulating expression of ZEB2. In this study, we showed that downregulated miR-335 levels in highly invasive CRC cell lines and tissues. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that patients with reduced miR-335 had a poor overall survival. Furthermore, enhancing the expression of miR-335 inhibited CRC cell migration and invasion in vitro and lung and liver metastasis in vivo, while silencing its expression resulted in increased migration and invasion. Additionally, we identified a novel miR-335 target, ZEB2, and the direct interaction between them was verified by 3'-untranslated region dual-luciferase reporter assay. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that miR-335 functions as a tumor suppressor and play a role in inhibiting metastasis of CRC cells through targeting ZEB2. These findings suggest that miR-335 may be useful as a new potential therapeutic target for CRC.
