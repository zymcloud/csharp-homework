Background:Liver transplantation (LT) and liver resection (LR) are currently considered the standard treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the outcomes of LT and LR are still inconclusive.Data sources:MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant studies. Surgical safety indices such as treatment-related morbidity and mortality, and efficacy indices such as overall and tumor-free survival outcomes were evaluated. Weighted mean differences and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a random-effects model.Results:Seventeen studies were included in this meta-analysis. LT achieved significantly higher rates of surgery-related morbidity (OR=1.47; 95% CI: 1.02-2.13) and mortality (OR=2.12; 95% CI: 1.11-4.05). Likewise, the 1-year survival rate was lower in LT (OR=0.86; 95% CI: 0.61-1.20). However, the 3- and 5-year survival rates were significantly higher in LT than in LR and the ORs were 1.12 (95% CI: 0.96-1.30) in 3 years and 1.84 (95% CI: 1.49-2.28) in 5 years. Furthermore, the tumor-free survival rate in LT was significantly higher than that in LR in 1, 3, 5 years after surgery, with the ORs of 1.72 (95% CI: 1.24-2.41), 3.75 (95% CI: 2.94-4.78) and 5.64 (95% CI: 4.35-7.31), respectively.Conclusions:One-year morbidity and mortality are higher in LT than in LR for patients with HCC. However, long-term survival and tumor-free survival rates are higher in patients treated with LT than those treated with LR.
