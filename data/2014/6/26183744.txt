A 61-year-old female was admitted to our hospital for esophageal cancer treatment. Esophagectomy with 2-field lymphadenectomy was performed. Postoperative findings revealed the lesion was a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma invading into the diaphragm and there were no carcinoma cells on the surgical margins. Eight months after surgery, a recurrence was suspected by the presence of tumors at the pericardia, right axillary lymph node and around the descending aorta. The patient was re-admitted for chemotherapy and administrated fluorouracil and cisplatin 4 days after admission. After 7 days, she complained of dysphagia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed no abnormal lesion that could cause the symptom. Computed tomography revealed massive progression of the pericardial tumor, bilateral pleural effusion and congested liver. Echocardiography showed the diffuse pericardial tumor caused restriction of ventricular dilation and hemodynamics of constrictive pericarditis. The patient died 29 days after re-admission. Autopsy revealed squamous cell carcinoma involving the mediatinum and pericardium. The pericardium was completely full of cancer tissue but no fluid. We concluded that the direct cause of death was neoplastic constrictive pericarditis.
