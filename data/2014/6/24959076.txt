To develop a chitosan-based nonviral gene carrier capable of delivering genes specifically into hepatoma cells, a bifunctional peptide composed of the TAT (transactivator of transcription) peptide and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) was conjugated with low molecular weight chitosan, resulting in a TAT-LHRH-chitosan conjugate (TLC). TLC/DNA nanoparticles (TLCDNPs) were characterized by agarose gel retardation, atomic force microscopy, and dynamic light scattering analysis. In vitro targeting specificity and transfection efficiency were analyzed with a GE IN Cell Analyzer 2000 High-Content Cellular Analysis System. The results demonstrated that TLC had stronger DNA condensing power than unmodified chitosan, and that TLCDNPs were of roughly round shape with average diameter of 70-85 nm and zeta potential of +30 mV and were relatively stable in solution. The in vitro study demonstrated TLC was highly selective for hepatoma cells and essentially nontoxic.
