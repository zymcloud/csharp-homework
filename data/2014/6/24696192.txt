Importance:In patients with low viral loads, high levels of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) have been shown to predict development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Whether high levels of HBsAg increase the risk for HCC recurrence after hepatic resection remains unknown.Objective:To investigate the association between levels of HBsAg and the risk for tumor recurrence after curative resection in HCC patients with low levels of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA.Design, setting, and participants:We performed a retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 1062 patients with low HBV DNA levels (Exposure:Partial hepatectomy for HCC.Main outcomes and measures:The risk for first tumor recurrence between patients with high and low HBsAg levels. We calculated cumulative incidences and hazard ratios after adjusting for competing mortality.Results:The risk for tumor recurrence increased with HBsAg levels of 1000 IU/mL or greater. When we compared the groups with low (Conclusions and relevance:A preoperative HBsAg level of 1000 IU/mL or greater is an independent risk factor for HCC recurrence in patients with low HBV DNA levels.
