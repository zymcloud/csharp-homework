Purpose:To report outcomes in patients with Child-Pugh B or C (CP B/C) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).Methods and materials:A prospective study of SBRT was developed for patients with CP B7 or B8 unresectable HCC, B8, >10 cm) treated off-study from 2004 to July 2012 were also reviewed. Patients were excluded if they were treated as a bridge-to-liver-transplant.Results:29 patients with CP B/C HCC were treated with SBRT (median dose 30 Gy in 6 fractions) from 2004 to December 2012. The majority had CP B7 liver function (69%) and portal vein tumor thrombosis (76%). The median survival was 7.9 months (95% CI: 2.8-15.1). Survival was significantly better in patients with CP=B7 and AFP≤4491 ng/mL. Of 16 evaluable patients, 63% had a decline in CP score by ≥2 points at 3 months.Conclusion:SBRT is a treatment option for selected HCC patients with small HCCs and modestly impaired (CP B7) liver function.
