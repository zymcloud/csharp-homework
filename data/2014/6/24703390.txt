Human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B) is an opportunistic pathogen associated with a growing number of complications in immunocompromised patients. Multiple reports of HHV-6B-associated hepatitis following primary HHV-6 infection and liver transplantation have appeared, but this has only been well documented in 1 patient after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). This report describes a case of acute hepatitis likely caused by HHV-6B in an HCT recipient who was successfully treated with ganciclovir. HHV-6B DNA was demonstrated in plasma and hepatic tissue using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical stains. Chromosomal integration was ruled out. We review the literature reporting HHV-6B-associated hepatitis, which may be an underappreciated cause of liver disease after HCT.
