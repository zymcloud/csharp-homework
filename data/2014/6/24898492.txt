An 84-year-old Japanese man was admitted with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). He underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Three weeks later, he developed sudden-onset right pleural effusion mixed with bile. Drip infusion cholangiography-computed tomography revealed leakage of the contrast agent, which passed from the HCC to the pleural cavity through a perforation in the diaphragm. The patient's condition improved after thoracic and endoscopic nasobiliary drainage. The occurrence of pleural effusion mixed with bile is a rare complication of RFA. This case provides important information about the morbidity, prevention, and treatment of this complication.
