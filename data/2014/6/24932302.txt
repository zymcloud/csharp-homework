Eltrombopag is an oral thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist that increases platelet counts in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and in patients with liver cirrhosis. When cirrhotic patients with thrombocytopenia undergo elective invasive procedures, eltrombopag treatment reduces the requirement for platelet transfusions. However, TPO is known to have proliferative effects on hepatic progenitor cells and hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, which indicates that eltrombopag may accelerate tumor progression. Thus, the effect of eltrombopag on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression is an important issue. The current study describes two cases of HCC with cirrhosis-related thrombocytopenia. A two-week administration of eltrombopag increased platelet counts from 4.8 to 11.3×104 /μl in case 1 and 4.5 to 23.2×104 /μl in case 2. However, no changes were identified in the serum levels of tumor markers or HCC size following eltrombopag administration in the two cases. These HCCs were curatively treated by radiofrequency ablation without platelet transfusions or serious bleeding. Thus, short-term eltrombopag administration may not accelerate HCC proliferation and may be beneficial for invasive HCC treatment in cirrhotic patients with thrombocytopenia.
