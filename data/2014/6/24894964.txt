Background:To investigate retrospectively the clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes of young patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatectomy.Methods:From January 2003 to December 2012, a total of 153 patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who received liver resection were included in the study. The clinicopathological features were analyzed retrospectively. The perioperative data were compared between those aged 40 years (the older group). Prognostic factors and long-term survival were evaluated.Results:The young group had more hepatitis B virus-related HCC than the older group (87.2% vs 66.3%, P = 0.031). In the young group, 15 patients (21.5%) were overweight (body mass index 25 to 29.9 kg/m2) or obese (body mass index â‰¥30 kg/m2), and 38 patients (45.8%) were overweight or obese in the older group (P = 0.032). Other clinicopathological characteristics were similar between the two groups. The perioperative data showed that the older group had more pulmonary infection after hepatectomy. Vascular invasion and high Edmondson-Steiner grade were the independent prognostic factors for long-term survival. There was no statistical difference between the young group and the older group in overall survival and disease-free survival (P = 0.109 and P = 0.087, respectively).Conclusions:Liver resection for young patients with large HCC was safe and efficacious and should be recommended.
