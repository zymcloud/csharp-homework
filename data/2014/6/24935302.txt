Background:Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related chronic liver disease is one of the most common indications for liver transplantation (LT). Patient data in our unit were collected to evaluate the impact of liver tumor on outcomes in patients with HBV-related cirrhosis who underwent LT.Methods:HBV transplantation patients in our hospital from August 2002 to March 2012 were analyzed and compared according to LT indications: decompensated cirrhosis (DEC) or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). For HCC patients, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the cutoff tumor size for prognosis, namely the maximum tumor diameter. According to the cutoff size, patients were divided into 2 groups: large-size HCC and small-size HCC. The correlations among other clinicopathologic factors were also investigated. Potential prognostic factors were evaluated with the use of Cox proportional hazards model analysis.Results:The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates of the 111 HBV-related patients were 76.2%, 43.2%, and 32.9%, respectively. Patients with HCC had significantly poorer overall survival than those with only DEC (P Conclusions:Tumor existence and tumor size are prognostic factors in HBV-related cirrhosis. With the use of a tumor size cutoff value of 4.25 cm, patients with large-size tumors have significantly poorer overall survival than those with small-size tumors.
