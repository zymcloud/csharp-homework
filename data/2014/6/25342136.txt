Purpose:Most transplant centers use chemoembolisation as locoregional bridge therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) before liver transplantation (LT). Chemoembolisation using beads loaded with doxorubicin (DEBDOX) is a promising technique that enables delivery of a large quantity of drugs against HCC. We sought to assess the imaging-histologic correlation after DEBDOX chemoembolisation.Materials and methods:All consecutive patients who had undergone DEBDOX chemoembolisation before receiving liver graft for HCC were included. Tumour response was evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) and modified RECIST (mRECIST) criteria. The result of final imaging made before LT was correlated with histological data to predict tumour necrosis.Results:Twenty-eight patients underwent 43 DEBDOX procedures for 45 HCC. Therapy had a significant effect as shown by a decrease in the mean size of the largest nodule (p = 0.02) and the sum of viable part of tumour sizes according to mRECIST criteria (p Conclusion:Our data confirm the potential benefit of DEBDOX chemoembolisation as bridge therapy before LT, and they provide a rational basis for new studies focusing on recurrence-free survival after LT. Radiologic evaluation according to mRECIST criteria enables accurate prediction of tumour necrosis, whereas RECIST criteria do not.
