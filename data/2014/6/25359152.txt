Hepatocellular carcinoma occasionally metastasizes to extrahepatic organs, rarely to the mediastinal lymph nodes. We present the case of a 64-year-old man who presented with nodules in the upper and right lower lobes of the lung 4 years after undergoing resection of a hepatocellular carcinoma. We performed wedge resection of both lesions. Pathological examination showed that the lesion in the right upper lobe was non-small cell lung cancer and that in the right lower lobe hepatocellular carcinoma. We accordingly performed right upper lobectomy with lymph node dissection. Nine months later, enlarged subcarinal and segmental lymph nodes were detected and mediastinal lymph node metastases from the hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed by transbronchial needle aspiration.
