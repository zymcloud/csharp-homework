Background:Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a widely used therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Several reports have demonstrated the aggressive local recurrence of HCC after RFA, suggesting that induction of further malignant transformation of HCC has occurred.Methods:Eighty-eight (88) patients with HCC who underwent hepatic resection were included in this study. Hepatectomy was indicated for local recurrence of HCC after RFA (n = 10, RFA group) and for HCC without prior RFA (n = 78, non-RFA group). Clinicopathological data and the patient's prognosis after hepatectomy were compared between the two groups. Expression levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), CD44, and vascular endothelial growth factor messenger RNA (mRNA) in the tumor tissues were also examined.Results:The RFA group showed higher frequency of portal vein invasion and less tumor differentiation compared with the non-RFA group (p Conclusions:These results suggest that local HCC recurrence after RFA shows an aggressive tumor phenotype and poor prognosis through the enhanced expressions of HIF-1 and EpCAM in the residual HCC tumors after insufficient or sub-lethal treatment by RFA.
