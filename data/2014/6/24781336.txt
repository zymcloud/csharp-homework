We determined the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) indicator proteins, E-cadherin (E-cad), vimentin (VIM), mucin 1 (MUC1) and S100 calcium-binding protein A4 (S100A4) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient tissue samples. We also investigated the relationship between the expression of these proteins and clinicopathologic factors in HCC. Finally, we assessed the potential value of these markers as prognostic indicators of survival in HCC patients. The expression of E-cad, VIM, MUC1 and S100A4 EMT indicator proteins was assessed in tissue microarray HCC tissue sections and corresponding peritumoral normal tissues by immunohistochemistry. In addition, the expression for the four EMT indicator proteins was correlated with clinicopathological features of HCC and patient outcome. Comparison of clinicopathological characteristics and immunohistochemistry by χ(2) analysis revealed that downregulation of E-cad in HCC was significantly associated with later TNM cancer stage (P = 0.012), gross classification (P = 0.018), regional lymph node metastasis (P = 0.036) and liver cirrhosis (P = 0.028). Increased S100A4 expression in HCC was significantly associated with differentiation (P = 0.032), tumor with a complete fibrous capsule (P = 0.031) and portal vein invasion (P = 0.038). High VIM expression in HCC was significantly associated with high serum α-fetoprotein levels (P = 0.016). We also observed that low E-cad expression was significantly associated with overexpression of VIM (P = 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analysis revealed that low E-cad expression (HR = 0.164, 95 % CI 0.072 to 0.373, P
