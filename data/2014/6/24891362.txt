In this issue of Cancer Discovery, Horwitz and colleagues identified a subtype of hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) bearing VEGFA genomic amplification that is particularly sensitive to VEGFA inhibition and is also more sensitive to sorafenib treatment. Taken conjointly, these data suggest that VEGFA genomic amplification can be used as a biomarker for personalized treatment of HCC with sorafenib.
