Objective:Liver resection is increasingly performed in elderly patients who are suspected of increased postoperative morbidity (PM) and reduced overall survival (OS). Patient selection based on the identification of age-adjusted risk factors may help to decrease PM and OS.Design and participants:Prospectively collected data of 879 patients undergoing elective hepatic resection were analyzed. This population was stratified into three age cohorts: >70 years (n = 228; 26 %), 60-69 years (n = 309; 35 %), and Results:The incidence of severe (p Conclusion:Although increased age should not be a contraindication for liver resection, this study accents the avoidance of major blood loss in elderly patients and a stringent patient selection based on preexisting comorbidities.
