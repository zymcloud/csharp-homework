Hepatocellular carcinoma with colonic metastasis is rare. It mainly occurs by direct invasion and presents with bloody stools. We describe a patient with haematogenous metastasis to the rectum who presented with tenesmus. To our knowledge, such an association has not been reported previously. Colonic metastasis should be considered when patients with hepatocellular carcinoma present with bloody stools or tenesmus.
