Background/aims:To observe the clinical safety of bioartificial liver supporting system constructed by human hepatoma cell line.Methodology:Seventeen patients with liver failure were treated with C3A-cell-constructed bioartificial liver supporting system, contrasting the difference of biochemical results and imaging data with 9 patients treated with non-bioartificial liver during 5-year treatment.Results:11 cases of Treatment Group survived at 3 months' follow-up, among whom 2 cases underwent hepatic transplantation. 9 cases without hepatic transplantation survived in 5-year follow-up, and 1 of them was found to occur focal liver lesion at the 5th years, and had hepatic lobectomy. Pathological prompt: hepatocellular carcinoma with moderate differentiation. Totally 4 patients in Control Group survived after 3 months' follow-up, including 1 patient of hepatic transplantation. All the 3 patients without hepatic transplantation survived the last 5-year follow-up, with basically normal biochemical indicators and no focal liver lesion were found by imaging examination.Conclusions:It was safe to use bioartificial liver constructed by tumor cell line C3A to treat liver failure.
