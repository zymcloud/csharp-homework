Objective:To explore the risk factors of intra-abdominal bacterial infection (IAI) after liver transplantation (LT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A series of 82 HCC patients who received LT surgeries in our department between March 2004 and April 2010 was recruited in this study. Then we collected and analyzed the clinical data retrospectively. Statistical analysis system (SPSS) software was adopted to perform statistical analysis. Chi-square test, t-test and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to analyze the clinical data and compute the significance of the incidences of early-stage IAI after LT for HCC patients. Binary logistic regression was performed to screen out the risk factors, and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to compute the independent risk factors.Results:A series of 13 patients (13/82, 15.9%) had postoperative IAI. The independent risk factors of postoperative intra-abdominal bacterial infections after LT for HCC patients were preoperative anemia [Hemoglobin (HGB) 400 mL), with the odds ratios at 8.121 (95% CI, 1.417 to 46.550, P=0.019) and 5.911 (95% CI, 1.112 to 31.432, P=0.037).Conclusions:Postoperative IAI after LT in patients with HCC was a common complication. Preoperative moderate to severe anemia, as well as postoperative intra-abdominal hemorrhage more than 400 mL within the first 72 hours might independently indicate high risk of IAI for these patients.
