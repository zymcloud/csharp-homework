In recent years, over 1000 reports have been published on the association between hepatic diseases and gene mutations which may result in pathogenic amino acids. Most of the studies focus on the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim was to systematically examine the published literature on the association between the mutations of arginine, serine, and threonine and hepatic diseases, particularly HCC. The Biosciences information service database was systematically searched before July 10, 2012. Of the initially selected 471 publications, 112 articles were included in this study. Meta-analyses were conducted for 3 amino acids. Risk ratios were used to analyze the association between amino acids and liver diseases. We analyze the literature on the association between gene mutations and hepatic diseases, especially in patients with HCC. Full-text articles were analyzed by 4 independent researchers. Some amino acid mutations were found only in people with liver diseases--not in the general population. Arginine and threonine mutations occurred more frequently in patients with hepatic diseases, compared to the normal population. There is a statistically significant association between arginine mutations and the risk of HCC and serine mutations and the risk of HCC.
