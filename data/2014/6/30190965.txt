Liver transplantation is the best treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma in the setting of chronic liver disease, completely removing malignancy and underlying diseased liver tissue. Technical aspects of liver transplantation have improved over the years, along with outcomes. But challenges continue in the areas of expanding existing indications for transplant with limited organ supply, calling for optimization of patient selection and the development of alternative or adjunctive treatment options. Expansion of existing transplant criteria will help identify patients most likely to have good outcomes. Locoregional and systemic treatments showing therapeutic promise are being investigated for use in achieving acceptable oncologic effect. Improvements in post-transplant treatment and continued attempts to enlarge the donor pool will continue to provide avenues for further improvements in outcomes.
