Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the few malignant tumours often treated without prior histological confirmation (in the patient with cirrhosis). Contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging is frequently diagnostic of HCC with a high degree of accuracy. However, on occasion, a liver biopsy is required, a complication of which can be needle-track metastasis. We present the case of a 57-year-old man who had previously undergone a liver transplant; he was found to have abdominal wall metastasis at the site of a prior percutaneous biopsy. This is the second case until now date of needle-track metastasis that presented following liver transplantation.
