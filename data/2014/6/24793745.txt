The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of blood NLR in patients with intermediate-advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who received transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) combined with Sorafenib. A total of 40 patients with intermediate-advanced HCC from January 1, 2010, through May 31, 2013, treated with concurrent TAE in combination with Sorafenib were admitted to this study in our hospital. Potential prognostic factors, including serum NLR, were analyzed. The pretreatment mean NLR was 3.0; 21 (52.5 %) patients with elevated high NLR (>3.0). The median survival of patients with a high NLR was 14 months (95 % CI 10.1-17.9 months) compared with 26 months (95 % CI 17.4-34.6 months) for patients with a low NLR; a significant difference was found in overall survival (P = 0 0.001). Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer staging classification and NLR >3.0 were all predictors of poorer over survival. Multivariate analysis showed that high NLR was independent factors associated with worse survival. A high periprocedural NLR independently predicts poor survival in patients with unresectable HCC undergoing TAE combined with Sorafenib.
