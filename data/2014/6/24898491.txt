A 78-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma was admitted to our hospital for vertigo after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging revealed metastasis in the cerebellar vermis. Although the cerebellar metastasis decreased in size after cyberknife radiotherapy, multiple enhancing nodules appeared in the cerebral ventricles. A diagnosis of intraventricular dissemination from the cerebellar metastatic lesion originating from the hepatocellular carcinoma was made. Six intrathecal administrations of 20 mg of methotrexate through lumbar puncture resulted in a dramatic decrease in the intraventricular dissemination. Although intraventricular dissemination recurred 4 months later, these lesions disappeared after an additional 8 administrations of intrathecal methotrexate. Intraventricular dissemination arising from hepatocellular carcinoma is rare. Here we report a case that was successfully treated by intrathecal chemotherapy with methotrexate.
