Background and aims:We aimed to compare clinical outcomes and safety after sorafenib therapy between patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B or C hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) aged â‰¥75 years (aged group, n=179) and those with BCLC stage B or C HCC aged Patients and methods:We compared overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), best treatment response and sorafenib related serious adverse events (SAEs) of grade 3 or more in the two groups. Furthermore, for reducing the selection bias, we compared clinical outcome of these two groups using propensity score matching analysis.Results:The median OS and PFS intervals were 9.7 and 3.8 months in the aged group and 8.2 and 3.3 months in the control group (P=0.641 for OS and P=0.068 for PFS). Disease control rates were 49.2% (88/179) in the aged group and 49.1% (137/279) in the control group (P>0.999). Objective response rates were 15.1% (27/179) in the aged group and 14.3% (40/279) in the control group (P=0.892). Treatment related SAEs of grade 3 or more were observed in 51 patients (28.5%) in the aged group and in 69 patients (24.7%) in the control group (P=0.385). In the propensity score matched cohort (132 pairs), no significant difference in the two groups was observed in terms of OS (P=0.898) and PFS (P=0.407).Conclusion:In BCLC stage B or C HCC patients treated with sorafenib, life expectancy, disease progression, treatment efficacy and SAEs are unaffected by age over 75 years.
