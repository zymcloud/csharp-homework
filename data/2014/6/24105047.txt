Objective:Although peroxiredoxin 3 (PRX3) was reported to be overexpressed in liver cancer, the precise function of PRX3 in the development and/or progression of liver cancer remained to be obscure. The present study was conducted to investigate the response of PRX3 to oxidative stress in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.Methods:After successful knockdown of PRX3 expression by small interfering RNA, we treated HCC cell lines Hep-3b and Hep-G2 with gradient concentrations of H2O2 and detected cell proliferation, apoptosis, and the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cells.Results:After low-dose (5-20 Î¼mol/l) H2O2 treatment, the ROS level was significantly higher in PRX3-knockdown Hep-3b cells than in controls. In addition, PRX3 down-regulation resulted in decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, and increased caspase 3 activity of Hep-3b cells. We did not notice significant difference between PrxIII knockdown and control Hep-G2 cells in ROS level, cell viability or apoptosis.Conclusion:Our results suggest that PRX3 is an indispensable ROS scavenger that protects tumor cells against oxidative damage and subsequent apoptosis, which provides a clue that PRX3 may be involved in the chemotherapeutic resistance of liver cancer. The underlying mechanism for PRX3 function needs further investigation.
