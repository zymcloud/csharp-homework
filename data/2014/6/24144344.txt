Background:Surgical results have been reported to be improved in hepatic resections for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in recent years, but the detailed trends in surgical results for HCC in a single high-volume center are still not clear.Methods:Surgical results in 1,000 hepatic resections for HCC performed at a single medical center from 1989 to 2011 were analyzed. Patients were divided into 3 groups: those performed in the early period (1989 to 1995, n = 181), the middle period (1996 to 2004, n = 391), and the late period (2005 to 2011, n = 428).Results:Hospital mortality (3.9%, 1.0%, and .5%; P = .0027) and morbidity (45%, 24%, and 15%; P Conclusions:Surgical results of hepatic resections for HCC were significantly improved, with the mortality rate nearly reaching 0%. The 5-year survival rate after hepatic resections for HCC was also improved to 78%, but the consistently high rate of HCC recurrence after hepatic remains a problem.
