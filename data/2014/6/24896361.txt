Hepatic fibrosis is caused by an imbalance between production and dissolution of extracellular matrix after chronic and inflmmatory injury, when hepatic stellate cells are stimulated to proliferate and secret extracellular matrix. The most common causes of liver fibrosis are chronic viral hepatitis B and C. Cirrhosis is the most advanced stage of fibrosis, which usually develop into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). microRNAs participate the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis or even the onset of HCC. In this review, we will summarize the role of miRNA in the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis fibrosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis fibrosis, primary biliary cirrhosis and HCC onset, especially in the regulation of stellate cells.
