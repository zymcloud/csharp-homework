Primary hepatic cancer is one of common malignant tumors. When being diagnosed, most patients were in middle and advanced stage and missed opportunities for surgical treatment. Therefore, chemotherapy and Chinese medicines become the main therapies for advanced primary hepatic cancer. This study was designed to observe the efficacy of Ganfule prescription combined with chemotherapy in treating advanced primary hepatic cancer. In the study, 58 cases of advanced primary hepatic cancer were randomly divided into the treatment group (30 cases) and the control group (28 cases). The treatment group was administered with Ganfule prescription combining with chemotherapy, while the control group was given chemotherapy alone. The tumors progress, quality of life, serum AFP level were evaluated in every three treatment cycles; and the survival rate was followed up for one year. According to the results of this study, after the treatment, there was no statistical significance in the comparison between the two groups in terms of response rate (RR) and disease control rate (DCR) (30.0% vs 25.0%, P = 0.670; 66.7% vs 60.7%, P = 0.637). The improvement rate of KPS score in the treatment group was significantly higher than that of the control group (43.33% vs 21.43%, P < 0.05). The reduction of serum AFP level in the treatment group was more significant than that of the control group (P < 0.05). During the one-year follow-up visit, the survival rate of the treatment group was 26.67%, and the control group was 25.00%, which indicated no statistical significance. This study drew the following conclusion that the oral administration of Ganfule prescription could improve the quality of life of patients of primary hepatic cancer, decrease the serum AFP level and maintain the disease control rate and the one-year survival rate.
