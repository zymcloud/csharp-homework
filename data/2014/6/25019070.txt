Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a disease with poor survival rates unless recognized and treated early, ranks as the fifth most common cancer worldwide. Previous researches has led some authors to choose radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as the primary treatment even the tumor is resectable. Dr. Roayaie's study retrospectively analyzed the surgical outcome of HCC â‰¤2 cm. The results obtained in the studies indicate that anatomic resection may achieve better survival for patients with well-preserved liver function, and without liver cirrhosis. This research also revealed the presence of satellite lesions and microvascular invasion were evident in such early tumors, as the benefit of anatomic resection is unique and cannot be duplicated by ablation. Further RCTs with large sample sizes and long-term follow-up are still required to clarify which should be the best treatment of choice.
