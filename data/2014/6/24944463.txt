The hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes an acute infection that is frequently asymptomatic, but a spontaneous eradication of HCV infection occurs only in one-third of patients. The remaining two-thirds develop a chronic infection that, in most cases, shows an indolent course and a slow progression to the more advanced stages of the illness. Nearly a quarter of cases with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) develop liver cirrhosis with or without hepatocellular carcinoma. The indolent course of the illness may be troubled by the occurrence of a hepatic flare, i.e., a spontaneous acute exacerbation of CHC due to changes in the immune response, immunosuppression and subsequent restoration, and is characterized by an increase in serum aminotransferase values, a frequent deterioration in liver fibrosis and necroinflammation but also a high frequency of sustained viral response to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin treatment. A substantial increase in serum aminotransferase values during the clinical course of CHC may also be a consequence of a superinfection by other hepatotropic viruses, namely hepatitis B virus (HBV), HBV plus hepatitis D virus, hepatitis E virus, cytomegalovirus, particularly in geographical areas with high endemicity levels. The etiology of a hepatic flare in patients with CHC should always be defined to optimize follow-up procedures and clinical and therapeutic decisions.
