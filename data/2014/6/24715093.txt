Three N-(pyridine-2-ylcarbamothioyl)benzamide derivatives were synthesized by the reaction of potassium thiocyanate, benzoyl chloride, and 2-amino pyridine derivatives in one pot. The obtained derivatives were oxidized using copper(ii) chloride. During the oxidation, two hydrogen atoms were removed, cyclization of the derivatives occurred, and finally, three new N-(2H-[1,2,4]thiadiazolo[2,3-a]pyridine-2-ylidene)benzamide derivatives were produced. Coordination of these three new derivative ligands to the copper(II) ion resulted in the formation of three new complexes: dichlorobis(N-(2H-[1,2,4]thiadiazolo[2,3-a]pyridine-2-ylidene)benzamide)copper(II), dichlorobis(N-(7-methyl-2H-[1,2,4]thiadiazolo[2,3-a]pyridine-2ylidene)benzamide)copper(II), and dichlorobis(N-(5-methyl-2H-[1,2,4]thiadiazolo[2,3-a]pyridine-2-ylidene)benzamide)copper(II). All the synthesized products were characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, and (13)C NMR spectroscopies. Crystal structures of the obtained N-(pyridine-2-ylcarbamothioyl)benzamide derivatives, N-(2H-[1,2,4]thiadiazolo[2,3-a]pyridine-2-ylidene)benzamide derivatives, and complexes were determined using X-ray single-crystal diffraction; the positions of atoms, bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles were also determined. In all complexes, the coordination of two large monodentate ligands and two chloride anions to the copper(ii) ion resulted in the formation of a stable planar geometry around the central ion. Three N-(pyridine-2-ylcarbamothioyl)benzamide derivatives, three N-(2H-[1,2,4]thiadiazolo[2,3-a]pyridine-2-ylidene)benzamide derivatives, and three complexes were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against five human cancer cell lines (breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-MC, prostate adenocarcinoma cell line LNCap, nasopharyngeal epidermoid carcinoma cell line KB, and liver cancer cell line HEPG-2) using an in vitro analysis. The N-(pyridine-2-ylcarbamothioyl)benzamide derivatives showed no cytotoxic activity, whereas the N-(2H-[1,2,4]thiadiazolo[2,3-a]pyridine-2-ylidene)benzamide derivatives and their complexes showed significant cytotoxicity, especially against MDA-MB-231 and LNCap cell lines. The complexes demonstrated smaller IC50 values than N-(2H-[1,2,4]thiadiazolo[2,3-a]pyridine-2-ylidene)benzamide derivatives.
