The clinical data of a patient with acute-on-chronic liver failure were analyzed retrospectively. The patient has suffered from hepatitis B for 30 years. His liver function deteriorated, yielding Child-Pugh grade C and reaching a model for end-stage liver disease score of 33 points within a short period; this condition was complicated with highly active variceal bleeding and coagulation system failure (PT > 100 s). The patient also presented hepatocellular carcinoma. Comprehensive treatments included effective inhibition of hepatitis B virus replication and intensive care support. Piggyback orthotopic liver transplantation was performed as the final treatment. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged after surgery.
