Our study utilized data from the 2002 to 2012 United Network for Organ Sharing registry to evaluate model for end-stage liver disease era trends in US liver transplantations focused on patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hepatitis C (HCV), alcoholic liver disease (ALD), and HCC.

However, overall long-term survival was significantly higher in patients with NASH and ALD (p
