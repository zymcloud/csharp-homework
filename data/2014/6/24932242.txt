Percutaneous ethanol injection therapy (PEIT) has been administered as a safe therapeutic modality for patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Due to the nature of the straight approaching line of a PEIT or radiofrequency ablation needle, penetrating the vessels that are interposed between the dermal insertion point and the nodule is unavoidable. A device with an overcoat needle and coaxial curved PEIT needle was created that facilitated a detour around interposing large vessels in order to avoid unnecessary harmful effects that result from the PEIT procedure. Two cases of HCC located adjacent to a neighboring large vessel were treated with a curved PEIT needle. The curved PEIT needle, which is connected to an outer needle, enabled deviation around the interposing vessels and successful connection with the HCC. Careful use of the curved line of the PEIT needle enabled the safe and successful performance of the PEIT without any requirement for specific training. This hand-assisted technique may be an applicable treatment for small HCC located beneath large vessels as a direct therapeutic method using ultrasound guidance.
