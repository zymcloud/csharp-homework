Background:In patients with solitary hepatocellular carcinoma ≤5 cm without macrovascular invasion, it is unknown whether the initial anatomic resection improves the long-term survival.Methods:Among 545 initial hepatectomies for hepatocellular carcinoma between 2000 and 2012, the 233 patients with the aforementioned criteria of hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled.Results:The mean observation time was 1,125 days. Disease-free 5-year survival rates with and without anatomic resection were 46% and 23%, respectively (P = .009). Multivariate analyses for disease-free survival rates revealed the risk factors to be α-fetoprotein (odds ratio, 1.6; P = .028) and anatomic resection (odds ratio, .7; P = .048), while increased Child-Pugh score (>5) was the only independent risk factor for overall survival (odds ratio, 1.8; P = .043). The 5-year overall survival rates with and without Child-Pugh score 5 were 74% and 40%, respectively (P Conclusions:Initial anatomic resection for small solitary hepatocellular carcinoma without macrovascular invasion improved disease-free survival rates remarkably.
