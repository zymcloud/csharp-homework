Background:Single operator choledochoscopy is a platform used to assist in the confirmation of diagnosis of biliary lesions. However, there are little data regarding the interobserver agreement of imaging interpretation. Our objective was to assess the interobserver agreement in single operator choledochoscopy interpretation.Methods:38 De-identified SPY Choledochoscopy video clips were sent to 7 interventional endoscopists. They were asked to score the videos on presence of four criteria selected by the investigators: growth, stricture, hyperplasia, and ulceration. Observers also chose a final diagnosis from the categories of cancer, hyperplasia, inflammation, or normal. Kappa scores were calculated for the scoring of the four criteria and for the selection of the final diagnosis.Results:The overall interobserver agreement was fair in scoring for the presence of a growth (K=0.28, SE 0.035) and stricture (K=0.32, SE 0.035). Scoring for ulceration was slight to fair (K=0.17, SE 0.035). There was only slight agreement for the presence of hyperplasia (K=0.11, SE 0.035); and presumed final diagnosis based on imaging (K=0.18, SE 0.022).Conclusion:The results of this study support the need for an effort to identify and validate cholangioscopy imaging criteria for biliary pathology. This may assist in improving the reliability of the diagnostic value of cholangioscopy as its use becomes more widespread.
