Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection afflicts a reported 170 million people worldwide and is often complicated by cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Morbidity and mortality are decreased with the successful treatment of chronic HCV infection. Increased understanding of the HCV has allowed further development of new direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents against the HCV and has also allowed the development of IFN-free oral treatment regimens. In late 2013 the first nucleotide polymerase inhibitor regimen with RBV alone for genotypes 2/3 and in combination with a 12-week regimen of PEG-IFN + RBV for genotypes 1, 4 was approved for use in the US. A number of promising new DAA regimens which are IFN-free are in phase 3 development and the first will likely be approved for use in the US in 2014. The currently approved regimens are discussed in detail and currently available data on future regimens are reviewed herein.
