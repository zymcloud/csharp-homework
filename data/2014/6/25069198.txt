Objective:To observe the effect of moxibustion at "Ganshu" (BL18) on levels of Livin (a novel member of the inhibitors of apoptosis family and plays crucial roles in apoptosis, cell proliferation, and cell cycle control) in the liver tissue in rats with precancerous lesion of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), so as to explore its mechanism underlying improvement of HCC.Methods:Sixty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control group (n = 10), model group (n = 20), moxibustion-20 d group (n = 15) and moxibustion-40 d group (n = 15). HCC model was established by intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine (DEN, 50 mg/kg), once every 3 days for 12 weeks. Moxibustion was applied to bilateral "Ganshu" (BL 18), once every other day for 10 times (moxibustion-20 d group) and 20 times (moxibustion-40 d group), respectively. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) content was detected with ELISA and Livin immunoactivity of the liver tissue detected using immunohistochemistry.Results:After modeling, serum AFP content and liver Livin immunoactivity of the model group were significantly increased in comparison with the control group (P 0.05).Conclusion:Moxibustion can down-regulate liver Livin protein expression, which probably has a role in promoting hepatocellular apoptosis to inhibit precancerous lesion and to postpone hepatocarcinogenesis.
