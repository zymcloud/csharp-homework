Background:The long-term survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) who received surgical resection (SR) or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) remains unclear. We compared the efficacy of SR and TACE by using a propensity score analysis.Methods:A total of 247 and 181 HCC patients with PVTT undergoing SR and TACE, respectively, were evaluated. One hundred eight pairs of matched patients were selected from each treatment arm by using a propensity score analysis.Results:Of all patients, the estimated 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of patients receiving SR and TACE were 85 versus 60 %, 68 versus 42 %, and 61 versus 33 %, respectively (p Conclusions:For either unselected patients or patients in the propensity model, SR provides significantly better long-term survival than TACE. SR should be considered as a priority treatment in this subgroup of HCC patients.
