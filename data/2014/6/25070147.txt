Aim:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with chronic inflammation derived from various origins. We investigated whether high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) could predict recurrence and survival after curative treatment for early stage hepatitis C virus-related HCC (C-HCC).Methods:We enrolled 387 patients with three or fewer C-HCC nodules, none of which exceeded 3 cm, and of Child-Pugh class A or B who underwent radiofrequency ablation. We divided the patients into high and low hsCRP groups based on the optimal cut-off value for recurrence using a split-sample method and maximally selected rank statistics. Differences in recurrence and survival rates were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Hazard ratios of hsCRP were adjusted with confounding factors using a multiple Cox regression model. We also assessed the correlations between hsCRP levels and clinical parameters.Results:The optimal hsCRP cut-off value was 0.08 mg/dL. The cumulative recurrence rates after 5 years in the high and low hsCRP groups were 90.0% and 82.2%, respectively (P = 0.028), and the corresponding survival rates were 50.9% and 71.8%, respectively (P Conclusion:Slight elevation of the hsCRP level, even within the normal range, can predict recurrence and survival after curative treatment among patients with early stage C-HCC.
