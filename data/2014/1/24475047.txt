Background:De novo cancers are a growing problem that has become one of the leading causes of late mortality after liver transplantation. The incidences and risk factors varied among literatures and fewer concerned the Eastern population.Aims:The aim of this study was to examine the incidence and clinical features of de novo cancers after liver transplantation in a single Chinese center.Methods:569 patients who received liver transplantation and survived for more than 3 months in a single Chinese center were retrospectively reviewed.Results:A total of 18 de novo cancers were diagnosed in 17 recipients (13 male and 4 female) after a mean of 41 Â± 26 months, with an overall incidence of 3.2%, which was lower than that in Western people. Of these, 8 (3.32%) cases were from 241 recipients with malignant liver diseases before transplant, while 10 (3.05%) cases were from 328 recipients with benign diseases. The incidence rates were comparable, p = 0.86. Furthermore, 2 cases developed in 1 year, 5 cases in 3 years and 11 cases over 3 years. The most frequent cancers developed after liver transplantation were similar to those in the general Chinese population but had much higher incidence rates.Conclusions:Liver transplant recipients were at increased risk for developing de novo cancers. The incidence rates and pattern of de novo cancers in Chinese population are different from Western people due to racial and social factors. Pre-transplant malignant condition had no relationship to de novo cancer. Exact risk factors need further studies.
