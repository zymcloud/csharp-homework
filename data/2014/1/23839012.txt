To investigate the potential role of small glutamine-rich TPR-containing protein A (SGTA) in hepatocarcinogenesis, immunohistochemistry and Western blot were performed to detect the expression of SGTA in clinical Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples, adjacent nontumorous liver tissues and HCC cell lines. In addition, expression of SGTA was correlated with clinicopathological variables and univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed to determine the prognostic significance. Moreover, the biological significance of the aberrant expression of SGTA was investigated in vitro. Both immunohistochemistry evaluation and Western blot analyses demonstrated that SGTA was overexpressed in HCC tissues compared with adjacent nontumorous liver tissues. Expression of SGTA directly correlated with the histological grades of HCC and high expression of SGTA was associated with a poor prognosis. SGTA depletion by siRNA inhibited cell proliferation, blocked S-phase and mitotic entry in Huh7 cells. Western blot analyses showed that SGTA depletion decreased cyclin A and cyclin B levels. Taken together, owing to overexpression of SGTA in HCC and its important role in predicting poor prognosis and the development of HCC, SGTA could be a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target of HCC.
