Staging systems are an attempt to incorporate the biology and therapy for cancer in a way that enables categorization and prediction of oncologic outcomes.

This article discusses the ways in which improved understanding of these diseases has informed the evolution of prognostication systems as applied to hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and hepatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.
