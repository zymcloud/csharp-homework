It is widely known that hepatitis and its complications such as cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma are one of the major health problems of the world especially since no specific treatment is available. In the present study we investigated the hepatoprotective potential of the methanolic extract of the whole plant of Dodonaea viscosa and its ethyl acetate, aqueous, butanol and n-hexane fractions against carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) induced hepatoxicity in rats. Hepatoprotection was assessed in terms of reduction in serum enzymes (ALT, AST, and ALP) that occur after CCl₄ injury, and by histopathology and immunohistochemistry. The methanolic extract reduced the serum enzyme level (ALT, AST, and ALP) down to control levels despite CCl₄ treatment. It also reduced the CCl₄-induced damaged area to 0% as assessed by histopathology. The CD68+ macrophages were also reduced in number around the central vein area by the methanolic extract. These hepatoprotective effects were better than the positive control silymarin. Similar hepatoprotective activities were found with the ethyl acetate, and aqueous fractions of the methanolic extract. The butanol and n-hexane fractions showed elevated levels of ALT, AST and ALP as compared to the positive control silymarin. Histopathology showed ∼30% damage to the liver cells with the butanol and n-hexane fractions which still showed some protective activity compared to the CCl₄ treated control. HPLC fingerprinting suggested that hautriwaic acid present in the methanolic extract and its ethyl acetate, and aqueous fractions may be responsible for this hepatoprotective activity of Dodonaea viscosa which was confirmed by in vivo experiments.
