A 77-year-old man who complained of melena was admitted to our department. Colonoscopy revealed a type 2 tumor in the hepatic flexure of the ascending colon. Biopsy examination revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Abdominal computed tomography(CT)revealed 3 tumors within the posterior segment of the right hepatic lobe. Initially, a right hemicolectomy was performed. Immunohistochemically, the tumor was diagnosed as an endocrine cell carcinoma. After surgery, a capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab(CapeOX/BEV)regimen was administered. However, after 5 chemotherapy courses, abdominal CT revealed enlargement of the 3 tumors in the posterior segment of the right hepatic lobe. There was no metastasis besides the liver metastasis. The patient underwent a radical hepatectomy of the posterior segment. At 8 months post-surgery, the patient remains alive and well. Endocrine cell carcinoma of the colon and rectum is usually malignant and is associated with a very poor prognosis because of rapid hematogenous or lymphogenous metastasis. Effective multimodal treatment regimens, including surgery and new chemotherapies such as molecular targeted therapies, should be established to improve the prognosis of patients with endocrine cell carcinomas of the colon and rectum.
