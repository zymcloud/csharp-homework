Background/aims:The current study examines the expression of molecular biomarkers in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and whether these findings correlate with the clinicopathologic features of the disease and patient survival.Methods:We analyzed the immunohistochemical expression of p53, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), c-Met, and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) with the clinicopathologic features of 83 HCCs.Results:p53 expression was higher in the male patients with undifferentiated histological tumor grades, cirrhosis, and portal vein invasion. High 48 c-Met expression correlated with cirrhosis, and high mTOR expression correlated with the tumor grade and cirrhosis. High IGF-1R expression correlated with the tumor grade and cirrhosis. A multivariate analysis identified a significant relationship between the high expression of p53, tumor grade, and portal vein invasion. In addition, a high expression of mTOR was related to tumor grade and cirrhosis, and a high expression of HSP70 was related to portal vein invasion in a multivariate analysis. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve for patients with high versus low Edmondson grades and p53 expression was statistically significant.Conclusions:p53, mTOR, and IGF-1R expression correlated with the Edmondson tumor grade in a univariate analysis, while p53 and mTOR correlated with the Edmondson tumor grade in a multivariate analysis. In addition, the tumor grade was found to predict survival. p53 was primarily related to the clinicopathologic features compared to other markers, and it is a poor prognostic factor of survival.
