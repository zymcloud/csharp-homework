Parylene-C (diX C) has been used as a surface coating material with many biological applications; diX AM, a member of the diX C parylene family, retains biocompatible features. Previously, it has been reported that diX AM shows high cell adhesiveness; however, the effect of diX AM on the function of cells remains unknown. In this study, we investigated cell morphology and gene expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells cultured on diX AM. Our results show that HepG2 cells adhered to the surface of diX AM, and retained morphology similar to that of the cells cultured on collagen-coated surfaces. Furthermore, microarray analysis has revealed that the expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 was highly induced in HepG2 cells cultured on diX AM without any additional factors. Moreover, CYP1 enzymatic activity measured by ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (EROD) assay corresponded with the induction of gene expression. These results indicate a novel effect of diX AM on HepG2 cell function for the first time and diX AM could be used as non-animal-derived material for cell culture.
