The aim of the present study was to compare clinical outcomes in patients with intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent the following treatments: transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) using an epirubicin-mitomycin-lipiodol (EML) emulsion at initial therapy (TACE group; n=145), and transcatheter chemotherapy infusion (TACI) using an EML emulsion at initial therapy (TACI group; n=81). Overall survival (OS) and treatment efficacy in the TACE and TACI groups were retrospectively compared. Prognostic factors associated with OS were examined using univariate and multivariate analyses. Treatment-related mortality was also calculated. The median observation periods were 1.8 years (range, 0.2-9.0 years) in the TACE group and 2.0 years (range, 0.2-8.7 years) in the TACI group. The median survival time and the 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year cumulative OS rates were 2.68 years and 81.5, 63.4, 43.9 and 32.7%, respectively, in the TACE group, and 2.64 years and 85.0, 60.0, 43.2 and 26.0%, respectively, in the TACI group (P=0.691). The objective response rate was significantly higher in the TACE group compared to the TACI group (80.0 vs. 66.7%; P=0.009). Using multivariate analysis, the Child-Pugh classification (P=0.017), tumor number ≤5 (P=0.045) and des-γ-carboxy prothrombin level >100 mAU/ml (P=0.002) were found to be significant predictors linked to OS. In all subgroup analyses involving Child-Pugh classification, maximum tumor size and tumor distribution, the differences in the two groups did not reach statistical significance in terms of OS. Treatment mortality was 0% in the two groups. In conclusion, patients with intermediate-stage HCC had a comparable prognosis when treated with TACI or TACE.
