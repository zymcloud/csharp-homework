VX680 is an Aurora A inhibitor. It has been reported to inhibit the growth of the HepG2 cell line in several studies. However, whether it enhances chemosensitivity to cisplatin remains unclear. In this study, the synergistic effect of VX680 and cisplatin on the proliferation of HepG2 cells was determined by MTT assay. The changes in cell apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. Aurora A, Bcl-2 and p53 protein levels were analyzed by western blotting. This study demonstrated that VX680, cisplatin and a combination of the two inhibit the growth of HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. A synergistic effect was observed with the combined therapy. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of VX680 was positively correlated with the expression of Aurora A. The rate of apoptosis in the combined group was significantly higher compared with that of the VX680 and cisplatin groups. In addition, VX680 and cisplatin increased the expression of the p53 protein. Cisplatin reduced the expression of Bcl-2 protein, while VX680 did not. In the combined group, the expression of Bcl-2 and p53 changed significantly compared with the single drug group and control group. This study suggests that Aurora A may represent a valid target in hepatocellular carcinoma. We also demonstrated that the Aurora A inhibitor VX680 has a synergistic effect with cisplatin.
