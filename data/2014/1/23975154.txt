This study evaluated the efficacy of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of metachronous liver metastases of gastric cancer. We enrolled a total of 44 patients who underwent percutaneous RFA for the treatment of metachronous liver metastases after resection of a primary gastric adenocarcinoma from January 2002 to November 2011. The primary endpoint of this study was overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) after RFA. Systemic chemotherapy was combined with RFA in 40 patients; the OS and RFS of the patients with liver-only metastasis who underwent RFA and chemotherapy were 20.9 months (95% CI 18.4-23.4) and 9.8 months (95% CI 9.2-10.5), respectively. On multivariate analysis, the factors independently, negatively associated with OS were extrahepatic metastatic lesions (HR 12.6, 95% CI 3.7-42.9; p=0.001), no chemotherapy (HR 43.3, 95% CI 7.4-251.3; p=0.001), and tumor numberâ‰¥2 (HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.2-5.9; p=0.015). The factors independently, negatively associated with RFS were extrahepatic metastatic lesions (HR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-7.8; p=0.003) and bilobar intrahepatic distribution (HR 3.9, 95% CI 1.5-9.9; p=0.001). The efficacy of percutaneous RFA for metachronous liver metastases of gastric cancer is limited to patients with a single, unilobar metastasis without extrahepatic metastatic lesions. Combined systemic chemotherapy is very important for the prolongation of OS.
