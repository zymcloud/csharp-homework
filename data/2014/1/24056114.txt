Purpose:The purpose of this study was the evaluation of prognostic factors for long-term survival and progression-free survival (PFS) after treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases with magnetic resonance-guided laser-induced interstital thermotherapy (LITT).Patients and methods:We included 594 patients (mean age, 61.2 years) with CRC liver metastases who were treated with LITT. The statistical analysis of the long-term survival and PFS were based on the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox regression model tested different parameters that could be of prognostic value. The tested prognostic factors were the following: sex, age, the location of primary tumor, the number of metastases, the maximal diameter and total volume of metastases and necroses, the quotient of total volumes of metastases and necroses, the time of appearance of liver metastases and location in the liver, the TNM classification of CRC, extrahepatic metastases, and neoadjuvant treatments.Results:The median survival was 25 months starting from the date of the first LITT. The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year survival rates were 78%, 50.1%, 28%, 16.4%, and 7.8%, respectively. The median PFS was 13 months. The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year PFS rates were 51.3%, 35.4%, 30.7%, 25.4%, and 22.3%, respectively. The number of metastases and their maximal diameter were the most important prognostic factors for both long-term survival and PFS. Long-term survival was also highly influenced by the initial involvement of the lymph nodes.Conclusions:For patients treated with LITT for CRC liver metastases, the number and size of metastases, together with the initial lymph node status, are significant prognostic factors for long-term survival.
