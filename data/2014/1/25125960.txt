Background:High level of alpha-fetoprotein is usually associated with testis cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma a primary tumor of the liver.Case:We report the case of a 72-year-old male patient with chronic renal failure who presented with a high alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level and a retroperitoneal mass, which was subsequently diagnosed to be an extrahepatic hepatocellular carcinoma.Conclusion:A retroperitoneal mass with elevated AFP level and no detected liver lesions is not always caused by a testicular cancer.
