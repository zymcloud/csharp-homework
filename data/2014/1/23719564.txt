Objectives:To evaluate whether, in chronic hepatitis C-positive naive patients recruited in the routine clinical setting and treated with pegylated-interferon-α2b (Peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), the sustained virologic response (SVR) is durable over the long term and whether it is associated with a decrease in liver complications and incidence of glucose abnormalities.Patients and methods:This was a prospective long-term follow-up study of 182 naive patients enrolled in 2001-2002 and treated with Peg-IFN and RBV and followed up to December 2010, with clinical, biochemical, and virological evaluations every 6-12 months.Results:None of the 115 (63.2%) sustained responders showed late viremic relapse during the follow-up. SVR was better defined at 24 weeks (16/16 relapsers, 100%) than at 12 weeks after the end of therapy (14/16 relapsers, 87.5%). On multivariable analysis, viral genotype (odds ratio 0.16, 95% confidence interval 0.07-0.36, P=0.0001) and a greater than 20% RBV reduction (odds ratio 5.21, 95% confidence interval 1.54-17.67, P=0.008) predicted long-term response (LTR) independently. The incidence of cirrhosis was significantly higher among nonresponders (21.3%) compared with long-term responders (0.9%, P≤0.0001), but the risk of developing glucose abnormalities was not significantly reduced in long-term responders (hazard ratio 1.36, P=0.363). Hepatocellular carcinoma occurred only in three cases.Conclusion:SVR achieved in patients treated in the routine clinical setting with Peg-IFN and RBV is durable over the long term and LTR significantly reduces the risk of progression to cirrhosis; however, in a population with mild liver fibrosis, the clinical impact of LTR on the risk of glucose abnormalities seems negligible.
