Background:Despite advances in radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and newly developed molecular targeting therapies, long-term survival after resection for patients with NSCLC remains less than 50%. We investigated factors predicting postoperative locoregional recurrences and distant metastases in patients with clinical stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after surgical resection.Methods:All patients with clinical stage I NSCLC, who underwent surgical resection between January 2002 and June 2006, were reviewed retrospectively. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent risk factors for patients with locoregional recurrences and distant metastases.Results:A total of 261 patients were eligible. Overall survival was significant related to locoregional recurrences (P = 0.03) and distant metastases (P <0.001). There were significant differences of locoregional recurrence in tumor differentiation (P = 0.032) and advanced pathological stage (P = 0.002). In the group of distant metastases, there were significant differences in tumor differentiation (P = 0.035), lymphovascular space invasion (P = 0.031). Among the relationship between pattern of distant metastasis and clinicopathologic variables in patients with clinical stage I NSCLC, SUVmax (P = 0.02) and tumor size (P = 0.001) had significant differences. According to multiple logistic regression analysis, tumor differentiation is the only risk factor of postoperative outcome for locoregional recurrence and serum CEA (>3.5 ng/mL) is the predictor of distant metastasis.Conclusions:Tumor differentiation and serum CEA were predictors of postoperative relapse for clinical stage I NSCLC after surgical resection. Risk factors of postoperative recurrence in patients with clinical stage I NSCLC may enable us to optimize the patient selection for postoperative adjuvant therapies or neoadjuvant treatment before surgery.
