Management of liver malignancies, both primary and metastatic, requires a host of treatment modalities when attempting to prolong survival. Although surgical resection and transplantation continue to offer the best chance for a cure, most patients are not amenable to these therapies because of their advanced disease at presentation. Taking advantage of the unique blood supply of the liver, transarterial chemoembolization has emerged as an alternative and effective therapy for unresectable tumors. In this article, the current role along with future perspectives of transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and colorectal liver metastasis are discussed.
