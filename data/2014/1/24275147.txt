Sorafenib is the first approved targeted therapeutic reagent for hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, we report that SC-60, a dimer-based sorafenib derivative, overcomes the resistance of sorafenib and shows a better anti-hepatocellular carcinoma effect in vitro and in vivo. SC-60 substantially increased SH2 domain-containing phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) phosphatase activity in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and purified SHP-1 proteins, suggesting that SC-60 affects SHP-1 directly. Molecular docking and truncated mutants of SHP-1 further confirmed that SC-60 interferes with the inhibitory N-SH2 domain to relieve the closed catalytic protein tyrosine phosphatase domain of SHP-1. Deletion of N-SH2 domain (dN1) or point mutation (D61A) of SHP-1 abolished the effect of SC-60 on SHP-1, p-STAT3, and apoptosis. Importantly, SC-60 exhibited significant survival benefits compared with sorafenib in a hepatocellular carcinoma orthotopic model via targeting the SHP-1/STAT3-related signaling pathway. In summary, dimer derivative of sorafenib, SC-60, is a SHP-1 agonist and may be a potent reagent for hepatocellular carcinoma-targeted therapy.
