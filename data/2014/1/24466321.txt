Objective:Increasing evidence suggests that, when used in combination, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) synergizes with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs to exert a heightened antitumor effect. The present study investigated the antitumor efficacy of recombinant mutated human TNF-α specifically targeted to the tumor vasculature (RGD-rmhTNF-α) combined with the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin in 2 murine allografted tumor models.Methods:Mice bearing hepatoma or sarcoma allografted tumors were treated with various doses of RGD-rmhTNF-α alone or in combination with doxorubicin (2 mg/kg). We then evaluated tumor growth and tumor vessel permeability as well as intratumoral levels of RGD-rmhTNF-α and doxorubicin.Results:RGD-rmhTNF-α treatment enhanced the permeability of the tumor vessels and increased intratumoral doxorubicin levels. In addition, intratumoral RGD-rmhTNF-α levels were significantly higher than that of rmhTNF-α. In both of the tested tumor models, administering RGD-rmhTNF-α in combination with doxorubicin resulted in an enhanced antitumor response compared to either treatment alone. Double-agent combination treatment of doxorubicin with 50,000 IU/kg RGD-rmhTNF-α induced stronger antitumor effects on H22 allografted tumor-bearing mice than the single doxorubicin agent alone. Moreover, doxorubicin with 10,000 IU/kg RGD-rmhTNF-α synergized to inhibit tumor growth in S180 allografted tumor-bearing mice.Conclusions:These results suggest that targeted delivery of low doses of RGD-rmhTNF-α into the tumor vasculature increases the antitumor efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs.
