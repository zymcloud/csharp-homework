Background:It is of great clinical concern to preoperatively predict the need for blood transfusions during hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:A total of 168 consecutive patients undergoing elective hepatectomy for HCC were retrospectively reviewed. We investigated preoperative factors potentially influencing intraoperative blood transfusion and established a predictive scoring system for intraoperative blood transfusion.Results:Thirty-eight patients (22.6%) received red cell blood transfusion during surgery. A preoperative predicting scoring system for blood transfusion was constructed using the following four factors: platelet count Conclusion:This predictive scoring system would be useful for preoperatively assessing the need for intraoperative blood transfusions during hepatectomy for HCC.
