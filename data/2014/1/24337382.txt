IL-27, a member of the IL-12 family, plays a critical role in the control of innate and adaptive immune responses. IFN-λ1, a member of the type III IFN family, shows antiviral abilities. In this study, we investigated the effects of IL-27 and IFN-λ1 on the replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV), a major pathogen associated with a high risk for cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. We revealed that HBV infection activates IL-27 expression and IFN-λ1 production and demonstrated that viral-activated IL-27 and IFN-λ1 are coordinated to inhibit HBV replication. Initially, HBV infection upregulates IL-27 expression, which, in turn, stimulates IFN-λ1 production through regulating ERK1/2 signaling and by enhancing NF-κB nuclear translocation to bind to the IFN-λ1 promoter. Moreover, IL-27-activated IFN-λ1 upregulates IFN-λ1 receptor (IL-28R1 and IL-10Rβ) activity, resulting in the activation of the STAT1/2 pathway, which, in turn, induces the expression of IFN-stimulated genes, including IFN-inducible dsRNA-activated protein kinase, oligoadenylate synthetase 1, and IFN-induced GTP-binding protein 1 and, finally, inhibits HBV protein expression and viral capsid-associated DNA replication. More interestingly, we also revealed that type I IFN (IFN-α) is also involved in the downregulation of HBV replication mediated by IL-27. Thus, we identified a previously unknown mechanism by which IL-27 and IFN-λ1 are coordinated to regulate virus replication through type I IFN.
