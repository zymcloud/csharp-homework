Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cause of cancer in the world. According to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer modified criteria, patients with early stage disease are candidate to radiofrequency ablation (RFA), while patients with intermediate stage HCC are usually treated by transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). TACE and RFA induce a transient devascularisation effect followed by strong neo-angiogenic stimulus. In fact, after these procedures, it has been demonstrated an up-regulation of pro-angiogenic and growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor-A, which might contribute to accelerated progression in patients with incomplete response. Several studies have demonstrated that MAP-kinase and AKT pathways, in addition to neo-angiogenesis, have an important role in the development of HCC. In advanced HCC, anti-angiogenic therapy and tyrosine kinases inhibitors showed potential clinical benefit. Actually, a number of clinical studies are ongoing testing these agents in combination with TACE or RFA. In this paper, we have reviewed the most recent preclinical and clinical results of such trials.
