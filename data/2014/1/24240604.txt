Today, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the leading cause of death in patients with liver cirrhosis; in most western countries the incidence is also expected to increase further. Due to insufficient surveillance of patients at risk, most cases are diagnosed in an intermediate to advanced stage, leading-together with the underlying liver cirrhosis-to limited therapeutic options and a dismal prognosis. Therefore, classification according to stage and interdisciplinary treatment decisions in experienced centers are of paramount importance to provide an individualized treatment plan when considering potentially curative (resection, liver transplantation, local ablation) and palliative (transarterial approaches, sorafenib) treatment options. There is hope that the prognosis of patients with HCC can be improved in the near future by better prevention, stringent surveillance, multimodality treatment approaches, and an expansion of personalized medicine.
