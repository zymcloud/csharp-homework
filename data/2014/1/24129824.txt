Introduction:Portal vein embolization (PVE) stimulates hypertrophy of the future liver remnant (FLR) and may improve the safety of extended hepatectomy. The efficacy of PVE was evaluated.Methods:Records of 358 consecutive patients who underwent PVE before intended major hepatectomy at our institution from 1995 through 2012 were retrospectively reviewed.Results:One hundred twelve patients (31.3 %) had right PVE alone; 235 (65.6 %) had right PVE plus segment IV embolization. The first-session PVE completion rate was 97.8 %. The PVE complication rate was 3.9 %. The median pre-PVE and post-PVE standardized FLRs were 19.5 % (interquartile range, 15.0-25.9) and 29.7 % (interquartile range, 22.5-38.2), respectively. Two hundred forty patients (67.0 %) underwent potentially curative resection. Sixty-two patients (25.8 %) had major post-hepatectomy complications; rates of postoperative hepatic insufficiency and 90-day liver-related mortality were 8.3 and 3.8 %, respectively. The proportion of patients with colorectal liver metastasis increased from 38.6 % before 2005 to 78.2 % in 2010-2012. Despite increased use of preoperative chemotherapy, postoperative hepatic insufficiency and 90-day liver-related mortality rates dropped from 10.6 and 4.1 %, respectively, before 2010 to 2.9 and 2.9 %, respectively, in 2010-2012.Conclusions:PVE can be safely performed with minimal morbidity. Most patients can proceed to extended hepatectomy, which is associated with a minimal mortality rate.
