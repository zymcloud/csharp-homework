Aim:The aim of this work was to synthesize and study in vitro and in vivo nanocarriers used as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents that accumulate in tumor cells specifically overexpressing folate receptors.Materials and methods:Nanoparticles were prepared by self-assembly of poly-Î³-glutamic acid and chitosan biopolymers and were complexed with gadolinium ions. Folic acid served as a targeting molecule. Rat hepatocellular carcinoma (HeDe) cells overexpressing folate receptors were used as a model system. For in vivo experiments, HeDe cells were transplanted under the renal capsule of F344 rats.Results:In vitro results showed the significant internalization of nanoparticles into HeDe cells. MRI measurements revealed that targeting nanocarriers accumulated in tumors. The MRI/PET fusion images resulted in the exact localization of tumors.Conclusion:The nanocarrier provides a suitable means for the early diagnosis of tumors based on their overexpression of folate receptors.
