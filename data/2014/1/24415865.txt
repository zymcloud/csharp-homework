Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which develops from liver cirrhosis, is highly prevalent worldwide and is a malignancy that leads to liver failure and systemic metastasis. While surgery is the preferred treatment for HCC, intervention and liver transplantation are also treatment options for end-stage liver disease. However, the success of partial hepatectomy and intervention is hindered by the decompensation of liver function. Conversely, liver transplantation is difficult to carry out due to its high cost and the lack of donor organs. Fortunately, research into bone-marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) has opened a new door in this field. BMSCs are a type of stem cell with powerful proliferative and differential potential that represent an attractive tool for the establishment of successful stem cell-based therapy for liver diseases. A number of different stromal cells contribute to the therapeutic effects exerted by BMSCs because BMSCs can differentiate into functional hepatic cells and can produce a series of growth factors and cytokines capable of suppressing inflammatory responses, reducing hepatocyte apoptosis, reversing liver fibrosis and enhancing hepatocyte functionality. Additionally, it has been shown that BMSCs can increase the apoptosis rate of cancer cells and inhibit tumor metastasis in some microenvironments. This review focuses on BMSCs and their possible applications in liver regeneration and metastasis after hepatectomy.
