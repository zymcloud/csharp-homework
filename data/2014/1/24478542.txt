Viral infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) has a high propensity in becoming chronic and it is the major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. This review was basically established to illustrate the putative role of the P53 gene Arg72Pro polymorphism on various cancer models and viral infections, focusing on HCV and HCC incidences. Authors studied the 72 G/C single base substitution of P53 gene at codon 72 using various polymorphic techniques. Intriguingly, authors investigated that the P53 codon 72 plays a crucial role as risk factor in several cancer models. Others found that there is no association between codon 72 genotypes and HCV disease severity or liver cancer. Moreover, the lack of a significant relationship between this polymorphism and risk of HCC shows that it does not predispose towards hepatocarcinogenesis and the frequent loss of the proline allele in HCV-associated carcinogenesis of the liver plays some critical role in hepatocarcinogenesis. Amazingly, there is a significant correlation between male homozygotes for P53 72Pro with HCV type 1b infection. However, there was no significant difference between the P53 polymorphism and HCV genotypes 2a and 2b. It was concluded that the P53 gene polymorphism at codon 72 has been investigated as potential risk factor in several cancer models and HCV infections.
