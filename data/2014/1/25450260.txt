Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the most lethal forms of cancer in the world. In this arena, utilities of microRNA (miRNA) as a sophisticated tool, in therapeutics and diagnostics, remains a prime focus among the leading researchers. It is well known that viral hepatitis, chronic alcoholism and metabolic syndrome are the prime causes of HCCs. Nevertheless, HCCs are usually diagnosed at late stages by using current serum biomarkers. Most epidemiological studies have found the survival rate in HCC cases to be relatively low. Therefore, development of effective noninvasive biomarkers for early detention of HCC and new strategies for HCC treatment remains a high priority research area on the shoulders of liver oncologists. Accumulating evidence in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics indicates that miRNAs involve in HCC progression, which may serve as sensitive biomarkers for detecting carcinogenesis and monitoring therapies of HCC. This review focuses on the role of miRNAs in the diagnostics and therapeutics of HCC.
