Objective:Medical illness is a risk factor for suicidality; however, disorder-specific risks are not well-known and these relationships are often explained by major depressive disorder (MDD). We aimed to investigate the relationship between suicidal ideation, MDD and medical illnesses in an age-stratified, population-based sample of men participating in the Geelong Osteoporosis Study.Methods:Suicidal ideation and medical conditions were self-reported. Medical conditions were confirmed by medical records, medication use or clinical data where possible. MDD was determined using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Research Version, Non-patient edition.Results:Of the 907 men, 8.5% reported suicidal ideation. Thyroid disorders (OR 3.85, 95%CI 1.2-12.1), syncope and seizures (OR 1.96, 95%CI 1.1-3.5), liver disorders (OR 3.53, 95%CI 1.1-11.8; younger men only) and alcoholism (OR 2.15, 95%CI 1.1-4.4) were associated with increased odds of suicidal ideation, independent of age and MDD. Major vascular events doubled the odds of suicidal ideation but this was explained by MDD. No association was evident with high medical burden, musculoskeletal disease, metabolic factors, gastrointestinal disorders, headaches, cardiovascular disease, COPD, cancer and psoriasis.Conclusion:Health care professionals should focus on identification, assessment and management of suicidal ideation in the medically ill in patients both with and without MDD.
