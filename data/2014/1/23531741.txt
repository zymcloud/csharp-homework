Abscesses in the adrenal gland are extremely rare in adults with few cases reported in literature. We report FDG PET/CT findings in a unilateral adrenal abscess in a case of hepatocellular carcinoma. Though rare, this diagnosis should be kept in mind while evaluating cystic lesions of adrenal gland on PET/CT. Correlation with clinical picture and blood investigations is useful in such cases.
