A condensation reaction between 1,2-diphenylethane-1,2-dione dihydrazone (DPEDDH) and dimethyl or diethyloxalate in methanol resulted in a novel Schiff base octaazamacrocyclic ligand, (L): (6,7,14,15-tetraoxa-2,3,10,11-tetraphenyl-1,4,5,8,9,12,13,16-octaazacyclohexadecane-1,3,9,11-tetraene). Subsequently metal complexes of the type [MLX2] and [CuL]X2; (M=Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II); X=Cl or NO3) were synthesized by the reaction of the free macrocyclic ligand (L) with the corresponding metal salts in 1:1 molar ratio. These complexes were characterized on the basis of analytical data, molar conductivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements, ESI-mass, IR, NMR ((1)H and (13)C), EPR and electronic spectral studies. The thermal stability of the complexes was also studied by TGA and DTA analyses. These studies show that all the complexes have octahedral arrangement around the metal ions except copper complexes which are square planar. The ligand and its complexes were screened for their antibacterial activity in vitro against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria and were also studied for their anticancer activity against the human cancer cells lines: HeLa (Human cervical carcinoma), MCF7 (Human breast adenocarcinoma) and Hep3B (Human Hepatocellular carcinoma). The recorded IC50 values for the tested compounds show moderate to good cytotoxicity against these cancer cell lines. The copper complex, [CuL]Cl2, showed excellent antimicrobial activity against tested microorganisms which is almost equivalent to the standard drug ciprofloxacin.
