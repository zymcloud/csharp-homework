Chlorogenic acid (1), salvianolic acid B (2), and tanshinone IIA (3) are commonly used as chemoprotective agents for chemotherapy in cancer patients. The present study deals with the effect of these three compounds on cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in HepG2 cells. The results showed that 1 and 2 reduced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin through scavenging ROS generated by doxorubicin in HepG2 cells. The findings suggest that 1 and 2 could enhance the expression of SOD and decrease that of NADPH oxidase, which resulted in the elimination of ROS. On the contrary, 3 enhanced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, drug interactions between doxorubicin and 3 produce synergistic effects in HepG2 cells.
