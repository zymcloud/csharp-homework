Recent reports revealed an association between variation in the PNPLA3 gene and alcohol-induced hepatocellular carcinoma among Europeans. We have assessed whether the PNPLA3 rs738409 (I148M) polymorphism may also affect the resolution and/or the progression of hepatitis C in a Moroccan cohort. Genotype and allele frequencies at rs738409 were determined using a TaqMan 5' allelic discrimination assay in 437 individuals. Among them, 230 patients had a persistent infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) with 129 patients affected by a chronic hepatitis and 101 patients by a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In addition, we analyzed 75 individuals who naturally cleared HCV and 132 healthy subjects. Variation at rs738409 was not associated with significant changes in resolution rate of hepatitis C. By contrast, M/M genotype, present at higher frequencies (22.8%) in HCC patients than in patients with chronic hepatitis C (8.5%, P = 0.004) or control individuals (9.1%, P = 0.005) was associated with a 3-fold increase of liver cancer risk. In North African subjects, the PNPLA3 I148M variant apparently stimulates liver cancer development without interfering on the HCV clearance process. This polymorphism may, therefore, represent a valuable genetic marker to monitor liver cancer risk in populations from the Southern bank of the Mediterranean.
