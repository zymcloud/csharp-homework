Purpose:To clarify the prognostic impact of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype after curative resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 199 patients who underwent a curative hepatic resection for HCV-related HCC were reviewed. The clinical outcomes were compared between patients infected with HCV genotype 1b (n = 160) and those infected with other genotypes (n = 39).Results:With a comparable median HCV viral load (6.0 vs. 5.8 log10 IU/mL, p = 0.17), the 3-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates (25 vs. 20 %, p = 0.65) and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates (72 vs. 65 %, p = 0.73) were similar between the two groups. A multivariate analysis confirmed that HCV viral load of +1.0 log10 IU/mL [hazard ratio (HR), 1.48], major vascular invasion (HR, 3.20), recurrent tumor (HR, 1.77), and preoperative des-gamma carboxyprothrombin level >40 mAu/mL (HR, 1.64) were independent predictors of tumor recurrence, while the HCV genotype was not a significant risk factor. When the population was stratified according to the HCV viral load, a significant difference was observed in the RFS rate for both genotype 1b (p = 0.003) and the other genotypes (p = 0.037) at HCV viral load of 5.3 log10 IU/mL.Conclusions:The HCV genotype does not affect the surgical outcomes of patients with HCC. A lower HCV viral load is advantageous regardless of the HCV genotype.
