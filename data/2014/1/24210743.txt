Orthotopic liver transplantation (LTx) has become a routine procedure in the treatment of end-stage liver disease. During the waiting period for transplantation, the patient's family members are also highly affected. We examined the course of distress and quality of life (QOL) in 47 patients awaiting LTx and distress in 24 caregivers at baseline and in intervals of 4-6 weeks, using The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). All subscales of the EORTC QLQ-C30, except emotional functioning, were lower than normal at baseline. Little change in patients' QOL was observed during the waiting period. In the HADS, there were significantly higher anxiety scores in caregivers than in patients both at baseline and after 1-2 months and the third assessment, with the difference after 3-5 months reaching almost significance. Caregivers' anxiety levels increased significantly. Relatives showed more depression than patients only at month 1-2 and a significant increase in depression from baseline to month 1-2. In patients, depression scores remained relatively stable throughout all visits. Our results emphasize the importance of evaluation of psychic stress especially in relatives during the waiting period for LTx.
