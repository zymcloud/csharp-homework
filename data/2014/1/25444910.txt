Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA integrations may affect therapeutic responses in cancers through ATM network-related DNA damage response (DDR). We studied whether cisplatin-induced DDR was altered in human HK-2 renal tubular cells immortalized by HPV16 E6/E7 genes. Cytotoxicity assays utilized thiazolyl blue dye and DDR was identified by gene expression differences, double-strand DNA breaks, ATM promoter activity, and analysis of cell cycling and side population cells. After cisplatin, HK-2 cells showed greater ATM promoter activity indicating activation of this network, but DDR was muted, since little Î³H2AX was expressed, DNA strand breaks were absent and cells continued cycling. When HK-2 cells were treated with the MDM2 antagonist inducing p53, nutlin-3, or p53 transcriptional activator, tenovin-1, cell growth decreased but cisplatin toxicity was unaffected. By contrast, arsenic trioxide, which by inhibiting wild-type p53-induced phosphatase-1 that serves responses downstream of p53, and by depolymerizing tubulin, synergistically enhanced cisplatin cytotoxicity including loss of SP cells. Our findings demonstrated that HPV16 E6/E7 altered DDR through p53-mediated cell growth controls, which may be overcome by targeting of WIP1 and other processes, and thus should be relevant for treating renal cell carcinoma.
