Background:Glypican-3 (GPC3) is a new prognostic factor after curative hepatectomy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the expression of GPC3 is known to be associated with postoperative metastasis. However, the role of GPC3 in patients with early HCC remains unknown.Methods:We retrospectively studied 55 patients with early HCC (total 99 nodules) who underwent initial hepatectomy between 1995 and 2010. Clinicopathological features and surgical outcomes were compared in relation to GPC3 expression.Results:The GPC3-positive expression was seen in 28 of 55 patients (50.9 %) with early HCC (44 of 99 nodules). The GPC3-positive expression was significantly associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (P = 0.0019) and with multiple early HCCs (P Conclusions:The GPC3 expression is capable to be a new prognostic factor for disease-free survival in patients with early HCC.
