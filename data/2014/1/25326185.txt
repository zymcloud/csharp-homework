Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 5 (PPP5C) has been reported to participate in tumor progression. However, its functional role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown yet. In this study, we firstly evaluated the expression levels of PPP5C in six HCC cell lines by real-time PCR and found that PPP5C was widely expressed in HCC cells. To explore the role of PPP5C in HCC cell growth, lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was employed to silence PPP5C expression in HepG2 and Bel-7404 cells. The expression of PPP5C was significantly downregulated in PPP5C knockdown cells. Knockdown of PPP5C markedly suppressed the proliferation and colony formation ability of HCC cells. Moreover, cell cycle analysis showed that PPP5C depletion in HepG2 cells led to G0/G1 phase and G2/M phase arrest. We demonstrate for the first time that PPP5C is essential for growth of HCC cells, which suggests that inhibition of PPP5C by RNAi may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HCC.
