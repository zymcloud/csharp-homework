Between January 1st, 2006 and December 31st, 2013, a total of 89 patients who underwent surgery for HCC were retrospectively enrolled. The analysis was conducted using the Student's t-test, Chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard regression model to assess potential confounding and predictive variables. The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate was 71%. The 3-year OS rates in patients with and those without vascular invasion were 62.1 and 92.8%, respectively (P
