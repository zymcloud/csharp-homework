Purpose:To evaluate the differences in enhancement pattern of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 20 mm or smaller and enhancement effects of hepatic vessels on early dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) obtained with gadoxetic acid and gadopentetate dimeglumine in the same patients with cirrhosis.Methods:We reviewed MR images using gadoxetic acid and gadopentetate dimeglumine in the same 34 patients with 42 histologically confirmed HCCs (median diameter, 14.5 mm). The percentage enhancements (PEs) of HCC, the hepatic artery and portal vein and relative contrasts (RCs) between HCC and the liver were calculated and analyzed statistically.Results:The PEs of HCC, the hepatic artery and portal vein were significantly lower for gadoxetic acid in comparison with gadopentetate dimeglumine in the arterial phase (p = 0.0256 for HCC, p Conclusions:Compared with gadopentetate dimeglumine, gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI demonstrated a different enhancement pattern of inferior arterial enhancement and was more rapidly hypointense in the portal phase for HCC. It showed markedly lower enhancement for hepatic artery and portal vein in the patients with cirrhosis.
