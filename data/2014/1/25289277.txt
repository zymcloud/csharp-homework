Malignant carcinoma metastasis to the skeleton is the third most common site of metastasis after lung and liver, usually involving the axial skeleton and the proximal ends of long bones, ribs, and vertebrae. Acrometastasis, metastasis to hands or feet, comprises only 0.1% of all metastases. Here, we present 2 cases of acrometastasis, one from hepatocellular carcinoma and the other from renal cell carcinoma. We describe the presentation, radiographs, surgical treatment, and outcomes for each patient. Patients presented with swelling and pain at the tumor sites and were treated with amputations. The second patient's disease progressed resulting in death shortly after amputation indicating acrometastasis may be a poor prognostic indicator of survival. We review the literature and discuss the importance of disease process recognition and prognosis.
