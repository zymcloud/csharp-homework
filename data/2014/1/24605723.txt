Cervical cancer is a frequent malignancy of the females. It still remains a leading cause of cancer-related death in women world wide. Cervical cancers do not always spread, but those that do most often spread to the lungs, liver, bladder, and vagina. We report a 67-year-old woman with squamous cell carcinoma of cervix that could not receive chemo-radio therapy due to mesenteric involvement. A 25 mm mass was detected in the magnetic resonance examination which was performed due to persistent headache. Diffusion magnetic resonance revealed non-contrasted mass consistent with metastases. The patient received palliative radiotherapy at 3000 cGy. Brain scans can be beneficial for metastasis detection if there is presence of significant symptoms at cervical cancer.
