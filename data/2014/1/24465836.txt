Background:Previous studies showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HLA-DP, TCF19 and EHMT2 genes may affect the chronic hepatitis B (CHB). To predict the degree of risk for chronicity of HBV, this study determined associations with these SNPs.Methods:The participants for this study were defined into 4 groups; HCC (n = 230), CHB (n = 219), resolved HBV infection (n = 113) and HBV uninfected subjects (n = 123). The HLA-DP SNPs (rs3077, rs9277378 and rs3128917), TCF19 SNP (rs1419881) and EHMT2 SNP (rs652888) were genotyped.Results:Due to similar distribution of genotype frequencies in HCC and CHB, we combined these two groups (HBV carriers). The genotype distribution in HBV carriers relative to those who resolved HBV showed that rs3077 and rs9277378 were significantly associated with protective effects against CHB in minor dominant model (OR = 0.45, pConclusions:Genetic variations of rs3077 and rs9277378, but not rs3128917, rs1419881 and rs652888, were significantly associated with HBV carriers relative to resolved HBV in Thai population.
