We upgraded the preliminary CCPD 1.0 to CCPD 2.0 using the latest deep-profiling proteome (CCPD 2013) of three hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, namely, Hep3B, MHCC97H, and HCCLM3 (ProteomeXchange identifiers: PXD000529, PXD000533, and PXD000535). CCPD 2.0 totally covered 63.6% (438/689) of Chr. 8-coded proteins and 62.6% (439/701) of Chr. 8-coded protein-coding genes. Interestingly, we found that the missing proteins exhibited a tendency to form a cluster region in chromosomes, such as two Î²-defensins clusters in Chr. 8, caused perhaps by their inflammation-related features. For the 41 Chr. 8-coded proteins being weakly or barely identified previously, we have performed an immunohistochemical (IHC) verification in 30 pairs of carcinoma/para-carcinoma HCC and 20 noncancerous liver tissues and confirmed their expressional evidence and occurrence proportions in tissue samples. We also verified 13 Chr. 8-coded HCC tumorigenesis-associated depleting or deficient proteins reported in CCPD 1.0 using IHC and screened 16 positive and 24 negative HCC metastatic potential-correlated proteins from large-scale label-free proteome quantitation data of CCPD 2013. Our results suggest that the selection of proper samples and the methodology to look for targeted missing proteins should be carefully considered in further verifications for the remaining Chr. 8-coded proteins.
