Alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) is used as a marker of early hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the impact of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) on this relationship in patients with HBV infection is not clear. The present study evaluated the relation between HBsAg and AFP levels at the initial visit in 1,610 untreated HBV patients, free of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or severe hepatitis. The cumulative rate of HCC was significantly lower in patients with a low AFP level (≤10 µg/L; below the upper limit of normal) than in those with a high AFP level (≥11 µg/L) at the initial visit. In patients with HBsAg levels more than 500 IU/ml, HBsAg levels correlated significantly and negatively with AFP levels, and significantly with platelet count. Multivariate analysis of data of patients with HBsAg more than 500 IU/ml identified HBsAg (
