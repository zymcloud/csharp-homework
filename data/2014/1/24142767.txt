Methylation of gene promoter CpG islands is an important early event in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and detection of cell-free tumor-specific DNA methylation is becoming a useful noninvasive method for HCC. This study was aimed at determining the diagnostic value of serum insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) promoter methylation in hepatitis B virus-associated HCC. A total of 217 subjects, including 136 HCC patients, 46 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and 35 healthy controls (HCs), were included. The methylation status of the serum IGFBP7 gene promoter was determined using methylation-specific PCR. The frequency of serum IGFBP7 promoter methylation in HCC patients (89/136, 65%) was significantly higher than that in CHB patients (8/46, 17%; X(2) = 31.883, P
