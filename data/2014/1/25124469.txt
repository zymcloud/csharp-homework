Background:This study aimed to clarify the clinical significance of surgical resection for recurrent lesions after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.Methods:Recurrence was detected in 113 of 365 consecutive patients who underwent surgical resection for esophageal cancer, and some treatment was performed for recurrence in 100 of the 113 patients. The treatments were classified into two groups: chemotherapy and/or radiation with surgery (surgery group, n = 14) and chemotherapy and/or radiation without surgery (no surgery group, n = 86). The outcomes were retrospectively analyzed.Results:Of the 14 patients in the surgery group, 3 underwent repeated resection. Thus, a total of 22 resections were performed for these patients. The resected organs were the lymph nodes in nine patients, the lungs in six patients, local recurrence in two patients, subcutaneous recurrence in two patients, the liver in one patient, the brain in one patient, and the parotid gland in one patient. Among the 22 recurrent cases, 20 involved solitary lesions or multiple lesions located in a small resectable region. When the two groups were compared, the surgery group showed a more favorable prognosis in terms of both survival after esophagectomy (median survival time, 103.3 vs 23.1 months; p = 0.0060) and survival after initial recurrence (92.1 vs 12.2 months; p = 0.0057).Conclusions:Multimodal treatment provides a significant benefit for patients with recurrence after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Surgical intervention should be aggressively included in the treatment strategy when the recurrent lesion is solitary or localized.
