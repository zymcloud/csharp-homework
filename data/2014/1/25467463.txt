This article reports on carbon nanotube/manganese dioxide (CNT-MnO2) composites as electrochemical tags for non-enzymatic signal amplification in immunosensing. The synthesized CNT-MnO2 composites showed good electrochemical activity, electrical conductivity and stability. The electrochemical signal of CNT-MnO2 composites coated glassy carbon electrode (GCE) increased by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to bare GCE in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) environment. CNT-MnO2 composite was subsequently validated as electrochemical tags for sensitive detection of α-fetoprotein (AFP), a tumor marker for diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma. The electrochemical immunosensor demonstrated a linear response on a log-scale for AFP concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 100 ng mL(-1). The limit of detection (LOD) was estimated to be 40 pg mL(-1) (S/N=3) in PBS buffer. Further measurements using AFP spiked plasma samples revealed the applicability of fabricated CNT-MnO2 composites for clinical and diagnostic applications.
