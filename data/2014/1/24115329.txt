Purpose:To determine whether the diagnostic performance of combined gadoxetic acid-enhanced dynamic phases and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is comparable to the standard protocol with hepatobiliary phase (HBP) and DWI for detection and characterization of focal liver lesions in chronic liver disease.Materials and methods:A total of 176 patients with 181 HCCs, 15 cholangiocarcinomas, and 32 benign lesions were included. Three combined gadoxetic acid-enhanced and DWI sets (dynamic phases [arterial, portal, and 3-min delay {3-min set} and dynamic phases with 10-min HBP [10-min set] or 20-min HBP [20-min set]) were analyzed by two observers to determine the diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity in detection of malignancy, and ability for lesion characterization.Results:There was a trend, although not statistically significant, toward highest diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity for detecting malignancies in the 20-min set (mean, 0.945, 96.2), followed by the 10-min set (0.937, 95.9), and the 3-min set (0.923, 94.1) (P > 0.05). For lesion characterization, three image sets were equivalent (P > 0.05).Conclusion:For lesion detection and characterization in chronic liver diseases, 3-min set with DWI showed comparable efficacy to 10-min or 20-min set. However, the best diagnostic performance could be achieved by combination of all image sets.
