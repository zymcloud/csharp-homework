Purpose:This study evaluates the incidence trends and clinical outcomes of children with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and assesses factors predictive of patient survival.Methods:The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry was queried from 1973 to 2009 for all patients between ages 0 and 19 with primary HCC. Demographics, tumor histology, surgical intervention, and patient survival were collected.Results:Overall, 218 patients were identified. The annual age-adjusted incidence was 0.05 cases per 100,000 in 2009. Fibrolamellar subtype tumors were exclusive to children >5years old and exhibited greater survival compared to non-fibrolamellar subtype (57% vs. 28%, respectively, p=0.002). Tumor extirpation for patients with resectable disease significantly improved overall survival at 5years compared to no surgery (60% vs. 0%, respectively, pConclusion:Over the past four decades, the incidence of HCC has remained relatively stable. Children of Hispanic ethnicity have high mortality rates. However, HCC resection for curative intent significantly improves outcomes.
