This study is aimed to investigate the effect of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels on prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients receiving radiofrequency ablation (RFA). The 110 HCC patients who received computed tomography (CT) guided RFA were enrolled in this study. The levels of serum VEGF were determined before and after RFA by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). According to the ELISA results, the patients were divided into the negative group and the positive group. The patient's progression-free survival time was determined. It was demonstrated that the serum VEGF had no significant correlation with ages, sex and tumour size. There were no significant peripheral blood supplies around tumour necrosis. The results showed that higher levels of serum VEGF had a worse prognosis when compared to the patients with lower levels of serum VEGF. The difference between the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and those when area under curves equalled 0.5 was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The serum VEGF level in liver cancer patients can be used as a prognostic indicator for evaluating the efficacy of RFA treatments.
