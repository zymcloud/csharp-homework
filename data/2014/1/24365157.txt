Tumor angiogenesis is a complicated process based upon a sequence of interactions between tumor and vessel endothelial cells. Tumor conditioned medium has been widely used to stimulate endothelial cells in vitro angiogenesis. This work was aimed to investigate the effects of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) on angiogenesis in hepatic carcinoma-conditioned endothelial cells. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured with conditioned medium (CM) from the human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2 (HepG2-CM), and then treated with different concentrations of GNPs. The effects of GNPs on the viability, migration and active VEGF level of HUVECs were investigated by MTT assay, wound healing assay and transwell chamber assay, and ELISA assay, respectively. The data showed that GNPs significantly inhibited HUVECs proliferation and migration induced by HepG2-CM, and also reduced the levels of active VEGF in the co-culture system. Then, the alterations in morphology and ultrastructure of HUVECs detected by atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that there appeared obvious pseudopodia, larger membrane particle sizes and much rougher surface in HUVECs after HepG2-CM treatment, which were all reversed after GNPs treatment. Changes in cytoskeleton of HUVECs determined by immunocytochemistry demonstrated that GNPs treatment remarkably inhibited the activation effect of HepG2-CM on HUVECs, which was associated with the disruption of actin filaments induced by GNPs. This study indicates that GNPs can significantly inhibit HepG2-CM activated endothelial cell proliferation and migration through down-regulation of VEGF activity and disruption of cell morphology, revealing the potential applications of GNPs as antiangiogenic agent for the treatment of hepatic carcinoma.
