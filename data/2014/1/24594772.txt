An 80-year-old man with prostate cancer receiving hormone therapy presented with urinary retention. The computed tomographic scan showed metastases to the lung, liver, and lymph nodes, as well as increased prostate volume. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) was performed, and the resected specimen was pathologically found to be a small cell carcinoma of the prostate. The patient was treated with a combination of carboplatin and irinotecan, and achieved a partial response : size reduction of the prostate and the metastatic lesions, and decreased neuron specific enolase (NSE) level. The chemotherapy with carboplatin and irinotecan is reported to have fewer serious adverse effects, and equivalent efficacy to the cisplatin/etoposide chemotherapy. Therefore, this regimen could also be a treatment option for the patients with small cell carcinoma of the prostate.
