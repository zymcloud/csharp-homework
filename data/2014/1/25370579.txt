Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a constituent of green tea and has been associated with anticancer activity. In the present study, the inhibitory effect of EGCG on human hepatocellular cancer cells was examined by cell viability assay, in vitro apoptosis assay and cell cycle analysis. In addition, gene expression was measured to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of action of EGCG by mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) determination and western blot analysis. We demonstrated that EGCG induced apoptosis, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and promoted G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest of HCCLM6 cells but not that of non-cancerous liver cells (HL-7702). The EGCG-induced apoptosis of HCCLM6 cells was associated with a significant decrease in Bcl-2 and NF-ÎºB expression. In addition, the expression of Bax, p53, caspase-9 and caspase-3 increased, and cytochrome c was released. These results suggest that EGCG inhibits the progression of cancer through cytocidal activity and that it is a potential therapeutic compound for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
