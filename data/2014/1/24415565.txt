Purpose:To evaluate short-term test-retest and interobserver reproducibility of IVIM (intravoxel incoherent motion) diffusion parameters and ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver parenchyma at 3.0T.Materials and methods:In this prospective Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved study, 11 patients were scanned twice using a free-breathing single-shot echo-planar-imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequence using 4 b values (b = 0, 50, 500, 1000 s/mm(2)) and IVIM DWI using 16 b values (0-800 s/mm(2)) at 3.0T. IVIM parameters (D: true diffusion coefficient, D*: pseudodiffusion coefficient, PF: perfusion fraction) and ADC (using 4 b and 16 b) were calculated. Short-term test-retest and interobserver reproducibility of IVIM parameters and ADC were assessed by measuring correlation coefficient, coefficient of variation (CV), and Bland-Altman limits of agreements (BA-LA).Results:Fifteen HCCs were assessed in 10 patients. Reproducibility of IVIM metrics in HCC was poor for D* and PF (mean CV 60.6% and 37.3%, BA-LA: -161.6% to 135.3% and -66.2% to 101.0%, for D* and PF, respectively), good for D and ADC (CV 19.7% and Conclusion:Poor reproducibility of D*/PF and good reproducibility for D/ADC were observed in HCC and liver parenchyma. These findings may have implications for trials using DWI in HCC.
