Aim:To investigate in greater detail the efficacy and safety of sorafenib for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with established cirrhosis.Methods:From October 2009 to July 2012 patients with an established diagnosis of cirrhosis and HCC treated with sorafenib were consecutively enrolled. According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification, patients were in the advanced stage (BCLC-C) or in the intermediate stage (BCLC-B) but unfit or unresponsive to other therapeutic strategies. Treatment was evaluated performing a 4-phase computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan every 2-3 mo, and analyzed according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Sorafenib was administered at 800 mg/d, until radiological progression or occurrence of unacceptable adverse events (AEs). Univariate and multivariate analyses identified predictors of 16-wk clinical benefit and overall survival.Results:Forty-four patients were enrolled, 15 had intermediate HCC and 14 a Child-Pugh score of B7. AEs caused treatment interruption in 19 patients (43%), and median treatment duration was shorter in this subset (5 wk vs 19 wk, P Conclusion:In patients with cirrhosis and HCC treated with sorafenib, AEs are a common cause of early treatment withdrawal. Vascular invasion and extrahepatic spread condition early response to treatment and survival. Baseline biochemical parameters may be helpful to identify patients at higher risk of shorter overall survival.
