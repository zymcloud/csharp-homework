Introduction:Improvement in long-term survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has followed the developments in surgical techniques and multidisciplinary therapies. The role of the surgeon has rarely been studied and to fill this research gap we offer this study which has reviewed the outcome of surgery in attempted curative resection for this condition.Methods:The clinical data of patients who underwent partial hepatectomy for HCC from January 2003 to December 2010 at the First People's Hospital of Foshan were collected and retrospectively analyzed.Results:Of 104 HCC patients, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease free survival (DFS) rates were 64.8%, 45.5%, and 38.5%, respectively, and the 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 86.3%, 63.6%, and 57.2%, respectively. Negative resection margin and tumor TNM stage were independent prognostic factors of DFS and OS (PConclusions:Negative resection margin and tumor TNM stage were the two most significant prognostic factors of survival in HCC patients after partial hepatectomy. As TNM stage is a factor not subjected to control, surgeons can improve the long-term survival of patients with HCC by ensuring an appropriate negative resection margin.
