Objectives:Less than 1 in 5 patients receive hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance; however, most studies were performed in racially and socioeconomically homogenous populations, and few used guideline-based definitions for surveillance. The study objective was to characterize guideline-consistent hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance rates and identify determinants of hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance among a racially and socioeconomically diverse cohort of cirrhotic patients.Methods:We retrospectively characterized hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance among cirrhotic patients followed between July 2008 and July 2011 at an urban safety-net hospital. Inconsistent surveillance was defined as at least 1 screening ultrasound during the 3-year period, annual surveillance was defined as screening ultrasounds every 12 months, and biannual surveillance was defined as screening ultrasounds every 6 months. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify predictors of surveillance.Results:Of 904 cirrhotic patients, 603 (67%) underwent inconsistent surveillance. Failure to recognize cirrhosis was a significant barrier to surveillance use (P Conclusions:Only 13% of patients with cirrhosis receive annual surveillance, and less than 2% of patients receive biannual surveillance. There are racial and socioeconomic disparities, with lower rates of hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance among African Americans and underinsured patients.
