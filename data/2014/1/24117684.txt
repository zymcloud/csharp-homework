Background and aim:Without effective prophylaxis, liver transplantation (LT) for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver disease is frequently complicated by severe and rapidly progressive HBV recurrence. The combination of low-dose hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and the new nucleos(t)ide analog, entecavir, as prophylaxis for HBV recurrence after living-donor LT (LDLT) were analyzed.Methods:A total of 315 patients with positive hepatitis B surface antigen underwent LDLT at our transplant center between July 2003 and December 2011. Our protocol for post-transplantation HBV prophylaxis was a combination of low-dose HBIG and nucleos(t)ide analog.Results:During a median follow-up period of 49 months post-transplant, 10 patients (3.2%) had HBV recurrence, which was significantly related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at transplantation (P = 0.041) and post-LT antiviral agent (P Conclusions:The combination of low-dose HBIG and nucleos(t)ide analogs is safe and effective for HBV prophylaxis after LDLT. As a post-LT antiviral treatment, entecavir is more effective than lamivudine. HCC at transplantation was significantly associated with HBV recurrence. HBV-related HCC patients who undergo LDLT require close virological monitoring.
