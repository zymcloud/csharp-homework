The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial process in tumor progression. EMT of tumor cells not only causes increased metastasis, but also contributes to drug resistance. Serum response factor (SRF) is a transcription factor that plays a central role in carcinogenesis and tumor progression in several types of cancers. We investigated the effect of EMT-related SRF, focusing on its promotion of chemoresistance against sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We examined SRF and Snail expression in 146 cases of HCCs by immunohistochemistry. We also examined the chemoresistance effect of SRF in HCC cells by transfecting HLE cells with SRF cDNA and SH-J1 cells with SRF antisense cDNA. Expression of SRF and Snail were detected in 37.6% (55 of 146 cases) and in 12.3% (18 of 146 cases) of the HCCs, respectively. None of the tumor-free liver tissues showed SRF or Snail expression. SRF expression was closely correlated with the expression of Snail (p
