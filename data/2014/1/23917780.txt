A 43-year-old man, previously submitted to right hepatectomy, right hepatic artery chemoembolization, and surgical resection of liver lesions, with well-differentiated and moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) confirmed by histopathology, underwent cholescintigraphy with Tc diisopropyliminodiacetic acid (Tc-DISIDA) due to recurrent cholangitis. The scintigraphic images and the coregistered CT images showed radiotracer uptake in an area of biliary ectasia near the hepatic surface (which may be associated with recurrent cholangitis), in a hepatic nodule, and in multiple pulmonary metastases.
