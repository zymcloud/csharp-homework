Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most frequent type of liver malignancy. Most cases of hepatocellular carcinoma are secondary to either viral hepatitis (hepatitis B, C) or alcoholic cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis due to any other causes is considered as a risk factor for development of hepatocellular carcinoma; however, hepatocellular carcinoma in a young patient with no cirrhosis or fibrosis is a relatively rare condition. The present case report describes a young 24-years-old male patient who presented with a two-month history of fever, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and weight loss with no evidence of pre-existing liver disease, initially treated as liver abscess; however, a computed tomography (CT) showed numerous hepatic hypodensities with ring enhancement. Serum alpha-fetoprotein level was high (>1000 ng/L) and histopathological study confirmed the presence of primary hepatocellular carcinoma. The present case findings suggest that multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma can occur in a young patient with no apparent risk factor, and that the clinical presentation of hepatocellular carcinoma can be similar to liver abscess.
