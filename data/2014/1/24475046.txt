Background:Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 12 (PTPN12), has been identified as a potent tumor suppressor in human cancers and a critical regulator of cell adhesion and migration. However, the PTPN12 expression and its prognostic significance in HCC have not been well elucidated.Methodology/principal findings:In this study, tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry (IHC) was investigated in an HCC cohort with adjacent liver tissues as controls. The resulting data were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curves, Spearman's rank correlation, Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. Our results showed that decreased expression of PTPN12 was more frequently observed in HCC tissues compared to the adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues. Further correlation analyses indicated that the decreased PTPN12 expression was closely correlated with tumor recurrence (P = 0.015). Univariate analysis showed a significant association between decreased expression of PTPN12 and adverse cancer-specific survival and recurrence-free survival (PConclusions/significance:Our findings provide a basis for the concept that PTPN12 protein expression is frequently decreased or lost in human HCC tissues and that decreased PTPN12 expression may represent an acquired recurrence phenotype of HCC and that PTPN12 expression may act as a biomarker of prognosis for patients with HCC.
