Background:Prognostic factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after liver transplantation (LT) are still a matter of debate. The absence of viable tumor in the native liver, due to effectiveness of pre-LT locoregional treatment or liver resection, is an intriguing prognostic factor that had never been evaluated.Methods:Between November 2000 and December 2011, 210 LTs were performed in patients with evidence of HCC and cirrhosis.Results:Fifty-three (25.2%) patients did not show any evidence of active residual HCC in the native liver (Group NVH), whereas 157 (74.8%) patients showed viable HCC (Group VH). All patients in Group NVH were treated before LT with a multimodal approach combining transarterial chemoembolization, liver resection, radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection, or sorafenib, whereas, in Group VH, 110 of the 157 (70.1%) patients received bridging therapy (PConclusions:The histologic absence of viable HCC in the native liver after LT and morphologic criteria, due to the high effectiveness of pre-LT bridging treatments, is a highly positive prognostic factor against HCC recurrence after LT.
