Castleman disease is an uncommon disorder characterized by the proliferation of lymphoid tissue. We present a case of Castleman disease in the porta hepatis, showing hypervascularity on enhanced CT and MRI as well as increased FDG uptake on FDG PET/CT. These image features were similar to exophytic hepatocelluar carcinoma. This case suggests that Castleman disease should be considered as a rare differential diagnosis in patients with a perihepatic hypervascular and hypermetabolic mass.
