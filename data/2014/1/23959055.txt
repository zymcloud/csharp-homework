Background:The indocyanine green (ICG) clearance test is reported to be useful for the preoperative evaluation of hepatic functional reserve. However, the ICG clearance test has not been sufficiently investigated in patients with colorectal liver metastasis after chemotherapy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the ICG clearance test is a useful parameter for the preoperative detection of chemotherapy-associated liver injury.Methods:Ninety-four patients undergoing liver resection for colorectal liver metastasis after chemotherapy were studied. The medical records for each case were retrospectively reviewed. They underwent pathological assessment to clarify the degree of histopathological liver injury of the nontumoral liver parenchyma. In addition, the correlation between the pathological score and the ICG retention rate at 15 min (ICG-R15) was analyzed.Results:Sinusoidal injury was observed in the 31 of 94 patients. Steatohepatitis was observed in the 40 of 94 patients. There was no strong correlation between the preoperative ICG-R15 value and the sinusoidal pathological score (r = 0.117, P = 0.261). There was no strong correlation between the ICG-R15 and the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (r = 0.215, P = 0.037).Conclusions:It was difficult to predict the degree of chemotherapy-associated liver injury by the preoperative ICG-R15 value. It is necessary to estimate the hepatic functional reserve based on a combination of several clinical indicators without relying on the ICG test, in order to perform a safe radical liver resection.
