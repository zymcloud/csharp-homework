Sorafenib is the treatment of reference for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most frequent form of primary liver tumour. The loss of function of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein is an important event during liver carcinogenesis, but it is unclear whether the Rb status modulates the response of HCC cells to sorafenib. Here, we examined this question in HCC cells with reduced levels of Rb achieved through stable RNA interference. We show that HCC cells with reduced levels of Rb exhibit a two- to threefold increase in cell death induction upon exposure to sorafenib compared with controls. Sorafenib treatment of Balb/c nude mice that received tumour xenografts derived from HCC cells with reduced Rb levels resulted in complete tumour regression in 50% of the animals treated, compared with tumour stabilization in mice that received control cells. We show that, upon exposure to sorafenib, the Rb-negative status of HCC cells promotes the occurrence of ferroptosis, a form of oxidative necrosis. The findings highlight the role of Rb in the response of HCC cells to sorafenib and the regulation of ferroptosis.
