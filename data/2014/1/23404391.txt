We report a case of repeat hepatectomies for hepatic malignant lymphoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A 75-year-old man with chronic hepatitis C underwent partial hepatectomy for a 25 mm hepatic tumor in S5. The histological diagnosis was diffuse large B-cell malignant lymphoma and as postoperative (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography showed no hot spots, the mass was presumed to be primary hepatic lymphoma. Thus, adjuvant systemic chemotherapy was given following the hepatectomy. Abdominal ultrasonography, done 12 months after the hepatectomy, showed a hepatic tumor in S6 and repeat partial hepatectomy was performed. This tumor was histologically diagnosed as HCC.
