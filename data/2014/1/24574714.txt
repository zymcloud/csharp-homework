Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem and more than 350 million people worldwide are chronic carriers of the virus. Despite the recent dramatic decline in HBV chronic patients through successful programs of hepatitis B surface antigen vaccination, South Korea is still recognized as an endemic area of HBV infection. HBV infections in South Korea exhibit several distinct features in epidemiologic and clinical aspects. In this review paper, we summarize the distinct HBV mutation patterns related to clinical severity and the molecular epidemiologic traits in Korean chronic patients based on previous reports. Generally, several lines of evidence, including our previous results, have led to the conclusion that a combination of the exclusive predominance of genotype C2, which is prone to mutations, the high prevalence of basal core promoter double mutations, and the presence of distinct immune responses against HBV proteins in the Korean population may generate the distinct HBV variants rarely or not encountered in other areas, which results in distinct clinical manifestations in Korean chronic patients. This may provide a novel insight into the relationships between clinical severity, HBV genotype distribution, and HBV naturally occurring variants.
