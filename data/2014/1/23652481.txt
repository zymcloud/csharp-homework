We report a new variation of the left hepatic artery arising from the superior mesenteric artery. The variant was discovered during radiological examinations in a patient presenting with ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma of the left liver lobe. Anatomical description was based on CT-scan and angiographic analysis. When present the left hepatic artery originates from the left gastric artery, with an incidence of 12-34 %. Knowledge of left hepatic artery anatomy is mandatory to optimize surgical and radiological management in complex clinical situations.
