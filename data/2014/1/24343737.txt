Objectives:Recent advances in sophisticated technologies in proteomics should provide promising ways to discover novel markers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the early diagnosis.Methods:Serum peptide and protein profiling was conducted by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Profiling was carried out in a training set of 16 patients with HCC and a testing set of 15 patients with cirrhosis without HCC. All the patients were hepatitis C virus positive. Candidate peaks were processed to partial purification, followed by protein identification by amino acid sequence analysis. Immunoprecipitation was conducted to confirm the protein identity.Results:Partial purification and protein identification revealed that one peak that was up-regulated in HCC sera both in the training and the testing sets was a fragment of apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I). Immunoprecipitation confirmed this result.Conclusions:MALDI-TOF MS analysis revealed that apo A-I is a potential novel serum marker of HCC. Combination of these pretreatments and the current magnet bead-assisted MALDI-TOF MS will further enhance the efficiency of biomarker discovery for HCC.
