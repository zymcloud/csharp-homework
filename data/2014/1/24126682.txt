Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection afflicts a reported 170 million people worldwide and is often complicated by cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Morbidity and mortality are decreased with the successful treatment of chronic HCV infection. The current standard of care in the treatment for genotype 1 chronic HCV is pegylated interferon (IFN)-alfa, termed PEG, and ribavirin (RBV) in conjunction with a protease inhibitor, either telaprevir or boceprevir, which results in 67-75% sustained viral response rates. Increased understanding of the HCV has allowed further development of new direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents against the HCV and has also allowed the development of IFN-free oral treatment regimens. We anticipate the approval in late 2013 of the first nucleotide polymerase inhibitor regimen with RBV alone for genotypes 2/3 and in combination with a 12-week regimen of PEG+RBV for genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6. Most of the promising new DAA regimens are discussed herein.
