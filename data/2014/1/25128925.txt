Background:To investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with both hepatitis B virus-surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody negative hepatocellular carcinoma (non-B non-C HCC [NBNC-HCC]) and examine the impact of occult hepatitis B virus infection (OBI) on patients' survival.Methods:All patients with OBI were identified from a database of patients with NBNC-HCC who underwent surgical resection between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2008. Their clinicopathologic and survival characteristics were compared with NBNC-HCC patients without OBI.Results:Out of the 86 NBNC-HCC patients, 59 patients (68.6%) with OBI. A higher prevalence of hepatitis B core antigen positive rate, low platelet count, portal hypertension, and liver cirrhosis were observed in NBNC-HCC patients with OBI. The 1- and 3-y recurrence free survival rates were 66% and 25% in OBI group and 89% and 70% in the no OBI group, respectively (P Conclusions:NBNC-HCC patients with OBI had a poorer prognosis. OBI can be a useful predictor for recurrence in patients with NBNC-HCC after surgery.
