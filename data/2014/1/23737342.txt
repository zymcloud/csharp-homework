The present study evaluated the efficacy of chemotherapy combined with targeted arterial infusion of verapamil in patients with advanced gastric cancer. Forty patients were enrolled. Targeted arterial infusion of verapamil was done once a month, 3-5 times per patient, along with chemotherapy. After 2 bouts of combined treatment, the efficacy was evaluated. Primary gastric tumor was confirmed in 38/40 patients, and unconfirmed in 2/40 patients due to adhesion of tumors to surrounding tissue. Combined treatment was administered in 38 patients with defined tumors. Complete response to the treatment was in 5/38 (13.1 %) patients, partial response in 27/38 (71.1 %) patients, stable disease in 4/38 (10.5 %) patients, and progressive disease in 2/38 (5.26 %) patients. The effective rate (i.e., complete + partial response) comprised 84.2 %. There were 31 patients with liver metastases; 10/31 (32.3 %) patients showed complete response, 16/31 (51.6 %) patients showed partial response, 3/31 (9.7 %) patients had stable disease, and 2/31 (6.5 %) patients had progressive disease. The effective rate in these patients was 83.8 %. Thirty-seven patients were followed up, and 27/37 (73.0 %) patients were alive for 6 months or longer, 19/37 (51.3 %) for 12 months, 8 (35.1 %) for 18 months, and 8/37 (21.6 %) for 24 months. In conclusion, in patients with advanced gastric cancer, chemotherapy is more effective when combined with targeted arterial infusion of verapamil, leading to extended patients' survival and improved quality of life.
