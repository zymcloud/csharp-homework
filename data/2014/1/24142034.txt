Background:A number of cohort studies have compared the outcomes of liver transplantation (LT) and liver resection (LR) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. However, the effects of LT versus LR remain unclear. We searched electronic databases and reference lists for relevant articles published before February 2013.Methods:The primary endpoints were pooled using random-effects models to model potential heterogeneity, including overall survival (OS), disease-free survival, and recurrence rate.Results:We found similar 1-year OS (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-1.43; P=0.61) yet significantly better 3-year OS (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.18-1.84; PConclusions:When including all the 62 previous studies comparing LT and resection, LT provides increased survival and lower recurrence rates than LR for HCC patients. These results of disease-free survival and recurrence rate are similar among early HCC patients with Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A cirrhosis. However, summary ORs and risk differences cannot be interpreted as causal effects of LT versus LR.
