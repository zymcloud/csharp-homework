The aims of the present study were to examine the relationship between the preoperative FIB-4 index and background liver fibrosis in non-tumor parts obtained from surgical specimens and to investigate whether the FIB-4 index can be a useful predictor for non-B non-C hepatocellular carcinoma (NBNC-HCC) patients treated with surgical resection (SR). A total of 118 patients with NBNC-HCC treated with SR with curative intent were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed for calculating the area under the ROC (AUROC) for the FIB-4 index, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index, AST to alanine aminotransferase ratio, serum albumin, total bilirubin and platelet count for cirrhosis. We also examined predictors linked to overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) after SR. The mean patient age was 68.9±9.0 years (93 males and 25 females) with a median observation period of 3.2 years. In extracted surgical specimens, background liver cirrhosis (F4) was observed in 39 patients (33.1%). The mean maximum tumor size was 5.7±3.2 cm. The mean body mass index was 24.3±3.9 kg/m2. The FIB-4 index yielded the highest AUROC for cirrhosis with a level of 0.887 at an optimal cut-off value of 2.97 (sensitivity, 92.3; specificity, 69.6%). In the multivariate analysis, serum α-fetoprotein >40 ng/ml (P=0.026) was the only significant independent predictor linked to OS, while tumor number (P=0.002) and FIB-4 index >2.97 (P=0.044) were significant factors linked to RFS. In conclusion, preoperative FIB-4 index can be a useful predictor for NBNC-HCC patients who undergo SR.
