Objective:To investigate the effects of Chinese medicine (CM) herbal treatment based on syndrome differentiation on patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 94 patients with unresectable HCC were reviewed between June 2008 and June 2011. Survival analysis was performed between patients who received CM with/without non-curative antitumor treatments of Western medicine (WM) (CM group, 30 cases) and patients who were not treated with CM but with non-curative antitumor treatments of WM or supportive treatment alone (non-CM group, 64 cases). Then, survival analysis was performed between patients treated with CM combined with non-curative antitumor treatments of WM (combination therapy group, 25 cases) and patients with non-curative antitumor treatments of WM alone (non-curative antitumor treatments group of WM, 52 cases). The survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method and prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) were assessed by the Cox proportional hazards regression model.Results:The median survival time (MST), 1- and 2-year survival rates of the CM group and the non-CM group were 36 months, 76.7%, 56.1% and 12 months, 48.4%, 26.6%, respectively. The Log-rank test revealed significant difference between the two groups in OS (PConclusions:CM herbs based on syndrome differentiation have positive effects on survival of patients with unresectable HCC. Furthermore, combination therapy of CM and WM are recommended in HCC treatment.
