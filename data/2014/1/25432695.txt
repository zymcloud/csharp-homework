Glypican-3 (GPC3) is a widely used immunohistochemical marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, its prognostic value is unclear. Immunohistochemical evaluation of GPC3 expression was performed on 300 postoperative HCC tissue samples with paired adjacent non-tumor tissues on tissue microarray sections. The integral optic density, representing the expression level of GPC3 in each HCC sample, was calculated using Image-Pro Plus. The outcome-based cut-point optimization was performed using X-tile software. GPC3 was highly expressed in HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. The expression level of GPC3 was significantly correlated with overall survival (OS) and time to recurrence (TTR). The lower the level of GPC3 expression in HCC tissue, the poorer the observed prognosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the expression level of GPC3 in HCC was an independent prognostic factor for both OS and TTR. In conclusion, GPC3 expression is an independent prognostic factor for postoperative HCC, and low expression levels of GPC3 in HCC may indicate poor outcome.
