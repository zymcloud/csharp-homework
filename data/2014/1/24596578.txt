Background:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection significantly contributes to the onset of liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Understanding the pathogenesis of HBV infection susceptibility could help us to control HBV infection effectively.Objectives:This study investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the tripartite motif-containing 22 (TRIM22) gene associated with HBV infection outcome.Patients and methods:A total of 765 Chinese Han subjects were enrolled: 293 patients were presented with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 224 were asymptomatic HBV carriers, 248 had self-limited HBV infection, and all of them were recruited for TRIM22 SNPs genotyping. RING and SPRY domains of TRIM22 gene were DNA-sequenced, and HBV serum markers and HBV DNA were measured quantitatively in all subjects.Results:243 (31.76%) of 765 Chinese Han patients showed genetic variation in the TRIM22 gene. TRIM22 SNPs were mainly in RING area -364T/C site, accounting for 98.35% of the population. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in the RING domain -364T/C SNP and allele frequencies between patients with chronic hepatitis and asymptomatic HBV carriers. The CC genotype of TRIM22 gene RING domain -364T/C locus (rs10838543) was associated with chronic HBV infection (OR = 2.30, 95% CI = 1.24-3.97, P = 0.0012; OR = 2.26, 95% CI = 1.08-3.74, P = 0.002) and a mutant allele C carrier of the TRIM22 gene was associated with HBV chronic infection (OR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.10-3.75, P = 0.0049; OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.17-3.89, P = 0.0038).Conclusions:TRIM22 gene RING domain -364T/C polymorphism is associated with chronic HBV infection in Chinese Han population.
