Background:Intrahepatic segmental portal vein thrombosis after living-related liver transplantation (LRLT) is uncommon. The cause remains unclear.Methods:After providing written informed consent, 25 recipients receiving LRLT at our institution from January 2011 to September 2013 were enrolled in this study. We performed triphase computerized tomographic (CT) study of the liver graft of each recipient 1 month after LRLT. The patencies of hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic vein were evaluated in detail. The triphase CT scans of the liver of each donor before transplantation also were reviewed. Thrombosis of the intrahepatic segmental portal vein was defined as the occlusion site of the portal vein being intrahepatic. Extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis was excluded in this study.Results:Among the 25 patients, 2 (8%) developed thrombosis of intrahepatic segmental portal vein. One 47-year-old man received LRLT for hepatitis B viral infection-related liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class C) with 3 hepatocellular carcinomas (total tumor volume Conclusions:Thrombosis of intrahepatic segmental portal vein is not common but is usually associated with complications of intrahepatic bile duct. Early detection is important, and follow-up CT study of liver is suggested.
