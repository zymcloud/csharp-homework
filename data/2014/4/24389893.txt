Objective:The purpose of this study was to evaluate MRI features for the differentiation of hepatic angiomyolipoma (HAML) from fat-containing hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the MRI findings of 20 patients with 22 hepatic angiomyolipomas and 25 patients with fat-containing hepatocellular carcinomas before surgery. The MRI features and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for the two types of tumors were compared and analyzed.Results:Fat was not detected in nine (40.9%) of the angiomyolipomas. An enhancement pattern of the washout area was seen in eight (36.4%) of the angiomyolipomas and 21 of the hepatocellular carcinomas (84%) (p = 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the enhancement pattern for HAML were 63.6% (14/22), 84% (21/25), and 74.5% (35/47), respectively. An early draining vein was seen in 16 (72.7%) angiomyolipomas and two hepatocellular carcinomas (8%) (p Conclusion:The presence of an early draining vein and tumor vessels, the absence of pseudocapsules and a higher ADC in the hypervascular hepatic tumor on the MRI were helpful for the differentiation of hepatic angiomyolipoma from fat-containing hepatocellular carcinoma.
