Aim:To evaluate the long-term results of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) compared to left lateral sectionectomy (LLS) in patients with Child-Pugh class A disease for the treatment of single and small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the left lateral segments.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the data of 133 patients with single HCC (≤ 3 cm) in their left lateral segments who underwent curative LLS (n = 66) or RFA (n = 67) between 2006 and 2010.Results:The median follow-up period was 33.5 mo in the LLS group and 29 mo in the RFA group (P = 0.060). Most patients had hepatitis B virus-related HCC. The hospital stay was longer in the LLS group than in the RFA group (8 d vs 2 d, P Conclusion:Liver resection is suitable for single HCC ≤ 3 cm in the left lateral segments.
