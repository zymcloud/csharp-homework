Objective:To evaluate the correlation between Cancer Antigen-25 (CA-125) levels with the amount of ascites in patients with liver cirrhosis.Study design:Observational, analytical study.Place and duration of study:Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, from March 2012 to February 2013.Methodology:A total of 130 patients with liver cirrhosis (with and without ascites) had serum CA-125 levels measured. The amount of ascites was classified according to physical examination and ultrasound (USG) findings. CA-125 levels were compared and correlated with amount of ascites.Results:Majority of patients (57%) had hepatitis C virus and 60% were in class Child Pugh C. There was moderate correlation between amount of ascites and CA-125 levels (r = 0.642, p < 0.001) with significant raised levels of CA-125 in patients with ascites (p < 0.001).Conclusion:There was a moderate correlation between CA-125 levels and presence and amount of ascites.
