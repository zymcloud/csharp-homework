Background:Aggressive surgical resection of neuroendocrine tumour liver metastases (NET-LM) is associated with symptomatic relief. Debulking up to 90% of tumour burden, even with positive margins, may be beneficial. However, patients with diffuse hepatic metastases may not qualify for resection owing to associated insufficient remnant liver parenchyma. The purpose of this study is to describe an early experience with a hepatic parenchymal preserving (HPP) approach.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed our institutional neuroendocrine tumours database to identify patients with NET-LM, including symptomatic patients with extensive bilobar involvement, who underwent virtual volumetric assessment (VVA) combined with HPP resection between October 2008 and July 2011.Results:Our study involved 9 patients. The median number of liver metastases resected was 10 (range 4-50). Symptomatic improvement was observed in all patients. Immediate postoperative normalization of 5-HIAA 24-hour urine levels occurred in 89% of patients. Symptomatic and biochemical response remained stable or improved in 75% of patients at 12 months of follow-up. Four patients had postoperative complications. There was no 90-day mortality.Conclusion:The described HPP approach is feasible and safe. Most patients experienced symptomatic and biochemical improvement. This reproducible approach could expand surgical resection options for patients with NET-LM and diffuse bilobar involvement.
