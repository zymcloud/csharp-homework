Purpose:To evaluate the value of measuring shear wave velocity evoked by acoustic radiation force impulse (VTTQ) for the risk assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Methods:VTTQ was measured three times in each of the four liver segments in 163 NAFLD patients, including 14 HCC cases; the results were statistically evaluated.Results:The VTTQ was 3.04 ± 0.17 m/s (median ± median absolute deviation) and 1.27 ± 0.25 m/s in patients with and without HCC, respectively, and was significantly higher in HCC cases (p Conclusions:These results suggest that fibrosis occurs heterogeneously throughout the liver and that VTTQ measurements are useful in HCC risk evaluation in a NAFLD cohort.
