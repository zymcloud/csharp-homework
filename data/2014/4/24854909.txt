Objective:To compare the performance of 7 prognostic staging systems in predicting the survival of surgical patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 908 surgical HCC patients were recruited from January, 1999 to December, 2010 at our hospital. They were assigned retrospectively into different stages according to the classification criteria of 7 different staging systems. That is, Tumor-Node-Metastasis classification system (TNM7th), Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system (BCLC), Tokyo score, Japan Integrated Staging score (JIS), model for the Chinese University Prognostic Index grade (CUPI), Cancer of the Liver Italian Program score (CLIP) and Okuda staging. Kaplan-Meier survival estimations were performed and P values assessed with Log-rank test.Results:Significant survival difference was found across all groups of these staging systems(P Conclusion:TNM7th staging system is a better staging model for HCC of Chinese population among seven currently applied staging systems.
