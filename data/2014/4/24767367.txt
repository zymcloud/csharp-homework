Background:New-onset diabetes mellitus (NODM) has a negative impact on graft and patient survivals. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, high body mass index, increased donor and recipient ages, and calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) type have been identified as risk factors for the development of NODM. We aimed to elucidate the risk factors for the development of NODM and those for progressive glucose intolerance in adult living-donor liver transplant (LDLT) recipients.Methods:We collected data from 188 primary liver transplant recipients (age > 16 years) who underwent LDLT from June 1991 to December 2011 at Hiroshima University Hospital. Risk factors for NODM and progressive impairment of glucose metabolism in pre-transplantation diabetes mellitus (DM) recipients were examined.Results:Pre-transplantation DM was diagnosed in 32 recipients (19.3%). The overall incidence of NODM was 6.0% (8/134 recipients). Multivariate analysis revealed that old recipient age (≥55 years) is a unique predictive risk factor for developing NODM. The incident of pre-transplantation DM was significantly higher in recipients with HCV infection than in those without HCV. A high pre-transplantation triglyceride level was an independent risk factor for progressive impairment of glucose tolerance among 32 LDLT recipients with pre-transplantation DM. All of the NODM patients were being treated with tacrolimus at the time of diagnosis. Switching the CNI from tacrolimus to cyclosporine allowed one-half of the patients (4/8) to withdraw from insulin-dependent therapy. NODM and post-transplantation glucose intolerance had no negative impact on patient and graft outcomes.Conclusions:Older age of the recipient (≥55 years) was a significant risk factor for NODM. Hypertriglyceridemia in the recipients with DM is an independent risk factor for post-transplantation progressive impairment of glucose metabolism. NODM had no negative impact on outcomes in the LDLT recipients.
