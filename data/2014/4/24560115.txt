Tumors of the biliary tract and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are complex tumors with heterogeneous carcinogenic mechanisms. Patients with hepatobiliary cancer have advances disease and need systematic therapy to palliate symptoms and extend survival. Development of effective systematic therapy is a significant unmet medical need. It is hoped that current and future clinical trials will identify additional effective systemic agents, combination systemic therapies, and combined modality options. The HCC community needs validated biomarkers to help identify the patients who will benefit most from emerging treatment options.
