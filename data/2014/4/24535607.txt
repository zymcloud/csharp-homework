The aims of this study were to compare the prognostic ability of inflammation-based prognostic scores including the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, prognostic index, and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing hepatectomy, and to propose the combination of staging systems and inflammation scores to improve the prognostic power. Data for 349 patients who underwent hepatectomy as initial treatment for HCC between 2008 and 2009 were retrieved from a prospective database. The association of inflammation scores with clinicopathological variables and overall survival (OS) was analyzed, and the concordance index (C-index) was calculated to compare the predictive ability of each inflammation scores and staging systems including Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) and Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) scores. The median follow-up period was 39 months, the 1, 2, and 3 year OS was 75.4, 67.0, and 59.0 %, respectively, and the median OS was 39 months. All inflammation scores, except PNI, were associated with tumor size, major/microvascular invasion and clinical stages, and the GPS and mGPS had a higher C-index (0.608). Multivariate analysis showed that the GPS, BCLC, and CLIP were independently associated with OS. The combined GPS and CLIP (C-index = 0.705) were superior to CLIP alone (C-index = 0.686) or the GPS alone in prognostic ability. The prognostic ability of the GPS is superior to other inflammation scores for patients undergoing hepatectomy as initial treatment for HCC. Combining GPS and CLIP improved the prognostic power.
