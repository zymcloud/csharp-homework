Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a public health problem as a cause of liver diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis. It is estimated that 350 million people live with chronic infection and about one million people die every year from complication of this chronic disease in the world. So far, ten HBV genotypes (A-J) has been identified which show a geographical distribution. Throughout the world, carrier variability rate for hepatitis B infection is estimated to be 0.1% to 20%, with regions classified as having low endemicity (8%). The prevalence of hepatitis B infection is estimated at 2 to 7 percent In Iran. After HBV vaccination program the prevalence of hepatitis B infection has been reported less than 2%, so Iran can be considered one of the countries with low HBV infection endemicity. In Iran several studies were shown that the only genotype of HBV(100%)was found genotype D as the prominent type in some provinces, but some studies reported genotype B(5%)as well as genotype D(95%).The distribution of HBV genotypes may guide us in determining disease burden, prognosis and antiviral responses. So, it is important to know the epidemiologically of HBV genotyping as well.
