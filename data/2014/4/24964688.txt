Objective:To study and to compare the medical and economic burden among chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients.Material and method:A prospective observational study was conducted among 129 adult CHB patients. The medical burden was assessed by using the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) and the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ) at initial day, the six and 12-month follow-up. The economic burden was assessed in term of total cost per case per yearResults:At one-year follow-up, the mean age of 129 patients was 41.6 (SD = 11.8) years. For medical burden at over time, CHB with antiviral drugs (ARV) for hepatitis B infection had a significant decreased in percentage of anxiety, and increased the mean (SD) CLDQ score. The mean total costs per case per year of CHB without ARV (52 cases), CHB with antiviral drugs (50 cases), and CHB with cirrhosis/hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with ARV (27 cases) were significantly different (p Conclusion:CHB causes a great economic burden in Thailand Early antiviral drugs treatment prevents complication in CHB patients.
