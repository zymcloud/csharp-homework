Water-soluble ginseng oligosaccharides (WGOS) composed of D-glucose with a degree of polymerisation ranging from 2 to 14 were obtained from Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer. In this study, the anti-tumour and immunoregulatory effects of WGOS were evaluated in Hepatoma-22 (H22)-bearing mice. Treatment with WGOS inhibited tumour growth in vivo and significantly increased relative spleen and thymus weight, serum tumour necrosis factor-Î± level, spleen lymphocyte proliferation, natural killer cell activity, phagocytic function and nitric oxide production secreted by macrophage in H22-bearing mice. However, no direct cytotoxicity was detected. Therefore, the anti-tumour activity of WGOS may be related to their immunomodulatory effects.
