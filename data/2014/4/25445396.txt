Background & aims:Hepatitis B virus genotype G (HBV/G) is characterized by a lack of HBeAg secretion and very low HBsAg secretion. This study aimed at (1) comparing HBV genotype G and A2 with respect to morphogenesis and release of HBV-derived particles, (2) characterizing factors contributing to HBV/G-associated pathogenesis.Methods:HBV/G- and HBV/A-expressing hepatoma cells and infected HepaRG cells were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, Western blot, real-time PCR, density gradient centrifugation, and electron microscopy. Modulation of the transcription factors Nrf2 and AP-1 was analyzed.Results:While the release of viral particles is not affected in HBV/G replicating cells, the secretion of subviral particles is impaired, although they are produced in high amounts. These subviral particles, which display an increased density and a predominantly filamentous morphology, accumulate at the endoplasmic reticulum. The PreS1PreS2 domain of genotype G, which forms aggregates, causes the block of HBsAg-secretion at the ER and leads to decreased transcriptional activator function of LHBs. Intracellular accumulation of HBsAg and impaired induction of the cytoprotective transcription factor Nrf2 lead to an elevated level of ROIs. This results in activation of JNK and as a consequence in Ser-phosphorylation of IRS-1, which is known to impair insulin signaling, a key factor for liver regeneration.Conclusions:Although competent for release of viral particles, secretion of subviral particles is impaired in HBV/G expressing cells leading to ER-stress. In parallel, HBV-induced Nrf2 activation diminishes, which causes a decrease of the capacity to inactivate ROIs. This might be related to genotype-specific pathogenesis.
