Liver transplantation (LT) is one of the few effective treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our aim in this study was to evaluate the risk factors for HCC recurrence and propose new criteria for LT based on pretransplantation findings. One hundred eighty patients who underwent LT for HCC between 2002 and 2008 were reviewed retrospectively. Outcome measures included maximal tumor size and number of tumors revealed by radiological studies before transplantation, demographics, and tumor recurrence. Maximal tumor size >6 cm, >7 tumors, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels >1000 ng/mL were identified as independent prognostic factors of HCC recurrence in univariate and multivariate analysis. Disease-free survival rate in patients with a maximal tumor size ≤6 cm, ≤7 tumors, and/or AFP levels ≤1000 ng/mL at 1, 3, and 5 years was 97.9%, 91.5%, and 90.0%, respectively, but the 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival rate of patients who had a maximal tumor size >6 cm, >7 tumors, and/or AFP levels >1000 ng/mL was 61.9%, 47.6%, and 47.6%, respectively (P
