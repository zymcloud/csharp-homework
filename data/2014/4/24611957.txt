Background:There have been encouraging reports on transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt (TIPSS) for Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS). Long-term data are lacking.Aim:To assess long-term outcomes and validate prognostic scores following TIPSS for BCS.Methods:A single centre retrospective study. Patients underwent TIPSS using bare or polytertrafluoroethane (PTFE)-covered stents.Results:Sixty-seven patients received successful TIPSS between 1996 and 2012 using covered (n = 40) or bare (n = 27) stents. Patients included had a Male: Female ratio of 21:46, and were characterised (mean ± s.d.) by age 39.9 ± 14.3 years, Model of end stage liver disease (MELD) 16.1 ± 7.0 and Child's score 8.8 ± 2.0. Seventy-eight percent had haematological risk factors. Presenting symptoms were ascites (n = 61) and variceal bleeding (n = 6). Nine patients underwent hepatic vein dilatation or stenting prior to TIPSS. Mean follow-up was 82 months (range 0.5-184 months). Fifteen percent had post-TIPSS encephalopathy. Two have been transplanted. Primary patency rates (76% vs. 27%, P Conclusions:Long-term outcomes following TIPSS for Budd-Chiari syndrome are very good. PTFE-covered stents have significantly better primary patency. The value of prognostic scores is controversial. TIPSS should be considered as first line therapy in symptomatic patients in whom hepatic vein patency cannot be restored.
