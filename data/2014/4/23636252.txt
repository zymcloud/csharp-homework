We report two cases of pulmonary aspergilloma (PA) in a cavity formed after percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA), a rare complication that has only been described once in the literature. The first patient was a 59-year-old white woman treated for a secondary lung nodule of an advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. One month after PRFA, a consolidation of a cavity was noticed with an "air crescent sign," and aspergilloma serology was highly positive. A bisegmentectomy was performed due to the proximity of the lesion to mediastinal vessels and the absence of significant regression after antifungal treatment. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of PA. The second patient was a 61-year-old white man followed-up for a non-small-cell lung cancer. A cavitation with thick margins in the ablation zone was noticed 6 months after PRFA. A biopsy was performed, and aspergilloma was diagnosed. Medical treatment with itraconazole was administered for 13 months, and there was significant regression.
