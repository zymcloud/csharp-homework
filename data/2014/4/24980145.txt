A 54-year-old woman initially diagnosed with stage IIIb squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix was treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. After 8 months, she developed dyspnea, leg edema, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and liver congestion. Her cardiac ejection fraction was normal and cardiomegaly was not evident. Metastatic carcinomatous pericarditis or pleurisy was suspected, but laboratory findings, including tumor markers, were normal. She was transferred to our hospital for the repair a cardiac injury caused by a pericardial drainage procedure. Emergency surgery was performed for the misplaced drainage catheter in the right atrium and for an abnormal mass in her right and left atria. The clinical diagnosis of carcinomatous pericarditis was made; however, her condition rapidly deteriorated, and she died 6 days postoperatively. At autopsy, metastasis was identified in a large area of the pericardium and myocardium.
