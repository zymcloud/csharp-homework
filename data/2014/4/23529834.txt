Objective:To observe the change in the number of antibodies of preneoplastic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using early treatment by Compound Phyllanthus Urinaria L. (CPUL) on patients with preneoplastic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCC.Methods:A total of 102 cirrhosis patients with regenerative or dysplastic nodules whose sera were tested positive for at least one of these six proteins (five up-regulated genes URG4, URG7, URG11, URG12 and URG19, and one down-regulated gene DRG2) were assigned randomly to two groups using continual random codes by SPSS software. Fifty-two patients were in the treatment group and 50 patients were in the control group. CPUL was used in the treatment group for 3 years, while the control group did not receive any treatment. The changes in HBV-DNA level, number of antibodies, and hepatocarcinogenesis occurred were observed. Patients who did not develop HCC were followed up for another 2 years.Results:HBV-DNA levels decreased ⩾2log in 22.2% (10/45) of patients in the treatment group in contrast to only 5.0% (2/40) of patients in the control group (P=0.0228). The number of antibodies that were tested positive in the treatment group (1.08±1.01) was significantly lower compared with the control group (2.11±1.12) after 24 months of drug treatment (PConclusions:Anti-URG11, anti-URG19 and anti-DRG2 could be used as early markers in the prediction of the therapeutic efficacy of CPUL in treating preneoplastic HCC. CPUL is useful in preventing or delaying the development of HBV-associated cirrhosis to HCC.
