The expression of microRNA-99a (miRNA-99a) has been investigated in a number of human cancers. It has been reported to be downregulated in several types of cancer, including ovarian carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, squamous cell lung carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, bladder cancer, prostate cancer and childhood adrenocortical tumors. In the present study, the effects of miRNA-99a on bladder cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion were examined. Following transfection of miRNA-99a, cell viability, cell migration assay, cell invasion, western blot analysis and luciferase assays were conducted in bladder cancer cell lines. It was found that miRNA-99a inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion in T24 and EJ cells. Additionally, this study provided the first evidence that miRNA-99a is likely to directly target fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 in bladder cancer. The study provided evidence that miRNA-99a suppresses cell proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting growth factor receptor 3 in bladder cancer cell lines. These results indicated that it could be investigated as a target for therapeutic drugs designed to treat bladder cancer.
