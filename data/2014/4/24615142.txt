Purpose:Tailored operative strategies have been proposed for patients with bilobar colorectal liver metastases (CLM). The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term outcome, safety and efficacy, including cancer-specific survival, morbidity, and mortality, of three different surgical strategies for extensive bilateral CLM.Methods:This is a retrospective study of a prospective database of 356 consecutive patients, who underwent hepatic resection due to CLM between January 2003 and January 2009. Fifty-nine patients underwent three different therapeutic approaches: 22 patients with portal vein embolization (PVE) + staged resections, 11 patients with staged resections solely, and 26 patients with an extensive liver resection and simultaneous or subsequent radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Results:The three groups were comparable regarding their general patient characteristics. The overall morbidity and mortality rates were 27.1 and 1.7 %, respectively. There were no significant differences in morbidity, mortality, or survival between the three groups. The median survival of all patients was 48 months, with a recurrence-free survival of 30 months.Conclusions:The clearance of bilobar CLM can be achieved by various strategies, all of them providing an acceptable mortality rate and survival for the patients. Therefore, patients with bilobar liver metastases should receive a procedure tailored for their individual extent of disease.
