Maintaining hepatic inflow and appropriate venous drainage is important for maximizing the capacity of the retrieved graft in liver transplantation. Here, we report a successful case of multiple hepatic vein (HV) reconstruction using an all-in-one sleeve patch graft of the autologous great saphenous vein to ensure adequate blood flow through the HV. A patient with hepatocellular carcinoma caused by hepatitis C virus-induced cirrhosis underwent living donor liver transplantation using a right lobe graft. A preoperative dynamic computed tomography scan and intraoperative findings revealed that the graft had three middle HV tributaries, a superficial vein, segment VIII HV (V8), and segment V HV (V5). The openings of the superficial vein and V8 were located very close to that of the right hepatic vein (RHV) in the cutting surface. Each HV had significant diameter and drainage territory requiring reconstruction. An autologous great saphenous vein was used to create a sleeve patch to incorporate the close-packed HV openings. The autologous sleeve patch graft was sutured to the openings of the RHV and the superficial vein and the hole created on the sleeve patch graft was anastomosed to the openings of V8 directly on the back table to create an all-in-one sleeve patch. For the V5 reconstruction, the recipient's intrahepatic portal vein graft was used to create an interpositional conduit from the recipient's V5 to the inferior vena cava. The postoperative course was uneventful and postoperative studies revealed good graft function with excellent blood flow in the HV.
