Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) exhibit characteristic anion-exchange chemistry making them ideal carriers of negatively charged molecules like deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). In this study, hydrotalcite (Mg-Al) and hydrotalcite-like compounds (Mg-Fe, Zn-Al, and Zn-Fe), also known as LDHs, were evaluated for their potential application as a carrier of DNA. LDHs were prepared by coprecipitation at low supersaturation and characterized by Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared (IR), Raman, and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). XRD patterns showed strong and sharp diffraction peaks for the (003) and (006) planes indicating well-ordered crystalline materials. TEM images yielded irregular circular to hexagonal-shaped particles of 50-250 nm in size. Varying degrees of DNA binding was observed for all the compounds, and nuclease digestion studies revealed that the LDHs afford some degree of protection to the bound DNA. Minimal toxicity was observed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293), cervical cancer (HeLa) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines with most showing a cell viability in excess of 80 %. All LDH complexes promoted significant levels of luciferase gene expression, with the DNA:Mg-Al LDHs proving to be the most efficient in all cell lines.
