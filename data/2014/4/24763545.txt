Background:Asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR)-ligand-based separation combined with identification with Hep Par 1 or pan-cytokeratin (P-CK) antibody have been demonstrated to detect circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to develop an improved enrichment and identification system that allows the detection of all types of HCC CTCs.Methods:The specificity of the prepared anti-ASGPR monoclonal antibody was characterized. HCC cells were bound by ASGPR antibody and subsequently magnetically isolated by second antibody-coated magnetic beads. Isolated HCC cells were identified by immunofluorescence staining using a combination of anti-P-CK and anti-carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) antibodies. Blood samples spiked with HepG2 cells were used to determine recovery and sensitivity. CTCs were detected in blood samples from HCC patients and other patients.Results:ASGPR was exclusively expressed in human hepatoma cell line, normal hepatocytes and HCC cells in tissue specimens detected by the ASGPR antibody staining. More HCC cells could be identified by the antibody cocktail for CPS1 and P-CK compared with a single antibody. The current approach obtained a higher recovery rate of HepG2 cells and more CTC detection from HCC patients than the previous method. Using the current method CTCs were detected in 89% of HCC patients and no CTCs were found in the other test subjects.Conclusions:Our anti-ASGPR antibody could be used for specific and efficient HCC CTC enrichment, and anti-P-CK combined with anti-CPS1 antibodies is superior to identification with one antibody alone in the sensitivity for HCC CTC detection.
