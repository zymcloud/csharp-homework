Current GH administration protocols imply frequent s.c. injections, resulting in suboptimal compliance. Therefore, there is interest in developing delivery systems for sustained release of the hormone. However, GH has different actions depending on its continuous or pulsatile plasma concentration pattern. GH levels and circulating concentration patterns could be involved in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in liver. Aberrant expression of this receptor and/or its hyperactivation has been associated with the pathogenesis of different types of carcinoma. Considering that one of the adverse effects associated with GH overexpression and chronic use of GH is the increased incidence of malignancies, the aim of this study was to analyze the effects of GH plasma concentration patterns on EGFR expression and signaling in livers of mice. For this purpose, GH was administered by s.c. daily injections to produce an intermittent plasma pattern or by osmotic pumps to provoke a continuously elevated GH concentration. Intermittent injections of GH induced upregulation of liver EGFR content, augmented the response to EGF, and the induction of proteins involved in promotion of cell proliferation in female mice. In contrast, continuous GH delivery in male mice was associated with diminished EGFR in liver and decreased EGF-induced signaling and expression of early genes. The results indicate that sustained delivery systems that allow continuous GH plasma patterns would be beneficial in terms of treatment safety with regard to the actions of GH on EGFR signaling and its promitogenic activity.
