Background:Aberrant signaling mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) occurs at high frequency in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), indicating that mTOR is a candidate for targeted therapy. mTOR forms two complexes called mTORC1 (mTOR complexed with raptor) and mTORC2 (mTOR complexed with rictor). There are minor studies of the expression kinetics of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in HCC.Methods:We studied 62 patients with HCC who underwent curative resection. We used univariate and multivariate analyses to identify factors that potentially influence disease and overall survival after hepatectomy. The mRNA and protein levels of mTOR, rictor and raptor in cancer and non-cancer tissues were analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting.Results/conclusion:High ratio of the levels of rictor and raptor mRNAs in tumors was identified as independent prognostic indicators for disease-free survival. Low and high levels of preoperative serum albumin and mTOR mRNA in the tumor, respectively, were identified as independent indicators of overall survival. HCC is likely to recur early after hepatic resection in patients with high levels of mTOR and rictor mRNAs and high rictor/raptor ratios in cancer tissues. We conclude that analysis of mTOR expression in cancer tissues represents an essential strategy to predict HCC recurrence after curative treatment.
