Hepatocellular carcinoma arises in patients as a consequence of long-standing preexisting liver illnesses, including viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, or metabolic disease. In such preexisting liver diseases, TGF-β plays an important role in orchestrating a favorable microenvironment for tumor cell growth and promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). TGF-β signaling promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression by two mechanisms: first, via an intrinsic activity as an autocrine or paracrine growth factor and, second, via an extrinsic activity by inducing microenvironment changes, including cancer-associated fibroblasts, T regulatory cells, and inflammatory mediators. Although there is an increasing understanding on how TGF-β signaling is associated with tumor progression in hepatocellular carcinoma, it is not clear whether TGF-β signaling is limited to a certain subgroup of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or is a key driver of hepatocellular carcinoma during the entire tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Inhibitors of the TGF-β signaling have been shown to block hepatocellular carcinoma growth and progression by modulating EMT in different experimental models, leading to the clinical investigation of the TGF-β inhibitor LY2157299 monohydrate in hepatocellular carcinoma. Preliminary results from a phase II clinical trial have shown improved clinical outcome and also changes consistent with a reduction of EMT.
