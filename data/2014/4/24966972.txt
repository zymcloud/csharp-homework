Purpose:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an effective treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, acute kidney injury (AKI) is a severe complication that commonly occurs in patients undergo TACE. In this study, we aim to investigate the incidence and risk factors associated with AKI in HCC patients received TACE treatment.Methods:This study enrolled 380 HCC patients who received a total of 453 TACE treatments. The incidence, clinical outcomes and risk factors of AKI were examined.Results:The incidence of post-TACE AKI was 9.05% (41/453). Of these, 3 patients (7.3%) progressed to chronic kidney failure while 7 patients (17.1%) died within 1 month of TACE. The Child-Pugh score (OR=3.784, 95% CI 1.899-7.542, p=0.000), pre-operative serum uric acid (OR=1.450, 95% CI 1.202-1.750, p=0.000), and proteinuria (OR=2.393, 95% CI 1.139-5.031, p=0.021) were independent risk factors for the development of post-TACE AKI.Conclusion:AKI is a common complication in HCC patients received TACE. The Child-Pugh score, preoperative serum uric acid and proteinuria may be used to predict the risk of post-TACE AKI in HCC patients undergo TACE.
