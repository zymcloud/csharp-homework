Objective:To provide potential evidence for the existence of abnormal Savda, we assessed host metabonomic responses and dynamic changes occurring in various diseases using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabonomics.Methods:Plasma samples taken from patients with complicated diseases with abnormal Savda (n = 140, including 35 cases each of diabetes, asthma, breast cancer, and cervical carcinoma) and from healthy controls (n = 35) were analyzed by 1H NMR (600 MHz), and the spectral profiles were analyzed by multivariate analysis using orthogonal projection to latent structure with discriminant analysis.Results:Supervised modeling of the data provided very good discrimination between patients and healthy controls. Compared with the healthy controls, the patient groups with different disease conditions displayed similar metabolic changes, characterized by lower creatine, creatinine, lactate, and amino acid levels (including isoleucine, leucine, valine, alanine, and 1-methylhistidine) and higher lipid levels (very low-density lipoproteins and unsaturated lipids). Additionally, cancer patients (breast and cervical) showed decreased myo-inositol, a-glucose, and beta-glucose, and increased pyruvate and carnitine in plasma.Conclusion:The data indicate that decreased oxidative defense, liver function abnormalities, amino acid deficiencies, and energy metabolism disorders are common characteristics of complicated diseases, which may be related to the formation of abnormal Savda.
