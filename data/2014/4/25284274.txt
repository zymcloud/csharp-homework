Purpose:Chinese American immigrants have higher rates of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections and consequently higher rates of liver cancer compared to the general U.S.Population:The need to assess this vulnerable population's knowledge and health practices is important to prevent HBV infections and improve outcomes. The purpose of this study was to describe HBV knowledge and preventive practices among Chinese American immigrants in Southern California.Data sources:Convenience sample of 179 Chinese American immigrants age â‰¥18 years from Los Angeles County (CA) participated in the study by completing a modified version of the B Free CEED's Hepatitis B Needs Assessment survey.Conclusions:Most participants were knowledgeable of HBV (91.6%) or HBV vaccination (70.5%), yet screening and vaccination for the virus were low (36.9% and 26.3%, respectively). Low knowledge was also found regarding modes of disease transmission. Barriers to engage preventive practices included: "feeling well/no health problems" and "not suggested by a doctor." These findings suggest the need for further education.Implications for practice:Nurse practitioners can play a significant role in assessing risk and implementing programs that are community focused, culturally sensitive, and evidence based to improve knowledge, screening, and preventive behaviors on HBV infections for this vulnerable population.
