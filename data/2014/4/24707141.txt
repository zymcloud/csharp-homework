Understanding the natural course of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is very important for the management and treatment of chronic hepatitis B in children. Based on treatment guidelines, the management of HBV carriers and treatment of active hepatitis have been advancing and resulted in increased survival, as well as decreased risks of complications such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Development of a continuing medical education (CME) program for primary physicians becomes an important responsibility of pediatric hepatologists. CME could prevent misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment that could lead to liver complications or antiviral resistance. In addition, education of patients and their parents is necessary to achieve better therapeutic outcomes.
