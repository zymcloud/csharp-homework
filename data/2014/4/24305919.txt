Background:Liver resection is the mainstay of curative treatment for localized hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the impact of surgery for HCC on quality of life (QOL) has not been well assessed.Methods:Health-related QOL was assessed using the Short Form-36 questionnaire in 108 patients who underwent a liver resection for HCC between January 2004 and January 2008. The QOL assessment was scheduled before and every 3 months after the operation. Patients were divided into two groups based on patient-, tumor-, and surgery-related variables. The physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) were compared between the two groups.Results:Altogether, 69 patients (64 %) completed the consecutive QOL assessments until 6 months after surgery. At 3 months, the PCS scores were significantly lower for women and for patients who had undergone thoracotomy than among men (p = 0.010) and patients who had not undergone thoracotomy (p = 0.048), respectively. No significant differences in any of the PCS scores were observed at 6 months. No significant differences in the MCS scores were observed between the groups throughout the investigation, and improvement relative to the preoperative status was observed at 6 months.Conclusions:Physical impairments in the QOL after surgery had returned to the baseline at 6 months, and the postoperative mental QOL improved relative to the preoperative state. The surgical candidates were expected to have a satisfactory QOL regardless of the preoperative status and surgical outcomes. A thoracoabdominal approach had a transient negative impact on the physical health status.
