Background:One of the best treatments for isolated hepatocellular carcinoma in the caudate lobe is major hepatectomy with caudate lobectomy, but it is not suitable for patients with poor liver function reserve. Isolated caudate lobectomy, which is a very difficult operation, is thus an alternative option.Methods:Here we report an isolated caudate lobectomy with an anterior approach in the treatment of a large hepatocellular carcinoma with underlying cirrhosis, with focus on the technical aspects.Results:In the operation, both the left and right lobes of the liver were mobilized. Hepatotomy was done along the round ligament where parenchymal transection was minimal. After exposure of the left and middle hepatic veins and the hilar plate, the caudate lobe and the tumor were resected en bloc with a 5-mm margin.Conclusion:Isolated caudate lobectomy can be performed safely with this anterior approach on patients with poor liver function reserve.
