Background:Although radiologic size criteria (Milan/University of California, San Francisco [UCSF]) have led to improved outcomes after liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), recurrence remains a significant challenge. We analyzed our 30-year experience with LT for HCC to identify predictors of recurrence.Study design:A novel clinicopathologic risk score and prognostic nomogram predicting post-transplant HCC recurrence was developed from a multivariate competing-risk Cox regression analysis of 865 LT recipients with HCC between 1984 and 2013.Results:Overall patient and recurrence-free survivals were 83%, 68%, 60% and 79%, 63%, and 56% at 1-, 3-, and 5-years, respectively. Hepatocellular carcinoma recurred in 117 recipients, with a median time to recurrence of 15 months, involving the lungs (59%), abdomen/pelvis (38%), liver (35%), bone (28%), pleura/mediastinum (12%), and brain (5%). Multivariate predictors of recurrence included tumor grade/differentiation (G4/poor diff hazard ratio [HR] 8.86; G2-3/mod-poor diff HR 2.56), macrovascular (HR 7.82) and microvascular (HR 2.42) invasion, nondownstaged tumors outside Milan criteria (HR 3.02), nonincidental tumors with radiographic maximum diameter â‰¥ 5 cm (HR 2.71) and Conclusions:In the largest single-institution experience with LT for HCC, excellent long-term survival was achieved. Incorporation of routine pretransplantation biomarkers to existing radiographic size criteria significantly improves the ability to predict post-transplant recurrence, and should be considered in recipient selection. A novel clinicopathologic prognostic nomogram accurately predicts HCC recurrence after LT and may guide frequency of post-transplantation surveillance and adjuvant therapy.
