Background:We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and clinical significance of using a modified liver-mobilization technique to treat renal cell carcinoma (RCC) combined with intrahepatic inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis.Methods:A total of 11 level III thrombus patients underwent radical nephrectomy with resection of the tumor thrombus from intrahepatic IVC. A father clamp was used in combination with hepatic portal blocking to control the IVC.Results:The intraoperative mortality and postoperative complications were reduced in 11 cases of RCC with intrahepatic IVC thrombosis. The mean blood loss was 800 mL, and mean patient hospital stay was 13 days. Follow-up was conducted for one to four months, with only two cases of recurrence recorded.Conclusions:The proposed modified liver-mobilization technique could safely and effectively treat RCC and reduce intrahepatic IVC thrombosis.
