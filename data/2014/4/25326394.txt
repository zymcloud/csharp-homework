Background:Targeted therapy or chemotherapy is suggested as standard treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with performance status (PS) 1-2 according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system. The underlying rationales have not been fully studied.Methods:This study enrolled 2,620 HCC patients. One-to-one matched pairs between HCC patients receiving aggressive anti-HCC treatments (resection, transplantation, ablation, and transarterial chemoembolization) and those receiving targeted therapy or chemotherapy or best supportive care were generated by using the propensity score with a matching model. Survival analysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Mortality risk was calculated with the Cox proportional hazards model.Results:Of 793 patients with PS 1-2, 64 % received aggressive anti-HCC treatments against the suggestion of the BCLC system. The patients receiving aggressive anti-HCC treatments had significantly milder cirrhosis, a smaller tumor burden, and better long-term survival than the patients undergoing targeted therapy or chemotherapy or best supportive care (all p 0.05) at baseline. In the propensity score model, patients with PS 1-2 undergoing aggressive anti-HCC treatments had significantly better long-term survival (p Conclusions:According to the findings, HCC patients with PS 1-2 should consider aggressive anticancer treatments if no contraindication is noted. Adjustment of the BCLC treatment allocation is needed to enhance its prognostic accuracy.
