Aflatoxin B1 is a potent carcinogen which can induce** hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in mammals. Though microRNAs are known to play important roles in tumorigenesis, the functional complexity of microRNAs in AFB1-induced hepatocellular tumorigenesis has not yet been elucidated. Here, we applied Illumina deep sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of microRNA in rat liver tissue before and after treatment with aflatoxin B1. Analysis of mature miRNAs from different arms of pre-miRNAs allowed us to identify the predominant form of miRNA. We studied the differential expression profile of miRNAs in two libraries, identifying several cancer-related microRNAs which exhibit abnormal expression. KEGG analysis indicated that predicted target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs are involved in cancer-related pathways. Bioinformatic analysis predicted 16 potential novel miRNAs. Our work provides new insights at the miRNA level into AFB1-induced hepatic injury which may lead to HCC.
