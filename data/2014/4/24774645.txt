Background:Viral hepatitis exists throughout the world and is a major global public health problem affecting millions of people. Hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) virus are the commonest causes of inflammation of the liver leading to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and even fulminant hepatitis. The objective of this retrospective study was to determine the prevalence of infections with HBV and HCV among patients with chronic hepatitis who visited Bereka Medical Center, southeast Ethiopia.Methods:Institution based retrospective study design was employed. HBV and HCV test records of all patients with chronic hepatitis who visited Bereka Medical Center from Nov. 2012 to Nov. 2013. A total of 578 (358 for HBV and 220 for HCV) patients with chronic hepatitis screened and the results of all patients were included. All sera were screened using commercially available rapid test kits. Test results were shown in percent and prevalence rates.Results:The overall prevalence of HBV and HCV among chronic hepatitis patients were 22.3% and 3.6% respectively. Prevalence of HBV and HCV among males from the total HBV and HCV screened was 52/358 (14.5%) and 6/220 (2.7%) respectively. 64/80 (80%) of HBV sero-positives were found in between 16 to 45 years of age. Of those 64 HBV sero-positive patients, 42/64 (65.6%) were found 16-30 age interval. Furthermore, of those HCV infected, 6/8 (75%) of them fall under 16-30 years of age. 6/8 (75%) of HCV infected patients were males.Conclusion:The present study has shown that HBV was highly prevalent among patients who visited the clinic. Males were more susceptible than female patients. 3.6% HCV prevalence was also high. Mass immunization of HBV is recommended to halt HBV infection.
