Purpose:The aim of this study was to evaluate short- and intermediate-term results of laparoscopic liver resection in selected patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:Eighty-five patients with HCC were subjected to liver resection between February 2007 and January 2013. From these, 30 (35.2%) were subjected to laparoscopic liver resection and were retrospectively analyzed. Special emphasis was given to the indication criteria and to surgical results.Results:There were 21 males and 9 females with a mean age of 57.4 years. Patients were subjected to 10 nonanatomic and 20 anatomic resections. Two patients were subjected to hand-assisted procedures (right posterior sectionectomies); all other patients were subjected to totally laparoscopic procedures. Conversion to open surgery was necessary in 4 patients (13.3%). Postoperative complications were observed in 12 patients (40%), and the mortality rate was 3.3%. Mean overall survival was 29.8 months, with 3-year overall and disease-free survival rates of 76% and 58%, respectively.Conclusions:Laparoscopic treatment of selected patients with HCC is safe and feasible and can lead to good short- and intermediate-term results.
