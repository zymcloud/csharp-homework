Objective:This study aimed to investigate whether CYP3A4/5 genetic variants, together with clinical and patient factors, influence serum fentanyl and norfentanyl concentrations and their ratio in cancer pain patients receiving transdermal fentanyl.Methods:CYP3A4*22 and CYP3A5*3 polymorphisms were analysed in 620 cancer pain patients receiving transdermal fentanyl (12.5-700 μg/h) from the European Pharmacogenetic Opioid Study. Using stepwise linear regression, CYP3A4/5 genetic variability was examined in combination with patient factors relating to organ drug elimination function and ABCB1 genetics for their association with serum fentanyl and norfentanyl concentrations and metabolic ratio (MR) (norfentanyl : fentanyl).Results:Delivery rate-adjusted serum fentanyl concentrations (0.0012-1.1 nmol/l/μg.h) and MRs (0.08-499) varied widely. Only 43% of variability in serum fentanyl concentrations was accounted for by delivery rate and less than 50% by CYP3A4/5 genotypes and clinical variables (delivery rate, sex, comedications, kidney disease, BMI, serum albumin). CYP3A4*22 and CYP3A5*3 variants, CYP3A inhibitors and variables relating to liver and kidney function (serum albumin, glomerular filtration rate, kidney disease, BMI) were associated with MR, but accounted for only 14% of variability.Conclusion:Serum fentanyl concentrations and MR vary considerably between cancer pain patients on transdermal fentanyl patches. CYP3A4*22 and CYP3A5*3 genotypes, and multiple clinical factors, combine to influence transdermal fentanyl pharmacokinetics, but accounted for only a small proportion of variability in this study. Identification of the remaining factors determining serum fentanyl concentrations, and their relationship to efficacy and adverse effects may aid in improving the safety and effectiveness of transdermal fentanyl.
