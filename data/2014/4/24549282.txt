MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been frequently reported to be diagnostic biomarkers and prognostic factors for cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical significance of microRNA-139 (miRNA-139) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). All 31 patients enrolled in the present study had received curative hepatectomy. The objective miRNA was determined using miRNA microarray. The miRNA-139 expression level in cancerous tissue specimens was measured by means of reverse transcription and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and compared with that in 31 corresponding peritumoral non-cancerous tissues. Plasma miRNA-139 expression was also quantified. The diagnostic value of plasma miRNA-139 for differentiating patients with HCC from the ones with chronic HBV-hepatitis (CH) was analyzed. The miRNA microarray performed in 3 pairs of tissue specimens determined miRNA-139 was downregulated (p=0.017). Compared with plasma of chronic HBV-hepatitis, miRNA-139 was lowly expressed in plasma of HCC patients (p
