Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of tumor size alone on long-term survival and recurrence after curative resection for solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) without macroscopic vascular invasion.Methods:A single-center cohort of 615 patients with solitary HCC (a single tumor, without macroscopic vascular invasion or distant metastasis) undergoing curative hepatic resection from 2002 to 2010 was retrospectively studied. Using 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 8.0, and 10.0 cm as cut-off values of tumor size, the overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were compared between the groups of patients with tumor size up to a certain cut-off value and the groups of patients with tumor size above that cut-off value. Thus, multiple comparisons were done. The prognostic factors of OS and RFS were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:The median tumor size of all HCCs was 4.0 cm (range 0.9-22.0 cm). The in-hospital mortality rate was 1.0 %, and the overall morbidity rate was 22.3 %. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 96.0, 79.8, and 69.9 %, and the corresponding RFS rates were 83.6, 72.7, and 57.2 %, respectively. On univariate analyses, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS and RFS rates were significantly different between the individual two groups of patients as divided by the aforementioned different cut-off values of tumor sizes (all p Conclusions:Tumor size did not independently affect long-term survival and recurrence after curative resection of solitary HCC without macroscopic vascular invasion. Therefore, there is no size limit that precludes hepatic resection for solitary HCC, provided the tumor is resectable.
