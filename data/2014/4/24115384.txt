Purpose:To determine the added value of 3 Tesla liver MR in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within the liver computed tomography (CT) -based Milan criteria.Materials and methods:Liver CT and MR images of 130 patients with HCC within the Milan criteria based on liver CT were retrospectively reviewed. The number of MR-diagnosed HCCs and that of high risk hypervascular nodules (HRHNs), the effect of obtaining MR on patient management and CT appearances of MR-diagnosed HCCs and those of HRHNs were evaluated. Independent predictor for diagnosing additional HCCs on liver MR was analyzed.Results:A total of 18.5% (24/130) of patients had additional 39 HCCs on MR, with a 5.4% (7/130) dropout rate from the Milan criteria. 28.5% (37/130) of patients had additional 78 HRHNs. Overall, 39.2% (51/130) of patients required changes in management. The common CT appearances of MR-diagnosed HCCs were arterial enhancing lesions â‰¥ 0.5cm (38.4%, 15/39), low density nodules Conclusion:For patients with HCCs within the Milan criteria on liver CT, liver MR may be necessary to detect additional HCCs and HRHNs.
