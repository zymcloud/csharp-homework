Background:To correlate between signal parameters using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCEMRI) and outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving radiotherapy with or without concomitant thalidomide.Methods:DCEMRI was performed in advanced HCC patients undergoing radiotherapy with or without concomitant thalidomide. Initial first-pass enhancement slopes (slope) and peak enhancement ratios (peak) were measured over an operator-defined region of interest over tumor and non-tumor liver parenchyma. The perfusion parameters were correlated with clinical outcomes. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. (identifier NCT00155272).Results:Forty-three patients were evaluable. There were 18 partial responses (PRs), 5 minimal responses (MRs), 17 stable diseases (SDs), and 3 progressive diseases (PDs). Baseline perfusion parameters as well as slope at 14 days of radiotherapy were higher in patients with PR or MR compared to SD or PD (0.81 ± 0.29 vs. 0.49 ± 0.34, p Conclusions:Signal parameters of DCEMRI over tumor and liver parenchyma correlated with tumor response and survival, respectively, in HCC patients receiving radiotherapy.
