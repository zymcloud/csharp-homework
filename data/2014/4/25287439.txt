Background:Although cryoablation (Cryo) has been advocated as an effective locoregional therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), few studies have compared the outcomes with those of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave coagulation therapy (MCT).Methods:Consecutive patients with primary HCCs of Results:The median tumor size was 2.5 cm in the Cryo group (n = 55) and 1.9 cm in the RFA/MCT group (n = 64; P 2 cm demonstrated significantly better local recurrence rates in the Cryo group compared with the RFA/MCT group (21 vs. 56 % at 2 years; P = 0.006). Overall complication rates and incidences of Clavien-Dindo classification grade â‰¥ III were identical (both P = 1.00). No in-hospital mortality occurred.Conclusions:Appropriate use of Cryo, as shown in this series, is safe and provides significantly improved local control for the treatment of primary HCCs of >2 cm compared with RFA/MCT.
