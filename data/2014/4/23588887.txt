Background:N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V), an enzyme that catalyzes the Î²1-6 branching of N-acetylglucosamine on asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of cellular proteins, enhances the malignant behaviors of carcinoma cells in experimental models. The aim of this study was to determine clinical significance of GnT-V expression in human pT2 gallbladder carcinoma with simple in vitro experiments.Methods:Ninety patients with pT2 gallbladder carcinoma were included for this study. The in vitro and in vivo biological effects of GnT-V were investigated using gallbladder carcinoma cells with variable GnT-V expression levels induced by a small interfering RNA.Results:Of the 90 cases, 57 showed positive staining and the remaining 33 demonstrated negative staining, the subcellular localization in the 57 cases was classified into the granular-type in 31 cases and the diffuse-type in 26 cases. In 76 cases with curative resection, postsurgical survival was significantly poorer in those showing positive staining than in those showing negative staining (P = 0.028). In all of the 76 cases, postsurgical recurrence was significantly more frequent in those showing diffuse-type localization than in those showing negative staining. Experimental analyses demonstrated that the down-regulation of GnT-V expression in gallbladder carcinoma cells induced suppression of cell growth in vitro. The expression levels of GnT-V in the cells were highly correlated with the rapid in vivo growth coupled with the enhanced angiogenesis, and the tendency to form liver metastasis.Conclusions:GnT-V expression in the subserosal layer of pT2 gallbladder carcinoma is correlated with the aggressiveness of the disease.
