Objective:To investigate whether the ERK/FoxO3a signal axis could induce the inhibitory effect of vitexin 1 (VB-1) in HepG2 cell proliferation.Method:The MTT method was adopted to observe the effect of different concentrations of VB-1 on human hepatoma carcinoma cell line HepG2 and immortalized human embryo liver cell line L-02. The cell growth was assessed by the clone formation assay. The protein phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and FoxO3a were measured by the western blot.Result:VB-1 inhibited the viability of HepG2 cell line in a concentration-dependent manner, with a weak effect on L-02 cell line. VB-1 could effectively inhibit the anchorage-dependent growth of HepG2 cells, and reduce the expression levels of pERK1/2 and pFoxO3a in a concentration-dependent manner. MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 could enhance VB-1' s effect in inhibiting HepG2 cell proliferation and ERK1/2, FoxO3a phosphorylation.Conclusion:VB-1 inhibits the proliferative activity of hepatoma carcinoma cell line HepG2 by blocking the ERK/FoxO3a signal axis.
