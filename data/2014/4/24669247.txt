The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) on malignant hepatic tumors and compare its therapeutic efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and metastatic liver cancer (MLC). A total of 56 patients with malignant hepatic tumors (34 patients with HCC and 22 patients with MLC) underwent RFA treatment. Two weeks following the RFA treatment, contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography scans were used to investigate whether the ablation of the tumors was complete. The patients were followed up for a period ranging from 1 to 93 months, to compare recurrence rates, distant recurrence rates and survival rates. The HCC group exhibited an initial complete ablation rate of 94.1% compared with 95.4% for the MLC group; the difference in ablation rates was not identified to be statistically significant. The recurrence and distant recurrence rates were 14.7% and 11.8%, respectively, for the HCC group and 9.1% and 36.4%, respectively, for the MLC group. The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of the patients with HCC were 86.2, 71.4 and 60.0%, respectively, whereas those for the patients with MLC were 73.9%, 45.4% and 37.5%, respectively. The survival rates of the two groups were identified to be significantly different (P=0.002). RFA treatment was therefore shown to be effective in treating small (
