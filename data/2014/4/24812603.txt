Error-prone integration of the hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) into the hepatocellular genome generates a multitude of mutants exerting diverse effects on the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A recent study by Lai and colleagues revealed the disparate regulatory activity of clinically-predominant HBx mutants towards hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a central regulator of tumor angiogenesis, proliferation, metastasis and differentiation. These findings have shed insight into specific viral contribution of hypoxic response during hepatocarcinogenesis.
