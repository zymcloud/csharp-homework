Objective:To investigate molding technology of total alkaloids from Sophora alopecuroides freeze-dried powders and observe its inhibition effects on liver transplantation tumor in mice.Method:With color, clarity, water-soluble and formability as indexes, single factor tests were adopted to screen type and amount of filler, the concentration of total alkaloids in drug liquid, pH in order to determine optimum prescription of total alkaloids from S. alopecuroides freeze-dried powders, the lowest melting point was determined and freeze drying curve was drafted. Mice hepatoma H22 ascites tumor strain was sterile inoculated in right axillary subcutaneous of mice, and antitumor effect of total alkaloids from S. alopecuroides freeze-dried powders on liver transplantation tumor H22 in mice.Result:When selected 80 g x L(-1) as mannitol as filler, the concentration of total alkaloids in drug liquid was 25 g x L(-1) and pH 6.5-7.5, freeze-dried effect was optimum with fast reconstitute speed. Average inhibition rate of the big (120 mg x kg(-1)) and medium (60 mg x kg(-1)) dose group of total alkaloids from S. alopecuroides freeze-dried powders on liver transplantation tumor H22 in mice were 56.08% and 35.49%, respectively.Conclusion:Preparation technology was reasonable, reproducible and stable, total alkaloids from S. alopecuroides freeze-dried powders had significant antitumor effect and showed a dose-effect relationship.
