Objective:To investigate the predictive value of metastatic lymph node ratio for postoperative distant metastasis in patients with colorectal cancer.Methods:The clinicopathological data were collected from 180 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgical resection in General Hospital of PLA between from January, 2007 to January, 2012. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of distant organ metastasis and the clinicopathological factors were analyzed with Chi-square test and logistic regression.Results:Of the 118 surgical patients enrolled, 118 were free of distant metastasis and 62 had distant metastasis involving the liver (39 cases), lungs (12 cases), and multiple organs (11 cases). The gross types, differentiation, ELN and LNR of the tumors differed significantly between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that LNR was an independent factor correlating to distant metastasis of colorectal cancer.Conclusion:LNR is independently correlated with distant organ metastasis of colorectal cancer and serves as an important predicative factor for estimating the prognosis of colorectal cancer.
