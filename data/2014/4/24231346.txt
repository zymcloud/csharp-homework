Purpose:This study has two aims. The first is to compare conventional lipiodol chemo-embolization (Trans Arterial Chemo-Embolization - TACE) to one using pre-loaded particles (Trans Arterial Chemo-Embolisation-Drug Eluted Bead - TACE-DEB) using a cost minimization study. The second is to define the fundable nature of TACE-DEB and the conditions under which it is cost-effective.Materials and methods:Retrospective study of patients treated by chemo-embolization (n=31: TACE; n=32: TACE-DEB) during the year 2010. The cost minimization study was conducted from the hospital perspective. Direct medical costs were calculated and compared using the readjusted ENCC (National Studies of Costs by Common Methodology) method. The affordability of the two techniques and definition of a cost-effective hypothesis (break-even point) were also established.Results:All DRGs combined, lengths of stay (TACE: 4.90 ± 3.36; TACE-DEB: 5.03 ± 3.36) does not change significantly. An average upper mean cost for TACE-DEB is described (TACE: 2869.05 €; TACE-DEB: 3960.10 €). The affordability calculations in the study show that, overall, TACE-DEB can be funded regardless of DRG. A ratio of 1.3 procedures using the conventional (TACE) method would enable TACE-DEB procedures to be funded.Conclusion:This medico-economic analysis demonstrates that the TACE-DEB procedure is fundable.
