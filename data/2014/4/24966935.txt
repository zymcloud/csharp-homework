The aim of this study was to study the anti-hepatoma effect of safrole and elucidate its molecular mechanism, the human hepatoma BEL-7402 cells were incubated with various concentrations (40, 80, 160, 320 and 640 Î¼g/ml) of safrole and the cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated. The results showed that both the cell proliferation determined by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium brominde (MTT) assay and cell colony determined by soft agar assay were significantly suppressed by safrole in a dose-time-dependent manner. Characteristic morphological and biochemical changes associated with apoptosis, including cells shrinkage, deformation and vacuolization of mitochondria, nuclear chromatin condensation and fragmentation, formation of apoptotic bodies were observed when treated with safrole for 24 h and 48 h. Cell cycle changes evaluated by flow cytometry analysis showed that the safrole could induce accumulation of cells arrested at G1 and S phases of the cell cycle. These results demonstrated that safrole is potent anti-hepatoma agent and the underlying mechanism may be attributed to suppress tumor cell growth by inducing cell apoptosis.
