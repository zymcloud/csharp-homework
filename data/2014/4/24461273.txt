Imaging detection of liver cancers and identification of the bile ducts during surgery, based on the fluorescence properties of indocyanine green, has recently been developed in liver surgery. The principle of this imaging technique relies on the intravenous administration of indocyanine green before surgery and the illumination of the surface of the liver by an infrared camera that simultaneously induces and collects the fluorescence. Detection by fluorescence is based on the contrast between the (fluorescent) tumoral or peri-tumoral tissues and the healthy (non-fluorescent) liver. Results suggest that indocyanine green fluorescence imaging is capable of identification of new liver cancers and enables the characterization of known hepatic lesions in real time during liver resection. The purpose of this paper is to present the fundamental principles of fluorescence imaging detection, to describe successively the practical and technical aspects of its use and the appearance of hepatic lesions in fluorescence, and to expose the diagnostic and therapeutic perspectives of this innovative imaging technique in liver surgery.
