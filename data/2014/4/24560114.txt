Radiation therapy is emerging as a potentially effective treatment of locally advanced, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Outcomes from early prospective studies seem promising, with improved survival compared with historical controls. Cure of early stage and unresectable HCC may be possible with high-quality radiation therapy. Many questions remain, including determination of the ideal radiation dose and fractionation schema, optimal patient selection criteria based on tumor size, tumor location, extent of vascular invasion, and baseline liver function, and the role of radiation therapy compared with other localized standard treatments including radiofrequency ablation or transarterial chemoembolization.
