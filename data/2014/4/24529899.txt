Early detecting of cancer is critical to provide proper treatment and to improve survival of patients. Here, we reported a highly sensitive ratiometric (yellow emission (550 nm) to blue emission (496 nm)) fluorescent probe 1 developed for detection of thiol-containing amino acids. This probe successfully eliminates interference from background autofluorescence, and discriminates between human carcinoma and normal cells by detecting intracellular thiol levels in living cells (P
