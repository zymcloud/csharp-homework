Patients who have undergone complete cavopulmonary anastomosis, the Fontan procedure, have passive venous blood flow from the superior and inferior vena cava into the pulmonary circulation without passing through the right ventricle. Although this procedure is an effective means of palliation, the resultant chronically increased central venous pressure, leads to several types of hepatic dysfunction including chronic congestion, cardiac cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. In this case report, we describe a patient with Fontan-associated hepatocellular carcinoma who successfully underwent a right hepatectomy.
