Persistent inflammation together with genetic/epigenetic aberrations is strongly associated with chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection-related hepatocarcinogenesis. Here, we investigated the alterations of the suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) family genes in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 116 patients with HCC were enrolled in this study. The methylation statuses of SOCS1-7 and CISH genes were quantitatively measured and clinicopathological significance of SOCS1 methylation was statistically analysed. The gene copy number variation was assayed by aCGH. Luciferase reporter assay and Western blot were used to detect the involvement of SOCS1 in p53 signalling. We found high frequencies of SOCS1 gene hypermethylation in both tumour (56.03%) and adjacent nontumour tissues (54.31%), but tumour tissues exhibited increased methylation intensity (24.01% vs 13.11%, P
