Objective:To explore the detection efficiency of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Immunomagnetic negative enrichment by nanometer magnetic beads and label-free capture with Captor(TM) system were used to isolate and enrich CTCs from peripheral blood of HCC patients, and epithelial and HCC markers were applied to identify CTCs by immunofluorescence staining. CTCs were detected in 50 HCC patients before and after hepatectomy to test the method for isolation, enrichment and identification. The dynamic changes of pre- and post-operative CTCs' numbers were compared. The clinical data were analyzed using SPSS 19.0 software.Results:Negative enrichment methods by nanometer magnetic beads and label-free capture using Captor(TM) system were both suitable for CTCs isolation and enrichment in HCC patients. The positive detection rate of CTCs in HCC patients via negative enrichment was 96.0% (48/50), the preoperative median number of CTCs was 16 per 7.5 ml blood, and the postoperative median number was 17 per 7.5 ml blood.Conclusions:Both negative enrichment and Captor(TM) system are suitable for isolation and enrichment of CTCs in HCC patients. There is a significant difference in the numbers of CTCs before and after operation, and dynamic detection of CTCs will provide helpful prognostic information for HCC patients in clinics.
