Background:Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the gastrointestinal tract are rare, slow-growing neoplasms. Clinical outcomes in a group of stage IV, well-differentiated patients with NETs with small bowel primaries undergoing cytoreductive surgery and multidisciplinary management at a single center were evaluated.Study design:The charts of 189 consecutive patients who underwent surgical cytoreduction for their small bowel NETs were reviewed. Information on the extent of disease, complications, and Kaplan-Meier survival were collected from the patient records.Results:A total of 189 patients underwent 229 cytoreductive operations. Ten percent of patients required an intraoperative blood transfusion and 3% (6 of 229) had other intraoperative complications. For all 229 procedures performed, mean (± SD) stay in the ICU was 4 ± 3 days and in the hospital was 9 ± 10 days. Before discharge, 51% of patients had no postoperative complications and 39% of patients had only minor complications. In a 30-day follow-up period from discharge, 85% of patients had no additional complications and 13% had only minor complications. The 30-day postoperative death rate was 3% (5 of 189). Mean survival from histologic diagnosis of NET was 236 months. The 5-, 10-, and 20-year Kaplan-Meier survival rates from diagnosis were 87%, 77%, and 41%, respectively.Conclusions:Cytoreductive surgery in patients with well-differentiated midgut NETs has low mortality and complication rates and is associated with prolonged survival. We believe that cytoreductive surgery is a key component in the care of patients with NETs.
