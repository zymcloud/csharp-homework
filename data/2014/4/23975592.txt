Purpose:The hepatic vein (HV) can be removed during hepatectomy if there is an effective intrahepatic veno-venous shunt (vv-shunt). We evaluated the efficacy of vv-shunt detection by three-dimensional (3D) venography reconstructed from multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) during angiography.Methods:3D venography was reconstructed using computer software in 88 patients with intrahepatic tumors.Results:We found that 12 patients had one shunt [4 right hepatic vein (RHV)-middle hepatic vein (MHV) and 12 RHV- inferior right hepatic vein (IRHV)] and 1 patient had 2 shunts (RHV-MHV and -IRHV), confirming a clinically efficient vv-shunt in 14.8% of the patients. In one patient with an RHV-IRHV shunt, the preserved RHV-IRHV shunt worked well and prevented congestion of the postero-caudal subsegment after central bisegmentectomy with partial resection of the RHV ventral trunk for huge hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Conclusions:Although the vv-shunt detection rate by 3D venography is low, a visualized vv-shunt proved to be efficient. Thus, invasive occlusion venography is avoidable if a vv-shunt is seen on 3D venography.
