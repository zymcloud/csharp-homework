Background:There is limited evidence concerning the postoperative platelet to lymphocyte ratio change (ΔPLR) in relation to the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study was designed to evaluate the prognostic value of ΔPLR in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related small HCC who underwent liver resection.Materials and methods:We retrospectively reviewed 219 patients with HBV-related small HCC who underwent liver resection between February 2007 and April 2013. The patients were divided into two groups as follows: group A (ΔPLR ≥2.875, n = 94) and group B (ΔPLR Results:The 1-, 3-, and 5-y overall survival (OS) rates were 90.5%, 72.3%, and 42.1%, respectively, in group A and 98.1%, 89.5%, and 86.4%, respectively, in group B (P Conclusions:ΔPLR was an independent prognostic factor for OS and RFS in patients with HBV-related small HCC who underwent liver resection.
