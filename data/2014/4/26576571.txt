Purpose:This study aimed at prospectively evaluating bile duct anatomy on ultrasonography and evaluating the safety and utility of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) assisted by virtual ultrasonography from gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Methods:The institutional review board approved this study, and patients provided written informed consent prior to entry into the study. Bile duct anatomy was assessed in 201 patients who underwent Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI for the evaluation of hepatic tumor. Eighty-one of these patients subsequently underwent RFA assisted by ultrasound imaging. In 23 patients, the tumor was located within 5 mm of the central bile duct, as demonstrated by MRI.Results:Virtual ultrasonography constructed by Gd-EOB-enhanced MRI was able to visualize the common bile duct, left hepatic duct, and right hepatic duct in 96.5, 94.0, and 89.6 % of cases, respectively. The target hepatic tumor nodule and biliary duct could be detected with virtual ultrasonography in all patients, and no severe complications occurred.Conclusion:The running pattern of the bile ducts could be recognized on conventional ultrasound by referencing virtual ultrasonography constructed by Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. RFA assisted by this imaging strategy did not result in bile duct injury.
