Hepatoma associated gene (HTA), a gene screened and cloned by our previous research, was specifically expressed in certain kinds of tumors and had a cancer-promoting role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To further elucidate the mechanism of HTA in hepatoma carcinogenesis and its potential role as a cancer biomarker, refolded HTA protein (HTA) was obtained by prokaryotic recombinant expression system and immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Then anti-HTA monoclonal antibody (mAb) was produced by hybridoma technique. Using the high titer anti-HTA mAb with high specificity obtained, the expression profile of HTA was analysed by immunohistochemistry staining. It showed that HTA expressed specifically in some kinds of tumors, and didn't express in almost any of the normal tissues. The positive expression rate and expression quantity of HTA was significantly higher in HCC tissues than in hepatic cirrhosis tissues, hepatic fibrosis tissues and normal hepatic tissues. The expression of HTA was positively correlated with hepatoma carcinogenic process.
