Objective:Angiogenesis has been associated with hepatic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Alcohol promotes liver hypoxia, a trigger of angiogenesis. We aimed to evaluate whether the frequency of three polymorphisms in hypoxia-induced factor-1α (HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), and KDR (encoding vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2) genes was higher in alcoholics presenting liver disease (ALD) and ALD patients who developed HCC.Materials and methods:Functional HIF-1α 1744C/T, VEGFA 2578C/A, and KDR 1416A/T single-nucleotide polymorphisms were studied in 125 ALD patients and 88 heavy drinkers without liver disease (NLD). ALD patients were followed up to 9 years or until they died; 26 patients developed HCC.Results:ALD patients were older than NLD (56±11 vs. 50±13, PConclusion:Genetic polymorphisms in proangiogenic factors did not associate with the risk of ALD in heavy drinkers. However, KDR and VEFGA polymorphisms may confer an increased risk of HCC in patients with ALD.
