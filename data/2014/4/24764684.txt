Aim:To report the devised anatomic liver resection of segments 6, 7 and 8 to improve the resection rate for patients with right liver tumors.Methods:We performed anatomic liver resection of segments 6, 7 and 8 to guarantee the maximum preservation of the remaining normal liver tissue. Segment 5 was determined by two steps of Glissonean pedicle occlusion. And a "┏┛" shaped broken resection line was marked upon the diaphragmatic surface of the liver. Selective right hemihepatic inflow occlusion was used to reduce blood loss during parenchymal transection between segments 6 and 5 and between segments 8 and 5. If needed, total hepatic Glissonean pedicle occlusion was used during parenchymal transection between segment 8 and the left liver.Results:Compared to right hemihepatectomy, the percentage of future liver remnant volume was increased by an average of 13.9% if resection of segments 6, 7 and 8 was performed. Resection of segments 6, 7 and 8 was completed uneventfully. After hepatectomy, the inflow and outflow of segment 5 were maintained. There was no perioperative mortality, postoperative abdominal bleeding or bile leakage in this group. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) returned to the normal range within 2 mo after the operation in all the patients. One patient died 383 d postoperatively due to obstructive suppurative cholangitis. One patient suffered from severe liver dysfunction shortly after surgery and had intrahepatic recurrence 4 mo postoperatively. Postoperative lung metastasis was found in one patient. No tumor recurrence was found in the other patients and the parameters including liver function and AFP level were in the normal range.Conclusion:Anatomic liver resection of segments 6, 7 and 8 can be a conventional operation to improve the overall resection rate for hepatocellular carcinoma.
