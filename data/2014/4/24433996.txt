Background:Liver surgery in patients with underlying liver disease results in higher mortality and morbidity rates compared to patients without underlying liver disease. Laparoscopy seems to have good results in patients with normal liver in terms of postoperative outcomes, but is more challenging in cirrhotic patients. Aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of laparoscopic liver resection both in normal and cirrhotic livers, and secondary endpoint was to compare the surgical results.Methods:We retrospectively evaluated 105 patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resection between November 2001 and January 2012. Candidates for laparoscopic liver resection were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of an underlying liver disease.Results:105 patients (52.4% males, median age 56.1 years) were enrolled, and 37.1% had liver cirrhosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis (89.7%) and liver metastases (57.6%) were the main indications for surgery in patients with cirrhosis and non-cirrhotic livers, respectively. None of the patients died post-operatively. Cirrhotic patients had greater blood loss (100 vs 50 ml; pConclusions:Laparoscopic liver resections are safe and feasible procedures in both patients with cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic livers.
