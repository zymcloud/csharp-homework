Objective:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is sexually dimorphic, with a significantly higher incidence in male. But it is not clear whether the women have a better prognosis than the men. The present study aimed to compare the short and long-term outcomes, postoperative recurrence and survival in female and male patients with HCC after hepatectomy.Methods:Clinicopathological data of retrospective analysis was performed on 40 female and matched 40 male HCC patients treated by hepatectomy in Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences between May 2006 and May 2012 were retrospectively reviewed in this study. Patients were paired in terms of age, chronic hepatitis, Child-Pugh class, tumor size, histological differentiation, presence of satellite nodules and resection margin.Results:Hepatectomy was successfully performed in all 80 cases. There was no significant difference in intraoperative variables and postoperative outcomes between the female and male groups except the level of total bilirubin. The 1-, 3- and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates were 76.7%, 47.4% and 29.7% in the female group and 63.8%, 30.0% and 25.0% in the male group (P = 0.12). Corresponding overall survival rates were 92.2%, 81.5% and 55.4% in the female group and 97.4%, 55.2% and 39.0% in the male group (P = 0.04).Conclusion:Certain gender differences might exist in HCC patients after hepatecomy, favoring females in the overall survival and the tolerance for liver injury.
