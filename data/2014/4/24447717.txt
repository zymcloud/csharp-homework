Chemotherapy plays a crucial role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment especially for patients with advanced HCC. Cisplatin is one of the commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of HCC. However, acquisition of cisplatin resistance is common in patients with HCC, and the underlying mechanism of such resistance is not fully understood. In the study, we focused on identifying the role of miRNAs in chemotherapy resistance after cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. We assayed the expression level of miR-182 after cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced HCC, and defined the biological functions by real-time PCR analysis and CCK-8 assay. We found that miR-182 levels were significantly increased in HCC patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. miR-182 levels were also higher in cisplatin-resistant HepG2 (HepG2-R) cells than in HepG2 cells. Upregulated miR-182 significantly increased the cell viability, whereas miR-182 knockdown reduced the cell viability during cisplatin treatment. miR-182 inhibition also partially overcame cisplatin resistance in HepG2-R cell. Furthermore, we found that upregulated miR-182 inhibited the expression of tumor suppressor gene TP53INP1 (tumor protein 53-induced nuclear protein 1) in vitro. In vivo, miR-182 and TP53INP1 expression was negatively correlated. We finally demonstrated that miR-182 increased cisplatin resistance of HCC cell, partly by targeting TP53INP1. These data suggest that miR-182/TP53INP1 signaling represents a novel pathway regulating chemoresistance, thus offering a new target for chemotherapy of HCC.
