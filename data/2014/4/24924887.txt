Objective:To explore the outcomes of different recurrence patterns and recurrence-related factors after hepatectomy in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM).Methods:The outcomes of different recurrence patterns and recurrence-related factors for surgical resection of CRLMs was reviewed retrospectively.Results:A total of 152 postoperative recurrent cases were included between 2000 and 2013. The median overall survival was 28.9 months and 5-year survival 22.1% for the entire group. The median disease-free survival was 7.6 months. Among them, 60 patients had disease recurrence within 6 months after hepatectomy (early recurrence) and their median overall survival was 19.4 months versus 35.1 months (n = 92) for those with a disease-free interval of over 6 months (P = 0.000).Repeat resection was associated with better outcomes, but different patterns of recurrence were not. Lymph node metastases of primary tumor, number of metastases and efficacy of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) were independently associated with recurrence.Conclusions:Recurrence after hepatectomy of CRLMs is affected by lymph node metastases of primary tumor, number of metastases and efficacy of NACT. Additional survival advantage may be achieved by resection of recurrent disease.
