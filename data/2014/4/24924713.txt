Objective:To subdivide the M1 stage of patients to predict better survival groups and assess the predictive factors of prognosis to select personalized cancer treatments.Methods:From the records of 666 colorectal cancer cases treated at our hospital during January 1995 to December 2010, we analyzed the site of metastases, number of metastases, size of hepatic metastatic tumor and corresponding treatments. According to the results, we made recommendations for subdividing the M1 stage to guide individualized treatments.Results:The metastatic median survival of liver metastasis and non-liver metastasis were 18.7 vs 22.9 months (P = 0.082). And the median survival of single organ metastasis, double organ metastasis and multiple organ metastasis were 24.8 vs 15.6 vs 10.9 months, (P < 0.01).With no more than 3 liver lesions, the patients received operation or ablation therapy plus chemotherapy and their median survival was longer than those on chemotherapy only (49.6 vs 22.3 months, P < 0.01).Conclusion:According to metastatic characteristics, different clinical features and treatments result in significantly different survivals and prognoses in metastatic colorectal cancer patients.
