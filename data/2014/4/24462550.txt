Background:Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is an effective treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but can cause severe toxicity.Aim:To identify predictive factors of severe TACE-related toxicity in patients with unresectable HCC.Methods:All HCC patients who underwent TACE at the Dijon University Hospital between 2008 and 2011 were included in this retrospective study. Severe TACE-related toxicity was defined as the occurrence of any adverse event grade â‰¥ 4, or any adverse event that caused a prolongation of hospitalisation of >8 days, or any additional hospitalisation within 1 month after TACE. Factors predicting toxicity were identified using a logistic regression model. The robustness of the final model was confirmed using bootstrapping (500 replications).Results:124 patients were included, median age was 67 years and 90% were male; 22 patients (18%) experienced severe TACE-related toxicity. Factors that independently predicted severe TACE-related toxicity in multivariate analysis were total tumour size (OR, 1.15 cm(-1); 95%CI, 1.04-1.26; p=0.01), and high serum AST levels (OR, 1.10 per 10 IU/l; 95%CI, 1.01-1.21; p=0.04). The results were confirmed by bootstrapping.Conclusions:Total tumour size and high serum AST levels were predictive factors of severe TACE-related toxicity in this hospital-based series of patients with unresectable HCC.
