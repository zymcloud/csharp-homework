Lysyl oxidase is an important extracellular matrix remodeling enzyme and plays critical roles in tumor progression and development. Its tumor-suppressor activity has been shown to depend on the propeptide region. Previous studies have reported that the expression levels of lysyl oxidase propeptide (LOX-PP) are associated with cancer of the breast, pancreas, lung, prostate and gastrointestinal system. However, to date, the exact effects and molecular mechanisms of LOX-PP in hepatocellular carcinoma progression are still unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the expression and clinical significance of LOX-PP in human hepatocellular carcinoma. First, 42 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma and corresponding adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCTs) were collected, and the expression of LOX-PP in these samples was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The clinicopathological characteristics of all patients were recorded. Next, in in vitro studies, recombinant adenovirus LOX (ad-LOX-PP) was used to infect hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines to determine the function of LOX-PP. To determine whether ad-LOX-PP affects hepatocellular carcinoma cell survival, cell viability was examined by CCK-8 assay, and cell cycle progression was assessed by flow cytometry. We also investigated the effects of LOX-PP on the expression of cell cycle regulators (cyclin D1 and cyclin E) by western blot analysis. The migration and invasion capacities of hepatocellular carcinoma cells were observed by wound-healing and tranwell invasion assays. To further investigate how LOX-PP affects migration levels of matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 were assessed by western blot analysis. Additionally, markers of the PI3K and MAPK signaling pathway were detected to further confirm the mechanisms of LOX-PP. As a result, reduced expression of LOX-PP was found in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, when compared with that in the ANCTs (15 vs. 83%, P
