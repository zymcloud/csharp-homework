1. This study assessed the mass balance, metabolism and disposition of [(14)C]trametinib, a first-in-class mitogen-activated extracellular signal-related kinase (MEK) inhibitor, as an open-label, single solution dose (2 mg, 2.9 MBq [79 µCi]) in two male subjects with advanced cancer. 2. Trametinib absorption was rapid. Excretion was primarily via feces (∼81% of excreted dose); minor route was urinary (∼19% of excreted dose). The primary metabolic elimination route was deacetylation alone or in combination with hydroxylation. Circulating drug-related component profiles (composed of parent with metabolites) were similar to those found in elimination together with N-glucuronide of deacetylation product. Metabolite analysis was only possible from
