In this study, we investigated the effect of (131)I gelatin microspheres ((131)I-GMSs) on human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) in nude mice (Balb/c) and the biodistribution of (131)I-GMSs after intratumoral injection. The treatment group and control group animals received intratumoral injections of 1 mCi (131)I-GMSs and GMSs unlabeled (131)I, respectively. The size of the implanted tumor was measured once a week for 8 weeks, and the survival time was calculated from the day of injection to 64 days post-injection. Another 35 animals received intratumoral injections of 0.2 mCi (131)I-GMSs and were subject to single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) on days 1, 8, 16, 24 and 32 post-injection. Samples of various organs were collected and used to calculate tissue concentrations on days 1, 4, 8, 16 and 24. Free thyroxine (FT4) in fetal bovine serum was tested to evaluate thyroid function. The tumors were collected for histological examination. (131)I-GMSs produced a pronounced reduction in HepG2 tumor volume, and the overall survival was 73.3% in the treatment group and only 13.3% in the control group (P
