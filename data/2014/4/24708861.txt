Background:PRO2000/ANCCA may be an important candidate gene which located within a region of chromosome 8q in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its significance remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the clinical significance of PRO2000/ANCCA expression in HCC.Methods:The correlations of PRO2000/ANCCA expression with clinicopathological factors and prognosis of HCC patients were analyzed. Expression of PRO2000/ANCCA, ki-67, cyclinD1, p53 and p21 was detected in HCCs from 107 patients along with corresponding non-tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry.Results:PRO2000/ANCCA expression was present in 66 of 107 (64.94%) HCC specimens in which 36 of 76 (47.37%) in well differentiated tumors and 30 of 31 (96.77%) in poorly differentiated tumors respectively, while 8 (7.48%) in adjacent non-tumor tissues with scattered positive cells. PRO2000/ANCCA expression was associated with clinicopathological features such as histological differentiation, number of tumor nodules, TNM stage, tumor microsatellite, portal vein tumor thrombus and recurrence, but not with gender, age, tumor size, cirrhosis, HBV infection and serum fetoprotein (AFP) level. There was a close relationship between PRO2000/ANCCA and ki-67 and cyclinD1 in HCC. PRO2000/ANCCA immunopositivity was independent of p53 and p21(WAF1/Cip1).Conclusions:Increased expression of PRO2000/ANCCA is associated with adverse outcome in patients with HCC and is a predictor of poor prognosis for HCC. PRO2000/ANCCA may be involved in the development of HCC and might promote cell proliferation through a p53/ P21(WAF1/Cip1)-independent pathway.
