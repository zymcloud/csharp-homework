Tumor markers [alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) or des-gamma-carboxyprothrombin (DCP)] and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) reportedly correlate with long-term outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, no standardized method has been established for evaluating the pretransplant data. One hundred and twenty-four patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) were retrospectively reviewed. The best predictive parameters for tumor recurrence were maximum values for AFP or DCP and 90-day mean values for NLR, respectively, and multivariate analysis confirmed these values were correlated with tumor recurrence. However, receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that discriminative powers were sufficient only in maximum AFP [area under the curve (AUC) 0.88, P 250 ng/ml, and (iii) DCP > 450 mAu/ml (>450 ng/ml), was correlated with a worse 5-year disease-free survival rate (20.0% vs. 96.8%, P
