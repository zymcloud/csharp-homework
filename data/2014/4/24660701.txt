Objective:The purpose of this article is to investigate whether there is a difference in susceptibility to transcatheter arterial chemoembolization between hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) showing high uptake and those showing low uptake of gadoxetic acid in the hepatobiliary phase of MRI.Materials and methods:One hundred HCCs that achieved optimal chemoembolization, as assessed by immediate CT in 60 patients, were classified as having high (n = 19) or low (n = 81) uptake of gadoxetic acid on MRI performed before chemoembolization. The local recurrence rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences between the groups were compared using the log-rank test. The following factors were also correlated with the local recurrence rate using the Cox proportional hazards model for a univariate analysis: high uptake of gadoxetic acid, number of feeding arteries, extrahepatic arterial supply, Child-Pugh class, clinical tumor stage, size, location, and iodized oil accumulation in the noncancerous tissue surrounding the lesion. Parameters that were significant at p Results:The 1- and 3-year local recurrence-free rates were 95% in high-uptake HCCs and 66% and 54%, respectively, in low-uptake HCCs (log-rank test, p Conclusion:HCCs showing high uptake of gadoxetic acid appear to be susceptible to chemoembolization.
