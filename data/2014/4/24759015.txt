Objective:To compare the efficacy and adverse events of adjusted BACOD (bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, dexamethasone) regimen (continuous intravenous infusion) and conventional BACOD regimen (conventional intravenous drip) in the treatment of relapsed and refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).Methods:Retrospective analysis of 63 cases of relapsed or refractory DLBCL patients was performed, 32 patients received conventional BACOD regimen and 31 patients received adjusted BACOD regimen.Results:The response rates for adjusted group and conventional group were 87.1%(27/31)and 62.5%(20/32), respectively, during a median follow-up of 14(7-84) months. The difference was statistically significant between the two groups (P=0.025). The main adverse events were myelosuppression, gastrointestinal adverse reactions were rarely serious, and there were no serious liver and kidney toxicity. The median overall survival (OS) was 33 months for adjusted group and 12 months for conventional group, there was statistical differences (P=0.019). The median progression free survival (PFS) was 11 months and 8 months for two groups, the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.095). 1-year survival rates were 68.8% for adjusted group and 44.3% for conventional group, there were no statistical differences (P=0.055). The expected 3- and 5-year survival rates of adjusted group were significantly higher than that of conventional group (47.1% vs 12.8%, P=0.002; 37.7% vs 8.5%, P=0.006, respectively).Conclusion:Compared with the conventional BACOD regimen, the adjusted BCOAD regimen is effective and well tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, the overall response rate and OS increased.
