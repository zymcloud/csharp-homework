Major abdominal surgeries, including liver transplantation, are considered high-risk procedures for patients with respiratory muscle dysfunction, such as patients with quadriparesis, due to possible fatal postoperative pulmonary complications. We report on a 57-year-old male patient with longstanding quadriparesis due to fifth cervical spine injury from a traffic accident who suffered from decompensated liver cirrhosis related to hepatitis C infection and hepatocellular carcinoma. A preoperative pulmonary function test showed forced expiratory volume in 1 minute (FEV1) 1.06 L, which was a risk for pulmonary complications. The patient required respiratory training. Cadaveric liver transplantation was performed successfully without surgical complications. The patient was extubated on the fourth day after surgery and initially did well. However, on the eighth postoperative day, an episode of status epilepticus from metabolic derangement developed. After controlling seizure with anticonvulsive medication and sedation, the patient was reintubated due to hypoventilation. Chest radiograph showed upper lung atelectasis. Due to this complication, tracheostomy was performed. The patient's condition gradually improved. He was ultimately discharged on the 45th postoperative day. Two months after the transplantation, liver functions were normal and the patient could breathe spontaneously without tracheostomy and had good quality of life. In conclusion, this is, to our knowledge, the first report of liver transplantation in a patient with quadriparesis. It shows that even with a very high risk for postoperative pulmonary complications, liver transplantation can be performed successfully with careful patient selection and effective respiratory care.
