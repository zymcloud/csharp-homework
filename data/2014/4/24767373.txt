Background:This study was conducted to compare the expression patterns of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and proteins induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) and resection at a high-volume single institution.Methods:First, 663 liver transplant recipients with HCC were selected. They were divided into hepatitis B virus (HBV) (n = 628) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) groups (n = 35). Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Second, another cohort of 2709 patients who underwent HCC resection included 2258 HBV, 143 HCV, and 308 non-HBV non-HCV (NBNC) patients.Results:In the transplantation group, pretransplantation AFP level >20 ng/mL was observed in 42.5% of HBV patients and 60% of HCV patients (P = .042). PIVKA-II level >40 mAU/mL was observed in 30.6% of HBV patients and 42.9% of HCV patients (P = .127). In the resection group, a preoperative AFP level >20 ng/mL was observed in 51.7% of HBV patients and 43.3% of HCV patients (P = .052). PIVKA-II level >40 mAU/mL was observed in 59.7% of HBV patients and 56.6% of HCV patients (P = .47). Preoperative AFP level >20 ng/mL and PIVKA-II level >40 mAU/mL were observed in 35.7% and 61% of NBNC patients, respectively. Receiver-operator characteristic curve analyses revealed that the expression pattern of PIVKA-II in patients with elevated AFP level was not predictable and vice versa, regardless of background liver diseases.Conclusions:This study indicates that serum AFP and PIVKA-II may be expressed variably regardless of the types of background liver disease. Further large-volume multicenter studies are needed to evaluate the possibility of the etiology-dependent expression of tumor markers.
