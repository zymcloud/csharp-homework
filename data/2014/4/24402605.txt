Background:The postresection alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may predict overall survival (OS) and recurrence beyond Milan criteria (MC) among the subgroup of initially transplantable patients.Methods:All patients with cirrhosis resected for HCC between January 1990 and December 2010 in a single institution and presenting a serum AFP value > 15 ng/ml at diagnosis were included. The postresection AFP was analyzed as a dichotomized variable: normalization (norm + group) or not (norm - group) within the 90-day postresection period.Results:Among 271 resected patients, 141 patients (52%) had a level of serum AFP â‰¥ 15 ng/ml at diagnosis. Five-year OS and median survival were 42% and 52 months in group norm + versus 20% and 23 months in the group norm - (P = 0.009). On multivariate analysis, the absence of AFP normalization was an independent factor of poor OS as well as microvascular invasion, and satellites nodules. Among theoretically transplantable patients, independent predictors of recurrence beyond MC were the absence of AFP normalization (risk ratio (RR) 5.02 [1.53-16.34]) and microvascular invasion (RR 4.76 [1.42-15.34]).Conclusion:The postresection AFP has an independent prognostic value. Transplantable patients resected for HCC without 90-day AFP normalization should be discussed for early liver transplantation.
