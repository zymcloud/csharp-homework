This work was designated to monitor the coagulation abnormalities associated with the gradual progression of liver diseases. The study included fifty patients; forty were diagnosed with liver cirrhosis with different stages categorized according to the Childs-Pugh classification and another ten patients were diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Haemostatic variables including fibrinogen (FI), calcium (FIV), transglutaminase (FXIII), prothrombin time (PT) and platelet count were estimated in patients and compared with the baseline levels of healthy subjects (n = 10). The results demonstrated that the fibrinogen level was progressively decreased, whereas PT was progressively prolonged in Child A, Child B and Child C groups. The maximum deterioration was observed in HCC patients. Calcium significantly increased in mild (Child A) and moderate (Child B) but not in Child C cirrhosis and HCC patients. FXIII level did not show any significant changes in cirrhotic patients compared to healthy group. Some of the haemostatic variables we investigated were correlated with serum albumin and bilirubin but not with aminotransferases (ALT and AST). The results indicated that the haemostatic abnormalities in fibrinogen, calcium and PT (but not FXIII) were deteriorated in parallel with the gradual regression of the constitutional function of liver.
