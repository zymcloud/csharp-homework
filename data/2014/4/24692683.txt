Hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis and treatment has witnessed many major changes and challenges in the past two decades. Increasing incidence of HCC has introduced new monitoring systems and increased the efficacy of screening tests, as well as prognosis of the disease, including the staging system, serological testing and diagnostic imaging. Moreover, surgical resection, liver transplantation and herbal therapy have improved treatment. The most encouraging specific serological marker for HCC is alpha fetoprotein (AFP), which, along with ultrasonography, has improved earlier detection of HCC. Most recently, circulating tumor cell measurement has emerged as a promising tool for the prognosis of HCC. Herbal drugs and herbal composite formula drugs are promising towards the prevention of invasion and proliferation of tumor cells. Chemotherapeutic agents, such as sorafenib, bevacizumab and erlotinib, which target growth factor receptors in signaling pathways, are also used as HCC treatments. Furthermore, radiotherapy is employed in the treatment of unresectable tumors. The present report provides an analysis of the above parameters in the management of HCC.
