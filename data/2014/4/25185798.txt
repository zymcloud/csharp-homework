Background:This study investigated the effect of transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) of the heparanase gene on hepatoma SMCC-7721 cells.Methods:SiRNAs targeting the promoter region and coding region of the heparanase gene were designed and synthesized. Then the siRNAs were transfected into hepatoma SMCC-7721 cells by nuclear transfection or cytoplasmic transfection. The expression of heparanase was detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting 48 h, 72 h and 96 h post-transfection. In addition, wound healing and invasion assays were performed to estimate the effect of TGS of the heparanase gene on the migration and invasion of hepatoma SMCC-7721 cells.Results:Protein and mRNA expression of the heparanase gene were interfered with by TGS or post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) 48 h after transfection. At 72 h post-transfection, the expression of the PTGS group of genes had recovered unlike the TGS group. At 96 h post-transfection, the expression of the heparanase gene had recovered in both the TGS group and PTGS group. Invasion and wound healing assays showed that both TGS and PTGS of the heparanase gene could inhibit invasion and migration of hepatoma SMCC-7721 cells, especially the TGS group.Conclusions:TGS can effectively interfere with the heparanase gene to reduce the invasion and migration of hepatoma SMCC-7721 cells.
