Purpose:The progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is multifactorial and angiogenesis plays a fundamental role, mainly because HCC is a highly vascularized tumor.Methods:In this study, we determined microvessel density (MVD) using the immunohistochemical markers, CD34 and CD105 (Endoglin), in 44 hepatectomy specimens, encompassing 44 malignant nodules (HCC), 44 regenerative nodules (RN), and 15 dysplastic nodules (DN). The evaluation included the determination of MVD in all nodules. For statistical analysis, a descriptive analysis was carried out using measurements of position and dispersion for continuous variables; ANOVA was used to compare between groups, considering p Results:We observed a significant difference when comparing CD34 and CD105 immunoexpression in HCC, DN, and RN. CD105 was predominantly expressed in the peripheral regions in HCC, with mean MVD scores of 6.2 ± 4.1 and 10.7 ± 4.4 at the center and periphery of the nodules, respectively, with significant differences between groups (p Conclusions:MVD determined by CD34 and CD105 expression may be used as an additional parameter to distinguish benign from malignant liver nodules.
