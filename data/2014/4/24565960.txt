Background:Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive α-fetoprotein (AFP-L3) is a fucosylated fraction of AFP that is highly specific for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We studied the relationship between AFP-L3 response and treatment outcome in terms of radiologic response and overall survival in patients undergoing transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 152 patients with advanced HCC undergoing TACE. Serum AFP-L3 and AFP levels were measured simultaneously with a novel lectin dual-label time-resolved immunofluorometric assay (lectin dual-label TRFIA). AFP-L3 response was defined as a ≥20% reduction in AFP-L3 level after a minimum of 2 cycles of chemotherapy.Results:A total of 47 AFP-L3 responders had improved median overall survival of 42.9 months compared with 15.4 months in nonresponders (PConclusion:A significant reduction in AFP-L3 in patients with advanced HCC is an important predictor of survival. Achieving an AFP-L3 response should be one of the therapeutic intents of TACE.
