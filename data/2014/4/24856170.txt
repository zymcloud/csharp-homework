The biopharmaceutical properties of doxorubicin delivered via two drug-delivery systems (DDSs) for the palliative treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma were reviewed with relation to the associated liver and tumor (patho)physiology. These two DDSs, doxorubicin emulsified with Lipiodol(®) and doxorubicin loaded into DC Bead(®) are different regarding tumor delivery, release rate, local bioavailability, if and how they can be given repeatedly, biodegradability, length of embolization and safety profile. There have been few direct head-to-head comparisons of these DDSs, and in-depth investigations into their in vitro and in vivo performance is warranted.
