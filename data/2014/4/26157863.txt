Polymyositis (PM) is an inflammatory condition of skeletal muscle and is believed to be a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with various types of cancer. PM associated with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is very rare. We report a case of advanced HCC with chronic HBV cirrhosis that presented with proximal muscle weakness. Further investigation showed elevation of muscle enzymes, myopathic pattern of electromyography (EMG), and evidence of myositis compatible with PM. Lamivudine and 1 mg/kg of oral prednisolone were given. Two sessions of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) were performed and sorafenib was started. Muscle enzymes normalized after 6 weeks of treatment. Unfortunately, 5 months after treatment, patient was readmitted and died of severe bacterial pneumonia.
