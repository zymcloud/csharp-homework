Background:Little is known about risk factors for recurrence in stage IB gastric cancer without lymph node metastasis. The aims of this study were to determine prognostic factors associated with long-term survival and to clarify patterns of recurrence.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 130 patients with primary gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy at Kitasato University East Hospital from 2001 through 2010 and analyzed clinicopathological characteristics associated with survival and patterns of recurrence.Results:Of the 130 patients, 12 (9.2%) had recurrence, among whom 10 (83%) patients died. Four patients (3.1%) died of other diseases. The 5-year overall survival rate was 89%. Of the 12 patients with recurrence, 7 (58%) had liver metastasis, 3 (25%) had distant lymph-node metastasis, 2 (17%) had peritoneal dissemination, and 1 (8.3%) had locoregional recurrence. Patients with tumors more than 5 cm in diameter tended to have recurrence within 1 year. Patients who had recurrence more than 2 years after surgery tended to survive for longer than 5 years after recurrence. Moderate or marked venous invasion (v2 or v3) and age >65 years were significantly associated with relapse-free and overall survival on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, the only independent prognostic factor for relapse-free and overall survival was venous invasion.Conclusions:Moderate or marked venous invasion (v2 or v3) is an independent predictor of relapse-free and overall survival in stage IB node-negative gastric cancer. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, currently not given to this subgroup of patients, may improve the outcomes of patients with stage IB node-negative gastric cancer, particularly when accompanied by venous invasion.
