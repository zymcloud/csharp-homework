Background & aims:A large proportion of patients with cirrhosis are seen only by their primary care provider (PCP). Surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therefore depends on PCPs in these cases. We aimed to assess PCP knowledge and practice of HCC surveillance.Methods:We contacted a random sample of 1000 North Carolina PCPs by mail. All PCPs contacted received an introductory letter followed by a 12-item questionnaire addressing HCC surveillance knowledge and practice.Results:A total of 391 PCPs (39%) completed the survey; 89% saw patients with cirrhosis in their practice, but only 45% screened for HCC. Among PCPs who screened for HCC, the most common methods were ultrasound analysis and measurement of Î±-fetoprotein level (66%). Reasons for surveillance included supported by evidence (72%), recommended by medical societies (42%), and malpractice liability for not performing surveillance (26%). Of PCPs who did not screen, 84% referred to gastroenterologists for surveillance decisions, 24% were unaware of recommendations, 8% were uncertain of the benefits, and 8% were concerned about cost. Hepatic resection and liver transplantation were identified as effective therapies by 67% and 56% of PCPs, respectively, but all other effective therapies were identified by less than half (transarterial chemoembolization by 42%, radiofrequency ablation by 35%, and sorafenib by 26%). The ability to identify at least 1 effective therapy was associated independently with surveillance (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-4.0).Conclusions:Most PCPs see patients with cirrhosis, but only a minority screen for HCC. PCP knowledge of effective HCC therapy options is suboptimal. Efforts to enlist PCPs in HCC surveillance may be best served by increasing their knowledge of effective therapies.
