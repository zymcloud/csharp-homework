Background:No predictive marker has been yet identified for bevacizumab which is widely used in metastatic colorectal cancer.Aims:Evaluate impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms involved in Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor pathway on efficacy and tolerance of bevacizumab.Methods:We retrospectively included patients who were treated with bevacizumab-based chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer, and for whom a deoxyribonucleic acid sample was available. Ten polymorphisms in Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A, his receptors and hypoxia inducible factor-1α were genotyped on germ line DNA using real-time polymerase chain reaction TaqMan(®).Results:89 patients were included. The CC genotype for rs3025039 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A c.*237C>T) was associated with a significantly better time to treatment failure (14.2 months) as compared to the CT and TT genotypes (6.0 months) in univariate (p = 0.004) and multivariate (p = 0.022; HR = 0.57; 95% CI [0.35-0.92]) analysis. Patients with at least one T allele showed worse overall survival and progression-free survival as compared to homozygous CC patients in univariate analysis (respectively p = 0.016 and p = 0.044). There was significantly more severe hypertension for the CC genotype (29.5%) compared to CT and TT genotypes (7.1%) (p = 0.022) in multivariate analysis.Conclusions:In this retrospective study, the rs3025039 polymorphism was significantly associated with time to treatment failure and hypertension in patients treated with bevacizumab-based chemotherapy.
