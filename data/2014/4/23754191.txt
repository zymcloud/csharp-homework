Background:According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) algorithm, patients with advanced stage (BCLC-C) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are recommended for systemic treatment or palliative therapy. However, chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE) has been shown to be safe in high-risk patients. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of DEB-TACE in patients with an advanced-stage HCC.Methods:In this institutional review board-approved, retrospective study, 80 patients with advanced-stage HCC underwent DEB-TACE with doxorubicin. Patients were evaluated for median hospital stay, incidence of Grade 3/4 toxicities, 30-day mortality, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) following DEB-TACE. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed for predictors of better OS.Results:The median hospital stay following DEB-TACE was 1 day (range: 1-11). The median PFS and OS were 5.1 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.1-7.7] and 13.3 months (95% CI: 10.1-18.6) respectively. On multivariate analysis ECOG PS ≤ 1 and >2 DEB-TACE procedures were associated with better OS. Patients with ECOG PS ≤ 1 demonstrated a median survival of 17.7 months compared with 5.6 months for patients with ECOG PS > 1 (p = 0.025). Multiple DEB-TACE procedures (>2 procedures) were associated with improved survival (26.8 months) compared with patients with one or two procedures (11.4 months, p = 0.01). Portal vein thrombosis or extrahepatic disease had no statistically significant association with OS.Conclusions:DEB-TACE is safe and effective in patients with advanced HCC. ECOG PS ≤ 1 and >2 DEB-TACE procedures were associated with better OS.
