Objective:To study the expression of arginase-1 (Arg-1), glypican-3 (GPC3), hepatocyte paraffin antigen 1 (HepPar-1) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), benign liver lesions (BLL) and metastatic carcinoma (MC), and their applications in diagnosis and differential diagnosis.Methods:Immunohistochemical study (EnVision method) for Arg-1, GPC3, HepPar-1 and AFP was carried out in three groups of liver lesions, including 85 cases of HCC, 35 cases of BLL and 19 cases of MC. The relationship between expression of Arg-1, GPC3, HepPar-1 and AFP and clinicopathologic features in HCC was also analyzed.Results:The positive expression rate of Arg-1 was 90.6% (79/85) in HCC and 100% (35/35) in BLL. Arg-1 expression was observed in 1 of the 19 cases of MC studied. The positive expression rate of GPC3 was 82.4% (70/85) in HCC, 5.3% (1/19) in MC and 0 (0/35) in BLL. The positive expression rate of AFP was 47.1% (40/85) in HCC and 0 in BLL or MC. The positive expression rate of HepPar-1 was 72.9% (62/85) in HCC, 100% (35/35) in BLL and 2/19 in MC. Arg-1 has a higher sensitivity in highlighting hepatocellular lesions than AFP and HepPar-1 (P=0.000 versus P=0.002). The specificity of GPC3 expression in HCC was 98.1%.Conclusions:Arg-1 is a sensitive hepatocellular marker in delineation of liver lesions.GPC3 is a relatively specific marker in diagnosis of HCC.
