Background and objectives:Podoplanin, a transmembrane sialoglycoprotein, is expressed by lymphatic endothelial cells and many tumor cells, and is involved in tumor cell-induced platelet aggregation and tumor metastasis. A recent study found that C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) is a physiologic receptor for podoplanin. Previous studies showed that aggretin, a snake venom-derived protein, activates platelets by targeting platelet CLEC-2. We hypothesized that the C-terminal fragment of aggretin may bind to platelet CLEC-2 and displace podoplanin, in turn exerting antitumor metastatic effects.Methods and results:Aggretin Î±-chain C-terminus (residues 106-136; AACT) prolonged the lag phase of platelet aggregation induced by aggretin in human washed platelets, indicating that AACT may target the binding site of CLEC-2. HepG2 cells, which are podoplanin-expressing hepatoma cells, induced platelet aggregation with a lag phase. Pretreatment with AACT inhibited platelet aggregation and prolonged the lag phase induced by HepG2 cells. This inhibitory effect was also found with another hepatocarcinoma cell line, HuH-7. AACT inhibited the interaction between HuH-7 cells and platelets, and a specific binding assay demonstrated that CLEC-2 was the binding site for AACT on platelets. In addition, the invasive ability of HepG2 cells was abolished by AACT in a chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane model. Furthermore, formation of lung metastases after intravenous administration of HuH-7 cells was significantly reduced when mice were treated with AACT.Conclusions:AACT interacts with CLEC-2 of platelets, leading to interference with platelet aggregation and the subsequent metastatic potential of tumor cells. These results suggest that aggretin AACT is a potential candidate for the treatment of tumor metastasis through CLEC-2 blockade.
