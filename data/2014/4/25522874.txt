Objectives:The aim of this study was to describe the proportion of liver-related diseases (LRDs) as a cause of death in HIV-infected patients in France and to compare the results with data from our five previous surveys.Methods:In 2010, 24 clinical wards prospectively recorded all deaths occurring in around 26 000 HIV-infected patients who were regularly followed up. Results were compared with those of previous cross-sectional surveys conducted since 1995 using the same design.Results:Among 230 reported deaths, 46 (20%) were related to AIDS and 30 (13%) to chronic liver diseases. Eighty per cent of patients who died from LRDs had chronic hepatitis C, 16.7% of them being coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Among patients who died from an LRD, excessive alcohol consumption was reported in 41%. At death, 80% of patients had undetectable HIV viral load and the median CD4 cell count was 349 cells/μL. The proportion of deaths and the mortality rate attributable to LRDs significantly increased between 1995 and 2005 from 1.5% to 16.7% and from 1.2‰ to 2.0‰, respectively, whereas they tended to decrease in 2010 to 13% and 1.1‰, respectively. Among liver-related causes of death, the proportion represented by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) dramatically increased from 5% in 1995 to 40% in 2010 (p = 0.019).Conclusions:The proportion of LRDs among causes of death in HIV-infected patients seems recently to have reached a plateau after a rapid increase during the decade 1995-2005. LRDs remain a leading cause of death in this population, mainly as a result of hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection, HCC representing almost half of liver-related causes of death.
