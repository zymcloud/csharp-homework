Background & aims:Vitamin D is an immunomodulator that might be involved in the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis. We investigated the effects of vitamin D deficiency on long-term outcomes of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Methods:We performed a prospective cohort study of 426 patients with CHB (65% male; mean age, 41 ± 13 years), who were enrolled from 1997 through 2000. Serum levels of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D3) were measured on study enrollment (baseline). Patients were followed for 159 ± 46 months until last clinic visit or death; approximately 33% received antiviral therapy during the follow-up period. The primary outcome was a clinical event (hepatocellular carcinoma, complications of cirrhosis, or death).Results:At baseline, the patients' mean serum level of hepatitis B virus DNA was 5.0 ± 2.1 log10 IU/mL; their mean level of 25(OH)D3 was 24.3 ± 9.4 ng/mL, and 348 patients (82%) had vitamin D deficiency (Conclusions:Vitamin D deficiency is common among patients with CHB and is associated with adverse clinical outcomes.
