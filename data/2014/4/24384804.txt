Objective:To compare the accuracy of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the detection of intrahepatic tumor recurrence after curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Fifty-six patients who underwent MDCT and gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI for postoperative surveillance after resection of HCC were retrospectively analyzed; 26 patients had a recurrence (36 lesions) and 30 patients did not. Recurrent HCCs were confirmed by histological examinations in two, typical dynamic imaging findings on CT and/or MRI in 28, and by demonstration of growth or tumor staining on angiography on six. Two reviewers graded the confidence for the presence of recurrence on CT and MRI, using a five-point scale. The jackknife free-response receiver operating characteristic method was used to compare diagnostic performance. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated.Results:For 36 recurrent lesions, the figure of merit was significantly higher for MRI than MDCT for detecting recurrence for both reviewers (p Conclusion:Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI is superior to MDCT for detecting intrahepatic recurrence after curative resection of HCC.
