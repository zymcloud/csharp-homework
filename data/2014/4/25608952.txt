Background:There were many treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT), in which targeted anti-angiogenic drug therapy is becoming a popular research topic. However, an objective and non-invasive method that can evaluate the treatment effects is still lacking.Methods:Eighteen New Zealand white rabbits implanted with VX2 tumor thrombus in portal vein were randomly assigned into 3 groups: Endostar, saline, or control, six in each group. Multi-slice CT (MSCT) perfusion scanning was performed to measure the differences in blood flow (TBF), tissue blood volume (TBV), and capillary permeability time the surface (PS) before and after Endostar treatment, between Endostar and saline treatment. Two weeks after treatment, both Endostar and saline groups underwent CT perfusion scan. The rabbits then were sacrificed by air embolism, and specimens of tumor thrombosis were collected. Immunohistochemistry assay was also performed to compare the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in PVTT after Endostar, saline and placebo treatment.Results:In Endostar group, PVTT CT perfusion parameters (TBF, TBV, PS) significantly decreased after the treatment (p 0, p Conclusions:Multi-slice CT perfusion imaging can evaluate the anti-angiogenic effects of Endostar for the VX2 tumor thrombus in portal vein, and provide quantitative functional information.
