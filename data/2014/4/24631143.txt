Purpose:To evaluate the application of perfusion CT for gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation for radiotherapy of intrahepatic tumors.Materials and methods:15 radiotherapy patients with confirmed liver tumors underwent contrast enhanced 4D-CT (Philips Brilliance Big-bore) as well as dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) CT (GE 750HD). Perfusion maps were generated with CT perfusion v5 from GE. Five observers delineated GTVs of all intrahepatic foci on the 4D-CT, time-averaged DCE-CT and perfusion CT for every patient. STAPLE consensus contours were generated. Dice's coefficients were compared between GTVs generated by observers on each image set and the corresponding consensus GTVs. Comparisons were also performed with patients stratified by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastatic tumors, and by tumor volume.Results:Overall, mean Dice's coefficients were 0.81±0.14, 0.84±0.10, and 0.81±0.14 for 4D-CT, DCECT and perfusion. DCE-CT performed significantly better than 4D-CT and perfusion (p=0.005 and p=0.01 respectively). For patients with HCC, DCE-CT reduced interobserver variability significantly compared to 4D-CT (Dice's coefficients 0.87 vs. 0.84, pConclusions:DCE-CT imaging of liver perfusion reduced interobserver variability in GTV delineation for both HCC and metastatic liver tumors.
