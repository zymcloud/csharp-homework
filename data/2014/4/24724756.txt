The authors report a 74-year-old man with chronic hepatitis C-related cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease undergoing maintenance haemodialysis who was diagnosed with hepatoma. The hepatoma spontaneously regressed with significantly decreased serum alpha-fetoprotein level without any treatment during the subsequent 4-year follow-up period. However, recurrent hepatomas over bilateral hepatic lobes were evident thereafter, and the patient died later due to hepatic failure. Hepatoma with ring calcification is extremely rare and considered poor differentiation with high risk for recurrence. Spontaneous regression of hepatoma is also rare, while spontaneous regression occurring in a hepatoma with ring calcification is never reported. The definite mechanisms causing spontaneous regression of hepatomas remain unclear, but an immune response toward hepatoma induced by alpha-fetoprotein might play an important role.
