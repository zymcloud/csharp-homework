Aim:To evaluate the anticancer efficacy of CKD-516, a novel vascular-disrupting agent, alone and in combination with doxorubicin in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:In mice bearing luciferized HCC cells, therapeutic efficacy was assessed for seven days after single administration of CKD-516, doxorubicin, or combination of CKD-516 and doxorubicin.Results:Bioluminescence-imaging (BLI) signals in the CKD-516 group abruptly decreased initially, but recovered at seven days after treatment. BLI signals in the doxorubicin group gradually decreased over the 7-day period. In the combination group, BLI signals were abruptly reduced and remained suppressed for the 7-day period. On histopathological examination, CKD-516-treated tumors showed extensive central necrosis, whereas the peripheral layers remained viable. Doxorubicin-treated tumors showed mild and scattered necrosis. Tumors from the combination group showed more extensive central and peripheral necrosis, with smaller viable peripheral layers than the CKD-516 group.Conclusion:Combination therapy can have additive effects for treatment of HCC compared with CKD-516 or doxorubicin monotherapy.
