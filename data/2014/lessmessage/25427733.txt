Purpose:To evaluate the usefulness of a virtual ultrasound (US) imaging device as a tool to assist novice sonographers.Materials and methods:A prospective blinded pilot study was conducted involving patients with liver lesions. Two sonographers and 2 medical doctors with less than 5 years of experience performed US examinations. The time needed to detect liver lesions on US and the success rate for detecting liver lesions with and without using the virtual US imaging device SYNAPSE VINCENT® (Fujifilm Medical Co., Tokyo, Japan) before US examination were evaluated.Results:Thirty-two patients with the following 42 liver lesions were included: liver cyst (n = 24), hemangioma (n = 8), hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 6), and liver metastasis (n = 4). The maximal diameter of these lesions ranged from 0.3 to 1.5 cm (mean ± SD, 0.8 ± 0.4). The average time for detecting liver lesions on US was 47.8 s (range, 7-113) with VINCENT and 112.9 s (range, 14-313) without VINCENT before US examination. There were significant differences in the duration of US examination with and without VINCENT (p = 0.0002, Student's t test). The rates for accurately detecting liver lesions were 100 and 76.2% (16/21) in US beginners with and without VINCENT, respectively. Significantly higher detection rates were found in the US beginners who used VINCENT compared to those who did not use VINCENT (p = 0.047, Fisher's exact test).Conclusion:Before US examination, a reference with VINCENT could contribute to the successful detection of liver lesions and could be time-saving for US beginners.
