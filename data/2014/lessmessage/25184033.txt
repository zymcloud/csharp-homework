Synchronous development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) in a liver is an extremely rare event. Very few cases have so far been reported in the literature with such condition. Herein, we report on the first case of incidental diagnosis of synchronous HCC and CC in a patient with cryptogenic cirrhosis who underwent liver transplantation. The diagnosis was made after careful examination of the explanted liver.
