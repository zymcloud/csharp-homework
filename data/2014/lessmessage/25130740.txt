Selenite is a selenium source for selenoprotein biosynthesis in mammalian cells. Although previous studies have suggested the involvement of glutathione (GSH) and/or thioredoxin reductase in selenite metabolism, intracellular selenite metabolism remains largely unknown. Here, we report that GSH depletion did not affect the amount of selenoprotein in Hepa 1-6 cells, suggesting that GSH does not play a central role in the reduction of selenite in selenoprotein biosynthesis. On the other hand, we found that GSH is involved in the efflux of low-molecular-weight selenium compounds from cells, presumably via the formation of selenodiglutathione. Moreover, selenite inhibited the efflux of a fluorescent bimane-GS conjugate that is mediated by ATP-dependent multidrug-resistant proteins, implying the existence of an active transporter for selenodiglutathione. This is the first report demonstrating that GSH plays a role in selenium excretion from cells by forming a GSH-conjugate, which may contribute to the distribution, detoxification, and homeostasis of selenium in the body.
