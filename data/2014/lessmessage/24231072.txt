Ethnopharmacological relevance:Matrine has been isolated from Sophora flavescens, and found to show anti-inflammatory effects in macrophages and anti-cachectic effects in hepatomas. The present study investigated whether matrine suppressed eosinophil infiltration and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in mice, and decreased the inflammatory response of tracheal epithelial cells.Materials and methods:BALB/c mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin to induce allergic asthma in mice. These asthmatic mice were given various doses of matrine by intraperitoneal injection. Additionally, activated human tracheal epithelial cells (BEAS-2B cells) were treated with matrine, and evaluated for levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.Results:We found that matrine significantly decreased AHR, and suppressed goblet cell hyperplasia, eosinophil infiltration, and inflammatory response in the lung tissue of asthmatic mice. Matrine also reduced the levels of Th2 cytokines and chemokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and suppressed OVA-IgE production in serum. Furthermore, matrine treatment of activated BEAS-2B cells decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines and eotaxins, as well as suppressed ICAM-1 expression and thus adhesion of eosinophils to inflammatory BEAS-2B cells in vitro.Conclusions:Our findings suggest that matrine can improve allergic asthma in mice, and therefore has potential therapeutic potential in humans.
