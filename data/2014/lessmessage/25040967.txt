Aim:To investigate the efficacy and safety of lobaplatin-transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with radioactive 125I seed implantation in treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:75 patients with primary HCC were enrolled in the study, among them 43 receiving lobaplatin- TACE (TACE group) and 32 lobaplatin-TACE combined with 125I seed implantation (TACE+125I group). After treatment, the local remission rates and postoperative complications of two groups were compared using the Pearson Chi-square test. Overall survival in the two groups was calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the differences were tested using Log-rank test.Results:There were 7 cases of complete response (CR), 13 of partial response (PR), 6 of stable disease (SD) and 17 of progressive disease (PD) in the TACE group, with 13 cases of CR, 9 of PR, 5 of SD and 5 of PD in the TACE+125I group. The disease control rates of TACE and TACE+125I group were 60.5% (26/43) and 84.4% (27/32), respectively, with a significant difference between them (P Conclusion:Lobaplatin-TACE combined with 125I seed implantation is favorable and safe for treatment of primary HCC.
