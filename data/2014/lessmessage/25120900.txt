Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common, malignant tumor of the liver. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) commonly metastasizes to the lungs, abdominal lymph nodes, adrenal glands, or bones. Distant lymph node metastases are rare in hepatocellular carcinoma. A 49-year-old male patient presented with right sided neck mass. On examination there was right cervical lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly. Excisional cervical lymph node biopsy showed metastatic carcinoma. However, further examination of the biopsy specimen for immuno-histochemistry markers, shows positivity for HepPar-1 & CD-10 suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma. Considering the high incidence of HCC in Asia, a special attention should be given to such unusual site of presentation and metastasis of HCC; therefore, not to miss the diagnosis.
