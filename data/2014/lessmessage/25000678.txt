Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is a benign tumour of the liver (hepatic tumour), which is the second most prevalent tumour of the liver (the first is hepatic hemangioma). It has a higher incidence in females, 20-40 years old, but also occurs in men and even in children. It is usually asymptomatic, rarely grows or bleeds, and has no malignant potential. This tumour was once often resected because it was difficult to distinguish from hepatic adenoma, but with modem multiphase imaging it is now diagnosed strictly by imaging criteria, and not resected. We present the case of a 78 years old man who presented to emergency room (ER) with a history of dry cough, chest pain and mild dyspnea. Chest X-ray showed ascension of the right hemidiaphragm, and a homogeneous round opacity of 6/6.2 cm in the right cardiophrenic angle. The first suspicion was of pulmonary tumor, but the final diagnosis was FNH, confirmed by CT scan. We discuss the differential diagnosis and prognosis of this entity. The particularities of the case are the presentation with respiratory symptoms and pulmonary mass, and the age of the patient.
