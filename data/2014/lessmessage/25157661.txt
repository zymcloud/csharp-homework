Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG). We investigated the effects of AChEIs on peripheral nicotinic receptors (nAChR), which play a crucial role in the treatment of MG symptoms. The positive modulation of those receptors by AChE inhibitors could have an added value to the anti-AChE activity and might be useful in the therapy of MG. Furthermore, to estimate the potential drawbacks of the compounds, cytotoxicity has been assessed on various cell lines. The whole-cell mode of the patch-clamp method was employed. The experiments were performed on medulloblastoma/rhabdomyosarcoma cell line TE671 expressing human embryonic muscle-like receptor with subunits alpha2betagammadelta. The effect of the compounds on cell viability was measured by standard MTT assay (Sigma Aldrich) on ACHN (renal cell adenocarcinoma), HeLa (immortal cell line derived from a cervical carcinoma), HEPG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma) and BJ (skin fibroblasts) cell lines. No positive modulation by the tested AChE inhibitors was observed. Moreover, the compounds exhibited antagonistic activity on the peripheral nAChR. Standard drugs used in MG treatment were shown to be less potent inhibitors of muscle-type nAChR than the newly synthesized compounds. The new compounds showed very little effect on cell viability, and toxicities were comparable to standards. Newly synthesized AChEIs inhibited peripheral nAChR. Furthermore, the inhibition was higher than that of standards used for the treatment of MG. They could be used for the study of nAChR function, thanks to their high antagonizing potency and fast recovery of receptor activity after their removal. However, since no positive modulation was observed, the new compounds do not seem to be promising candidates for MG treatment, even though their cytotoxic effect was relatively low.
