The dielectric properties of human liver were determined by characterization of tissue absorption and coupling of electromagnetic energy in the electromagnetic field. In this study the ex-vivo dielectric properties of human hepatocellular carcinoma (well and moderately differentiated), liver hemangioma, hepatic fibrosis (stages S1 and S2), and normal liver tissue were measured and analyzed over the frequency range of 10 Hz to 100 MHz. The dielectric properties over the frequency range can reflect tissue information including biological macromolecules, vesicles, and cellular membrane; these information aids in distinguishing different physiological states and lesions. The ex-vivo conductivity, permittivity, resistivity, as well as the characteristic parameters between the lesions and normal liver were analyzed and their differences were also verified. The data can contribute to developing bioelectric applications for tissue diagnostics and creating more accurate computer models for medical applications.
