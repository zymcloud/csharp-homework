Introduction:Defined as heterotrophic autotransplantation of splenic tissue after splenic trauma or surgery.Presentation of case:We present a case of 45 years old female patient with past history of splenectomy for haemolyticanaemia. Complaining of abdominal pain the patient was investigated by abdominal CT scan which revealed a focal lesion in the left lateral section of the liver suspicious to be hepatocellular carcinoma and gall bladder stones. Serum Î±-fetoprotein was within normal range. Exploration revealed a well encapsulated lesion completely separable from the liver and the diaphragm. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of splenosis. Although it is a rare condition, we recommend that the diagnosis of splenosis should be put in consideration in every patient with past history of splenectomy for proper management.Discussion:Although several cases of hepatic splenosis have been reported in the literature, supra-hepatic splenosis as our case has been rarely described.Conclusion:Considering patients past history of splenectomy or splenic trauma should add splenosis to the list of possible differential diagnosis to avoid unnecessary surgical intervention.
Splenosis; Suprahepatic.
