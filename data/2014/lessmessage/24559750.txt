Objective:The objective was to identify the decision-making magnetic resonance (MR) features in differentiating small intrahepatic mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma (sIMCC) from atypical small hepatocellular carcinoma (sHCC) (â‰¤3 cm) in patients with cirrhosis and chronic viral hepatitis.Methods:Signal features and relative contrast of sHCCs and sIMCCs in T2-weighted and dynamic enhanced imaging were analyzed. A subgroup comparison between the cirrhosis and noncirrhosis chronic viral hepatitis group was also made.Results:Univariate analysis revealed that tumor contours (PConclusion:Dynamic enhancement patterns and signals in T2-weighted images were the most important MR features to differentiate sIMCC from atypical sHCC with cirrhosis and chronic viral hepatitis.
