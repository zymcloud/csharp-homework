Hepatitis C is an important risk factor of hepatocellular carcinoma and in Europe the most common cause of liver transplantation performed due to cirrhosis. Pharmacologic therapy of hepatitis C has long been based on the combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Telaprevir and boseprevir improved the treatment options of relapse patients in particular, but their use has been limited by adverse effects, among other things. The second-generation virus-specific drugs that are now becoming available revolutionize the treatment of hepatitis C. They are orally administrable and as combinations effective against all genotypes. The price of these drugs is, however, notably high.
