Purpose:Hepatic resection is the mainstay of the curative treatment of primary hepatic tumors, with constantly improving short and long term results. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)-assisted liver resection is a relatively new method of transection of the liver parenchyma with favorable intra- and perioperative results. The aim of this study was to investigate the oncological efficacy (long term overall survival/OS and disease free survival/DFS) and to confirm the favorable short term morbidity and mortality.Methods:Between May 2004 and January 2007, 28 patients underwent 32 resections with removal of 50 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions. The technique of parenchymal transection has been described previously as RFA-assisted liver resection.Results:Thirty-day morbidity and mortality were 42.8 and 0%, respectively. Blood transfusion was necessary for 28.5% of the patients. The median hospital stay was 16.5 days (range 5-34). The 1- and 3-year OS were 92.9 and 65.7%, respectively. The 1- and 3-year DFS were 62.3 and 54.6- respectively. No patient developed metastatic disease or local recurrence at the margin site. Twelve patients (42.9%) developed in-the-liver recurrence away from the resection area.Conclusion:RFA-assisted liver resection is a safe and oncologically efficacious method for the surgical treatment of HCC with results comparable to other surgical techniques.
