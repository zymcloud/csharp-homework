Background/aims:This study is to find the changes of hypersplenism, the leukocyte, platelets count, blood loss and operative time, hospitalization days in gastric cancer patients with cirrhosis and hypersplenism after splenectomy or splenic artery ligation.Methodology:32 gastric cancer patients with cirrhosis and hypersplenism were divided into two groups performed radical gastrectomy combined with splenectomy (Group A, n = 17) or splenic artery ligation (Group B, n = 15), 16 gastric cancer patients performed radical gastrectomy were selected as control group (Group C). Then, statistical analyzed.Results:There were no significant differences of the leukocyteand platelets between Group A and B (p > 0.05), but significant compared with Group C (p < 0.01). After 6 chemotherapy, the differences of the leukocyteand platelets were obvious between Group A and C (p < 0.05), but not between Group B and C (p > 0.05). There were significant differences on the grading of hyperhepatia between Group A and B. Except the operative time of Group B and C (p > 0.05), there were significant differences on the blood loss, the operative time and hospitalization days among three groups (p < 0.05).Conclusions:The splenic artery ligation method was much more rational than splenectomy and it was preferred for the gastric cancer patients with cirrhosis and hypersplenism.
