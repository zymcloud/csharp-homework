Malignant melanoma (MM) with multiple metastases (including the oral mucosa) is an extremely rare condition that is difficult to manage due to its complexity. This article presents the case of a 27-year-old man who first developed MM on the scalp, which subsequently metastasized to the mandible, parotid gland, infratemporal fossa, and the cervical regions of the larynx, kidneys, liver, and lungs. The findings of the present case report are compared with 31 other cases published in the English literature. Multiple metastases of MMs in the head and neck region are rare and generally are associated with a poor prognosis. In such cases, dentists play a role in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of sequelae stemming from oncologic treatment, with the aim of improving the patient's quality of life.
