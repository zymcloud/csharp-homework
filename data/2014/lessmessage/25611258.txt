Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a major health burden in the modern world. Because current treatment options for HCC are capable of providing good survival rates to only a limited number of patients, new therapeutic opportunities should be looked upon. The particularities of dendritic cells (DC) populations existing in the liver, and their consecutive selective activation of certain immunotolerant T-cell subgroups, account for the high success rate of allogeneic hepatic transplantation, currently the most efficient treatment for HCC. The particularities of dendritic cells (DCs) populations existing in the liver, and their consecutive selective activation of certain immunotolerant T-cell subgroups, account for the high success rate of allogeneic hepatic transplantation for HCC. These molecular mechanisms also open new paths towards cancer preventing and cancer curative vaccines, as well as successful immunotherapy. Our aim was to summarize the main aspects of the biology of DCs populations, especially those present in the liver, and to draw attention to their current and future roles in the curative treatment of hepatocarcinoma.
