Hepatitis C is a common cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplant. Although it is usually asymptomatic, new screening recommendations will lead to increased recognition by primary care physicians. Rapidly evolving treatment recommendations are making this a treatable infection for many patients. Recognition of the infection and initiation of treatment for appropriate patients will decrease the likelihood of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Primary care physicians have the difficult task of managing comorbid conditions, such as chronic pain and hyperlipidemia, in patients with hepatitis C, as well as a potential for treating hepatitis C.
