Liver failure after liver resection for cirrhosis is a critical problem, and no effective therapy except liver transplantation is currently available. The objective of this study was to examine whether hepatocyte transplantation (HT) reduces the poststandard liver resection mortality rate of rats with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related cirrhosis. Liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) combined with NASH-related cirrhosis has become increasingly common. We developed a rat model of acute liver failure after two-thirds partial hepatectomy (PH) for NASH-related cirrhosis. The mechanism by which HT improved the survival of the model rats was examined in short- and long-term investigations. Female DPPIV(-) recipient F344 rats were fed the choline-deficient l-amino acid (CDAA)-defined diet for 12 weeks. Some of the rats were transplanted with male F344 DPPIV(+) rat hepatocytes 24 h before undergoing PH. The overall post-PH survival of each group was evaluated, and short- and long-term pathological and molecular biological evaluations were also performed. Overall survival was significantly longer in the HT group than the non-HT group (7-day survival rates: 46.7% and 7.7%, respectively). Compared with the recipient livers of the non-HT group, numerous Ki-67(+) hepatocytes and few TUNEL(+) hepatocytes were observed in the livers of the HT group. At 6 months after the HT, the DPPIV(+) hepatocytes had partially replaced the recipient liver and formed hepatocyte clusters in the spleen. Preoperative HT might improve the survival of rats with NASH-related cirrhosis after PH by preventing the host hepatocytes from accelerating their growth and falling into apoptosis.
