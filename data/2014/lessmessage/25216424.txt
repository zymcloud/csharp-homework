Abstract A 78-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with right upper abdominal pain and fever. His general condition was poor. The laboratory data showed severe inflammatory reactions. Computed tomography revealed an irregular tumor in the gallbladder. (18)F-fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed high uptake by the tumor, with diffuse uptake in the spine. Based on the elevated leukocyte count and FDG-PET findings, a granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)-producing tumor was diagnosed (G-CSF 120 pg/mL). We performed cholecystectomy with central bisegmentectomy of the liver, lymph node dissection and right hemicolectomy. Histologically, the tumor was an adenosquamous cell carcinoma of the gallbladder. Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor cells was positive for G-CSF. Postoperatively, the general condition of the patient was improved. The fever subsided, the leukocyte count and serum G-CSF level normalized, and FDG-PET showed no uptake in the spine postoperatively. The patient showed no signs of recurrence at 27 months after undergoing surgery. FDG-PET is a useful method for diagnosing G-CSF-producing gallbladder carcinoma. Aggressive curative resection for G-CSF-producing gallbladder carcinoma may improve patients' general condition and prognosis.
