Background:Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is defined as an acute deterioration of chronic liver disease. Intrasplenic hepatocyte transplantation is increasingly recognized as a treatment for liver failure and genetic metabolic liver diseases. We describe our experience of intrasplenic hepatocyte transplantation in a small cohort of patients as bridge therapy or as an alternative to orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).Methods:Seven patients with ACLF with an expected survival of less than 8 weeks were enrolled into the study. The donor hepatocytes were collected from 2 healthy males and cryopreserved. Donor hepatocytes were transplanted into the spleen of recipients via catheterization of the femoral artery. All patients were followed up for 5 years or to death.Results:A total of (4.2-6.0) × 10(10) hepatocytes were harvested from the 2 donors' livers and their survival after recovery from the frozen stock was 63% ± 2.8% and 73.5% ± 3.2%, respectively. Following intrasplenic hepatocyte transplantation, 3 patients fully recovered from liver failure, 1 survived and subsequently underwent OLT, and the remaining 3 patients died between 2.5 and 12 months after intrasplenic hepatocyte transplantation. At month 48 post-intrasplenic hepatocyte transplantation, living hepatocyte signals were observed in the spleen using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA).Conclusions:Intrasplenic hepatocyte transplantation is a promising therapy for liver failure that may reduce mortality rates among patients with end-stage liver disease awaiting OLT. Conceivably, intrasplenic hepatocyte transplantation may be considered an alternative to OLT for patients with acute liver failure. MRI (Gd-BOPTA) is a useful tool for detecting living hepatocytes in the spleen after intrasplenic hepatocyte transplantation.
