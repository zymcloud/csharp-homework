Our previous studies have showed that Gli2 played a predominant role in proliferation and apoptosis resistance to TRAIL in hepatoma cells. The purpose of this study was to explore whether Gli2 silencing enhances efficiency of TRAIL for hepatoma in vivo. SMMC-7721-shRNA cells were implanted subcutaneously into nude mices and TRAIL was injected into the peritoneal space. TUNEL assay was used to detect apoptosis of tumor cells. The expression of Gli2, c-FLIPL, c-FLIPS, and Bcl-2 protein was determined by immunohistochemistry, respectively. Apoptosis and the level of caspases proteins in SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells were detected by Flow cytometry and Western blot. Transcriptional activity of c-FLIP induced by Gli2 was measured by luciferase reporter gene assay. The results showed that lower volumes and weights of tumor were found in mice xenografted with SMMC-7721-shRNA cells as compared with control cells in the presence of TRAIL (P
