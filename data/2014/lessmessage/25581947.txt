Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) accounts for the majority of chronic liverdiseases in Occidental countries and remains a major cause of liver-related mortality in worldwide. The spectrum of ALD includes steatosis in patients which consume over 80g of alcohol per day, alcoholic steatohepatitis and liver cirrhosis in approximately 15% of patients. Once cirrhosis is established, the annual risk for hepatocellular carcinoma is about 1-2%. Environmental factors such as drinking patterns, coexisting liver disease, obesity, diet and co-medication may affect the natural course of ALD. Abstinence is the hallmark of therapy for ALD, and nutritional therapy is the first line in therapeutical intervention.
