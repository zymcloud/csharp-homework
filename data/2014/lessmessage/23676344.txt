Fibrolamellar cancer (FLC) is a rare primary hepatic malignancy with no established standard systemic treatments. Case reports and subgroup analyses from larger liver cancer studies suggest possible activity for fluoropyrimidines, platinum agents, and interferon-α. However, randomized studies are lacking, and the merits of any particular regimen in FLC are still largely unsubstantiated. We report the outcome of a case of metastatic FLC with previous progressive disease on 5-FU plus interferon-α and FOLFOX regimens that was treated with bevacizumab and erlotinib. The patient derived a prompt palliative response with complete resolution of cancer-related pain 2 weeks after initiation of erlotinib. Computed tomography after 2 months of treatment showed disease regression in distant lymphadenopathy. Molecular testing failed to confirm any evidence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, whereas immunohistochemistry showed 2 to 3+ staining for EGFR expression. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a clinical benefit for FLC in association with erlotinib and bevacizumab treatment. FLC overexpresses EGFR in comparison to hepatocellular cancer, suggesting that EGFR targeting may be an interesting therapeutic approach in this rare malignancy.
