Background/aims:For most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), diagnosis is invariably done only in the advanced stages of the disease. For advanced, non-metastatic stage, standard therapy is transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). For metastatic disease, the recommended therapy is systemic treatment with sorafenib. In this study, we evaluated the benefit of an additional local hepatic treatment for patients with advanced metastatic disease.Methods:In a retrospective study, we assessed the overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP), and disease control rate (DCR) in 37 patients with metastasized HCC treated with sorafenib. Sixteen patients received additional local therapy, while 21 patients received only sorafenib.Results:Median OS of patients with combined therapy was significantly higher with 25 months (95% CI: 13.7-36.3 months) as compared to 11 months (95% CI: 6.2-15.8 months) in patients treated with sorafenib alone. TTP was 7 months (95% CI: 5.3-8.7 months) compared to 5 months (95% CI: 3-7 months) and DCR was 87 versus 72% after 3 months and 31 versus 22% after 9 months.Conclusion:These data suggest that control of the liver tumor burden by local therapy in combination with sorafenib might prove beneficial for metastasized HCC. Randomised studies are needed to confirm this exploratory finding.
