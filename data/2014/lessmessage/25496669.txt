Venous involvement is commonly detected microscopically on gastric neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), but related imaging studies have been rarely documented. We report a rare case of gastric large cell NEC with tumor thrombi in gastric and splenic veins, elevated serum alpha fetoprotein, and multiple hepatic nodules. In this case, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography combined with contrast-enhanced computed tomography provided valuable information on tumor staging.
