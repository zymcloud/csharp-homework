To assess inhibition mechanisms of a Phellinus igniarius (PI) extract on cancer, C57BL/6 mice were orally treated with PI extractive after or before implanting H22 (hepatocellular carcinoma ) or B16 (melanoma) cells. Mice were orally gavaged with different doses of PI for 36 days 24h after introduction of H22 or B16 cells. Mice in another group were orally treated as above daily for 42 days and implanted with H22 cells on day 7. Then the T lymphocyte, antibody, cytokine, LAK, NK cell activity in spleen, tumor cell apoptosis status and tumor inhibition in related organs, as well as the expression of iNOS and PCNA in tumor tissue were examined. The PI extract could improve animal immunity as well as inhibit cancer cell growth and metastasis with a dose-response relationship. Notably, PI's regulation with the two kinds of tumor appeared to occur in different ways, since the antibody profile and tumor metastasis demonstrated variation between animals implanted with hepatocellular carcinoma and melanoma cells.
