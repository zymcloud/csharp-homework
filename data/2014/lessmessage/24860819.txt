Background:Recent studies suggested that two common polymorphisms, miR-146a G>C and miR-196a2 C>T, may be associated with individual susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the results remain conflicting rather than conclusive. Object. The aim of this study was to assess the association between miR-146a G>C and miR-196a2 C>T polymorphisms and the risk of HCC.Methods:A meta-analysis of 17 studies (10938 cases and 11967 controls) was performed. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were used to evaluate the strength of the association.Results:For miR-146a G>C, the variant genotypes were associated with a decreased risk of HCC (CC versus GG: OR = 0.780 and 95% CI 0.700-0.869; GC/CC versus GG: OR = 0.865 and 95% CI 0.787-0.952; CC versus GC/GG: OR = 0.835 and 95% CI 0.774-0.901). For miR-196a2 C>T, significant association was also observed (TT versus CC: OR = 0.783, 95% CI: 0.649-0.943, and P = 0.010; CT versus CC: OR = 0.831, 95% CI 0.714-0.967, and P = 0.017; CT/TT versus CC: OR = 0.817, 95% CI 0.703-0.949, and P = 0.008).Conclusion:The two common polymorphisms miR-146a G>C and miR-196a2 C>T were associated with decreased HCC susceptibility, especially in Asian population.
