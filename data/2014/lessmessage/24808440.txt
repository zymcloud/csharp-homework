Purpose:We aimed to compare the effect of using different embolic agents such as gelfoam and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) on survival, tumor response, and complications in transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Materials and methods:We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 38 inoperable HCC patients who underwent TACE between August 1998 and April 2007. A total of 50 TACE sessions were performed using PVA (n=18) or gelfoam particles (n=20), following the application of 60 mg doxorubicin with 10-20 mL lipiodol emulsion. The PVA and gelfoam groups were compared based on clinical, laboratory and demographic variables. Survival rates were calculated starting from the first TACE session using the Kaplan-Meier analysis.Results:There was no significant difference between the survival rates of PVA and gelfoam groups (P = 0.235). Overall survival rates at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months were 55%, 36%, 15%, 7%, and 5%, respectively. Tumor response, age, lipiodol accumulation type, number of HCC foci, complications and serum alpha-fetoprotein level were significant factors for survival in all patients.Conclusion:Use of gelfoam or PVA as the embolic agent did not have a significant impact on survival. Complete tumor response, intensive lipiodol accumulation in tumor, older age (
