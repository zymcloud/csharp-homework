Introduction:CyberKnife based radiosurgery is increasingly becoming the common treatment modality used. The high precision and tumor tracking of the CyberKnife makes it a useful tool in gynecological oncology.Aim:The aim of this study was a preliminary evaluation of CyberKnife based radiosurgery effectiveness as a treatment of patients with gynecological malignancies metastases.Material and methods:33 cases of gynecological malignancies metastases (19 patients) treated using CyberKnife (14--endometrium cancer, 12--ovary cancer, 7--cervix cancer; 25 adenocarcinomas, 7 SCC and 1 folliculoma). Between June 2011 and July 2013 we irradiated 16 lymph nodes metastases, 15 liver metastases, 1 bone and 1 mesentery metastasis using a fraction dose of from 6 Gy to 15 Gy (median 12) up to the total dose varied from 8 Gy to 45 Gy (delivered in 1-3 fractions). 21 cases underwent follow up. We analyzed tumor size changes and calculated the percentage of complete regressions and local control (LC) after 6 months.Results:The median of tumor size (mean of three diameters) decreased from 1.6 cm before the treatment to 1.1 cm 6 months later. In the controlled group (21 cases) a 24% of total regressions were noted. 6 month LC was 88% (88% for lymph nodes metastases and 86% for liver metastases).Conclusion:The obtained results permit us to form the conclusion that CyberKnife based radiosurgery is an effective and safe treatment for patients with gynecological malignancies metastases.
