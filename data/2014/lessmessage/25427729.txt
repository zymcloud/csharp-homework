Surveillance and diagnostic algorithms for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have already been described in guidelines published by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), the European Association for the Study of the Liver and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EASL-EORTC), and the Japan Society of Hepatology (JSH), but the content of these algorithms differs slightly. The JSH algorithm mainly differs from the other two algorithms in that it is highly sophisticated and considers the functional imaging techniques of gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced MRI (EOB-MRI) and Sonazoid contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to be very important diagnostic modalities. In contrast, the AASLD and EASL-EORTC algorithms are less advanced and suggest that a diagnosis be made based solely on hemodynamic findings using dynamic CT/MRI and biopsy findings. A consensus meeting regarding the JSH surveillance and diagnostic algorithm was held at the 50th Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan Congress, and a 2014 update of the algorithm was completed. The new algorithm reaffirms the very important role of EOB-MRI and Sonazoid CEUS in the surveillance and diagnosis of liver cancer and is more sophisticated than those currently used in the United States and Europe. This is now an optimized algorithm that can be used to diagnose early-stage to classical HCC easily and highly accurately.
