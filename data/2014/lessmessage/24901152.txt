Background/aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) has an extremely poor prognosis. One reason is that portal hypertension may progress rapidly and intractable gastric/esophageal variceal hemorrhage may occur in PVTT cases. We studied whether a percutaneous transhepatic portal vein stent placement could improve the prognosis for HCC with PVTT.Methodology:Five cases of HCC with PVTT where portal hypertension had rapidly progressed were performed portal vein stenting.Results:All cases had been classified into Child-Pugh class C. Only one of them died of liver failure five months after stent placement, but two of the cases successfully avoided dying of liver failure and the other two cases are still alive with a hepatic functional reserve maintained.Conclusions:Although portal vein stent placement for HCC with PVTT is not by itself a therapy for PVTT, portal vein stent placement plays a prominent role in improving hepatic function reserve preventing fatal hepatic failures due to PVTT and gastric/esophageal variceal hemorrhage associated with portal hypertension. This leads to prolonged survival for HCC patients with PVTT. Further prospective trials including the appropriate timing of portal vein stent placement treatment will be needed for larger numbers of HCC patients with PVTT.
