Background/aims:We performed balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (B-RTO) before hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy in cases with HCC and gastric varices (GV) containing porto-systemic shunts. We conducted retrospective analyses on effects of B-RTO on hepatic functional reserve and HCC, as well as associated complications, and verified HCC treatment timing.Methodology:B-RTO was performed before HCC therapy after confirming disappearance or shrinkage of gastro-renal shunt with 3-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT). Hepatic resection (HR) was performed in 7 of 12 cases, and transcatheter chemo-embolization (TACE) was used in 5 cases.Results:B-RTO significantly improved GV (P=0.002). Improvement in grade/form was observed by endoscopy after 84.1 days, and that in gastro-renal shunt was observed by 3D-CT after 13.9 days. HCC size (P=0.862) and stage didn't change after B-RTO. Two cases showed improved Child-Pugh classification, and no deterioration in hepatic functional reserve was observed. B-RTO was performed 37.9 days before HCC therapy in surgical cases, and 45 days in TACE cases.Conclusion:Performing B-RTO before HCC therapy did not exacerbate HCC and allowed its safe performance. Evaluation with 3D-CT after B-RTO to determine HCC therapy timing was possible after 2 weeks. However, care is needed as esophageal varices worsened in some cases.
