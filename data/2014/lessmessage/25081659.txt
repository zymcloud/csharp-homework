Background:The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a c-myc antisense oligodeoxynucleotide and 5-fluorouracil on the expression of c-myc, invasion and proliferation of HEPG-2 liver cancer cells.Materials and methods:HEPG-2 cells were treated with lipiosome-mediated c-myc ADSON and 5-fluorouracil. The proliferation inhibition rate and invasion were measured by MTT and invasion assay, respectively. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry and expression of c-myc by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.Results:The proliferation inhibition rate was significantly higher in the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide added-5-fluorouracil group than single antisense oligodeoxynucleotide or 5-fluorouracil group (pConclusions:A liposome-mediated c-myc antisense oligodeoxynucleotide and 5-fluorouracil can inhibit the proliferation and invasion of liver cancer cells by reducing the expression of c-myc. A c-myc antisense oligodeoxynucleotide can increase the sensitivity of liver cancer cells to 5-fluorouracil and decrease the dosage of the agent necessary for efficacy, providing an experimental basis for the clinical therapy of liver cancer.
