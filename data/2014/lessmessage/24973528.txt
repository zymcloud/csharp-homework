Introduction:Extended liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma can be performed safely and results in long-term survival in select patients. Caudate lobe as the sole remnant liver following extended liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma has traditionally been considered a relative contraindication to resection for advanced tumors of the liver. This study evaluated this surgical technique and the results of patients with tumors who had undergone liver resection with the caudate lobe as the sole remnant liver.Presentation of case:A 68-year-old man with a tumor (9cm×11cm) located in Couinaud's segment VI+VII+VIII and another tumor (7cm×8cm) located in segment IV+V underwent liver tumor resection.Discussion:Pathological examination of the resected tumors revealed HCC and mixed nodular cirrhosis. With a follow-up, the patient survived 28 months.Conclusion:Despite its small volume, the caudate lobe has integrated bilateral blood supply system and proliferates easily. Liver resection is a feasible procedure that can be performed with an acceptable operative risk leading to long-term outcome in selected patients.
