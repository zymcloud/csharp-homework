Mean platelet volume (MPV) is the commonly measured platelet index for platelet size and surrogate marker of platelet activation. Changes of MPV in hepatic disease have been evaluated in inflammatory conditions, fibrosis and malignancy. We also had reported previous studies to analyze clinical meaning of MPV in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic hepatitis B. However, data about investigation of MPV in cholestatic conditions are not sufficient so far. Recently, it has been reported that MPV was increased in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. In this study, we planned to investigate the relationship between MPV and glutamyltransferase which is well-established laboratory marker for cholestasis, in various disease conditions.
