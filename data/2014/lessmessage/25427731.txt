Background:Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) failure or refractoriness is an indication for sorafenib therapy in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The study evaluated the validity of the definition of TACE failure or refractoriness as proposed by the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan (LCSGJ) through a retrospective analysis of sorafenib treatment.Methods:Out of 265 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who were treated with sorafenib at our hospital, 45 experienced TACE failure or refractoriness and were included in this study and retrospectively analyzed.Results:Multivariate analysis only identified the number of ineffective TACE procedures performed before starting sorafenib treatment as significant factors. Overall survival (OS) after starting sorafenib was statistically longer in patients treated with ≤2 consecutive ineffective TACE procedures before sorafenib administration than in patients treated with ≥3 consecutive ineffective TACE procedures (p Conclusion:In patients treated with sorafenib, OS was extended with ≤2 consecutive ineffective TACE procedures compared to that with ≥3 consecutive ineffective TACE procedures. Thus, if tumors are uncontrolled, TACE should not be repeated. The result of this study supports the definition of TACE failure or refractoriness proposed by the LCSGJ.
