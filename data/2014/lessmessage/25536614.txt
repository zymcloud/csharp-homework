Purpose:To analyse the relationship between the expression of SASH1 and its methylation level in human hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Expression levels of SASH1 were examined with real-time PCR (RT-PCR) in tissues and cells, and methylation analysis was performed with MassArray.Results:The expression levels of SASH1 were strongly reduced in liver cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Quantitative methylation analysis by MassArray revealed different CpG sites in SASH1 promoter shared similar methylation pattern between liver cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues and the CpG sites of significant difference in methylation level were found as follows: CpG_3, CpG_17, CpG_21.22, CpG_25, CpG_26.27, CpG_28, CpG_34.35.36 and CpG_51.52. Moreover, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment of Hep-G2 cell line caused significant elevation of SASH1 mRNA.Conclusions:Based on these data, we propose that increase of DNA methylation degree in the promoter region of SASH1 gene, particularly CpG_26.27 sites, possibly repressed SASH1 expression in liver cancer.
