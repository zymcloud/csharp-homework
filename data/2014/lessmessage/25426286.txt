De novo esophageal malignancy following liver transplantation is very rare. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma following liver transplant is closely associated with history of alcohol intake and tobacco chewing. We report on a 45-year-old man, chronic tobacco chewer and alcoholic who underwent liver transplantation for alcoholic cirrhosis and developed esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 23 months following the procedure. He was treated surgically and has had a tumor-free survival after 34 months of regular follow-up.
