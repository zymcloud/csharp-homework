Background/aims:The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the feasibility and treatment effects of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for recurrent intrahepatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation.Methodology:Between March 2007 and December 2012, we treated 8 patients (6 men and 2 women; mean age, 54 years) with recurrent HCC after living donor liver transplantation by TACE using an interventional-CT system. We retrospectively investigated treatment outcomes, complications, and the prognosis in these patients.Results:Overall, 17 sessions of TACE were performed. A single TACE session was performed in 4 patients while multiple TACE sessions were performed in 4 patients. Anticancer drugs and embolic agents were selectively infused from the right hepatic artery (n=7), left hepatic artery (n=1), A3 (n=1), A5 (n=1), A6 (n=1), A7 (n=2), anterior branch (n=1), posterior branch (n=3), intercostal artery (n=1), and right inferior phrenic artery (n=5). There were no procedure-related complications. Response rate was 50%. The median overall survival from the initial TACE for recurrence of HCC was 12.9 months (95% confidence interval, 5 to 21). The 1-year survival rate was 42.9%.Conclusion:TACE with an interventional-CT system could play an important role in the treatment of recurrent HCC after liver transplantation.
