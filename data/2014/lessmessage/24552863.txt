Background:Incidental hepatocellular carcinoma (iHCC) generates uncertainty over risk of recurrence after liver transplantation (LT).Aim:To compare recurrence between iHCC and confirmed HCC diagnosed prior to transplant based on imaging criteria (cHCC).Material and methods:Fifty-four HCC patients were analyzed from a series of 309 consecutive adult transplanted patients. We developed a recurrence predicting score (RPS) applying ORs based on pathologic risk variables.Results:Incidence of iHCC was 4.8% (n = 15) and overall recurrence 12.9% (cHCC 15.4% and iHCC 7%; P = 0.39). Variables included in the RPS were: microvascular invasion OR 17.8 (1.78-178.97; P = 0.014: 2 points), neural invasion OR 15.5 (1.13-212.17; P = 0.04: 1.5 points), nuclear grade > II OR 9.3 (1.17-74.84; P = 0.035: 1 point), and beyond Up-to 7 criteria OR 13.1 (1.66-103.67; P = 0.015: 1.5 points). Two risk groups were identified: low risk for recurrence (0-1 point) and intermediate-high risk groups (2-6 points). Low risk category remained an independent predictor of recurrence: OR 0.11 (0.01-0.67; P = 0.017); AUROC of 0.75 (0.54-0.96). A tendency towards more patients categorized as low risk group among iHCC patients was observed (69.2%; P = 0.13).Conclusions:In this series iHCC was not associated to lower risk of recurrence when compared to cHCC. We propose application of an RPS as a clinical tool for recurrence risk estimation.
