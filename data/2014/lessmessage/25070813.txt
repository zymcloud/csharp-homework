Objectives:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors and the third cause of cancer death worldwide. The development of HCC is a multi-pathway regulated process including a variety of genetic mutations and variations.Materials and methods:To get an insight into the overall genetic aberration, we analyzed the gene expression profile of 9 HCC samples and 9 normal liver tissues as control. Genes located in these two regions of 4p16.3 and 14q32.1 with gain or loss proceeded to in-depth analysis based on the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Through network analysis of these genes and pathways, molecules highly correlated with HCC and might be targeted for treatments were also hunted out.Results:Through this method, we found two MicroRNAs (miR-943 and miR-571) that never been reported in HCC samples before.Conclusions:Our study has introduced an effective method for cancer research and our work will greatly promote the genetic knowledge of HCC.
