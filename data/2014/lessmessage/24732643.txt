Background:Some prognostic evaluation systems were developed to postoperatively predict the outcome of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, mainly based on the cancer itself and the underlying liver diseases. However, none of these prognostic evaluation systems have so far been universally accepted. A simple and feasible scoring system is still lacking for the prediction of prognosis of HCC patients following resection. We aimed to uncover the correlation between the preoperative Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) and the clinical outcome of HCC patients after radical resection.Methods:The patients were separated into 3 subgroups on the basis of their GPSs. The prognostic significance of the GPS in the patient cohort was evaluated by survival analysis.Results:On univariate analysis, the levels of C-reactive protein and albumin, the Child-Pugh class, vascular invasion, tumor number, tumor size, the tumor/node/metastasis (TNM) stage, and the GPS were associated with overall survival and time to recurrence of HCC patients after radical resection. On multivariate analysis, the tumor size, albumin level, and GPS were independently associated with the outcome of HCC postoperatively.Conclusion:The GPS is an independent biomarker for prognostic prediction of HCC following radical resection.
