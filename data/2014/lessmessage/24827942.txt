We aimed to review our experience with the clinical characteristics and outcome in childhood liver tumors. We investigated the clinical, laboratory and pathological characteristics, treatments and outcome in hepatoblastomas (HBL) and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). We identified 91 HBL and 42 HCC cases. Distant metastases were detected in 16% of HBLs and 22% of HCCs. PRETEXT stages were I/II in 34% and III/IV in 66% of HBLs and I/II in 16% and III/IV in 84% of HCCs. Most cases received cisplatin + doxorubicin chemotherapy. At a median of 58 months, 90 cases had died, 28 were alive, and 15 were lost to follow-up. Five-year survival rates were 32.4% for all HBLs and 15.6% for HCCs. Five-year survival rates were 47% in HBLs and 22.8% in HCCs diagnosed after 1990. In HBLs, distant metastases and absence of chemotherapy response indicated poor prognosis. Prognosis for childhood liver tumors has improved over the last two decades with preoperative chemotherapy with cisplatin + doxorubicin. Surgical resectability is important for cure. For HCC, more effective chemotherapy approaches are essential.
