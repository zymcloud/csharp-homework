Liver regeneration is a unique means of studying cell proliferation in vivo. Screening of a large cDNA library from regenerating liver has previously allowed us to identify and characterize a cluster of genes encoding proteins with important roles in proliferative processes. Here, by examining different rat and human tissues as well as cell lines, we characterized a highly conserved gene, guanylyl cyclase domain containing 1 (GUCD1), whose modulation occurs in liver regeneration and cell cycle progression in vitro. High-level expression of GUCD1 transcripts was observed in livers from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. A yeast two-hybrid interaction assay, aimed at identifying any relevant interaction partners of GUCD1, revealed direct interactions with NEDD4-1 (E3 ubiquitin protein ligase neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated gene 4), resulting in control of GUCD1 stability. Thus, we have characterized expression and function of a ubiquitous protein, GUCD1, which might have a role in regulating normal and abnormal cell growth in the liver.
