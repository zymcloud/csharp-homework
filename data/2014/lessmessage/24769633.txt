We present a case of a 69-year-old man with primary hepatic carcinosarcoma who underwent computed tomography that revealed a hypervascular hepatic tumor with local dense calcification. Gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging revealed hyperintense lesions in the hepatobiliary phase that indicated hepatocellular carcinoma with bile production. The patient underwent right lobectomy, and the presence of a sarcoma component within the tumor on histopathology confirmed liver carcinosarcoma that included hepatocellular carcinoma. In cases with atypical images that resemble this case, the hyperintensity of a lesion in the hepatobiliary phase aids differential diagnosis.
