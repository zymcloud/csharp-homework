Background and study aims:Alfa fetoprotein (AFP) is widely used as a surveillance test for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with liver cirrhosis (LC). However, the clinical use of AFP has been shown to present some important limitations in sensitivity and specificity. Osteopontin (OPN) is a secreted matrix glycoprotein that is emerging as a significant protein in the biology of HCC. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of plasma OPN compared with that of AFP in the diagnosis of HCC among hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related LC.Patients and methods:Plasma levels of OPN and AFP were measured in 69 Egyptian patients with HCV-related LC (35 with HCC and 34 without HCC) and 20 healthy controls.Results:Both median AFP and OPN levels were significantly higher in the HCC group compared to LC and healthy control groups (pConclusion:OPN is a promising tumour marker which could be used as a screening test for the diagnosis of HCC in patients with LC and, hence, improves the prognosis and survival rate of these patients. The association of OPN with the multiplicity of focal lesions and portal vein invasion suggests an additional prognostic value.
