Background:Advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has an extremely poor prognosis although sorafenib, which is the treatment of choice, has provided survival benefits. Among advanced diseases, liver-confined HCC, which invades the vasculature without extrahepatic metastasis, requires novel therapeutic management beyond using sorafenib alone. Currently, the Korean Liver Cancer Study Group and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend combined radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy for some selected cases. For advanced liver-confined HCC, focal liver irradiation, RT technological development, and optimal selection of RT-suitable patients enable clinicians to use RT-involving multimodality treatments based on oncologic principles, such as concurrent chemoradiotherapy, which represent effective multimodality treatments for several types of malignancy.Summary:In this review, we discuss the need to develop novel therapeutic approaches for liver-confined HCC and clinical applications of RT-involving multimodality treatments for advanced liver-confined HCC.Conclusion:RT-involving multimodality treatments can enhance the overall therapeutic successes for advanced liver-confined HCC and also provide potential cures to some patients via conversion to a resectable condition.
