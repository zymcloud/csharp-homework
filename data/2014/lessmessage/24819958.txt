Background:Secondary biliary carcinomas are associated with persistent reflux cholangitis after bilioenterostomy. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been a target for cancer prevention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the chemopreventive efficacy of long-term treatment with a selective COX-2 inhibitor medication during the natural course after bilioenterostomy without chemical induction.Methods:Syrian golden hamsters which underwent choledochojejunostomy were randomly divided into two groups: the control group (n = 31), which was fed a normal diet, and the etodolac group (n = 33), which was fed 0.01% etodolac (a selective COX-2 inhibitor) mixed in the meal. The hamsters were killed at the postoperative weeks 20-39, 40-59, 60-79, or 80-100. Biliary neoplasms, cholangitis, proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling index (PCNA-LI) of the biliary epithelium, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production were evaluated.Results:The occurrence rates of biliary neoplasm were 43.8 and 15.2% in the control and etodolac groups, respectively (p < 0.05). The incidence of biliary neoplasm increased as time progressed in the control group, whereas it remained at a low level throughout the experimental period in the etodolac group. PGE2 products tended to be lower in the etodolac group, and PCNA-LI was significantly lower in the etodolac group (p < 0.01). These results suggest that the medication etodolac suppresses cell proliferation of the biliary epithelium, thereby preventing biliary carcinogenesis.Conclusions:Etodolac is expected to prevent secondary biliary carcinogenesis caused by persistent reflux cholangitis after bilioenterostomy.
