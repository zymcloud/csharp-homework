This article presents an analysis of a recently published study of the survival experience among a group of patients treated for hepatitis C with advanced hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis, divided into groups based on whether or not sustained virological response was achieved. The purpose is to evaluate the magnitude of excess mortality relative to a comparison population. The potential errors inherent in generating mock age/sex distributions from limited published data are also highlighted.
