Objective:To determine appropriate imaging criteria for early response evaluation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) using drug-eluting beads.Methods:Seventy-six patients who underwent TACE with drug-eluting beads as a first-line treatment were included. Responses at 1 month after treatment were evaluated by comparing contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging performed before TACE. Evaluations were performed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), modified RECIST (mRECIST), and Choi criteria. Correlation with progression-free survival (PFS) was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.Results:Modified RECIST yielded a significant difference in PFS across the different response categories (P Conclusion:Application of mRECIST criteria at the 1-month follow-up computed tomography may be a reliable early predictor of outcome response in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with TACE using drug-eluting beads.
