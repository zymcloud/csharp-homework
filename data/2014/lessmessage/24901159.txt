Background/aims:To assess the perfusion parameters and angiogenesis of HCC using dynamic contrast enhanced(DCE) MR and to correlate it with histopathologic findings in an experimental rat model.Methodology:Twenty rats were continuously infused with diethylnitrosamine (DEN) for tumor induction. After 32 to 36 weeks of DEN treatment, the rats underwent MRI of the liver with a 3-T MR imaging system. Perfusion parametric maps and perfusion parameters such as, time to peak (TTP) and peak enhancement (PE) were obtained by using a commercially available software package. The nodules were correlated precisely to DCE MR images.Results:A total of 13 nodules were found in 12 rats; 5 dysplastic nodule (DN)s were identified in 5 rats and 8 HCCs (3 Edmonson grade I, 2 Edmonson grade I-II, 3 Edmonson grade II) were found in 7 rats. There were significant differences in mean values of PE and HPH (histogram peak height) of PE between DN and HCC. Mean value and HPH of PE showed statistically significant correlation with tumor grade.Conclusions:There were significant differences in perfusion parameters between DN and HCC. DCE MR imaging can be used in the differential diagnosis and management of liver disease in hepatocarcinogenesis.
