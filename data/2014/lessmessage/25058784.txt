A 59-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital because of a 1-month history of dysphagia. Endoscopic examination revealed a superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and a giant gastric tumor. Computed tomography showed that the gastric tumor was directly invading the liver and pancreas. Because of the risk of the gastric tumor causing obstruction and bleeding, we performed a subtotal esophagectomy, proximal gastrectomy, left lateral segmentectomy of liver, and pancreatosplenectomy with gastric tube reconstruction. Final pathological findings were superficial esophageal carcinoma penetrating the muscularis mucosae with an intramural gastric metastasis directly invading the liver and pancreas. The patient received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, yet died 8 months postoperatively of complications of local recurrence. Early-stage esophageal carcinoma with intramural gastric metastasis is very rare. To our knowledge, this is the first case of mucosal esophageal carcinoma with intramural gastric metastasis directly invading other organs.
Direct invasion; Intramural gastric metastasis; Mucosal esophageal carcinoma.
