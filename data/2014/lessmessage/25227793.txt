Background:This retrospective study aimed to validate the safety and effectiveness of hepatectomy for huge hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Data of patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC between January 2006 and December 2012 were reviewed. The patients were divided into three groups: huge HCC(≥ 10 cm in diameter), large HCC(≥ 5 butResults:Characteristics of pre-operative patients in all three groups were homogeneously distributed except for alpha fetal protein (AFP)(pConclusions:The safety of hepatectomy for huge HCC is similar to that for large and small HCC; and this approach for huge HCC may achieve similar long-term survival and disease-free survival as for large HCC.
