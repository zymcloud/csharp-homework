Background:Most developing regions of the world are undergoing gradual epidemiological transition resulting in high burden of both communicable and noncommunicable diseases. This affects the pattern of death in this region.Objective:The objective of this study is to determine the causes of death in the medical wards of the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Ituku/Ozalla, Enugu, South-East Nigeria from 1995 to 2010.Materials and methods:Data were collected retrospectively from January 1995 to December 2010.Statistical analysis used:Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) version 17.0 was used. Simple descriptive statistics were done. Student's t-test was used to compare means of continuous variables, while Chi-square test was used to test significance of differences between two proportions.Results:The mortality rate was 22.8% (6250/27,514) admissions. The male to female ratio was 1.7:1. Infections (20.2%) were the most common cause of death. However, chronic kidney disease was the single most common disease entity causing death (12.3%). Other important causes of death in order of prevalence were cerebrovascular accident (10.5%), acquired immune deficiency syndrome and tuberculosis either alone or as co-infection (10.3%), heart failure (8.8%), chronic liver disease (7.0%), septicemia (6.5%), respiratory failure (5.3%), diabetes mellitus (4.6%), cardiac arrhythmias (2.9%), and primary liver cell carcinoma (2.7%). There were few deaths from tetanus, malaria, typhoid fever, and coronary artery disease.Conclusion:Mortality is high in our medical wards and reflects the emerging trend of mixed disease spectrum comprising communicable and noncommunicable diseases.
