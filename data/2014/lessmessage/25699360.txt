Background/aims:Hematogenous recurrences of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have dismal prognoses, but prognostic heterogeneity exists in this disease. The objectives of this study were to clarify the prognosis in this disease with regard to the initial recurrence site and to define the prognostic factors.Methodology:We retrospectively reviewed the cases of 67 consecutive patients with hematogenous recurrence in major organs after esophagectomy for ESCC of the thoracic esophagus and the esophagogastric junction. We analyzed clinicopathological characteristics, survival probability, and potential prognostic factors.Results:Lung, liver, bone, and multiple-organ metastases occurred in 24, 19, 14, and 10 patients, respectively. Twenty-seven patients simultaneously had locoregional recurrence (combined recurrence). Among all 67 patients, the median disease-free interval (DFI) was 9.7 months, and the median survival time after the initial recurrence was 4.9 months. The patients with initial lung metastasis had most favorable prognosis with the median survival time of 9.8 months. A multivariate analysis identified that initial recurrence site, DFI, combined recurrence, and anti-cancer therapy were independent prognostic factors.Conclusions:The initial recurrence site contributes to the prognostic heterogeneity of patients with hematogenous recurrence of ESCC. The prognostic factors identified in this study are useful to optimize the management of these patients.
