Mostly disease has a benign process, but in some radical case might lead to cirrhosis or even to cancer. There is a demand on specific researches about NFLD, cause knowledge about pathogenesis and epidemiology is not clear. The aim of this researches is to rate frequency of occurring nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in obese type II and III patients with reference to patients with correct body weight.Material and methods:Research group comprise 70 patients of Clinical Health Resort Hospital in Ciechocinek with BMI higher than 35. Control group comprise 20 patients with BMI lower than 30. In case of all patients fatty liver qualities were rate by ultrasounds scaning examination. For additional diagnostic following parameters were rated: liver enzyme ASPAT/ALAT levels, lipids level, glycemic level before and after meal.Results:In case of 52 patients from research group fatty liver qualities were noticed, it is about 65% of whole group. Much more often fatty liver qualities had been noticed about patients witch III degree of obese (94%). In control group we didn't notice fatty liver qualities in any patients. ALAT level was statistical relevant (p = 0.0006) higher in research group (32 U/l) then level in control group (20,3 U/I). ASPAT level in research group amounted to 28.7 U/l and in control group only 19.8 U/l. Difference between those two group was statistical relevant (p = 0.0005).Conclusion:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease occur average in case of 65% obese patients but in cease of patients with III degree obese is about 94%. That disease ought to be treated like a complication of obese.
