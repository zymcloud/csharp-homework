Background:Occludin and claudins are integral constituents of tight junction proteins and are de-regulated in various malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study investigated whether expression of claudins 1, 4, 5, 7 and occludin may be used as prognostic markers for overall and disease-free survival in patients with HCC after hepatectomy.Patients and methods:The study included 67 hepatectomy specimens obtained from an equal number of patients with HCC who underwent partial hepatectomy at the Patras University Hospital for therapeutic reasons. Ten normal liver tissues were used as controls. Expression of claudins 1, 4, 5, 7 and occludin in liver tissues was assessed by immunochemistry. Clinicopathological features were also available for each case.Results:Expression of claudins 1, 4, 5, 7 and occludin was significantly increased in HCC specimens compared to non-neoplastic liver tissues and normal controls (pConclusion:The present study demonstrates that high expression of claudins 1, 4, 5 and down-regulation of claudin-7 are positive prognostic markers and are associated with good outcome and increased survival rates. Moreover, an increase in claudin-4 expression may serve as an independent positive prognostic factor for low recurrence rate after hepatectomy.
