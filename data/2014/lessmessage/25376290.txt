Objectives:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly vascularized tumor. In this study, we investigated the prognostic and predictive values of proangiogenic factors in HCC patients receiving radiotherapy.Methods:Between September 2008 and December 2009, a total of 50 patients treated with radiotherapy were prospectively enrolled in this study. Serum and urine samples were collected Results:After completion of radiotherapy, serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/platelet (Plt) levels were significantly increased (p Conclusions:In HCC patients receiving radiotherapy, levels of VEGF/Plt and MMP-2 before radiotherapy can be useful to predict treatment outcome. This study also suggests the necessity of anti-angiogenic therapy, such as sorafenib, since radiotherapy increases VEGF/Plt levels, and higher levels of VEGF/Plt are associated with a poor outcome.
