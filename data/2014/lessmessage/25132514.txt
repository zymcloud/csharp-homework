Due to the growing incidence of diabetes in developed nations, there is a compelling case to be made for teaching graduate students more deeply about mechanisms underlying this disease. Diabetes is associated with enhanced oxidative stress and protein glycation via the covalent binding of glucose molecules. Albumin represents the major plasmatic protein and undergoes enhanced glycoxidative modifications in diabetic condition. La Réunion Island, a French department located in the Indian Ocean exhibit a growing incidence of diabetes. At the University of La Réunion, our research group named GEICO (Groupe d'Etude sur l'Inflammation Chronique et l'Obésité) participated to foster research and training in diabetes context and focuses on the impact of glycated albumin mediated oxidative stress on cell physiopathology. A laboratory course was designed by our group to introduce graduate students to cutting edge techniques in redox biology while providing insights into scientific processes and methods. This two weeks research laboratory training took place at CYROI, a local biotechnology center that provides advanced facilities for research, business, and education. Using histochemistry, molecular biology, biochemical techniques, student investigated oxidative damages in liver from leptin receptor deficient diabetic mice compared to control littermates. In addition, they used an in vitro model by assaying oxidative impact of glycated albumin on hepatoma carcinoma HepG2 cells. This article gives an overview of the organization and protocol used by the students during their two weeks training in the laboratory. Therefore, it may be helpful for teaching graduate students techniques used in research laboratory working on redox biology.
