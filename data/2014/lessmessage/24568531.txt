Objective:To validate the relationship between MACC1 and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2, 6 bisphosphatase (PFKFB2) expression as well as its clinicopathological features and prognostic significance in hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:By using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the MACC1 and PFKFB2 protein expression in 60 pairs of hepatocellular carcinoma and corresponding non-tumor tissues. Using the Mann-Whitney U test, the Chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox proportional hazard regression analysis and Spearman analysis, we studied the relationship between MACC1 and PFKFB2 protein expression and postoperative overall survival (OS) of the HCC patients.Results:MACC1 and PFKFB2 positive staining rates were significantly higher in hepatocellular carcinoma than in the corresponding nontumor tissues (P=0.012 and 0.04, respectively). The clinicopathological features evaluation revealed that positive expression of MACC1 was associated with a high Edmondson classification (P=0.007) and advanced TNM stage (P=0.027). Similar findings were evident for PFKFB2 expression (P=0.002 and P=0.027). MACC1 and PFKFB2 positive expression was associated with a lower OS rate (P=0.004 and 0.03, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox proportional hazard regression analyses revealed MACC1 positive expression to be a prognostic factor for postoperative OS, but PFKFB was not.Conclusion:Highly expressed MACC1 and PFKFB2 protein were associated with TNM stage, Edmondson -Steier classification and overall survival. MACC1 may affect tumor metabolism partly through expression and phophorylation of PFKFB2.
