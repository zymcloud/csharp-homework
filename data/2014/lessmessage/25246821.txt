Objective:To compare gadoxetic acid injection rates of 0.5 mL/s and 1 mL/s for hepatic arterial-phase magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.Materials and methods:In this prospective study, 101 consecutive patients with suspected focal liver lesions were included and randomly divided into two groups. Each group underwent dynamic liver MR imaging using a 3.0-T scanner after an intravenous injection of gadoxetic acid at rates of either 0.5 mL/s (n = 50) or 1 mL/s (n = 51). Arterial phase images were analyzed after blinding the injection rates. The signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the liver, aorta, portal vein, hepatic vein, spleen, and pancreas were measured. The contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of the hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) were calculated. Finally, two experienced radiologists were independently asked to identify, if any, HCCs in the liver on the images and score the image quality in terms of the presence of artifacts and the proper enhancement of the liver, aorta, portal vein, hepatic vein, hepatic artery, spleen, pancreas, and kidney.Results:The SNRs were not significantly different between the groups (p = 0.233-0.965). The CNRs of the HCCs were not significantly different (p = 0.597). The sensitivity for HCC detection and the image quality scores were not significantly different between the two injection rates (p = 0.082-1.000).Conclusion:Image quality and sensitivity for hepatic HCCs of arterial-phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR were not significantly improved by reducing the contrast injection rate to 0.5 mL/s compared with 1 mL/s.
