Objective:The supplementation of oral branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) granules is known to improve energy metabolism in cirrhotic patients, but not those with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to clarify whether BCAA granules improve energy metabolism in HCC patients after radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Methods:We performed a prospective cohort study (UMIN000004624) involving 40 HCC patients who underwent RFA at Kobe University Hospital. Indirect calorimetry and urinary/blood biochemical examinations were performed before and seven days after RFA. Blood biochemical examinations were also conducted three months after RFA. The patients treated with and without BCAA supplementation were compared, and univariate factors were statistically examined.Results:The non-protein respiratory quotient (npRQ) and albumin levels before RFA were significantly lower in the BCAA group than in the control group (p=0.024 and 0.005). The npRQ ratio (seven days after/before RFA) was significantly higher in the BCAA group than in the control group (p=0.019). In addition, the albumin ratio (three months after/before RFA) was significantly higher in the BCAA group than in the control group (p=0.018).Conclusion:Supplementation with BCAA granules improves energy metabolism in addition to the liver function after RFA. Improvements in the liver function may result in consistently adequate treatment for HCC recurrence after RFA.
