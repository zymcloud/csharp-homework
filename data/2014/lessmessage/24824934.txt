Distal-less homeobox gene 4 (DLX4) has been shown to play a role in carcinogenesis. The value of DLX4 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been fully investigated. Here, we sought to quantify the expression of DLX4 in association with the clinicopathological features and prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We examined DLX4 expression in 45 HCC tissues and matched adjacent noncancerous tissues by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. Furthermore, 226 HCC samples were analyzed for DLX4 expression by immunohistochemistry. The expression of DLX4 was significantly elevated in HCC tissues in comparison with that in adjacent non-cancerous tissues (P
