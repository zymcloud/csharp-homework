Crude rates, age-specific rates of cancer incidence and annual percent change were calculated.Results:The total newly diagnosed cancer cases (n=6,889) comprised 4,341 males (63.0%) and 2,540 females (36.9%). Gastric cancer was the most common GI tract cancer with an ASR (per 105) of 23.1 for males and 7.69 for females. The ASRs for esophageal and colorectal cancers were 9.69 and 11.2 in males and 7.35 and 8.93 in females. Trend analysis showed a significant decline for esophageal cancer and increasing incidence for colorectal cancer in females.Conclusions:The prevalence of gastric cancer is high in East Azerbaijan province of Iran.
