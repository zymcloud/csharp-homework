In recent years, the use of diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI) has increased for the diagnosis of focal liver lesions (FLLs). DW-MRI may help in the differentiation of benign and malignant FLLs by measuring the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. Unfortunately, liver metastases present different histopathologic features with variable MRI signals within each lesion; this histologic variability explains the intra- and inter-lesion variations of ADC measurements. We present the case of a 64-year-old female with diagnosis of liver metastasis from small cell lung carcinoma admitted to the emergency unit due to symptoms of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Quantitative comparison of two liver MRI, on admission and 2-months after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization showed persistence of the hyperintense metastatic lesions with significant difference in the ADC values in the with-in metastatic lesions (p = 0.001) and between normal tissue and liver metastases only at the end of treatment (p < 0.001). Several publications state that DWMRI is capable to predict the response to chemotherapy in malignant tumors, the histologic variability of liver metastasis and their response to different treatments is reflected in intra- and inter-lesion variations of ADC measurements that might delay an accurate imaging diagnosis. We present evidence of this variability, which might encourage prospective clinical trials that would define better cut-off values, would help understand the ADC biological behaviour, and would reach consensus about the best acquisition parametersfor this promising quantitative biomarker.
