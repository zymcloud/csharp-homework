Rectal cancers may rarely metastasize in bone and when it occurs, is usually preceded by lung and/or liver metastasis. However, whether it may ever bypasses other organs, particularly lung and liver and metastasizes directly to bone or not, is debatable. Some authors have described the presence of isolated bone metastasis from colo-rectal cancers, whereas others have questioned its' existence in the absence of lung or liver metastasis. A case of isolated bone metastasis from rectal cancer in the absence of lung or liver metastasis is reported here.
