Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health problem and a leading cause of chronic liver disease. Chronic HCV infection often follows a progressive course over years and can result in cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and need for liver transplantation. In the United States alone, the estimated prevalence of HCV infection is up to 5.1 million persons. The optimal approach to detecting HCV infection is to screen persons for possible history of risks of exposure to virus and to test those selected individuals with risk factors. Both host and viral factors may be important contributors to the natural history of HCV. Currently, effective pharmacologic therapy are available to induce sustained virologic response (SVR) or virologic "cure," which results in improved morbidity and mortality. Patient education before treatment is essential and should include a full discussion of potential side effects. It is important to work collaboratively and closely with patients to ensure early recognition of adverse events and to effectively manage them in order to ensure treatment compliance. This paper provides a thorough overview on screening for the diagnosis, clinical management, and treatment indications and contraindications for chronic hepatitis C.
