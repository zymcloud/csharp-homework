Background and aim:Sorafenib is recommended as a standard treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The efficacy and safety of sorafenib as a first-line therapy in Korean patients with advanced HCC were investigated.Methods:From 2007 to 2012, 86 patients with advanced HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C) treated with sorafenib as a first-line therapy were enrolled from five tertiary hospitals. Predictors of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed.Results:The median age was 59.5 years, and 71 (82.6%) were males; 57 (66.3%) patients were in Child-Pugh class A. The median OS and PFS were 5.0 (range 4.0-5.9) and 3.2 (range 2.6-3.7) months, respectively. Regarding OS, Child-Pugh class A (6.0 vs 2.8 months), tumor diameter Conclusions:Because the efficacy of sorafenib seems marginal in Korean patients with treatment-na√Øve HCC, how to select candidates with favorable outcomes should be further investigated.
