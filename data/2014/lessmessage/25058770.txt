We describe the case of a patient with a diaphragmatic hernia associated with radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma who was successfully treated by laparoscopic surgery. A 62-year-old man with a long history of hepatitis C-induced liver cirrhosis was admitted to our institution because of recurrent postprandial periumbilical pain. Eight years earlier, he had undergone radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma at hepatic segment VIII. Computed tomography, gastrografin enema examination revealed transverse colon obstruction because of a diaphragmatic hernia. We diagnosed diaphragmatic hernia associated with the prior radiofrequency ablation treatment. The patient underwent laparoscopic repair of the diaphragmatic hernia. Though the patient experienced the recurrence once, relaparoscopic treatment has improved the patient's conditions. Thus, diaphragmatic hernia can develop as a complication of radiofrequency ablation treatment. A laparoscopic approach is safe, feasible, and minimally invasive, even in patients with cirrhosis who develop iatrogenic diaphragmatic hernia as a complication of radiofrequency ablation treatment.
