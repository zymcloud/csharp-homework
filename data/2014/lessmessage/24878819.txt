NHERF1 (Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger regulatory factor) is a scaffolding protein, consists of two tandem PDZ domains linked to a carboxyl-terminal ezrin-binding region. NHERF1 recruits macromolecular complexes at the apical membrane of epithelial cells in many epithelial tissues. It is involved in trafficking and regulation of transmembrane ion transporters and G protein-coupled receptors. Further, NHERF1 also linked other molecules involved in cell growth and cancer progression, such as PDGFR, PTEN, β-catenin, EGFR and HER2/neu. In this review, we focus on the role of NHERF1 during cancer development. Evidences of its involvement in cancer development are present in hepatocellular carcinoma, schwannoma, glioblastoma, colorectal cancer and particularly in breast cancer. Recent findings obtained from our laboratory show that cytoplasmic NHERF1 expression increases gradually in breast cancer during carcinogenesis, and its overexpression is associated with aggressive clinical parameters, unfavourable prognosis, and increased tumor hypoxia. Interestingly, also nuclear NHERF1 expression seems to play a role both in carcinogenesis and progression of colorectal cancer. These data suggest that NHERF1 could be a new biomarker of advanced malignancies.
