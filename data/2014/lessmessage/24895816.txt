Background/aims:Treatment of multiple hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a critical issue. In addition, the prognosis and prognostic factors of multiple HCC after hepatic resection are rarely prospectively documented.Methodology:The clinicopathologic and follow-up data of 81 patients who underwent curative resection of HCC between January 2008 and January 2009 were prospectively collected. Patients were categorized according to the size of the largest tumor: group A (n = 40, two or three HCCs with maximum tumor diameter > 3 cm and Results:The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year survival rates of group A were 75.0%, 58.0%, 50.0%, and 44.0%, respectively, while the survival rates of group B were 93.0%, 80.0%, 66.0%, and 47.0%, respectively. The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year disease-free survival rates of group A were 43.0%, 30.0%, 23.0%, and 15.0%, respectively, comparing to 71.0%, 54.0%, 44.0%, and 36.0% in group B, respectively. The median overall cumulative survival time of group A and group B were 36.0 and 44.5 months, respectively (P = 0.322). The median disease-free survival time of group A was 10.0 months and was significantly shorter than that of group B (30.0 months, P = 0.011).Conclusions:Resection may provide comparative survival benefits even for patients with multiple HCCs with maximum tumor diameter > 3 cm and
