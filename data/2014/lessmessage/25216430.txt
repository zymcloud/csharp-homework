Central bisegmentectomy (CBS) of the liver is an en bloc hepatic resection of Couiaud segments 4, 5, and 8. The indications for CBS include benign and malignant tumors occupying both the left medial and right anterior segments. However, CBS has rarely been reported. Here, we investigate CBS in patients with suboptimal liver function for whom an extended lobectomy is not an optimal solution. Each case was 1 of 8 patients who underwent CBS for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) at the Department of Surgery, Jikei University Hospital. Indications for CBS consisted of CRLM in 3 patients and HCC in 5 patients. The median duration of operation was 552 minutes, and median blood loss was 2263 g. No postoperative nor in-hospital mortalities occurred. In this study, 1-, 2-, and 3-year disease-free survival rates were 62.5%, 12.5%, and 12.5%, respectively, and 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival rates were 100%, 100%, and 85.7%, respectively. CBS is advocated for central liver tumors in patients with suboptimal liver function for whom extended lobectomy could result in less than optimal remnant liver volume and function.
