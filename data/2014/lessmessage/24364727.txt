Dietary isoprenic derivatives such as β-ionone (βI) are a promising class of chemopreventive agents. In this study, cellular aspects of βI protective activities during early hepatocarcinogenesis were evaluated. Male Wistar rats were submitted to "resistant hepatocyte" model and then received daily 16 mg/100 g body weight (b.w.) of βI (βI group) or only 0.25 mL/100 g b.w. of corn oil (vehicle, control group [CO]) during 4 wk, specifically during early promotion phase. Compared to controls, βI inhibited (P
