Hepatoblastoma (HB) is a rare malignant tumour of the liver and usually occurs in the first three years of life. Hepatoblastoma in adolescents and young adults is extremely rare; nevertheless the prognosis is much worse than in childhood, because these kinds of tumours are usually diagnosed late. Characteristic imaging and histopathological and AFP levels help in the diagnosis of hepatoblastoma. Paraneoplastic features of hepatoblastoma are not uncommon at presentation and include erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis, hypocalcaemia, isosexual precocious puberty, and rarely hypoglycaemia. Even though hypoglycaemia is commonly seen in hepatocellular carcinoma, its association with hepatoblastoma is very rare. We present a case of 15-year-old male patient presenting with complaints of recurrent hypoglycaemic seizures ultimately leading to diagnosis of hepatoblastoma. Managed successfully with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with adriamycin and cisplatin based regimens. An extensive review of literature in the PubMed and MEDLINE did not reveal much data on paraneoplastic recurrent hypoglycaemic seizures as an initial presentation of hepatoblastomas in adolescents and young adults.
