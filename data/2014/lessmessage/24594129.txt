Objective:To evaluate trends in the distribution of care for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the past decade.Design:Retrospective study.Method:We collected data on diagnostic testing and initial treatment of patients with HCC in the period 2003-2011 from the Dutch Cancer Registry.Results:In the period 2003-2011, 2915 patients were diagnosed with HCC. The proportion of patients given palliative treatment increased significantly, whereas the proportion of patients treated by resection remained stable (approximately 10%). Tumour biopsies were performed in virtually all hospitals. Despite a significant decrease seen in the period studied, tumour biopsy was still performed in more than 50% of cases. The number of hospitals where any treatment was performed increased significantly (from 33% to 62% of all hospitals) and the contribution of treatments in academic hospitals decreased significantly (from 83% to 75%). Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and resection were mainly performed in academic hospitals (99%, 95% and 79% respectively), whereas about half of the initial sorafenib treatments were given in non-academic hospitals. Only in a few academic hospitals were a minimum of five resections performed annually and (only during the last three years of the period studied) were a minimum of five patients started on sorafenib annually. Significant differences existed between regions in the use of RFA or TACE - both p Conclusion:In the past decade there was no trend towards centralization of diagnostic testing and treatments for patients with HCC.
