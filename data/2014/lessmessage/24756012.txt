Background:Cirrhotic patients are prone to having bacterial infections due to impaired innate immunity. This nationwide population-based study aimed to identify the effect of bacterial infections on the mortality of the cirrhotic patients with esophageal variceal bleeding (EVB).Material and methods:The Taiwan National Health Insurance Database was used to collect data about the cirrhotic patients receiving endoscopic procedures for EVB between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2004. The enrolled patients were followed up individually for one year to identify their 6-week and 1-year mortalities.Results:Of the 2,053 cirrhotic patients with EVB, 318 (15.5 %) were diagnosed with bacterial infections. Compared to non-infection group, the adjusted hazard rations (HRs) of bacterial infection for 6-week and 1-year mortalities were 2.69 (2.06-3.52) and 1.89 (1.56-2.28), respectively. Compared to non-infection group, the HRs of pneumonia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, urinary tract infection, and sepsis without specific focus (SWSF) were 3.54, 1.91, 1.04, and 3.95 for 6-week mortality, and 3.18, 1.52, 1.15, and 2.23 for 1-year mortality of cirrhotic patients with EVB.Conclusions:In cirrhotic patients with EVB, bacterial infections increase 2.7 folds of 6-week mortality and 1.9 folds of 1-year mortality. Of all infections, pneumonia and SWSF contributed higher risks for mortality.
