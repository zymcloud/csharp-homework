Objective:To evaluate the sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:MRIs performed within 120 days of transplant, and pathology, were reviewed.Results:Of the 87 patients included in the final analysis, 58 had HCC at explant (106 total HCCs). The per-patient and per-lesion sensitivity was 74.1% (43/58) and 81.1% (86/106), respectively. The sensitivity based on size 2 cm was 80.0% (28/35), 77.2% (44/57), and 100% (14/14).Conclusion:MRI accurately detects HCC, including HCCs
