There is evidence that Hirsutella sinensis may have antitumor activity. The aim of the present study was to determine the anti-hepatoma effects and food safety assessment of Hirsutella sinensis mycelium in vivo and in vitro. Effects on mutagenicity were determined using a bacterial reverse mutation assay employing the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA102, TA1535 and TA1537. There were no dose-dependent increases or decreases in the number of colonies both with and without metabolic S9 activation in Ames tests. Mice were inoculated with SK-Hep 1 cells and those developing tumors were treated with three different concentrations of Hirsutella sinensis mycelium. After six weeks, blood samples were collected and liver pathology was determined. Aspartate aminotransferase levels were significantly different only in the low-dose treatment group (106±27 IU/l, p=0.048), compared to the control group (162±80 IU/l). The tumor weight was significantly different only in the low-dose treatment group. We found that necrosis, hemorrhage and calcifications were presented in both control and experimental groups. Inhibition of tumor growth was observed only at the lowest dose.
