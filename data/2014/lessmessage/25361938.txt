Inflammatory pseudotumor (IPT) is an uncommon, benign lesion of unclear etiology, which is sometimes associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). In this study, we discuss a case of hepatic EBV positive IPT and discuss mimickers, prognosis, and treatment. The case we describe was located in the liver and composed of a mixture of spindle cells and polymorphic inflammatory cells with areas of necrosis. The spindle cells were negative for CAM5.2, ALK1, CD21, CD23, CD35, actin, S-100, and CD34. EBV-encoded small RNA in situ hybridization showed a large number of EBV positive cells. The diagnosis of hepatic EBV positive IPT with uncertain biological behavior was issued, presenting numerous difficulties with diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.
