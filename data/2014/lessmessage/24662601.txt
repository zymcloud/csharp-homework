The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of 6-shogaol on tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP)-induced oxidative stress leading to apoptosis in human hepatoma cell line HepG2. The cells were exposed to tBHP (100 μmol/l) after pretreatment with 6-shogaol (2.5 and 5 μmol/l), and then cell viability was measured. 6-Shogaol fully prevented HepG2 cell death caused by tBHP. Treatment of tBHP resulted in apoptotic cell death as assessed by TUNEL assay and the expression of apoptosis regulator proteins, Bcl-2 family, caspases and cytochrome c. Cells treated with 6-shogaol showed rapid reduction of apoptosis by restoring these markers of apoptotic cells. In addition, 6-shogaol significantly recovered disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential as a start sign of hepatic apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. In line with this observation, antioxidative 6-shogaol inhibited generation of reactive oxygen species and depletion of reduced glutathione in tBHP-stimulated HepG2 cells. Taken together, these results for the first time showed antioxidative and antiapoptotic activities of 6-shogaol in tBHP-treated hepatoma HepG2 cells, suggesting that 6-shogaol could be beneficial in hepatic disorders caused by oxidative stress.
