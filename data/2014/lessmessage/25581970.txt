Aim:Multifactorial analysis of local and lymph node recurrences in stage 0-II breast cancer treated by conservative or radical surgery.Material and methods:In the interval January 1, 2005-July 31, 2013, 477 breast cancer patients were assessed by imaging techniques at the Radiology Clinic of Iasi "Sf. Spiridon" Hospital and Radiology Service of the Iasi Regional Cancer Institute. Of these 229 (48%) patients underwent conservative surgery and 248 (52%) patients radical surgery.Results:Local recurrences were 2.8 times more frequent in conservatively vs. radically treated patients, and lymph node recurrences 2 times more frequent in patients treated conservatively. Breast tumors larger than 3 cm in diameter were at higher risk for local and distant recurrence in lymph nodes.Conclusions:Assessment in patients with local and lymph nodes recurrences of the relative risk for developing other types of recurrences (bone, pleuro pulmonary, liver, brain metastases) indicated that these are a risk factor for other types of recurrences, influencing the prognosis of patients. Local recurrences showed a higher relative risk for other types of recurrences than nodal recurrences.
