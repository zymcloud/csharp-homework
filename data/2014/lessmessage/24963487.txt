New strategies for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are urgently needed. There is an increasing interest in using microRNAs (miRNAs) as biomarkers in diseases. In this study, we examined the expression of miR-21 in serum exosomes from patients with HCC or chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and investigated the potential clinical significance of miR-21. Quantitative RT-PCR indicated that the concentration of miR-21 was significantly higher in exosomes than in exosome-depleted supernatants or the whole serum. Further, the expression level of serum exosomal miR-21 was significantly higher in patients with HCC than those with CHB or healthy volunteers (P
