Ante-situm liver resection under hypothermic total vascular exclusion is used to resect large tumours that involve the hepatic veins close to the vena cava or the cava itself. This procedure traditionally requires venovenous bypass when it is necessary to clamp the cava, or portocaval shunt when caval continuity is maintained by piggyback dissection of the liver. We present a technique of ante-situm liver resection, operating on one side of the liver at a time while maintaining prograde portal flow through the opposite side of the liver, thereby avoiding venovenous bypass, portacaval shunt and portal vein reconstruction.
