Background/aims:This study was carried out to clarify the clinicopathological features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) arising in patients without viral infection and to confirm the influence of metabolic syndrome (MS) on characteristics in HCC patients.Methodology:Two hundred and thirty-three hepatectomized HCC patients were enrolled. The status of the hepatitis viral infection was defined; non-B non-C (NBNC) (n = 15), negative for HBs-Ag, HBc-Ab or HCV-Ab; HBV (n = 70); HCV (n = 148). We compared clinicopathological features and surgical outcomes among three groups. Additionally, fifty-six HCC patients who were evaluated on coexistence of MS were divided into two groups and analyzed; MS (n = 16) and non-MS (n = 40) groups.Results:In NBNC-patients, preoperative platelet counts and ICGR15 were significantly better compared to HCV-patients (21.8 x 10(4)/mm3 vs. 11.3 x 10(4)/mm3, 14.0% vs. 19.2%, p Conclusions:HCC with MS included more NBNC-HCC than HBV or HCV related HCC. Aggressive hepatectomy contributed to the favorable outcome in NBNC-patients because of their better liver function.
