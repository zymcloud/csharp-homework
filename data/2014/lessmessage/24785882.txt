Objective:Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis and thrombocytopenia are often excluded from receiving interferon therapy because the treatment results in severe platelet depletion. Surgical splenectomy or partial splenic embolization (PSE) is a promising procedure for increasing the platelet count before interferon therapy. We performed PSE and evaluated the long-term clinical course in HCV cirrhotic patients.Methods:Patients with HCV cirrhosis and thrombocytopenia were included (n=108) in this study. The straight-coiled PSE procedure (Takatsuka method) was performed. The platelet count, hemodynamic changes, rate of a sustained virological response (SVR) and prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were evaluated.Results:PSE resulted in a significant increase in the platelet count (before PSE: 7.9±2.3×10(4)/μL, two weeks after PSE: 16.7±6.6×10(4)/μL (pConclusion:PSE enabled the induction of regular-dose interferon therapy in patients with HCV cirrhosis and thrombocytopenia. Although the prevalence of HCC did not differ between the SVR+BR and NR patients, there was a significant survival benefit in the patients with SVR+BR.
