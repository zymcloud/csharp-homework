Background/aims:Mini-laparoscopy has, since its first description in 1998, proven to be a valuable diagnostic method in liver diseases. We re-evaluated the significance of mini-laparoscopy for diagnosis and staging of liver disease and primary liver and bile duct cancer.Patients and methods:1,788 consecutive patients who received a diagnostic mini-laparoscopy between 10/1998 and 06/2011 were included in this retrospective cohort study.Results:In chronic liver disease, cirrhosis was detected by mini-laparoscopy in 27% of cases. A comparison of microscopic versus macroscopic diagnosis of cirrhosis revealed a sampling error for histology alone of 21%. Macroscopic inspection of the liver surface contributed to the diagnosis of unknown liver diseases in approximately 38%. In patients with bile duct or liver cancer, mini-laparoscopy led to upstaging of the disease in 33 and 23%, respectively. Major complications (bowel perforation and delayed bleeding) occurred in 0.39% of cases.Conclusions:Mini-laparoscopy is a valuable procedure with significant diagnostic impact in known and unknown inflammatory and malignant liver diseases. It can be safely performed even in patients with acute liver failure and severe coagulopathy and the diagnostic value does not differ from diagnostic laparoscopy performed with standard instruments.
