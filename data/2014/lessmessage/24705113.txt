Background:Patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) have been reported to have sexual dysfunction irrespective of etiology. There is little or no report from Nigeria on this disorder. This study looked at sexual dysfunction among male patients with CLD.Materials and methods:Patients with chronic viral hepatitis B, liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were interviewed using the international index of erectile function questionnaire. Their responses were compared with an age and sex matched healthy controls. Bio-data and body mass index were obtained for both groups and liver disease severity was graded for patients using the Child-Pugh score. Analysis was done using SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA, 2004) for frequencies and means while comparison of means was done using Student's t-test. Significance level was put at P Results:There were 120 subjects consisting of 60 patients aged from 28 to 71 years; mean (SD) 45. 3 ± 9.4 and 60 controls aged from 29 to 79 years with mean (SD) 45.5 ± 10.1 years. Sexual dysfunctions were seen in patients with HCC and LC in the domains of sexual desire and sexual satisfaction respectively when compared with controls. When patients were divided into the various liver disease severities, patients in Child-Pugh Grade B scored low in the domain of arousal, whereas the domains of erectile functions, orgasm, resolution and satisfaction were affected in patients in Grade C when compared with controls.Conclusions:Male patients with CLD have significant sexual dysfunctions when compared with controls. The dysfunctions are more pronounced in those with Grade C liver disease. Sexual concerns of CLD should be inquired of in those with advanced liver disease.
