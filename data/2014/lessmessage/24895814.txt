Background/aims:Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) has a poor prognosis and usually presents as advanced disease. Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) is a promising option for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma; however, there have been few reports on the use of HAIC in patients with ICC. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of treatment with systemic gemcitabine (GEM) combined with HAIC with cisplatin (CDDP), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and isovorin in patients with advanced ICC.Methodology:Seven patients with advanced ICC, who received systemic GEM combined with HAIC with CDDP, 5-FU, and isovorin were studied.Results:The response rate after the first chemotherapy cycle was 57.1% (partial response, 4; stable disease, 2; progressive disease, 1). The cumulative survival rates at 1 and 2 years were 85.7% and 28.6%, respectively, and the median survival time was 22.3 months. With regard to grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions, the percentages of patients developing leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and anorexia were 28.6%, 28.6%, 42.9%, 14.3%, and 14.3%, respectively. Na treatment-related deaths were encountered.Conclusions:Although this is a pilot study, we suggest that systemic GEM combined with HAIC with CDDP, 5-FU, and isovorin, may be a useful therapy for patients with advanced ICC.
