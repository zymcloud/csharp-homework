Purpose:To investigate the effect of deacetylase inhibitory trichostatin A (TSA) on anti HepG2 liver carcinoma cells and explore the underlying mechanisms.Materials and methods:HepG2 cells exposed to different concentrations of TSA for 24, 48, or 72h were examined for cell growth inhibition using CCK8, changes in cell cycle distribution with flow cytometry, cell apoptosis with annexin V-FTIC/PI double staining, and cell morphology changes under an inverted microscope. Expression of β-catenin, HDAC1, HDAC3, H3K9, CyclinD1 and Bax proteins was tested by Western blotting. Gene expression for β-catenin, HDAC1and HDAC3 was tested by q-PCR. β-Catenin and H3K9 proteins were also tested by immunofluorescence. Activity of Renilla luciferase (pTCF/LEF-luc) was assessed using the Luciferase Reporter Assay system reagent. The activity of total HDACs was detected with a HDACs colorimetric kit.Results:Exposure to TSA caused significant dose-and time-dependent inhibition of HepG2 cell proliferation (pConclusions:TSA inhibits HDAC activity, promotes histone acetylation, and activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling to inhibit proliferation of HepG2 cell, arrest cell cycling and induce apoptosis.
