Background:For huge hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), therapeutic decisions have varied from local therapy to systemic therapy, with radiotherapy (RT) playing only a palliative role. In this study, we investigated whether multimodality treatment involving RT could be effective in huge HCC.Results:This study was performed in 116 patients with HCC >10 cm. The number of patients in stage II, III and IV was 12, 54 and 50, respectively. RT was given as a combined modality in most patients. The median dose was 45 Gy, with 1.8 Gy per fraction. The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 14.8 and 6.5 months, respectively. The median infield PFS was not reached. Infield failure, outfield intrahepatic and extrahepatic failure were observed in 8.6, 18.1, and 12.1% of patients, respectively. For OS and PFS, number of tumors, initial alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, treatment response, percent AFP decrement, and hepatic resection were significant prognostic factors. Tumor characteristics and treatment response were significantly different between long-term survivors and the other patients.Conclusion:Although huge HCC presents an aggressive clinical course, multimodality approaches involving RT can offer an opportunity for prolonged survival.
