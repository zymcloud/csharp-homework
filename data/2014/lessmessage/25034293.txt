Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the commonest cause of chronic liver disease in developed countries. Treatment depends on the stage of disease, and non-invasive methods for risk stratification are urgently needed. Lifestyle modification (aimed at weight loss and increasing physical activity) and management of the features of metabolic syndrome are vital for all patients with NAFLD. Metformin is the first-line therapy for diabetic patients with NAFLD and also reduces the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Clinicians should have a low threshold for introducing a statin for the management of dyslipidaemia. Antihypertensive agents that target the renin-angiotensin system should be first-line in NAFLD for the management of hypertension. For patients with progressive disease, liver-directed pharmacotherapy with vitamin E should be considered. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis cirrhosis is an increasingly common indication for liver transplantation.
