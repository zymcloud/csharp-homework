It has recently become apparent that obesity is associated with chronic inflammation and several common types of cancer development. Although several events were proposed to be involved in these pathologies, the precise mechanisms underlying obesity-associated inflammation and cancer largely remain unclear. Here, we show that senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) plays crucial roles in promoting obesity-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in mice. Dietary or genetic obesity induces alterations of gut microbiota, thereby increasing the levels of a bacterial metabolite that cause DNA damage. The enterohepatic circulation of the bacterial metabolites provokes SASP phenotype in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which in turn, secretes various inflammatory and tumour promoting factors in the liver, thus facilitating HCC development in mice after exposure to chemical carcinogen. Importantly, reducing gut bacteria efficiently prevents HCC development in obese mice. Similar results were also observed in mice lacking an SASP inducer or depleted of senescent HSCs, indicating that the induction of SASP by the gut bacterial metabolite in HSCs plays key roles in obesity-associated HCC development. Interestingly, moreover, signs of SASP were also observed in the HSCs in the area of HCC arising in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), implying that a similar pathway may contribute to at least certain aspects of obesity-associated HCC development in humans as well. These findings provide valuable new insights into the development of obesity-associated cancer.
