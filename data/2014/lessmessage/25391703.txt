We describe a 39-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer who had grade 4 epistaxis induced by bevacizumab. The patient visited our outpatient clinic with complaints of a lump in her right breast, fatigue, dyspnea, abdominal distention, appetite loss, and weight loss of 10 kg over 1 year. Liver dysfunction was detected, with elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (271 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (100 IU/L), alkaline phosphatase (4,205 IU/L), total bilirubin (2.7 mg/dL), and direct bilirubin (2.1 mg/dL). A secondary liver tumor that occupied most of the liver volume was found, and bone metastasis, ascites, and pleural effusion were also discovered. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 2. A core needle biopsy of the right breast tumor revealed invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast (nuclear grade 1) that was positive for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor and negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpression and had a high Ki-67 score. We chose combination chemotherapy with paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15) and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg on days 1 and 15) for 28 days (1 cycle). After completion of the first cycle of chemotherapy, the ascites and pleural effusion decreased, and the metastatic liver tumor shrank. The performance status improved from 2 to 1. On day 3 of the third cycle of chemotherapy, however, she began having persistent epistaxis. On day 6, she lost consciousness and was transported to the emergency room of our hospital. The hemoglobin level was 5.6 g/dL. Blood transfusion and endoscopic hemostasis were immediately started. Bevacizumab was discontinued, and paclitaxel alone was continued; after this change, epistaxis did not recur.
