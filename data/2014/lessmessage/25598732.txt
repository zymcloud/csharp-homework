Although most clinicians have extensive experience with the diagnosis and treatment of the disease, they have limited experience screening for it.Methods:We report current screening guidelines and methods.Results:By identifying the disease as early as possible, screening and treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality.Conclusion:Screening for hepatitis C leads to the appropriate evaluation and treatment of individuals chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus and prevents the progression of liver disease to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the associated morbidity and mortality. Screening for hepatitis C is also cost effective.
