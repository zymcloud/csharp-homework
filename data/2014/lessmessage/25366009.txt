We herein report a case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with lung metastasis that was successfully treated with transcatheter arterial infusion chemotherapy via the hepatic and bronchial arteries. A 64-year-old man diagnosed with HCC in 2003 was treated with locoregional therapy followed by sorafenib for recurrent HCC. Tumor thrombosis and lung metastasis were noted in April 2012. We administered IA-call(Â®), a fine-powder formulation of cisplatin, via the hepatic and bronchial arteries. This therapy resulted in the disappearance of the lung metastases and a partial response to tumor thrombosis. The patient remained alive for 23 months after developing lung metastasis.
