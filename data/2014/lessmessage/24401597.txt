Objectives:Recent reports indicated that reduced SLC22A7 (a gene-encoding organic anion transporter 2) expression in noncancerous liver tissue predicts hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after curative resection. Our study aimed to elucidate the association between SLC22A7 expression and HCC development in chronic hepatitis C patients.Methods:HCC recurrence after local ablation therapy and SLC22A7 expression in noncancerous liver tissue were analyzed in 20 patients. Subsequently, the association between de novo HCC development and SLC22A7 expression was examined at baseline in 38 hepatitis C patients without HCC who subsequently developed HCC as well as in 76 hepatitis C patients who did not develop HCC and were matched for age, gender and stage of fibrosis.Results:In the patients whose HCC had been cured, reduced SLC22A7 expression in noncancerous liver tissue was significantly associated with a high incidence of multifocal HCC recurrence. In patients without HCC at baseline, cumulative incidence of de novo HCC development was significantly higher with a reduced SLC22A7 expression than with a normal expression (p = 0.01). This difference remained significant among patients without known risk factors for HCC like age and advanced fibrosis.Conclusion:Reduced SLC22A7 expression in the liver indicates a significant risk for HCC development in chronic hepatitis C, independently of other risk factors.
