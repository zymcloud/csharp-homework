Background and aim:The effect of preoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) on the short- and long-term outcome of resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial. We conducted a retrospective evaluation of this aspect using data from our center.Material and methods:A total of 656 consecutive patients who underwent curative resection of HCC were divided into two groups based on the preoperative TACE: the liver resection (LR) group (405 cases) and the TACE-LR group (183 cases). Overall and disease-free survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. The significance of differences in survival was tested using a log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify the factors that best predicted overall survival or tumor free survival.Results:Although the cost of LR showed no difference between groups, the overall cost was significantly higher in the combined group than in the LR group (P Conclusion:Preoperative TACE has comparable intraoperative and short-term outcomes but more overall cost due to repeated TACE, and the procedure did not significantly improve the overall or tumor-free survival rate. Preoperative TACE should not, therefore, be recommended as a routine procedure before resection for resectable HCCs particularly in cases due to underlying hepatitis B virus (HBV).
