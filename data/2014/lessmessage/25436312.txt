Background/aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mainly arises from underlying liver disease. Complicated liver cirrhosis and secondary hypersplenism are the most risk factors preventing surgical treatment of patients with HCC. The present study aimed at investigating the safety and long term outcome of patients with HCC and liver cirrhosis undergoing synchronous hepatectomy and splenectomy.Methodology:The clinical data of 306 cases of patients with HCC and liver cirrhosis undergoing curative hepatectomy were reviewed. 18 cases underwent synchronous hepatectomy and splenectomy. The rest 288 cases of HCC with hepatectomy only were compared in aspects of clinicopathological and surgical variables and surgical outcomes.Results:Preoperative hemoglobin and platelet count were significantly lower in splenectomy than non-splenectomy group (p0.05).Conclusions:With strict selection, patients with HCC and hypersplenism could undergo combined splenectomy and hepatectomy safely.
