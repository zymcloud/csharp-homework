Since the licensing of lamivudine in 1999, the treatment of chronic hepatitis B has been revolutionized by the introduction of oral nucleoside and nucleotide analogues (NAs), which act as inhibitors of the HBV polymerase. The effectiveness of the first of these substances was limited by incomplete response and resistance development in many patients, but today, highly potent substances are available that make a reliable and durable suppression of HBV replication, a reduction of necroinflammatory activity in the liver, and even a reversion of liver fibrosis achievable for almost all patients. Beyond that, NA treatment can prevent the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in many patients. HBeAg seroconversion appears in approximately 50% of all HBeAg-positive patients during NA treatment. However, the ideal treatment endpoint, the serologic loss of HBsAg, remains a rare event almost exclusively achievable for HBeAg-positive patients. After cessation of the treatment, HBV replication tends to relapse in most patients, which is why the duration of NA treatment is indefinite. Future treatment strategies should aim at tailoring individual NA treatment regimens to increase HBs loss rates and optimize treatment duration.
