The present study aim was to evaluate radiofrequency (RF)-assisted liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:35 consecutive patients were enrolled in this study. A Habib®4X RF ablation device (RFAD) was used for liver resection. The patients were divided into two groups: in group A (45.7%; n=16) liver resection was performed using the RFD, whereas in group B (54.3%; n=19), liver resection was performed without RFD. The data were analysed for statistical significance.Results:The study population had a male female ratio of 25 10 and a mean age of 62.6 ± 11.6 years old. The mean overall tumor volume was 161.8 ± 35.5 mL and there were no differences in tumor volume between groups. The operative time and intraoperative blood loss were lower in group A,but without statistical significance [132.5 ± 61.5 vs 167.9 ± 46.3 mins, (P=0.061) and 459 ± 342 vs 716 ± 648 mL (P = 0.135)]. No differences were reported between the two groups in operative accidents (P = 0.508) and postoperative morbidity (P=0.782); a higher rate of late postoperative complications was found in group A (56.3% vs. 16.7%, P = 0.016). The overall postoperative mortality rate was 2.8%. Local recurrence was noted in 32.4%. The three-year cumulative survival rate was 60%.Conclusions:RFAD allows liver resection with low postoperative mortality and morbidity rates; RFD tends to decrease the operative time and blood loss.
