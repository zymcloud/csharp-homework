Background:Thrombocytopenia often makes the introduction of systemic treatment difficult in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We retrospectively evaluated the long-term effects of partial splenic embolization (PSE) with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with HCC patients accompanied by thrombocytopenia.Patients and methods:Twenty-one patients with HCC complicated by severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count, Results:Seventeen of 21 patients (81.0%) showed increased platelet counts to ≥5.0 × 10(4)/mm(3). Subsequently, 13 patients (61.9%) successfully received systemic chemotherapy. Platelet counts and serum levels of total bilirubin, as well as neutrophil counts, improved significantly one month after treatment. However, serum levels of albumin and hemoglobin decreased significantly one month after treatment. Severe adverse events, including acute liver failure and portal vein thrombus, were observed in two patients.Conclusion:PSE with selective TACE made it possible for patients with HCC and severe thrombocytopenia to receive systemic chemotherapy. Although PSE with TACE was safe and tolerable for most patients, the extent of PSE with TACE in a wide area of the liver may increase the risk for fatal liver failure.
