Background:Carcinoma of unknown primary with a "gastrointestinal profile" is an emerging, favorable entity. Distinguishing this entity is of increasing significance given the progress in the treatment of colorectal cancer.Patients and methods:74 carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) patients with CDX2+ tumors were chosen from the databases at M.D. Anderson and Sarah Cannon Cancer Centers between 2004 and 2010. Data on clinical and pathological characteristics including therapy and survival were recorded.Results:20 patients had ascites on presentation; the predominant sites of metastases included liver (30 %), carcinomatosis (50 %), and nodes (51 %). Based on immunohistochemistry, 2 cohorts were created: Cohort 1-"consistent with lower GI profile" included 34 patients [CDX-2+, CK20+, CK7-] and Cohort 2-"probable lower GI profile" included 40 patients [CDX2+, irrespective of CK7/CK20 status]. Excluding 6 outliers, Cohorts 1 and 2 had 32 and 36 patients, respectively; their median survivals were 37 and 21 months, respectively. On multivariate Cox regression analysis, only liver metastases were found to negatively influence survival.Conclusions:Our retrospective study provides encouraging indications that CUP patients with gastrointestinal profiles benefit from site-specific therapy. We recommend all CUP patients, especially those with abdominal nodes, isolated carcinomatosis or liver metastases, to undergo optimal immunohistochemistry (IHC) to check for a gastrointestinal profile of CUP.
