Background/aim:We evaluated doxycycline-inducible manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD(tet/tet)) mice after 9.25 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI) or 20 Gy thoracic irradiation.Materials and methods:Six-week-old MnSOD(tet/tet) or control C57BL/6NHsd mice on or off doxycycline (doxy) in food received 9.25 Gy TBI, were sacrificed at day 19 and bone marrow, brain, esophagus, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, spleen and tongue harvested, total RNAs extracted and transcripts for irradiation response genes quantitated by real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).Results:MnSOD(tet/tet) mice only survived with daily injections of doxy beginning 5 days after birth until weaning, at which time they were placed on food containing doxy. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) transcript levels were reduced in all tissues except the lung. Adult mice survived with low MnSOD levels, but induced by doxy or TBI. Thoracic-irradiated MnSOD(tet/tet) mice survived past day 120.Conclusion:MnSOD(tet/tet) mice should be valuable for elucidating the role of MnSOD in growth and irradiation response.
