One of the most common hepatic manifestations of the metabolic syndrome is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This disease varies from simple steatosis to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Different molecules secreted from adipose tissue such as adiponectin, leptin, resistin and visfatin and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-Î±, and interleukins, can be involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. In this review we describe the role of these adipokines and cytokines in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. We comment on their potential use as non-invasive biomarkers of steatosis and fibrosis, and their potential therapeutic role.
