Major hepatic resection is often necessary for cure in patients with multiple colorectal cancer metastases but low future liver remnant (FLR) volume makes surgery risky because of the posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF). Right portal vein ligation/embolization and two-stage hepatectomy were proposed previously to overcome this problem. Associated liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) is a novel approach aimed for FLR volume hypertrophy. During the first stage right portal vein is ligated followed by liver parenchyma in situ splitting. Right liver lobe removal is performed during the second stage when FLR hypertrophy becomes sufficient. Three patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases were scheduled for major hepatic resection. ALPPS was applied because of insufficient FLR volume. We observed FLR hypertrophy of 77, 90 and 70% after 7, 7 and 14 days waiting period. FLR/Total Liver Volume ratio increased from 22, 23 and 15% to 33, 35 and 32% respectively. The second stage was performed successfully in all patients. All patients are alive and they have not disease relapse after 17, 15 and 15 months after surgery. ALPPS is promising technique that allows rapid FLR hypertrophy and enables curative liver resections in initially unresectable patients. But it is necessary more data concerning ALPPS safety and long-term results.
