Background:Urachal cancer is a rare malignancy that accounts for <1% of bladder cancers. There is currently no consensus on the diagnosis and management of urachal cancer and there are very few reports on palliative chemotherapy for unresectable disease. We delineate the clinical features and treatment outcome of urachal cancer, in particular the relevance of palliative chemotherapy in recurrent, metastatic disease.Methods:The clinicopathologic variables and treatment outcome of patients who were treated for urachal cancer were retrospectively reviewed.Results:Among 28 eligible patients, 25 had localized disease and 3 had metastatic disease at initial diagnosis. All patients with localized disease underwent curative resection and there was disease recurrence in 10. Out of 13 patients with metastatic disease either at initial diagnosis or during follow-up, the lung was the most common metastatic site (n = 5), followed by the liver, bone and peritoneum. Ten patients received palliative chemotherapy. A total of 24 chemotherapeutic regimens were administered; regimens with a base of fluoropyrimidine (5-FU), taxane and gemcitabine were the most common. The overall response rate of all chemotherapeutic regimens was 16.7%. The 5-FU-based regimens showed a good response, with 2 of 4 patients who received these showing a partial response. One tumor with a partial small-cell component showed a partial response to both an etoposide-based regimen and a taxane-based regimen.Conclusions:In urachal cancer, curative surgery is still the recommended treatment with respect to overall survival. A 5-FU-based chemotherapy regimen could be considered for metastatic recurrent disease.
