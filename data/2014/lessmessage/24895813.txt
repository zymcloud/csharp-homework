Background/aims:The plasticity of bone marrow stem cells has been confirmed to self-renew and transdifferentiate into hepatocytes. Thus, we performed autologous stem cell transplantation for rapid liver regeneration with extensive hepatectomy in hepatocellular cancer patients.Methodology:With informed consent, patients aged 20 to 75 who needed large extensive hepatectomy due to hepatocellular carcinoma were randomly divided into three groups: control, mononuclear cells (MNCs), and CD34+ cells, based on infused cell type. After portal vein embolization (PVE), mobilized MNCs or CD34+ cells were returned to the patient via the portal vein on mobilization day without manipulation. Liver volume, liver function, clinical score and Indocyanine green R15 (ICG-R15) were compared before and after PVE.Results:Total bilirubin, albumin, and clinical score showed significant improvement (p Conclusions:Improvements in liver volume, liver function, clinical score and ICG-R15 suggest that autologous stem cell transplantation is a promising method for liver regeneration.
