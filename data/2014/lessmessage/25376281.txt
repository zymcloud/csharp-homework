Objective:To clarify the progression pattern of abnormal DNA methylation during the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using a comprehensive methylation assay.Methods:We used an Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array that can analyze >485,000 CpG sites distributed throughout the genome for a comprehensive methylation study of 117 liver tissues consisting of 59 HCC and 58 noncancerous livers. Altered DNA methylation patterns during tumor progression were also analyzed.Results:We identified 38,330 CpG sites with significant differences in methylation levels between HCCs and noncancerous livers (DM-CpGs) using strict criteria. Of the DM-CpGs, 92% were hypomethylated and only 3,051 CpGs (8%) were hypermethylated in HCC. The DM-CpGs were more prevalent within intergenic regions with isolated CpGs. In contrast, DM-CpGs that were hypermethylated in HCC were predominantly located within promoter regions and CpG islands (p Conclusions:We clarified the unique characteristics of DM-CpGs in human HCCs. The stepwise progression of alterations in DNA methylation was a common feature of HCV-related hepatocarcinogenesis.
