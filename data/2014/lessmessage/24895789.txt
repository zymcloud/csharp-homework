Background/aims:We retrospectively evaluated the local tumor control and safety of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) followed by stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in this pilot study.Methodology:Twenty-eight patients not for the indication of hepatectomy or ablation procedures were enrolled in this study. Eligible criteria was as followed: i) less than 3 hypervascular HCC nodules, each up to 30 mm in diameter; ii) not suitable for the hepatic resection or ablative therapy; iii) Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score Results:The median local tumor control time was not reached. The 1-year cumulative local tumor control rate was 96.3%. The median disease-free survival time was 18 months. The 1- year cumulative overall survival rate was 92.6%. One patient (3.6%) died due to intrahepatic ectopic multiple recurrence and systemic metastasis and one (3.6%) due to cerebral hemorrhage. No patients experienced severe acute hematologic or physical toxicity or radiation induced liver damage.Conclusions:Our study demonstrated SBRT combined with TACE is a safe and effective modality of the locoregional therapy for small primary HCC.
