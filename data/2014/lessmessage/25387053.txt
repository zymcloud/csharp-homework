Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the major etiologic agents of liver cancer. HCV is an RNA virus that, unlike hepatitis B virus, is unable to integrate into the host genome. Through complex interactions between viral and host proteins that induce host responses and promote inflammation, fibrosis, and ultimately cirrhosis, HCV infection can result in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The HCV oncogenic process involves genetic and epigenetic alterations and oncogenic effects mediated by viral proteins in the activation of cellular oncogenes, inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes, and dysregulation of multiple signal-transduction pathways. Advances in genetics and gene expression profiling have enhanced our current understanding of the pathways involved in HCV-associated liver cancer development. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis induced by HCV infection.
