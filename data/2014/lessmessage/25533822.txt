Background:Accumulating evidence indicates that systemic inflammation response is associated with the prognosis of various cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), which is one of the systemic inflammation markers, in the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after treatment of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:The clinical data of 178 HCC patients who received TACE were retrospectively analyzed. The optimal NLR cutoff was determined according to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. All patients were divided into NLR-normal group and NLR-elevated group according to the cutoff, and the clinical features of these two groups were comparatively analyzed. Meanwhile, the overall survival and disease free survival (DFS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The risk factors of postoperative survival were investigated using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses.Results:The optimal NLR cutoff was defined at 1.85 and 42 (23.6%) patients had an elevated NLR (NLR>1.85). The median survival time was 9.5 months (range 1-99 months). The clinical data between the two groups were comparable, except for a-fetoprotein. Follow-up results showed that the median survival of patients with normal NLR was 17.5 months (range: 1-99 months) compared with 8 months (range: 8-68 months) of patients with elevated NLR. The 1, 3 and 5-year overall survival of patients in the NLR-normal group and NLR-elevated group were 57.3%, 44.1%, and 27.2% and 42.1%, 19.6%, and 9.5% respectively (Ï‡(2) = 194.2, P Conclusion:Preoperative NLR was an important prognostic factor to predict the prognosis of patients with intermediate HCC treated with TACE.
