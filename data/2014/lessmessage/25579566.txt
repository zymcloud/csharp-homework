Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been the standard treatment modality in patients with intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Brivanib is an oral small molecular inhibitor of both vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor receptors. Herein, we reported that a 67-year-old patient with intermediate stage HCC achieved the complete remission after TACE combined with brivanib therapy. This finding potentially suggested the benefit of this combination therapy for HCC.
