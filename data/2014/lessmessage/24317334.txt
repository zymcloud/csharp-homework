Purpose:We aimed to evaluate the combination of the modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (mRECIST) and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) as a tool for the assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma treated with transarterial chemoembolization.Materials and methods:Forty-seven hepatocellular carcinoma patients (80 target tumors suitable for mRECIST measurements) were studied. They were treated with scheduled transarterial chemoembolization with doxorubicin-eluting microspheres every 5-7 weeks. Imaging follow-up (performed one month after each transarterial chemoembolization) included a standard, contrast-enhanced modality (computed tomography [CT] in 12 patients or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] in 35 patients) and CEUS. The study focused on response evaluation after the third transarterial chemoembolization. CEUS required a bolus injection of an echo-enhancer and imaging with a dedicated, low mechanical index technique. The longest diameters of the enhancing target tumors were measured on the CEUS or CT/MRI, and mRECIST criteria were applied. Radiologic responses were correlated with overall survival and time to progression.Results:The measurements of longest diameters of the enhancing target tumors were easily performed in all patients. According to mRECIST-CEUS and mRECIST-CT/MRI, complete response was recorded in five and six patients, partial response in 22 and 21 patients, stable disease in 16 and 14 patients, and progressive disease in four and six patients, respectively. There was a high degree of concordance between CEUS and CT/MRI (kappa coefficient=0.84, P Conclusion:The mRECIST-CEUS combination is feasible and has prognostic value in the assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma following transarterial chemoembolization.
