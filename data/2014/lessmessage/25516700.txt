Background:Open liver resection is the current standard of care for lesions in the right posterior liver section. The objective of this study was to determine the safety of robot-assisted liver resection for lesions located in segments 6 and 7 in comparison with open surgery.Methods:Demographics, comorbidities, clinicopathologic characteristics, surgical treatments, and outcomes from patients who underwent open and robot-assisted liver resection at 2 centers for lesions in the right posterior section between January 2007 and June 2012 were reviewed. A 1:3 matched analysis was performed by individually matching patients in the robotic cohort to patients in the open cohort on the basis of demographics, comorbidities, performance status, tumor stage, and location.Results:Matched patients undergoing robotic and open liver resections displayed no significant differences in postoperative outcomes as measured by blood loss, transfusion rate, hospital stay, overall complication rate (15.8% vs 13%), R0 negative margin rate, and mortality. Patients undergoing robotic liver surgery had significantly longer operative time (mean, 303 vs 233 minutes) and inflow occlusion time (mean, 75 vs 29 minutes) compared with their open counterparts.Conclusions:Robotic and open liver resections in the right posterior section display similar safety and feasibility.
