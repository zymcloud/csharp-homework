Background/aims:The long-term prognosis for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who undergo laparoscopic hepatectomy has not been well compared with that for patients after open hepatectomy.Methodology:We analyzed patient survival (PS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of 310 consecutive patients who underwent primary hepatectomy between January 2001 and March 2010. The patients were divided into Group LAP (laparoscopic approach) (n = 24) and Group OPN (with open laparotomy) (n = 286). The median follow-up time was 60.9 months (range, 12.0-123.9 months).Results:The 5-, and 7-year PS rates of Group LAP were 87.9%, and 87.9%, and those of Group OPN were 82.2% and 69.3%, respectively (P = 0.5638). The 5-, and 7-year DFS rates of Group LAP were 47.1%, and 31.4%, and those of Group OPN were 29.4%, and 24.3%, respectively (P = 0.4594). Laparoscopic hepatectomy in patients of Group LAP resulted in a better outcome of blood loss (P = 0.0314), operative time (P Conclusions:The long-term outcome of laparoscopic hepatectomy for patients with HCC was identified to be comparable to open hepatectomy with regard to PS and DFS. Laparoscopic hepatectomy is a promising therapeutic option for patients with HCC.
