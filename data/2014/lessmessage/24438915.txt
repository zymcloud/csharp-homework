We report the case of a 39-year-old female with metastatic colorectal cancer. Pretreatment SPECT/CT imaging revealed extrahepatic tracer accumulation along the falciform artery distribution. Prior to the administration of (90)Y microspheres, hepatic arterial anatomy was evaluated angiographically. It was not possible to identify the hepatic falciform artery so that no coil-embolization was performed. The patient tolerated the treatment well with only mild pain around the umbilicus during the procedure that spontaneously abated. As far as we know, this is the first report of Bremsstrahlung SPECT/CT images that has clearly shown that the microspheres accumulation in the anterior abdominal wall corresponds to hepatic falciform artery distribution on CT.
