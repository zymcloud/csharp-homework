We analyzed the treatment results in patients who underwent hepatic resection for breast cancer liver metastases(BCLM).Between 1/2003 and 12/2012, 15 patients underwent hepatic resection for BCLM. All primary breast tumors were diagnosed as invasive breast cancer. Synchronous BCLM ocurred in 2 patients and 13 patients presented with metachronous BCLM. Median age of patients at the time of BCLM diagnosis was 51 years(range from 31 to 73 years). All resections were considered as R0. From among 15 resections we performed 10 major hepatic resections according to Couinaud classification(â‰¥3 segments) and the rest were minor ones. There was no postoperative mortality within 60 days . All postoperative complications were managed conservatively. Median hospital stay was 10,5 days, ranging from 7-14 days.Standard therapy for patients with BCLM remains systemic chemo- and hormonal therapy. Hepatic resection as a part of multimodal treatment in tertiary HPB centers can offer in a selected group of patients a safe option for improved survival.
