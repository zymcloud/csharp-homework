Background:Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that serum aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a hepatocarcinogenic mycotoxin and contributor to the high rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prevalence of liver cancer in Egypt is particularly worrisome. In a registry-based analysis of occupational risk for HCC, significant excesses were observed especially for grain mill workers.Objective:The aim of this study was to assess the hepatic carcinogenicity of AFB1 in wheat handlers.Methods:Serum AFB1/albumin (AFB1/Alb), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), alpha-l-fucosidase (AFU), and arginase were estimated in exposed wheat handlers including millers and bakers. The control group was composed of non-occupationally exposed workers.Results:AFB1/Alb and AFU were significantly higher among workers employed as bakers compared to mill workers and controls. Mill workers had higher levels of AFB1/Alb than the controls. AFB1/Alb, AFP, and AFU were all significantly higher and arginase was significantly lower among HCC cases compared to the other groups. There was a significant correlation between AFU and AFB1/Alb in bakers and between AFP and AFB1/Alb in HCC cases. Arginase was inversely correlated with AFB1/Alb in HCC cases. AFB1/Alb was significantly correlated with the duration of exposure in bakers.Conclusion:Wheat handlers exposed to Aspergillus flavus have a high risk of elevated serum AFB1/Alb levels and AFU.
