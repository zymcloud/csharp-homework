Objectives:DNA methylation-dependent transcriptional inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) is critical for the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study identifies potential TSGs in HCCs using methylation profiling and pharmacological unmasking of methylated TSGs.Methods:Methylation profiling was performed on 22 pairs of HCCs and their corresponding noncancerous liver tissues using the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip. We also determined the gene reexpression after treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) and trichostatin A (TSA) in 5 HCC cell lines.Results:We selected CpGs that exhibited a significant increase in methylation in HCC tissues compared with that of the noncancerous control group. Two hundred and thirteen CpGs on different gene promoters with a mean difference in the β value ≥0.15 and a value of p Conclusions:We identified several potential TSGs that participate in transcription inactivation through epigenetic interactions in HCC. The results of this study are important for the understanding of functionally important epigenetic alterations in HCC.
