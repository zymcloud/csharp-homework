In this study, we used branches Ramulus mori from cultivated mulberry Husang-32 (Morus multicaulis Perry) as the experimental material and anhydrous ethanol as the extraction solution to obtain the crude extract from the branch bark. The ethanolic extract was successively purified through a macroporous resin, Sephadex LH-20, and semipreparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The high-purity monomer was identified as morusin by HPLC with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) and its UV spectrum. The contents of morusin exhibited almost no difference between the root and branch bark in Husang-32, and morusin was not detected in the leaves. Morusin is able to inhibit the tumor growth of transplanted H22 hepatocarcinoma in mice and has no side effects. The fluorescence quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results indicate that morusin has a marked inhibitory effect on liver cancer cells through a mechanism that may be related increases in the expression of p53, Survivin, CyclinB1, and Caspase-3 and a decrease in NF-κ B gene expression. The influence of this compound is more apparent in the Caspase-3 and the NF-κ B genes.
