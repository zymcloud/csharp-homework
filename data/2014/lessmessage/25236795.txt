Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) staging provides a basis for calculating disease prognosis and therapeutic guidance. Liver resection and transplantation are curative options, and ablation therapies are applied to patients that are not candidates for curative treatment. Survival after liver resection or ablation therapies varies.Aims:To describe the presentation, staging, management, and outcome in patients with HCC in our center.Patients and methods:Forty-two patients had a 7-year prospective follow-up. Survival was calculated with the Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test was used for its comparison between the staging systems (Okuda, BCLC, and CLIP) and types of treatment (liver resection, radiofrequency ablation, and no surgical treatment).Results:The mean age of the patients was 68.9 ± 9.5 years; 57% were women. A total of 54% of the patients presented with cirrhosis and 31% were infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The mean tumor size was 6.48 ± 2.52cm. The CLIP 0, Okuda I, and BCLC A stages had better survival rates than the other stages (PConclusion:The patients at our center were diagnosed at late stages of HCC, as is the case in other Mexican populations. Outcome in relation to CLIP and BCLC was similar to the prognoses reported in the literature. The best results were observed in the patients with early stage disease and those that underwent HCC resection surgery.
