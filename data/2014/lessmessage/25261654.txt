Purpose:This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in combination with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in the treatment for locally advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:From March 2000 to March 2009 a total of 158 patients with unresectable HCC treated and followed at our hospital were divided into TACE group (N=80) and TACE combined with 3D-CRT group (N=78). The TACE group was treated 3-6 times. In the combination group, 2-3 TACE courses were administered and 3D-CRT was performed 2 weeks after the last TACE. Three months after the end of treatment, imaging and serum AFP were carried out to assess the treatment efficacy.Results:The response rates of TACE and the combination groups were 53.7% (43/80) and 71.8% (58/78) (pConclusion:3D-CRT in combination with TACE significantly improve the therapeutic outcome in patients with locally advanced unresectable HCC, without creating severe toxicity.
