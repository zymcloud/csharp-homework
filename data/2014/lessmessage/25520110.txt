Background:This analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cisplatin based chemotherapy for treating patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.Methods:Clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of cisplatin based regimens on response and safety for patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma were identified using a predefined search strategy. Pooled response rates (RR) of treatment were calculated.Results:In cisplatin based regimens, 4 clinical studies which including 50 patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma were considered eligible for inclusion. Regimens included cisplatin, doxorubicin, or vindesine. Pooled analysis suggested that, in all patients, the pooled RR was 60% (30/50) in cisplatin based regimens. Nausea and vomiting were the main side effects. No grade III or IV renal or liver toxicity were observed. No treatment related death occurred with the cisplatin based treatments.Conclusion:Evidence based analysis suggests that cisplatin based regimens are associated with a good response rate and acceptable toxicity for treating patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.
