Aim:We hereby present and evaluate a technique for hepatic parenchymal transection based on the application of Metzenbaum scissors and clips during liver ischemia.Methods:Our technique was retrospectively evaluated in 32 noncirrhotic, noncholestatic patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and 32 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (23 of whom cirrhotic, 71.9%). Patient data were retrieved from our Hepatobiliary Surgery Database. Type and duration of vascular clamping, blood transfusion requirements, marginal status and immediate postoperative complications were analyzed.Results:Twenty-seven extended (>4 liver segments; 42.2%) and 37 nonextended (â‰¤4 liver segments; 57.8%) liver resections were analyzed. Warm liver ischemia duration was 14 (interquartile range: 11-17.8) min. Thirty-three patients (51.6%) were transfused with a median of 2 (1.5-3) units of packed red blood cells. Tumor-free margins were achieved in 90.6% of cases (n = 58). The overall morbidity rate was 18.8% with a 4.7% mortality rate. Our technique allowed for excellent identification and safe dissection and preservation, or ligation of major liver vessels.Conclusions:The proposed technique is simple, fast, safe and with low cost. It is associated with limited postoperative complications while from an oncologic standpoint it enables the surgeon to achieve a high percentage of tumor-free margins while protecting major vascular structures.
