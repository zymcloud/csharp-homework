Background/aims:The C-reactive protein level has been reported as a prognostic predictor for hepatocellular carcinoma after surgery. We investigated the usefulness of preoperative C-reactive protein levels in predicting outcomes after living donor liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma and identified preoperative risk factors.Methodology:We retrospectively analyzed 96 hepatocellular carcinoma patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation in March 2003-November 2009. The effect of preoperative variables on overall survival was evaluated by multivariate analysis.Results:The 5-year overall survival rate was significantly lower for C-reactive protein levels >0.3 mg/dL than for C-reactive protein levels â‰¤0.3 mg/dL (55.8% vs. 89.8%; P=0.001). In multivariate analysis, C-reactive protein levels >0.3 mg/dL (P=0.006) and alpha-fetoprotein levels >200 ng/mL (PConclusions:Preoperative C-reactive protein levels predicted prognosis after living donor liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma. C-reactive protein and alpha-fetoprotein levels together with Milan criteria may improve hepatocellular carcinoma patient selection for liver transplantation.
