Purpose:To investigate the effects and mechanism of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) on the proliferation and apoptosis of human hepatoma cell line Bel-7402.Methods:SAHA treatment and control groups were designed in this study. To observe the morphological characteristics and the inhibition of cell proliferation, we conducted confocal microscopy and methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay, respectively. Changes in cell apoptosis and cell cycle were then determined by flow cytometry. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was also conducted to detect the mRNA expressions of p53, bcl-2 and bax genes. Caspase-3 protein activity was determined by spectrophotometry.Results:Cell proliferation in the SAHA treatment group could be inhibited in a time- and dose-dependent manner. FCM analysis showed that the early apoptosis rate in the SAHA treatment group increased significantly. Furthermore, cell cycle was arrested at the S phase. RT-PCR assay confirmed that SAHA could upregulate the mRNA expressions of p53 and bax genes. By comparison, SAHA could downregulate the mRNA expression of bcl-2. SAHA induced apoptosis by activating the caspase-3 pathway.Conclusion:SAHA inhibited cell proliferation and promoted human hepatoma Bel-7402 cell apoptosis by affecting caspase-3 protein activity and mRNA expressions of p53, bcl-2 and bax genes.
