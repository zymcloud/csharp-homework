Objective:The aim of this study was to identify the prognostic factors in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are refractory or intolerant to sorafenib and to exclude unsuitable candidates from subsequent therapy.Methods:The study cohort consisted of 111 patients who had discontinued sorafenib therapy. Uni- and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify the prognostic factors for survival after discontinuation of sorafenib therapy.Results:The median age of the patients was 70 years, and 96 of them (86%) were male. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0-1 in 94 patients (85%). Forty patients (36%) were classified as Child-Pugh class A and 57 (51%) as Child-Pugh class B. The median survival time after discontinuation of sorafenib therapy was 146 days. Hepatitis C viral antibody negativity, presence of ascites, absence of a history of previous treatment excluding sorafenib, elevated serum total bilirubin level, and elevated serum Î±-fetoprotein level were identified as the independent unfavorable prognostic factors by multivariate analysis. The median survival time of the patients with 4 or 5 unfavorable prognostic factors was 59 days.Conclusions:We should judge the indication of any subsequent therapy carefully in patients with 4 or 5 of the aforementioned factors.
