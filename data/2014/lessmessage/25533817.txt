Background:The management of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial due to the early recurrence after curative hepatectomy, and many variables were related to the prognosis. The purpose of this study was to predict the tumor recurrence in early postoperative period of the patients with BCLC stage B HCC.Methods:From January 2004 to January 2012, 104 patients with BCLC stage B HCC underwent hepatectomy. Clinicopathological factors and follow-up data were statistically analyzed to establish a predicting scoring system.Results:The overall survival rates for one, three, and five years were 69.2%, 52.7%, and 42.3%, and the disease-free survival rates for one, three, and five years were 52.9%, 47.3%, and 37.5%, respectively. The multiple factors analysis showed that the micro-vessel invasion, lymph nodes metastasis, multiple lesions, and the high expression of HMGB1 were independent factors (P Conclusion:Variant clinicopathological factors were associated with early postoperative recurrence for BCLC stage B HCC and recurrence early after hepatectomy was more likely in patients with a higher score of the scoring system.
