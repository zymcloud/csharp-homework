Background:To evaluate the feasibility, accuracy, and utility of sonography (US) and CT fusion imaging guidance for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of malignant liver tumors not visualized on conventional US.Methods:Seventy-seven patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and 15 patients with metastatic liver cancer with a total of 136 lesions underwent RFA with US and CT fusion imaging guidance. The mean number of punctures, success rate of a single ablation session, local tumor progression rates, and long-term outcome were evaluated. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by dynamic CT and contrast-enhanced US 1 month after RFA.Results:RFA was technically feasible in all patients, and no major complications occurred. The mean ± SD time needed to synchronize US and CT images was 13.9 ± 11.9 minutes (range, 5-55 minutes). The success rate of a single ablation session was 83.8% (114/136), and tumor residue was present in 7.4% of lesions (10/136). The mean number of treatment sessions was 1.2 ± 0.5 sessions. During follow-up, local tumor progression was observed for 15 (11.9%) lesions. Distant tumor recurrence was found in 51 (55.4%) patients.Conclusions:US and CT fusion-assisted RFA is a safe and efficacious treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic liver cancer.
