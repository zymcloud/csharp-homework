Background and aims:The rs738409 variant (I148M) of the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) gene is associated with several liver malfunctions. Its impact on end-stage liver disease has not been addressed yet.Methods:The I148M polymorphism was genotyped in a well-characterized cohort of 421 Caucasian patients and retrospectively analyzed from the time of enrollment at Eurotransplant.Results:The G allele of the I148M variant was significantly overrepresented in patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD, P Conclusions:In end-stage liver disease patients, we identified ALD to be predominantly affected by the PNPLA3 I148M variant resulting in an increased risk of HCC and reduced transplantation free survival. Genetic testing of the I148M genotype in ALD patients awaiting liver transplantation might be beneficial for these patients.
