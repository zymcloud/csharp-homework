Liver transplantation (LT) is the treatment of choice in selected patients with end-stage liver disease and in some with acute liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other diseases with no synthetic liver failure. Currently, LT has an overall survival > 90 % at 1 year. Proper selection of LT candidates is important given the shortage in organ donation. The allocation and priorization of organs to patients with chronic liver failure (CLF) in waiting lists, is determined by the MELD priority score (Model of End Stage Liver Disease). Indications for LT in patients with CLF are the same regardless of the etiology (any type of hepatic decompensation or development of HCC). Priority MELD is a variant to this classification used only in special cases such as in those with stable hepatopathy but severe extra-hepatic features (e.g., HCC or hepato-pulmonary syndrome). The indication for LT in patients with acute liver failure (ALF) and acute failure associated to chronic liver failure (ACLF) are not fully established; there are prognostic factors that may guide the decision for urgent LT and some centers, like the King's College Hospital criteria in the UK. Currently, LT is a therapeutic modality in some primary liver tumors (HCC, cholangiocarcinoma) and neuroendocrine liver metastatic tumors. These protocols have provided significant opportunities for long-term survival (> 70% at 5 years). The high demand and shortage of organs have fostered the development of new strategies to benefit more patients, such as the use of extended criteria donors, or "domino" transplants. This review focuses on the most relevant data on the different indications of LT.
