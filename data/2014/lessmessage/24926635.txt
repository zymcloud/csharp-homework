Gefitinib and erlotinib are selective epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) inhibitor. They are approved for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating mutations of EGFR-TK. We report the case of a hepatitis cytolytic during gefitinib treatment with a positive rechallenge. A relay by erlotinib has been initiated and doesn't give recurrence of hepatotoxicity. From a literature review and this observation, arguments have been provided to justify erlotinib as a safe and well-tolered alternative for patients who have to stop gefitinib after a severe hepatotoxicity.
