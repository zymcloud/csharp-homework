Background/aims:To compare and assess the outcomes of liver resection, radiofrequency ablation and liver transplantation for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within Milan criteria and cirrhotic portal hypertension.Methodology:248 patients with HCC within Milan criteria and cirrhotic portal hypertension who underwent surgical treatments (liver resection, radiofrequency ablation and liver transplantation were reviewed in this study. Patients were divided into three groups according to different surgical strategies: RST Group, RFA Group and LT Group. Pre- and intra-operative parameters were statistically analyzed. Postoperative outcomes including Hematological data and tumor data, complications, long-term survival rates and recurrence-free survival rates were compared.Results:The incidence of postoperative complications that were classified according to Clavien-Dido Classification were 16.22% for RST Group, 9.09% for RFA Group and 53.85% for LT Group. The 1-, 2- and 3-year recurrence-free survival rate of three groups were 88%, 74%, 68% for RST Group, 60%, 39%, 35% for RFA Group and 97%, 89%, 87% for LT Group, respectively.Conclusion:Although the postoperative recurrence rate following RFA was higher than that of RST and LT, the long-term survival rates of three managements for patients with HCC within Milan criteria and portal hypertension were similar.
