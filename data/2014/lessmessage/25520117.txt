Background:The morbidity and mortality rate of liver cancer continues to rise in China and advanced cases respond poorly to chemotherapy. Ribosomal protein L24 has been reported to be a potential therapeutic target whose depletion or acetylation inhibits polysome assembly and cell growth of cancer.Materials and methods:Total RNA of cultured amycin-resistant and susceptible HepG2 cells was isolated, and real time quantitative RT-PCR were used to indicate differences between amycin-resistant and susceptible strains of HepG2 cells. Viability assays were used to determine amycin resistance in RPL24 transfected and control vector and null- transfected HepG2 cell lines.Results:The ribosomal protein L24 transcription level was 7.7 times higher in the drug-resistant HepG2 cells as compared to susceptible cells on quantitative RT-PCR analysis. This was associated with enhanced drug resistance as determined by methyl tritiated thymidine (3H-TdR) incorporation.Conclusions:The ribosomal protein L24 gene may have effects on drug resistance mechanisms in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells.
