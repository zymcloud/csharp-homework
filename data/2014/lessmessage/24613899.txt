Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is an intrinsically tumor-specific virus, several clinical trials have reported that mesogenic NDV is a safe and effective agent for human cancer therapy. Interleukin 2 (IL2) is a cytokine that stimulates T cell propagation to trigger innate and adaptive immunity. IL2 has been used for cancer therapy and has achieved curative effects. In this study, a recombinant NDV LaSota strain expressing human interleukin 2 (rLaSota/IL2) was generated. The ability of rLaSota/IL2 to express human IL2 was detected in the infected tumor cells. In addition, the activity of IL2 was analyzed. The antitumor potential of rLaSota/IL2 was studied by xenograph mice carrying H22 and B16-F10 cells. Tumor-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and MHC II were also analyzed in the two tumor-bearing models. Our study showed that rLaSota/IL2 significantly stimulated tumor-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses and increased regulatory CD4(+) and cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells proliferation. The treatment with rLaSota/IL2 led to tumor regression in tumor-bearing mice and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, tumor challenging experiments demonstrated that rLaSota/IL2 invoked mice a unique capacity to remember a pathogen through the generation of memory T cells, which protect the host in the event of reinfection and form adaptive immune system. The result indicates that tumor-infiltrating CD4(+) T regulatory cells may denote the effective regression of tumors. Taken together, rLaSota/IL2 has potential for immunotherapy and oncolytic therapy of cancers and may be an ideal candidate for clinical application in future cancer therapy.
