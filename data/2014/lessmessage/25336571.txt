Sorafenib is the only systemic therapy to demonstrate a significant survival benefit over supportive care in robust randomised controlled trials for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the context of an intense search for prognostic and predictive factors for response and efficacy of different systemic therapies (including sorafenib), a number of molecular targets have been identified, paving new avenues for potential therapeutic opportunities. Such molecular targets include somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-related alterations. In this review, we provide an overview of the various considerations relating to SSTRs as potentially novel prognostic and predictive biomarkers for HCC with special emphasis on the therapeutic potential of somatostatin analogues in HCC management.
