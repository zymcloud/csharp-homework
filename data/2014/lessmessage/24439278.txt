The purpose of this chapter is to provide a summary of polymer patterning technologies for biological applications and detailed instructions for resist-free deep ultraviolet (UV) patterning of poly(styrene). Photochemical modifications of this polymer yield unstable peroxides together with stable oxidized chemical groups. The altered physicochemical properties of the polymer surface influence protein adsorption and cell adhesion. HepG2 (human hepatoma cell line), fibroblasts (L929, murine fibroblast line), and other cell lines exhibit strong adhesion on areas of UV-irradiated polymer. Masked irradiations open a simple, fast (cell patterns are obtained within a few hours), and economical route to obtain chemically patterned cell culture substrates. The described protocol is advantageous compared to silane-based patterning techniques on glass or thiol-based patterning on gold because of the elimination of any chemical treatment and the small size of achieved structures. The protocol is compatible with common clean room technologies; however, even without access to a clean room, structured substrates can be produced. The described technique can be a useful tool for a variety of cell cultures used to study biological processes like intercellular communication and organogenesis and for applications like biosensing or tissue engineering.
