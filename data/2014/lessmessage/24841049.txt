Objectives:This study evaluated the association among IL-6(-572) and IL-6(-597) genotypes, haplotypes, mRNA, and protein levels with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in India.Methods:For this, 403 participants (153 controls, 61 inactive HBV-carriers, 65 chronic-active HBV patients, 63 HBV-cirrhotics, and 61 HBV-HCC participants) were enrolled in the study. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), ELISA, and RT-PCR methods were used for assessing polymorphism, protein, and the mRNA levels, respectively, of IL-6.Results:The study revealed that the IL-6(-572) GC genotype shared a positive association with hepatitis among controls, and a negative association with cirrhosis and consequent HCC development among carriers. However, the CC genotype shared a significant negative association with cirrhosis among controls and carriers. The IL-6(-597G>A), GA genotype acted as a potential protective factor for hepatitis, cirrhosis, and subsequent HCC development among carriers. The GA and CG haplotypes acted as a vital risk factor for HCC among controls and carriers. On the contrary, the CA haplotype was found to be a potential protective factor for HCC among carriers. Besides, the IL-6 levels significantly increased with cirrhosis development, as compared to carriers and hepatitis subjects.Conclusions:These preliminary findings indicate a potential role of IL-6(-572/-597) genotypes in HBV disease pathogenesis in an Indian population.
