There are very few reports of esophageal G-CSF-producing cancer. This report describes a case of G-CSF-producing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma we recently encountered. A 70-year-old male patient had Stage III esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The patient received preoperative chemotherapy, and therapeutic response for the primary lesion was rated as complete response and that of the lymph node metastasis as stable disease. A radical operation was then performed. A relapse to neutrophilia occurred as liver metastasis recurred postoperation, and serum G-CSF level was high. Immunohistochemical staining of the resected specimen with anti-G-CSF antibody was positive. The patient died about 1 year after the operation. According to our search of the literature, there are 22 cases of esophageal G-CSF-producing cancer. Carcinosarcoma was more frequent as compared to esophageal non-G-CSF-producing cancer. The prognosis was graver in those cases of G-CSF-producing squamous cell carcinoma, relative to cases of non-G-CSF-producing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
