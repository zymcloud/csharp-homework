Screening of known cirrhotics for hepatocellular cancer (HCC) has long been a contentious topic. Studies to date have failed to conclusively prove or disprove the validity of Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) and hepatic ultrasound as screening mechanisms for HCC among cirrhotics. It is not clear whether these screening mechanisms provide any benefit in terms of reduced morbidity and mortality. Screening for HCC among cirrhotics by using AFP and/or imaging at every 6 months correlate with HCC diagnosis, thus portending better treatment options and an improved prognosis. Screening all the known cirrhotics for HCC may lead to decreased mortality.
