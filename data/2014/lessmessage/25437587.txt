Challenges in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents one of the most frequent types of cancer worldwide. Surgery, although only a part of the armamentarium against HCC, represents the cornerstone in the management of this aggressive disease. This article will review the current and future challenges in the surgical management of HCC, with a special emphasis on the following areas: (1) the evolution of staging of the disease and the importance of the biological nature and behavior of HCC, (2) the effort to increase resectability, (3) technical innovations and the role of image-guided surgery, and, finally, (4) the role of liver transplantation in the continuum of care for these patients. Although by no means an exhaustive list, the issues mentioned above represent some of the most promising prospects for significant progress in the management of HCC.
