Background/aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. The only curative treatment is surgery. As hepatocellular carcinoma is often associated with liver cirrhosis, patients are at risk for postoperative liver failure. In the recent years, platelets are thought to play an important role in liver regeneration.The aim of this study was to discover the relevance of postoperative platelet counts after liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma.Methodology:Data of 68 patients who underwent liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma between July 2007 and July 2012 in a single centre were analysed. Postoperative morbidity and mortality were evaluated in regard to postoperative platelet counts. Comparative analysis between patients with platelet counts ≤100 2x109/ l and >100 x109/ l at d1 was performed in regard to postoperative outcome.Results:Within this cohort, 43 patients (63%) suffered from histologically proven liver cirrhosis. Postoperative mortality was statistically significant associated with postoperative reduced platelet counts. Comparative analysis showed significantly elevated postoperative bilirubin levels and lower prothrombin time in patients with platelet counts ≤ 100 1x109/ l at d1.Conclusions:Postoperative low platelet counts are associated with poor outcome after hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma.
