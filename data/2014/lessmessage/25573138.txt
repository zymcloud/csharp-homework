Background:This study analyzed the patient survival outcomes following the resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metachronous adrenal metastasis (MAM) in patients who had undergone liver resection or liver transplantation (LT).Methods:Clinical results were analyzed retrospectively in 26 patients with MAM-HCC who underwent adrenalectomy.Results:The mean interval between initial surgery and adrenalectomy was significantly shorter in the resection group than in the LT group (18.3 ± 14.4 vs. 42.6 ± 13.8 months, p Conclusions:Adrenalectomy is indicated in patients with isolated MAM-HCC. Comparisons with other locoregional treatment modalities and multicenter studies with additional patients are needed to validate the role of adrenalectomy.
