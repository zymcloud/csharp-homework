Background:Based on the results of phase III trial, vinflunine was approved by European Medicines Agency in 2010 as second line treatment of advanced urothelial cancer in patients with good performance status (ECOG 0- 1). The objective of this prospective observational study was to assess vinflunine treatment of advanced urothelial cancer patients in terms of progression free survival and overall survival, and to evaluate vinflunine toxicity.Patients and methods:From April 2011 to June 2014 a total of 16 patients (100%) with advanced urothelial cancer were treated with vinflunine. The median age was 62 years (range 43- 80) and the median Karnofsky index was 90% (range 80- 100%). Thirteen patients (81.25%) had urothelial bladder cancers, two patients (12.50%) suffered from urothelial cancers of ureter, and one patient (6.25%) had urothelial cancer of unknown origin (histology was obtained from liver metastasis). Histologically, all the lesions were grade 3 tumors (100%). The number of metastatic sites ranged from 1- 4 (median 3).Results:The effect of treatment was evaluated in accord with RECIST: two patients (12.50%) obtained partial remission, three (18.75%) stabilization, eight patients (50.00%) progressed, and treatment was suspended in one case at patients request. Vinflunine toxicity grade 3- 4 included neutropenia in six patients (37.50%), leukopenia in four patients (25.00%), anemia in one patient (6.25%), constipation in three patients (18.75%), and febrile neutropenia in one patient (6.25%). Median overall survival was 5.2 months (95% CI 3.4- 8.8) and median progression-free survival was 2.3 months (95% CI 2.1- 3.2).Conclusion:This study summarizes the first Slovak experience with vinflunine therapy. Our data confirmed the efficacy of vinflunine and its acceptable toxicity in the treatment of patients with advanced urothelial cancer previously treated with a platinum-based regimen.Key words: advanced urothelial cancer - vinflunine - progression-free survival - overall survival - side effects.
