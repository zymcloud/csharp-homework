The present study was undertaken to clarify the association of the clinicopathological features of hepatoid adenocarcinoma (HAC) in the stomach, a special kind of carcinoma that histologically resembled hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is characterized by large amounts of Î± -fetoprotein (AFP) in serum, with the clinical prognosis. We collected the data of the clinicopathological features and the follow-up information from a total of 31 HACs from January 2005 to December 2012 in our hospital. High lymphatic (54.8%) and distant (25.8%) metastasis rates before surgery, large proportion of advanced HACs (71.0%) at admission, short median overall survival time (6 months), and low three-year survival rate (22.6%) suggested that HAC in the stomach was an aggressive disease, resulting in a poor prognosis. And pTNM stages, immunohistochemical staining of AFP, CEA, CK7, and CK20 had statistically relation with the survival as the independent risk factors, P
