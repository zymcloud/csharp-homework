To investigate which anticancer drugs and combination of dual drugs could further promote the inhibition of cell growth in vitro against HCC cell line (HepG2) in the hypoxic and hyponutritional culture medium (HHCM) mimicked the different scenarios of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). The cells of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated by TACE suffered various hypoxia and hyponutrition. The cells were treated for 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, and 24 hours, respectively, using 10 drugs including epirubicin (EPI), cisplatin (DDP), mitomycin-C (MMC), oxaliplatin (OXA), hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), gemcitabine (GEM), docetaxel (DTX), thiotepa (TSPA), and pemetrexed disodium (PEM) in 4 concentrations of HHCM (5%, 10%, 25%, and 50%, respectively) mimicking the scenario of TACE and were assessed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The cells treated with combinations of dual drugs for 24 hours were also tested. The sensitive drugs with inhibition rates more than 30% were EPI, MMC, HCPT, OXA, and PEM in 4 types of HHCMs. The sensitivity of the cells to treatment with drugs for 24 hours was significantly higher than the sensitivity of the cells to treatment with drugs for 2 hours in 5%, 10%, and 25% HHCM. The sensitivity of the combination of dual drugs was no more than the sensitivity of the single drug with higher sensitivity in 4 concentrations of HHCM. EPI, MMC, HCPT, OXA, and PEM exhibited cytotoxic activity against HepG2 cells in various hypoxia and hyponutrition states. Prolonging the time of exposure could increase the sensitivity of drug, and the combination of dual drugs cannot enhance the cytotoxic effect.
