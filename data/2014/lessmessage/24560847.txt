Background:The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two device combinations used in parenchymal division during hepatic resections in non-cirrhotic patients and without inflow vascular occlusion.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 47 patients who underwent liver resection at our Institution from 2004 to 2010 using the TissueLink with either the Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) or the Harmonic Scalpel. The TissueLink was used with the CUSA in 27 patients and with the Harmonic Scalpel in 20 patients.Results:Median estimated blood loss (EBL) in the Harmonic Scalpel and CUSA groups was 250 and 1035 mL respectively (p Conclusions:Our results show the Harmonic Scalpel with TissueLink to be a safe, effective method of parenchymal division with significantly less EBL and LOS when compared to CUSA with TissueLink.
