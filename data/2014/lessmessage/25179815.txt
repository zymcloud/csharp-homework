The potential hepatoprotective effect of the methanolic extract of Periploca somaliensis Browicz fruits, its different fractions (n-hexane, chloroform and n-butanol) and the major isolated compound ursolic acid was evaluated using the human hepatoma cell line (Huh7) based on the changes in the activity of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, glutathione and superoxide dismutase. Each sample was tested at three different concentrations (1000, 100 and 10 μg/mL). All tested samples exhibited a potent concentration-independent cytoprotective effect relative to silymarin as a reference standard. Chromatographic fractionation of the chloroform-soluble fraction of the methanol extract of P. somaliensis Browicz fruits afforded two known triterpenes, namely ursolic acid, and 11α,12α-epoxy-3β-hydroxy-olean-13β,28-olide, and a newly discovered one, namely 3β-hydroxy-urs-11-en-13β,28-olide. The structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated by the analysis of 1D and 2D NMR spectral data.
