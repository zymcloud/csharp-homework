Background:Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome characterized by impaired metabolic integrity of myocytes, causing the release of intracellular constituents into the circulation, and can be a serious side effect of drug intake.Case report:This report describes a unique case of rabdomyolysis secondary in which ciprofibrate, sirolimus, cyclosporine, and pegylated interferon-α in a liver transplant patient was used. A 47-year-old male liver transplant recipient in 2009, who had hepatitis C and incidental hepatocellular carcinoma, underwent immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporine and sirolimus). The patient is currently in treatment for viral recurrence with pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin; he had a history of hypertriglyceridemia treated with ciprofibrate. He had development of severe and generalized myalgia and fever after the eighth application of pegylated interferon-α and increasing doses of cyclosporine. Laboratorial tests showed acute renal failure and significant increase in creatine kinase. Rhabdomyolysis secondary to interaction of fibrate-cyclosporine-pegylated interferon-α was postulated.Conclusions:Medical professionals should be aware of possible drug interactions and should monitor patients receiving these drugs.
