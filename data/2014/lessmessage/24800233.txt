Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of death from cancer, with dismal outcomes and an increasing incidence worldwide. Hepatocarcinogenesis is a multistep process that progresses from chronic hepatitis through cirrhosis and/or dysplastic nodule to HCC. However, the detailed molecular pathogenesis remains unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small noncoding RNAs that regulate the translation of many genes, have emerged as key factors involved in several biological processes, including development, differentiation, and cell proliferation. Recent studies have uncovered the contribution of miRNAs to the cancer pathogenesis, as they can behave as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. In addition, other studies have demonstrated their potential values in the clinical management of HCC patients as some miRNAs may be used as prognostic or diagnostic markers. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about the roles of miRNAs in carcinogenesis and progression of HCC. We also discuss the potential application of miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers and their potential roles in the intervention of HCC.
