Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most commonly occurring cancer in Korea and typically has a poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of only 28.6%. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to achieve the earliest possible diagnosis of HCC and to recommend the most up-to-date optimal treatment strategy in order to increase the survival rate of patients who develop this disease. After the establishment of the Korean Liver Cancer Study Group (KLCSG) and the National Cancer Center (NCC), Korea jointly produced for the first time the Clinical Practice Guidelines for HCC in 2003, revised them in 2009, and published the newest revision of the guidelines in 2014, including changes in the diagnostic criteria of HCC and incorporating the most recent medical advances over the past 5 years. In this review, we will address the noninvasive diagnostic criteria and diagnostic algorithm of HCC included in the newly established KLCSG-NCC guidelines in 2014, and review the differences in the criteria for a diagnosis of HCC between the KLCSG-NCC guidelines and the most recent imaging guidelines endorsed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS), the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) system, the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) and the Japan Society of Hepatology (JSH).
