In vitro immunohistochemical investigations on the human hepatoma cell line (Huh7) infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) strain JFH-1 showed that AV0012 compound blocks the early stages of viral infection. AV0012 also blocked viral infection spread in tissue culture through the secreted virus and through tight cell-to-cell contact. AV0012 is a specific inhibitor of HCV but not of related pestivirus, flaviviruses and other RNA-containing viruses such as bovine diarrhea (BVDV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis (strain TC-83), dengue type 2 (New Guinea), yellow fever (strain 17D), west Nile fever, parainfluenza (type 3) virus, RSV (strain A2), and Rhinovirus (type 2 strain HGP). It is established that human serum does not significantly affect the antiviral activity of AV0012 in vitro. The drug combination studies with AV0012 and interferon alpha 2a in vitro showed that the two inhibitors act additively, which makes possible the use of this combination in clinical tests. AV0012 is highly soluble and stable in aqueous solutions and murine blood plasma, has limited metabolic stability, low binding to human plasma proteins, high permeability through biological membranes, and only interacts with isoenzymes 2D6 and 3A4 of human cytochrome P450. In animal pharmacokinetic studies, AV0012 was rapidly absorbed into the blood stream upon oral administration, showed sufficiently long half-elimination times, and had high oral bioavailability that reached 92% in monkeys. Further preclinical development of AV0012 is in progress.
