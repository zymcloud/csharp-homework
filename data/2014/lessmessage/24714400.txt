Background/aims:It has been demonstrated that cryptogenic pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) is associated with colonic mucosal defect, especially colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, the screening of CRC in patients with cryptogenic PLA is important. This study was to investigate whether computed tomographic colonography (CTC) has value as a follow-up modality as well as CRC screening tool in patients with PLA.Methods:A retrospective evaluation of 109 patients with cryptogenic PLA who underwent CTC or colonoscopy for CRC screening between July 2005 and July 2012 was performed. The patients were divided into a CTC group (n = 68) and colonoscopy group (n = 41) after treatment of liver abscess, and compared concerning the detection rate of advanced neoplasia, consisting of advanced adenomas and invasive carcinomas. Patients with advanced polyps in CTC surveillance underwent subsequent colonoscopy.Results:Advanced colonic neoplasia was detected in 9 of the 68 patients (13.2%) in the CTC group and 8 of the 41 patients (19.5%) in the conventional colonoscopy group (p = 0.42). The treatment response of all abscess lesions was clearly visualized on CTC, with complete resolution in 17.6% (12/68) of patients. After adjustment for sex and pathogens, old age (â‰¥65 years) was significantly associated with advanced neoplasia (OR 5.481; 95% CI 1.757-17.100; p = 0.03).Conclusion:CTC has a valuable dual role as a follow-up modality and in the screening of CRC in patients with cryptogenic PLA, particularly in elderly patients over 65 years of age.
