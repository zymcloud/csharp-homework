Background and study aims:There is still need for accurate markers for early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and assessment of prognosis. The aim of this study is to investigate interleukin (IL)-32, IL-1 beta, IL-18, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) in the diagnosis and assessment of prognosis of HCC.Patients and methods:Fifty patients with HCC and 15 healthy volunteers were enroled into this prospective study. Serum samples were obtained at the first admission before any treatment was given. Serum IL-32, IL-1 beta, IL-18, VCAM-1, and EpCAM levels were determined using ELISA kits.Results:The mean age of the patient group and controls was 60±9years and 56±8years, respectively. The mean serum level of IL-32 was higher in patients with HCC than in the control subjects (65.1 vs. 14.1pg/mL; p0.05). Alpha-foetoprotein, IL-32, IL-18, EpCAM, and VCAM had valuable cutoff levels to differentiate between patients with HCC and control group (pConclusions:Although cytokines can be a diagnostic marker for HCC, they did not have any significant prognostic value in patients with HCC. Only EpCAM may be used to determine the prognosis of HCC, thereby assisting with treatment management.
