Aims:The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of heat sink on the recurrence of hepatic malignant tumors Subjects and methods:This study included 564 hepatic malignant tumors Statistical analysis used:SPSS software version 17.0 was used for data processing, and the Ï‡2 test was used for comparative analysis. Two-sided P Results:A total of 33 recurrences were found: 15 in the MR group (15/468), 12 in the US group (12/53), and 6 in the CT group (6/43). Of the 101 lesions adjacent to blood vessels larger than 3 mm, 20 showed recurrence: 10 in the MR group (10/77), 7 in the US group (7/17), and 3 in the CT group (3/7). The recurrence rate of perivascular lesions was higher than that of nonperivascular lesions, and the rate in the MR group was lower those in the US and CT groups.Conclusions:The curative effect of MRI-guided RFA is better than those of US- and CT-guided ablation. The heat sink effect is an important factor affecting recurrence of hepatic malignant tumors after RFA.
