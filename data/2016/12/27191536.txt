Background:Evidence is lacking regarding how Helicobacter pylori infection status, eradication history, and ABO blood type affect the development of gastric cancer (GC) given the multifactorial and distinctive etiology according to cancer location (noncardia vs cardia) and histologic type (intestinal vs diffuse-type). We evaluated the effect of H. pylori infection status incorporated with H. pylori eradication history and ABO genotype on GC development according to cancer location and histologic type.Methods:A case-control study of 997 patients with noncardia GC (NCGC) and 1147 control subjects was performed using risk analyses with 14 factors including H. pylori infection with eradication history and ABO genotype. As final analyses, multivariable logistic regression models were fitted. Additionally, H. pylori infection status with eradication history was tested for its association with age, atrophic gastritis (AG), and intestinal metaplasia (IM).Results:The ABO genotype with the B allele was associated with a significantly lower risk of NCGC of both histologic types. The reduction in risk for NCGC by adding the B allele was more prominent in diffuse-type than that in the intestinal-type. H. pylori infection with eradication history was associated with a significantly lower risk of NCGC of both histologic types, compared with those without eradication history (odds ratio (OR), 0.22; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.14-0.34) approaching that of uninfected subjects. Past infection status without an eradication history was associated with older age, AG, and IM.Conclusions:H. pylori eradication and the B allele decreased the risks of the intestinal and diffuse-types of NCGC. H. pylori eradication revealed a strong association against developing NCGC. Therefore, it should be considered as a primary measure in NCGC prevention.
