Aim:In the 7th edition of the TNM classification, not only HCC with distant metastases but also those with regional lymph node metastases are classified as stage IV.Materials and methods, results:From our prospectively recorded tumor registry, 138 patients (17 %) with HCC were in stage IV. Among those were 68 and 70, respectively, in stage IVA (regional lymph node metastases) and IVB (distant metastases). The tumors were less frequently treated with resection or local ablative treatment (chemoembolization, RFA, SIRT, percutaneous radiation) than patients in stage I-III. Ten HCCs were resected. Five of the resected patients were in stage IVA and five in stage IVB. After tumor resection, patients lived longer than those who underwent local or systemic treatment only (p = 0.003 or p = 0.001, respectively). In the univariate survival analysis, the stage IV patients' long-term survival was decreased statistically significantly through elevated bilirubin, low albumin, Okuda stage III and BCLC stage D. Patients' age and sex, pre-treatment AFP level, Child stage and the presence of venous invasion did not influence survival. In the multivariate analysis (Cox regression), tumor resection and BCLC stage were independent prognostic factors.Conclusion:Patients with HCC in TNM stage IV have a very poor prognosis. Only few patients are eligible for resection because of the extent of tumor growth, comorbidities and general condition. These, however, benefit markedly from tumor resection with lymph node dissection and possibly resection of distant metastases.
