We report a 60-year-old male patient who developed extrahepatic metastases in bone, peritoneum, and lymph nodes (confirmed by computed tomography and positron emission tomography-computed tomography) after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma. He was treated with sorafenib (800 mg/day) but developed grade 3 hand-foot syndrome. He continued to be treated with sorafenib but at a lower dose (400 mg/week). The response to sorafenib therapy was graded as complete response at 6 months by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Sorafenib was continued for 8 months and the patient remained in complete response for 11 months. Further reporting of similar cases should help design treatment strategies and evaluate predictors of the response to sorafenib therapy.
