Glycosylation profiles significantly change during oncogenesis. Aberrant glycosylation can be used as a cancer biomarker in clinical settings. Different glycoforms can be separately detected using lectin affinity electrophoresis and lectin array-based methods. However, most methodologies and procedures need experienced technique to perform the assays and expertise to interpret the results. To apply glycomarkers for clinical practice, a robust assay system with an easy-to-use workflow is required. Wako's μTASWako i30, a fully automated immunoanalyzer, was developed for in vitro diagnostics based on microfluidic technology. It utilizes the principles of liquid-phase binding assay, where immunoreactions are performed in a liquid phase, and electrokinetic analyte transport assay. Capillary electrophoresis on microfluidic chip has enabled the detection of different glycoform types of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a serum biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma. AFP with altered glycosylation can be separated based on the reactivity to Lens culinaris agglutinin on electrophoresis. The glycoform AFP-L3 was reportedly more specific in hepatocellular carcinoma. This assay system can provide a high sensitivity and rapid results in 9 min. The test results for ratio of AFP-L3 to total AFP using μTASWako i30 are correlated with those of conventional methodology. The μTASWako assay system and the technology can be utilized for glycosylation analysis in the postgenomic era.
