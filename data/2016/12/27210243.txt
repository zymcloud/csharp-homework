Aim:To clarify the frequency of fatty change in moderately and poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (mHCCs and pHCCs) and its relationship to arterial blood flow.Materials and methods:One hundred and thirty-six surgically resected HCC lesions were studied. All patients had undergone dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with chemical-shift-encoded water-fat imaging (CSI). The presence of fat was identified by a signal drop-off on CSI and confirmed at pathology. Lesions were classified into four groups in the arterial phase; G1, hypointense; G2, isointense; G3, slightly and heterogeneously hyperintense; G4, markedly and homogeneously hyperintense. The number of cumulative arteries (CAs) in the tumours in the pathology examination were counted.Results:A fat component was observed significantly more frequently in the pHCCs (13/21; 61.9%) compared to the mHCCs (32/101; 31.7%; p=0.013). The numbers of lesions in each group were as follows: (G1, G2, G3, G4) = (18, 9, 23, 4) in the HCCs with fat; (1, 6, 24, 51) in the HCCs without fat (pConclusion:A fat component was more commonly observed in the pHCCs than in the mHCCs. The present results showed a possible mechanism of fatty change in mHCCs and pHCCs in relation to decreased arterial blood supply.
