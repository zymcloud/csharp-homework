Background:While spontaneously ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a poor prognosis, the true impact of a rupture on survival after hepatic resection is unclear.Methods:Fifty-eight patients with ruptured HCC and 1922 with non-ruptured HCC underwent hepatic resection between 2000 and 2013. To correct the difference in the clinicopathological factors between the two groups, propensity score matching (PSM) was used at a 1:1 ratio, resulting in a comparison of 42 patients/group. We investigated outcomes in all patients with ruptured HCC and compared outcomes between the two matched groups.Results:Of the 58 patients with ruptured HCC, 7 patients (13 %) died postoperatively. Overall survival (OS) rate at 5 years after hepatic resection was 37 %. Emergency hepatic resection was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death and Child-Pugh class B for unfavorable OS in multivariate analysis. Clinicopathological variables were well-balanced between the two groups after PSM. No significant differences were noted in incidence of in-hospital death (ruptured HCC 12 % vs non-ruptured HCC 2 %, p = 0.202) or OS rate (5/10-year; 42 %/38 % vs 67 %/30 %, p = 0.115).Conclusion:Emergency hepatic resection should be avoided for ruptured HCC in Child-Pugh class B patients. Rupture itself was not a risk for unfavorable surgical outcomes.
