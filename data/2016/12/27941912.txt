This study aimed at developing simple, sensitive and rapid electrochemical approach to quantitatively determine and assess the toxicity of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP), a priority pollutant and has potential risk to public health through a novel poly(eosin Y, EY)/hydroxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes composite modified electrode (PEY/MWNTs-OH/GCE). The distinct feature of this easy-fabricated electrode was the synergistic coupling effect between EY and MWNTs-OH that enabled a high electrocatalytic activity to 2,4-DCP. Under optimum conditions, the oxidation peak current enhanced linearly with concentration increasing from 0.005 to 0.1 μM and 0.2 to 40.0 μM, and revealed the detection limit of 1.5 nM. Moreover, the PEY/MWNTs-OH/GCE exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity toward intracellular electroactive species. Two sensitive electrochemical signals ascribed to guanine/xanthine and adenine/hypoxanthine in human hepatoma (HepG2) cells were detected simultaneously. The sensor was successfully applied to evaluate the toxicity of 2,4-DCP to HepG2 cells. The IC50 values based on the two electrochemical signals are 201.07 and 252.83 μM, respectively. This study established a sensitive platform for the comprehensive evaluation of 2,4-DCP and posed a great potential to simplify environmental toxicity monitoring.
