Microwave ablation has been used clinically as an alternative to surgical resection. However, lack of real-time imaging to assess treated regions may compromise treatment outcomes. We previously introduced electrode displacement elastography (EDE) for strain imaging and verified its feasibility in vivo on porcine animal models. In this study, we evaluated EDE on 44 patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma, treated using microwave ablation. The ablated region was identified on EDE images for 40 of the 44 patients. Ablation areas averaged 13.38 ± 4.99 cm2 on EDE, compared with 7.61 ± 3.21 cm2 on B-mode imaging. Contrast and contrast-to-noise ratios obtained with EDE were 232% and 98%, respectively, significantly higher than values measured on B-mode images (p < 0.001). This study indicates that EDE is feasible in patients and provides improved visualization of the ablation zone compared with B-mode ultrasound.
