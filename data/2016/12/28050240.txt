Aim:To examine the association of PNPLA3 polymorphisms in chronic hepatitis C patients and development of liver disease spectrum.Methods:Literature was searched systematically from PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane search engines for full-length articles written in English that examined PNPLA3 polymorphism in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. Studies evaluating the association of PNPLA3 polymorphism spectrum (fatty liver, steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma) of CHC were included. Pooled data are reported as OR with 95%CI. Our study endpoint was the risk of the entire liver disease spectrum including: Steatosis/fatty liver, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma in CHC patients with PNPLA3 polymorphisms.Results:Of 380 studies identified, a total of 53 studies were included for full-text review. Nineteen on chronic hepatitis C were eligible for analysis. Pooled ORs for rs738409 GG compared to CC and CG among patients with fatty liver was 2.214 (95%CI: 1.719-2.853). ORs among advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis were 1.762 (95%CI: 1.258-2.468). Similar odds ratios among hepatocellular carcinoma patients were 2.002 (95%CI: 1.519-2.639). Pooled ORs for rs738409 GG and CG compared to CC among patients with fatty liver were 1.750 (95%CI: 1.542-1.986). Pooled ORs for advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis patients were 1.613 (95%CI: 1.211-2.147). All analyses were homogenous and without publication bias except one. The associations were maintained after adjusting for publication bias and heterogeneity.Conclusion:PNPLA3 polymorphisms have strong association with increased risk and severity of the liver disease spectrum in CHC patients.
