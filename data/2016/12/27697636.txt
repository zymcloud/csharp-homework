Objective:Annexin A5 (Anxa5) is associated with the progression of some cancers, while its role and regulation mechanism in tumor lymphatic metastasis is rarely reported. This study aims to investigate the influence of Anxa5 knockdown on the malignant behaviours of murine hepatocarcinoma Hca-F cell line with high lymph node metastatic (LNM) potential and the underlying regulation mechanism.Methods:RNA interfering was performed to silence Anxa5 in Hca-F. Monoclonal shRNA-Anxa5- Hca-F cells were obtained via G418 screening by limited dilution method. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting (WB) were applied to measure Anxa5 expression levels. CCK-8, Boyden transwell-chamber and in situ LN adhesion assays were performed to explore the effects of Anxa5 on the proliferation, migration, invasion and adhesion capacities of Hca-F. WB and qRT-PCR were used to detect the level changes of key molecules in corresponding signal pathways.Results:We obtained two monoclonal shRNA-Anxa5-transfected Hca-F cell lines with stable knockdowns of Anxa5. Anxa5 knockdown resulted in significantly reduced proliferation, migration, invasion and in situ LN adhesion potentials of Hca-F in proportion to its knockdown extent. Anxa5 downregulation enhanced E-cadherin levels in Hca-F. Moreover, Anxa5 affected Hca-F behaviours specifically via ERK2/p-ERK2/c-Jun/p-c-Jun(Ser73) instead of p38MAPK/c-Jun, Jnk/c-Jun and AKT/c-Jun pathways.Conclusions:Anxa5 mediates the in vitro malignant behaviours of murine hepatocarcinoma Hca-F cells via ERK2/c-Jun/p-c-Jun(Ser73) and ERK2/E-cadherin pathways. It is an important molecule in metastasis (especially LNM) and a potential therapeutic target for hepatocarcinoma.
