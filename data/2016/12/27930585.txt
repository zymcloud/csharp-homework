To investigate the incidence and outcome of major complication following conventional transarterial embolization/chemoembolization (TAE/TACE) therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).From May 2010 to May 2016, all patients with major complication following conventional TAE/TACE for HCC were included. Major complication was defined as admission to a hospital for therapy, an unplanned increase in the level of care, prolonged hospitalization, permanent adverse sequelae, or death after conventional TAE/TACE therapy by Society of Interventional Radiology.During the study period, a total of 2863 TAE/TACE procedures were performed among 1120 patients, and a total of 24 patients (21 male and 3 female) developed major complication with the incidence of 2.1% (24/1120) per patient and 0.84% (24/2863) per TAE/TACE procedure. The major complications were liver rupture (n = 6), liver abscess (n = 5), femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (n = 3), cholecystitis (n = 2), biloma (n = 2), pulmonary embolism (n = 2), and 1 each of the following: cerebral lipiodol embolism, tumor lysis syndrome, partial intestinal obstruction, gallbladder perforation. The mean interval from last TAE/TACE procedure to the diagnosis of major complication was 11.1 Â± 7.7 days. The treatments of the complications were conservative treatment (n = 12), conservative treatment plus percutaneous drainage (n = 3), ultrasound-guided thrombin injection (n = 3), conservative treatment plus TAE (n = 2), and conservative treatment plus surgery (n = 2). Of the 24 patients, 20 patients were recovered, and remaining 4 patients were died of major complications; therefore, the mortality rate of major complication was 16.7% (4/24).Major complication following conventional TAE/TACE therapy is uncommon; the outcomes are benign of most major complications, but some are mortality.
