Aim:Little is known about the impact of radiotherapy associated early hepatic toxicities. This study is to investigate the risk factors and outcome of early radiation-induced liver disease (early-RILD) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:One hundred patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma receiving hepatic radiotherapy were included in this retrospective analysis. All had no evidence of intrahepatic tumor progression within 3 months after initiating radiotherapy. The toxicities were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for adverse events version 4.0. Early-RILD was defined as any detectable events of RILD occurring during or within 2 weeks after the ending of radiotherapy. Patient- and radiotherapy-related data, and several staging/scoring parameters were retrieved for analysis. Logistic regression analysis was used to find risk factors for early-RILD. Cox regression model was performed to explore prognosticators for survival.Results:Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score >5 was the predictor for early-RILD (odds ratio 5.38, P = 0.004). The incidence of early-RILD in patients with CTP scores 6/7 and 5 was 34% and 13.2%, respectively. Early-RILD and a Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score > 2 were the two prognostic factors associated with inferior overall survival (hazard ratio 2.79, P = 0.04; hazard ratio = 3.79, P = 0.04, respectively). The median overall survival for patients with early-RILD was 3.5 months compared with 12.7 months in those without this event.Conclusion:The occurrence of early-RILD is associated with high mortality. A CTP score >5 is the most informative factor predicting early-RILD.
