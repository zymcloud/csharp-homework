Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies and the second cause of cancer-related deaths around the world. Pterostilbene (PTE), is a natural analog of resveratrol, possessing diverse pharmacological activities. In the present study, we aimed to examine the effect of PTE on tumor growth in mouse models of HCC and to elucidate the possible molecular mechanism in vivo and in vitro. We showed that PTE dose-dependently suppressed tumor growth in mice induced by diethylnitrosamine plus carbon tetrachloride, as evidenced by a decrease in the number of tumors and in the maximum size of the tumors. PTE concentration-dependently inhibited cell viability and proliferation in HepG2 cells. PTE increased caspase-3 activities and apoptosis in liver tumor tissues and cells, indicating the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. PFTα, superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) lentivirus and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly inhibited PTE-induced inhibition of tumor growth and cell proliferation and increase in apoptosis. PTE dose-dependently increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels both in liver tumor tissues and cells, which were inhibited by PFTα, SOD2 lentivirus and NAC. PTE resulted in a significant decrease in SOD2 expression in liver tumor tissues and cells, which were inhibited by PFTα, but not NAC, indicating that PTE-induced ROS generation was attributed to p53-mediated downregulation of SOD2. Collectively, PTE increased p53 expression, decreased SOD2 expression, and resulted in an increase in the ROS levels and the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, leading to inhibition of tumor growth and cell proliferation. These data demonstrated that the p53/SOD2/ROS pathway is critical for PTE-mediated inhibition of tumor growth and HCC cell proliferation.
