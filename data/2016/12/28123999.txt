Background:Liver transplantation is an effective treatment modality for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Due to deceased organ shortage, living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) accounts for the majority of liver transplants in Korea. The aim of this study is to evaluate the recent trend of LDLT for HCC, and to suggest guidelines and criteria for selecting the appropriate candidates for LDLT.Methods:Between January 2000 and December 2015, 532 patients underwent LDLT for HCC. Clinicopathologic data were analyzed as well as overall survival rate (SR) and disease-free survival rate (DFSR) according to the Milan criteria based on explant pathology, positron emission tomography (PET) positivity, and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level.Results:The 5-year overall SR and DFSR were 81.5% and 75.5% respectively. According to our previously reported combination of AFP and PET [Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) criteria]; low risk group [AFP 200 ng/mL, PET (-) or AFP 200 ng/mL, PET (+)], the 5-year DFSR of low risk group was 86.1%, intermediate risk group was 79.0%, and high risk group was 18.5% (PConclusions:In conclusion, our data and experience suggest that a continued paradigm shift from a conventional size based criteria to a biological marker based criteria is indicated when evaluating LDLT candidates with HCC.
