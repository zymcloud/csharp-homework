Aim:To investigate the effect of a sirolimus-based immunosuppressive protocol on tumor recurrence and survival after liver transplantation (LT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 142 HCC patients who underwent LT in our hospital from January 2006 to January 2012. The patients were divided into the sirolimus (SRL) group (62 cases) and non-sirolimus (control) group (80 cases). Disease-free survival (DFS) and tumor-bearing survival after tumor recurrence were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:No significant difference in DFS was observed between the two groups. Furthermore, DFS showed no significant differences in the subgroups of patients who met the Milan criteria, exceeded the Milan criteria but met the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) criteria, or exceeded the UCSF criteria between the two groups. In the control group, 21 patients who were administered SRL after tumor recurrence had a median tumor-bearing survival time of 12months (3-34months), while 14 patients who did not experience a change in their immunosuppressive protocol after tumor recurrence had a median tumor-bearing survival time of 8months (6-22months). There was a significant difference in the tumor-bearing survival time between these patients (P=0.039).Conclusions:Not all HCC patients benefited from the sirolimus-based immunosuppressive protocol after LT. However, sirolimus may prolong the survival time of patients after tumor recurrence.
