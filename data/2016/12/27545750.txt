Background - aims: The long-term survival of pancreatic cancer is poor even after potentially curative resection. The incidence of local-regional failures is high. There is evidence that hyperthermic intraperitoneal intraoperative chemotherapy (HIPEC) is effective in controlling the local-regional failures. The purpose of the study is to identify the effect of HIPEC after surgical removal of pancreatic carcinoma. Patients - Methods: Prospective study including 33 patients with resectable pancreatic carcinomas. All patients underwent surgical resection (R0) and ΗIPEC as an adjuvant. Morbidity and hospital mortality were recorded. The patients were followed-up for 5 years. Survival was calculated. Recurrences and the sites of failure were recorded.Results:The mean age of the patients was 67.8 ± 11.1 years (38-86). The hospital mortality was 6.1% (2 patients) and the morbidity 24.2% (8 patients). The overall 5-year survival was 24%. The mean and median survival was 33 and 13 months, respectively. The median follow-up time was 11 months. The recurrence rate was 60.6% (20 patients). Three patients were recorded with local-regional failures (9.1%) and the others with liver metastases.Conclusions:It appears that HIPEC as an adjuvant following potentially curative resection (R0) of pancreatic carcinoma may effectively control the local-regional disease. Prospective randomised studies are required.
