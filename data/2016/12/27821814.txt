Backgrounds and Objective: Mounting evidence suggests that human leukocyte antigen (HLA) plays a central role in anti-virus and tumor defense. To test whether genetic variation in HLA-DRB1 gene, a key component of HLA system, can predict its predisposition to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we thereby conducted an association study by genotyping 8 nonsynonymous polymorphisms in HLA-DRB1 gene among 257 HCC patients and 264 controls.Results:All polymorphisms respected the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The genotypes and alleles of rs17879599 differed significantly between patients and controls after Bonferroni correction (both P Materials and methods:Genotypes were determined by ligase detection reaction. HCC patients were newly diagnosed, histopathologically confirmed or previously untreated and controls were cancer-free.Conclusions:Our findings suggest an independent leading contribution of rs17879599 in the 2nd exon of HLA-DRB1 gene to HCC risk in Han Chinese.
