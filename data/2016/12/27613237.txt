Objective:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is currently performed widely for managing HCC. RFA treatment causes damage around the ablation. Trientine dihydrochloride has been used to reduce the copper in liver.Methods:The rats were treated with trientine dihydrochloride for 5 days before liver RFA. Liver function, copper concentration, inflammation biomarkers and MDA, SOD were analyzed after RFA treatment for 2 h, 2 and 5 days.Results:The results indicated that trientine dihydrochloride reduced the copper in plasma and liver tissue significantly. And trientine dihydrochloride significantly inhibited RFA-induced inflammatory gene expression in liver. Similar inhibitory effects of trientine dihydrochloride were observed on ROS-induced malondialdehyde production in liver tissues.Conclusion:These results suggest that pre-treatment with the selective copper chelator trientine dihydrochloride can inhibit inflammatory response effectively during and after liver RFA in vivo. Chelation of copper to a lower level before liver RFA may be a novel strategy to prevent or ameliorate inflammatory responses in liver induced by RFA and to protect the parenchyma tissues in liver during and after RFA in HCC patients.
