Background:Laparoscopic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is performed in a relatively small number of institutions. Its operative results have been reported to be comparable with that of open laparotomy; however, information on laparoscopic right hemihepatectomy (LRH) is scarce. This study aimed to compare the perioperative outcomes of the right hemihepatectomy via laparoscopic and open approach to treat HCC at a single institution.Methods:From January 2010 to 2015, we performed right hemihepatectomy in 77 HCC patients. LRH was performed in 35 patients and open right hemihepatectomy (ORH) was performed in 42 patients. All clinical data were analyzed retrospectively.Results:The mean LRH operative time was longer than ORH (309±108 vs. 223±110 min; PConclusions:LRH can decrease complications, shorten hospitalization time, is a minimally invasive, safe, and effective way.
