Liver cancer, primarily hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is a major cause of cancer-related death worldwide. HCC is a suitable model of inflammation-induced cancer because more than 90% of HCC cases are caused by liver damage and chronic inflammation. Several inflammatory response pathways, such as NF-ÎºB and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways, play roles in the crosstalk between inflammation and HCC. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved, short endogenous, non-coding single-stranded RNAs that are involved in various biological and pathological processes by regulating gene expression and protein translation. Evidence showed that miRNAs play a pivotal role in hepatitis virus infection and serve as promoters or inhibitors of inflammatory response. Aberrant miRNA was observed during liver inflammation and HCC. Many dysregulated miRNAs modulate the initiation and progression of inflammation-induced HCC. This review summarizes the role and functions of miRNAs in inflammation-associated HCC, as well as the designed therapeutics targeting miRNAs to treat liver inflammation and HCC.
