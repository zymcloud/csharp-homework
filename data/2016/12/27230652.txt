Background:Although the effectiveness of perioperative adjuvant therapy in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been investigated, the efficacy of preoperative therapy is unclear. Herein, we report a case of pathological complete response after percutaneous isolated hepatic perfusion (PIHP) for HCC involving portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT).Case presentation:A 77-year-old woman was referred to our institute with a liver mass detected on a routine health screening. Computed tomography revealed a 28 Ã— 25 mm HCC in the left lobe of the liver and a tumor thrombus in the left and right portal branches (T4N0M0, stage IVA). The patient received a single dose of preoperative PIHP with doxorubicin plus mitomycin C, without severe toxicity. After the chemotherapy, she underwent extended left hepatic lobectomy and thrombectomy of the PVTT. No cancer cells were detected during histopathological analysis, indicating pathological complete response. She remained relapse-free 12 months after the surgery.Conclusions:We experienced a case of pathological complete response after preoperative PIHP with doxorubicin plus mitomycin C for HCC involving PVTT.
