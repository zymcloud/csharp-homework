Objective:Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQB1 genetic polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk of hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-related HCC). We aimed to evaluate the influence of genetic polymorphisms in HLA-DQB1 exon region and neighboring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs rs9275572 and rs2244546) on survival of HBV-related HCC patients undergoing hepatic resection.Methodology:All SNPs were genotyped by sequencing DNA isolated from tumor samples of 483 patients with HBV-related HCC.Results:We identified rs9275572 and HLA-DQB1 haplotype CCCCC (constituted by rs1130375C, rs12722107C, rs12722106C, rs36222416C and rs3189152C) were significantly associated with overall survival (OS) of HBV-related HCC patients (P=0.015 and 0.049, respectively), after adjusting for serum AFP level, the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages, Child-Pugh score, regional invasion, radical hepatic resection and adjuvant antiviral treatment. In stratified analyses, the AG/GG genotype of rs9275572 significantly decreased risk of death among patients with younger age, serum AFP levels ≥400ng/mL, tumor size ≥10cm, BCLC stage A and radical hepatic resection. HLA-DQB1 haplotype CCCCC was significantly protective for male patients, patients with serum AFP levels Conclusions:The AG/GG genotype of rs9275572 and HLA-DQB1 Block2 CCCCC haplotype may have protective effects in HBV-related HCC patients receiving hepatic resection.
