Hepatitis B and C infections can be either acute or chronic. The chronic infection can culminate in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Influence of the host genetic makeup on conversion of acute to chronic infection, development of cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma is an interesting area of research. Variability in different immune system genes may account for such differences in the outcome of infection. This article discusses single nucleotide polymorphisms in different host immunomodulator genes that have been frequently reported to influence the outcome of infection and severity of disease. The genetic variability could be utilized for the prediction of disease outcome and treatment responses.
