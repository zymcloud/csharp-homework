Objectives:To compare 10-minute (min) delayed hepatocyte phase imaging (HPI) using a 30° flip angle (FA) (10m-FA30) and 20-min delayed HPI using a 10° FA (20m-FA10) or 30° FA (20m-FA30) in Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI in patients with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, in terms of lesion-to-liver contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and detection sensitivity for focal hepatic lesions (FHLs).Materials and methods:One hundred and four patients with 168 HCCs and 55 benign FHLs who underwent Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI with 10m-FA30, 20m-FA10, and 20m-FA30 were enrolled. Patients were divided into two groups according to the Child-Pugh classification: group A with chronic hepatitis or Child-Pugh A cirrhosis and group B with Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis. Lesion-to-liver CNR for HCCs was compared between 10m-FA30 and 20m-FA10 or 20m-FA30 for each group. The presence of FHLs was evaluated using a four-point scale by two independent reviewers, and the detection sensitivity was analyzed.Results:In group A, the CNR for HCCs (n = 86) on 10m-FA30 (165.8 ± 99.7) was significantly higher than that on 20m-FA10 (113.4 ± 71.4) and lower than that of 20m-FA30 (210.2 ± 129.3). However, there was no significant difference in the sensitivity of FHL detection between 10m-FA30 (mean 95.0% for two reviewers) and 20m-FA10 (94.7%) or 20m-FA30 (94.7%). In group B, the CNR (54.0 ± 36.4) for HCCs (n = 57) and the sensitivity (94.2%) of FHL detection for 10m-FA30 were significantly higher than those for 20m-FA10 (41.8 ± 36.4 and 80.8%, respectively) and were not different from those for 20m-FA30 (62.7 ± 44.4 and 93.3%, respectively).Conclusion:The diagnostic performance of 10m-FA30 was similar to or higher than 20m-FA10 or 20m-FA30 in both groups A and B. This finding indicates that 10m-FA30 could replace 20-min delayed HPI regardless of patient liver function and reduce the delay time by 10 minutes.
