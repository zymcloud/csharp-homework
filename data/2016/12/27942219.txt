Objective:The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and outcomes of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for treating patients with hepatocellular carcinoma involving portal vein tumor thrombus.Methods:Between January 2000 and December 2013, a total of 182 hepatocellular carcinoma patients with portal vein tumor thrombus were retrospectively analyzed: 68 patients were treated by 3DCRT alone (group A), 74 by TACE alone (group B), and 40 by a combination of 3DCRT + TACE (group C). The overall survival (OS) of the three groups was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method. The independent predictors of survival were identified using multivariate analysis.Results:The total effective rate (complete response + partial response) among all patients was 44% (80/182). The objective response rate (complete response + partial response) was higher in group C than in group A or B, but the differences were not significant. OS rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were significantly higher in group C than in group A or B (P<0.05), while OS rates were similar between groups A and B. Multivariate analysis identified serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein <400 ng/mL and the use of 3DCRT + TACE as independent predictors of better OS.Conclusion:These results suggest that combining 3DCRT with TACE may provide better OS than either technique alone in hepatocellular carcinoma patients with portal vein tumor thrombus.
