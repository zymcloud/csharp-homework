Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for about 90% of all malignant tumors of liver, ranking fifth in the worldwide incidence of malignant tumors and the third in fatality. More and more evidences suggest that cancer is a metabolic-related disease. From the analysis of recent clinical research data, we found that as the severity of the cirrhosis aggravated, patients with HCC and end-stage liver cirrhosis had a flat energy metabolism which was better than it in patients with simple end-stage liver cirrhosis. Based on these clinical phenomenon, the major aim of this study is to present a new hypothesis: "compensated liver function mechanism" for patients with HCC and liver cirrhosis, cancer cells may play a role to compensate liver function. In this study, we elaborated relevant content about this novel standpoint combined with tumor energy metabolism reprogramming mechanism and tumor cell origin as well as cell exchange mechanism.
