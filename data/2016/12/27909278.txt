Right atrial tumor thrombus is rare in patients with visceral malignant tumors and can cause right heart failure or sudden death. We present 2 cases of right atrial tumor thrombus treated under deep hypothermic intermittent circulatory arrest (DHICA). A 45-year-old man with right heart failure was diagnosed with right renal cancer extending to the right atrium. Computed tomography revealed no metastasis. He underwent right nephrectomy and tumor thrombus resection under DHICA. He was discharged on postoperative day 11 in good clinical course. A 67-year-old woman with hepatitis C virus liver cirrhosis( Child-Pugh A) was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma and right atrial tumor. She underwent S8 and tumor thrombus resection under DHICA. Hemorrhagic diathesis was controlled using fresh frozen plasma transfusion. She was discharged on postoperative day 24 without liver failure. In cases of atrial tumor thrombus resection, DIHCA may be useful to achieve a bloodless operation field because the procedure is relatively simple and the primary disease need not be considered.
