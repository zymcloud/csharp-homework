Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most frequently occurring cancers and the leading causes of cancer mortality worldwide. Identification of the signaling pathways regulating liver carcinogenesis is critical for developing novel chemoprevention and targeted therapies. C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is a member of a larger group of serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinases known as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. JNK is an important signaling component that converts external stimuli into a wide range of cellular responses, including cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, migration, invasion, and apoptosis, as well as the development of inflammation, fibrosis, cancer growth, and metabolic diseases. Because of the essential roles of JNK in these cellular functions, deregulated JNK is often found to contribute to the development of HCC. Recently, the functions and molecular mechanisms of JNK in HCC development have been addressed using mouse models and human HCC cell lines. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate that the activation of JNK by oncogenes can promote the development of cancers by regulating the transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î²/Smad pathway, which makes the oncogenes/JNK/Smad signaling pathway an attractive target for cancer therapy. Additionally, JNK-targeted therapy has a broad potential for clinical applications. In summary, we are convinced that promising new avenues for the treatment of HCC by targeting JNK are on the horizon, which will undoubtedly lead to better, more effective, and faster therapies in the years to come.
