It remains controversial whether transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) should be performed in patients with advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present large retrospective cohort study aimed to define the survival outcome following TACE of advanced HCC and to identify the prognostic factors. Five hundred eight patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) C-stage HCC, Child-Pugh A/B who were treated with TACE between November 1998 and December 2013 were identified. There was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0 and those with ECOG â‰¥1 (10.5 months vs. 11.9 months, P = 0.87). The median OS of patients without portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) was longer than that of patients with PVTT (16.9 vs. 6.1 months, P 6.5 (high-risk group) (24.1 vs. 7.5 months, respectively; P
