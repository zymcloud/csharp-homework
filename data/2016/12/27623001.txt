Background/aim:Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (US) has improved the detection and characterization of focal hepatic lesions. Recently, the importance of obtaining high-quality samples in the biopsy of hepatic lesions has been increasing not only in the field of pathological diagnosis but also in molecular analysis for predicting the effectiveness of anticancer agents and molecular targeted drugs. We evaluated the utility of Sonazoid-enhanced ultrasonography (SEUS) in guiding percutaneous biopsy of focal hepatic lesions by comparing the results of histopathological diagnosis between B-mode US and SEUS guidance.Methods and materials:This retrospective study examined 121 focal hepatic lesions in 108 patients (mean age: 63.8 years) referred for US-guided percutaneous biopsy. The technical success rate was defined as the percentage of the lesions diagnosed clearly at the initial biopsy.Results:Among 121 lesions, 56 lesions were subjected to biopsy with B-mode US guidance whereas 65 were subjected to SEUS guidance. The technical success rate was significantly higher under SEUS guidance than under B-mode US guidance (92.3 vs. 76.8%, respectively, PConclusion:SEUS guidance is recommended for more accurate localization of suitable hepatic lesion biopsy areas as it increases conspicuity and differentiates viable areas from denaturalization or necrosis.
