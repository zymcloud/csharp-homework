The Association of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and type I hereditary angioedema is a very rare condition in medicine. The case reported by Muller et al., describes the coexistence of the two diseases and emphasizes the need for listing HHT patients for liver transplantation in case indications occurs, such as the presence of HCC, abnormally increased cardiac output, and gastrointestinal bleeding as reported for this case. The case described by Mueller et al. is anecdotal for the usefulness of liver transplantation in HHT patients and shows that liver transplantation may be the best supportive care and, sometimes, the unique and final therapeutic option for these patients.
