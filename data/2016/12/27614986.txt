This study evaluated the levels of As, Cd, and Pb in muscle and liver the cattle and chicken. The risk was estimated for the adult population of a midsized city in southeast Brazil, concerning the tolerable ingestion and cancer risk. Samples of muscle and liver (cattle and chicken) were collected (n = 250). Samples of mineral supplements for cattle (n = 4) and chicken feed samples (n = 4) were evaluated as one of many potential source of contamination. Muscle, liver, mineral supplement, and feed samples were dissolved in acid medium and analyzed by ICP-OES. Daily muscle and liver intake was estimated using a questionnaire (N = 427). Daily intake of trace elements by the population based on the consumption of cattle muscle, cattle liver, chicken muscle, and chicken liver was low, corresponding to 2.76%, 0.33%, 2.12%, and 0.22% of the Tolerable Intake defined by the WHO for As; 0.54%, 0.29% 0.55%, 0.01%, for Cd; and 0.80%, 0.07%, 0.62%, 0.02%, for Pb. The mean of total ingestion of As, Cd and Pb was 5.43%, 1.18% and 1.51%, respectively of Tolerable Intake defined by WHO. Cancer risk was lower than 5 Ã— 10-5 year-1. The results indicate that the muscle and liver consumption is a source of As, Cd, and Pb. Consumers that ingest cattle and chicken muscle need attention in terms the risk of cancer related to intake of As and Cd. Feed and mineral supplementation remain as one of many sources of exposure of As, Cd, and Pb.
