We report a case of sustained remission of a liver transplant patient infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 undergoing hemodialysis treatment. Oral treatment regimen of the HCV infection consists of a combination of sofosbuvir 400 mg after each hemodialysis session and daclatasvir 60 mg daily, for a period of 3 months. Laboratory testing indicate that the combination regimen was well-tolerated with no sign of drug-drug interaction. Confirmation of these clinical observations in large clinical studies may help improve morbidity and decrease mortality outcome in patients infected with HCV and undergoing hemodialysis treatment.
