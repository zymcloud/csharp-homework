Arctigenin (ARG), a nature medicine with many pharmacological activities, was poorly soluble in water and placed restriction on practical usage. Six novel arctigenin monoester derivatives were obtained from the reflux reaction with arctigenin, carboxylic acids (crotonic acid, furoic acid, 2-naphthalene acid and indol-3-acetic acid), EDCI and DMAP in dichloromethane at 60°C for 4-6h and their properties on nitrite scavenging assay were investigated in vitro. Based on the results, the one of the most effective derivatives, arctigenin β-indolylacetate (ARG6), was selected to study anti-tumor activity in vivo at doses of 20 and 40mg/kg. The results showed that comparison with ARG group, ARG6 exhibited more anti-tumor activity in H22 tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, ARG6 exhibited less damage to the liver, kidney, spleen and thymus when compared with those in positive group. Biochemical parameters of ALT, AST, BUN and Cre showed ARG6 had little toxicity to mice as well. ARG6 significantly improved serum cytokine levels of IL-2, IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF-α, and decreased VEGF compared with ARG. Moreover, H & E staining, TUNEL assay and immunohistochemical of tumor issues also indicated that ARG6 exhibited anti-tumor activity in vivo. In brief, the present study provide a method to improve ARG anti-tumor activity and provide a reference for new anti-tumor agent.
