Pharmacotherapeutic options are limited for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, we identified the anti-tumor ligand MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) gene as a susceptibility gene for hepatitis C virus-induced HCC in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). To prove the concept of HCC immunotherapy based on the results of a GWAS, in the present study, we searched for drugs that could restore MICA expression. A screen of the FDA-approved drug library identified the anti-cancer agent vorinostat as the strongest hit, suggesting histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) as potent candidates. Indeed, the HDACi-induced expression of MICA specific to HCC cells enhanced natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity in co-culture, which was further reinforced by treatment with an inhibitor of MICA sheddase. Similarly augmented anti-tumor activity of NK cells via NK group 2D was observed in vivo. Metabolomics analysis revealed HDACi-mediated alterations in energy supply and stresses for MICA induction and HCC inhibition, providing a mechanism for the chemoimmunotherapeutic actions. These data are indicative of promising strategies for selective HCC innate immunotherapy.
