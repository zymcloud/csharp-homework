An increasing body of evidence suggests that downregulation or deletion of HECT domain and ankyrin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (HACE1) gene plays an important role in the occurrence, invasion and metastasis process in many human malignancies and is closely related to prognosis. However, sparse evidence exists concerning the precise function and clinical significance of HACE1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we investigated the expression pattern of HACE1 in HCC tissues and cell lines, and determined the potential functions of HACE1 in HCC cell lines and evaluated the relationships between HACE1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics. Protein and mRNA expression levels of HACE1 in human HCC tissues and cell lines were examined by western blot analysis, quantitative real‑time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses. IHC was used to analyze the correlations between HACE1 expression and clinicopathological features. HACE1 was upregulated in SMCC7721 cells by transfection with pcDNA3.1-HACE1 and Huh7 cells were transfected with siRNA targeting HACE1 for downregulation. Cell Counting Κit-8, Transwell and wound healing assays were performed to investigate the effects of the overexpression and knockdown of HACE1 on cellular proliferation and migration. The results revealed that HACE1 expression was lower in the HCC tissues and cell lines at the mRNA and protein levels compared to levels noted in the matched non‑tumor tissues and the normal liver cell line L02. Knockdown of HACE1 in Huh7 cells accelerated cell proliferation and migration (P
