Liver, the largest intern organ of the human body, is responsible for several vital tasks such as digestive and excretory functions, as well as for nutrients storage and metabolic functions, synthesis of new molecules and purification of toxic chemicals. Cirrhosis, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are the most prevalent liver diseases. Despite all the studies performed so far, treatment options for these diseases are very limited. For this reason, it is urgent to find effective therapies for these pathologies. Several studies have been performed during the last decade about the possible application of human amniotic membrane in hepatic diseases therapy. Promising results about human amniotic membrane or its derived cells, in vitro and in vivo, applications in fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were already published. Since it is an attractive study area, it is becoming a dynamic scientific subject. However, the action mechanisms of human amniotic membrane and its derived cells in hepatic diseases therapy must be precisely known in order that this promising therapy could be clinically used.
