Immune checkpoint proteins programmed death-1 (PD-1) and T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain containing molecule-3 (TIM-3) expression and their gene polymorphisms have separately been shown to be associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study simultaneously examined PD-1 and TIM-3 expression in liver tissues and PD1 and TIM3 polymorphisms and analyzed their correlations in 171 patients with HBV-related HCC and 34 patients with HBV-related cirrhosis.PD-1 and TIM-3 expression in liver tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry and the genotypes of PD1 rs10204525 and TIM3 rs10053538 polymorphisms were determined using genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood as template.Both PD-1 and TIM-3 expressions in liver infiltrating lymphocytes of HCC tumor tissues were significantly higher than those in tumor adjacent tissues or cirrhotic tissues. The elevated PD-1 and TIM-3 expressions were significantly associated with higher tumor grades. The levels between PD-1 and TIM-3 expression in tumor tissues and tumor adjacent tissues had a significant positive intercorrelation. The expressions of PD-1 and TIM-3 in tumor tissues, tumor adjacent tissues, and cirrhotic tissues were significantly associated with PD1 and TIM3 polymorphisms, with genotype AA of PD1 rs10204525 and genotypes GT+TT of TIM3 rs10053538 being associated with significantly increased PD-1 and TIM-3 expression, respectively.These findings support the potential to improve the efficiency of immune checkpoint-targeted therapy and reduce resistance to the therapy by blocking both PD-1 and TIM-3 and suggest the potential to apply the genotype determination of PD1 rs10204525 and TIM3 rs10053538 as biomarkers of immune checkpoint-directed therapies.
