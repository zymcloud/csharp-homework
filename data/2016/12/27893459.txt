The bi-exponential intravoxel-incoherent-motion (IVIM) model for diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) fails to account for differential T 2 s in the model compartments, resulting in overestimation of pseudodiffusion fraction f. An extended model, T2-IVIM, allows removal of the confounding echo-time (TE) dependence of f, and provides direct compartment T 2 estimates. Two consented healthy volunteer cohorts (n = 5, 6) underwent DWI comprising multiple TE/b-value combinations (Protocol 1: TE = 62-102 ms, b = 0-250 mm-2s, 30 combinations. Protocol 2: 8 b-values 0-800 mm-2s at TE = 62 ms, with 3 additional b-values 0-50 mm-2s at TE = 80, 100 ms; scanned twice). Data from liver ROIs were fitted with IVIM at individual TEs, and with the T2-IVIM model using all data. Repeat-measures coefficients of variation were assessed for Protocol 2. Conventional IVIM modelling at individual TEs (Protocol 1) demonstrated apparent f increasing with longer TE: 22.4 ± 7% (TE = 62 ms) to 30.7 ± 11% (TE = 102 ms); T2-IVIM model fitting accounted for all data variation. Fitting of Protocol 2 data using T2-IVIM yielded reduced f estimates (IVIM: 27.9 ± 6%, T2-IVIM: 18.3 ± 7%), as well as T 2 = 42.1 ± 7 ms, 77.6 ± 30 ms for true and pseudodiffusion compartments, respectively. A reduced Protocol 2 dataset yielded comparable results in a clinical time frame (11 min). The confounding dependence of IVIM f on TE can be accounted for using additional b/TE images and the extended T2-IVIM model.
