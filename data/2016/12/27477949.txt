Introduction:To retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of salvage resection(SR) for recurrence or metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after initial percutaneous ablation therapy (PAT).Methods:From September 2006 to September 2013, 50 consecutive patients who received SR for recurrent or metastatic HCC undergone initial PAT were enrolled. Safety and efficacy of SR for these patients were analyzed.Results:No treatment-related death occurred. Curative outcome was achieved in all the patients. The median overall survival after SR was 40 months, and the 1-, 3-, 5-year overall survival rate after SR was 85.2%, 46.4% and 34.8%, respectively. The disease-free survival was 38.6% at 1 year and 12.1% at 3 years after SR.Conclusion:SR is an effective and safe method for patients with recurrent or metastatic HCC after initial PAT treatment.
