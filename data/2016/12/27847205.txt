The mouse hepatocarcinoma cell lines Hca-F and Hca-P have been derived from hepatocarcinoma in mice and metastasize only to the lymph node. Hca-F cells displayed greater lymphatic metastasis ability than Hca-P cells. When the two cell lines were compared for cell surface sialylated β1,6 branched N-glycans by flow cytometry using L-PHA and SNA, Hca-F cells were found to express significantly higher levels. To explore the effect of increased sialylated β1,6 branched N-glycans on hepatocarcinoma progression, we inhibit their expression in Hca-F cells by using swainsonine treatment and RNA interference. We found that swainsonine treatment or GnT-V-shRNA transfection significantly inhibited the formation of β1,6 branched N-glycans, and partially inhibited the expression of α2,6 sialic acids. Knockdown of sialylated β1,6 branched N-glycans significantly attenuated the invasive and metastatic capability both in vitro and in vivo. Blockade of α2,6 sialic acid expression on Hca-F cell surface by the treatment with neuraminidase caused reduction in cellular adherence to lymph node. In addition, knockdown of sialylated β1,6 branched N-glycans could decrease the expression of Notch1, NICD1, NICD2 and HES1 in Hca-F cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that increased sialylated β1,6 branched N-glycans may contribute to hepatocarcinoma progression by altering the adhesive, invasive and metastatic ability to lymph node via Notch signaling pathway.
