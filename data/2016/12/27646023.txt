Background:Chemotherapeutic advances have enabled successful cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) expansion in treating metastatic colorectal cancer.Objectives:The aims of this study were to evaluate the safety of combining liver surgery (LS) with HIPEC and CRS (which remains controversial) and its impact on overall survival (OS) rates.Methods:From 2007 to 2015, a total of 77 patients underwent CRS/HIPEC for peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) of colorectal cancer. Twenty-five of these patients underwent concomitant LS for suspicion of liver metastases (LM; group 2), and were compared with patients who underwent CRS/HIPEC only (group 1). Demographic and clinical data were reviewed retrospectively.Results:Among the group 2 patients, two underwent major hepatectomies, six underwent multiple wedge resections, 16 underwent single wedge resections (one with radiofrequency ablation), and one underwent radiofrequency ablation alone. For groups 1 and 2, median peritoneal cancer index was 6 and 10 (range 0-26; p = 0.08), complication rates were 15.4 and 32.0 % (Dindo-Clavien â‰¥3; p = 0.15), and median follow-up was 34.2 and 25.5 months (range 0-75 and 3-97), respectively. One group 2 patient died of septic shock after 66 days. Pathology confirmed LM in 21 patients in group 2 (four with benign hepatic lesions were excluded from long-term outcome analysis). Two-year OS rates were 89.5 and 70.2 % (p = 0.04), and 2-year recurrence-free survival rates were 38.3 and 13.4 % (p = 0.01) in groups 1 and 2, respectively.Conclusions:Simultaneous surgery for colorectal LM and PC is both feasible and safe, with low postoperative morbidity. Further longer-term studies would help determine its impact on patient survival.
