Long non-coding RNAs constitute the most abundant part of the transcribed mammalian genome. lncRNAs affect all essential processes in the living cell including transcription, splicing, translation, replication, shaping of chromatin and post translational modification of proteins. Alterations in lncRNA expression have been linked to a number of diseases; thus, modulation of lncRNA expression holds a huge potential for gene-based therapy. In this review we summarize published data about lncRNAs in the context of hepatic carcinogenesis and liver fibrosis, and the corresponding potential targets for gene therapy. Recent advancements in targeted delivery to the liver made RNA interference an invaluable tool to decipher hepatic lncRNA function and to develop lncRNA-oriented therapies for liver-involved diseases in the future. Different approaches for RNA delivery that can be used for functional studies in the lab and for clinical lncRNA based applications are critically discussed in this review.
