Aims:Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) plays a critical role in tumor growth and progression. In this study, we sought to explore the expression and biological roles of miR-539 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Main methods:The expression of miR-539 in human HCC tissues and cell lines was examined. The effects of miR-539 overexpression on cell growth, tumorigenicity, arsenic trioxide resistance of HCC cells were determined. The signaling pathways involved in the action of miR-539 in HCC were also investigated.Key findings:miR-539 was downregulated in HCC tissues and cells, relative to corresponding controls. Overexpression of miR-539 inhibited HCC cell viability and colony formation in vitro and impaired tumorigenesis of HCC cells in vivo. Transfection with miR-539 mimic significantly induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells, which was coupled with reduced expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and decreased phosphorylation of Stat3. Overexpression of a constitutively active form of Stat3 partially blocked miR-539-mediated apoptosis. Enforced expression of miR-539 resensitized arsenic trioxide-resistant HCC cells to arsenic trioxide. Intratumoral delivery of miR-539 mimic significantly retarded the growth of xenograft tumors from arsenic trioxide-resistant HCC cells by about 35%, compared to delivery of control miRNA (PSignificance:miR-539 functions as a tumor suppressor in HCC and reexpression of this miRNA offers a potential therapeutic strategy for this disease.
