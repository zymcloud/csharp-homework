Background:Graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) after liver transplantation (LT) is a deadly complication with very limited data on risk factors, diagnosis and management. We report a case series and a comprehensive review of the literature.Methods:Data were systematically extracted from reports of GVHD after LT, and from the United Network for Organ Sharing database. Group comparisons were performed.Results:One hundred fifty-six adult patients with GVHD after LT have been reported. Median time to GVHD onset was 28 days. Clinical features were skin rash (92%), pancytopenia (78%), and diarrhea (65%). Six-month mortality with GVHD after LT was 73%. Sepsis was the most common cause of death (60%). Enterobacter bacteremia, invasive aspergillosis, and disseminated Candida infections were frequently reported. Recipient age over 50 years is a risk factor for GVHD after LT. Hepatocellular carcinoma was overrepresented, whereas chronic hepatitis C was underrepresented, in reported United States GVHD cases relative to all United Network for Organ Sharing database LT cases. Mortality rate with treatment of GVHD after LT was 84% with high-dose steroids alone, 75% to 100% with regimens using dose increases of calcineurin inhibitors, and 55% with IL-2 antagonists. Mortality was 25% in small case series using the CD2-blocker alefacept or TNF-α antagonists.Conclusions:Age older than 50 years and hepatocellular carcinoma appear to be risk factors for GVHD. Hepatitis C may be protective. High-dose steroids and calcineurin inhibitors are ineffective in the treatment of GVHD after LT. CD2-blockers and TNF-α antagonists appear promising. We propose a diagnostic algorithm to assist clinicians in managing adults with GVHD after LT.
