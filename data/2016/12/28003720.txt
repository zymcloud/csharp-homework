Background:Limited studies have evaluated the role of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for histologically grading the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Objective:To compare the efficacy of DWI with dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance (DCEMR) in detection of HCC in cirrhosis, and to evaluate whether DWI can be used instead of DCEMR.Methods:20 patients of either sex with cirrhosis and suspected of having HCC on screening USG were included in this prospective study approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. All patients underwent DCEMR of the abdomen on 3T scanner and fine needle aspiration of the lesions. MR protocol included T1WI, T2WI, DWI, and dynamic CEMR. The results of diffusion weighted imaging were compared with DCEMR to find the efficacy of DWI vis-Ã -vis CEMR.Results:DWI had a sensitivity and specificity of 100%, for diagnosis of lesions in cases having single lesion on CEMR, and sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 100% for diagnosis of lesions in cases having multiple lesions. There was a decreasing trend of ADC values with increasing grade of the tumor; however, the decreasing trend was not statistically significant. A cut-off ADC value of 0.8705 resulted in a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 50% for differentiating between well-differentiated and other grades of HCC.Conclusion:DWI can be used as an alternative for the detection and characterization of HCC, especially in patients with impaired renal function or contrast allergies precluding the use of contrast. In addition, DWI with ADC measurement may be helpful for non-invasive and preoperative prediction of the degree of differentiation of HCC.
