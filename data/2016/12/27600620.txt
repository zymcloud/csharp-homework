Background:Early diagnosis of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) involvement is vital for patients with a borderline resectable cancer of the pancreatic head to achieve an R0 resection. We aimed to detect the effect of the inferior infracolic 'superior mesenteric artery first' approach with a no-touch isolation surgical technique in these patients.Methods:The data of 21 patients who were consecutively diagnosed with a borderline resectable cancer of the pancreatic head and treated with our technique between July 2014 and September 2015 were analyzed.Results:During the exploration, five patients were confirmed to have invasion to the SMA. Fourteen patients underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy, and two patients underwent a total pancreatectomy due to a positive margin at the pancreatic neck on frozen sections. Ten men and six women, with a mean age of 64.1 years, were included in the study. Pathologic stage was T1, T2, and T3 in 1, 3, and 12 patients, respectively. Venous resection was performed in 8 patients, and an R0 resection was achieved in all patients (16/16). The mean intraoperative blood loss was 532 ml (range 200-1800 ml). At median follow-up time after surgery (12.8 months; range 4.5-18 months), two patients had a recurrence in the liver. The 1-year survival rate was 75 %, and the 1-year tumor-free survival rate was 62.5 %.Conclusions:Our technique facilitates early diagnosis of arterial involvement and the achievement of an R0 resection. This technique allows the tumor to be resected in situ, and removed en bloc, and is associated with decreased blood loss.
