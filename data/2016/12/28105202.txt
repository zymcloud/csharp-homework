Urotensin II (UII) and the urotensin II receptor (UT) exhibit mitogenic effects on tumor growth. Our previous study demonstrated that the UII/UT system is upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and may enhance the proliferation of human hepatoma cells. However, the clinical significance of UII/UT expression in HCC remains unclear. The present study assessed UII messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in 129 surgical specimens obtained from HCC patients using reverse transcription quantitative-polymerase chain reaction. The association between UII mRNA expression and clinicopathological parameters and overall survival rates was also investigated. The results revealed that UII and UT mRNA expression was significantly increased in HCC tissue compared with adjacent non-cancerous liver tissue (P
