The present study aimed to compare the overall and recurrence-free survival rates following hepatic resection (HR) and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classified intermediate-stage Child-Pugh A hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 443 patients were examined, among whom 274 underwent HR, whereas 169 received TACE. The overall survival, recurrence-free survival between groups and subgroups, and risk factors with respect to mortality and recurrence, were analyzed. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall and recurrence-free survival rates were 70, 46 and 37% and 73, 52, and 37%, respectively after HR, compared with 38, 15, and 12% and 44, 25 and 16%, respectively after TACE. Overall and recurrence-free survival rates were significantly increased following HR compared with TACE. Subgroup analysis in the multi-nodule group showed that the 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 68, 38 and 30% after HR, compared with 36, 10 and 0% following TACE. In the solitary tumor group, 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 71, 50 and 38% after HR, and 41, 22 and 15% after TACE. The overall survival rate after HR was significantly increased compared with that after TACE in the solitary tumor and multi-nodule groups. The risk factors for mortality include solitary tumor diameter >10 cm, multi-nodules, serum albumin level â‰¥35 g/l, prothrombin time >13 sec, alphafetoprotein levels >400 ng/ml, and patients with hepatitis B virus. Solitary tumor diameter >10 cm, multi-nodules, and hepatitis B virus (P
