Cerasome is a freshly developped bilayer vehicle that resemble traditional liposome but has higher mophorlogical stability. In this study, a novel redox-responsive cerasome (RRC) was developed for tumor-targeting drug delivery. The cerasome-forming lipid (CFL) that comprise a cleavable disulfide bond as connector unit of the triethoxysilyl head and the hydrophobic alkyl double chain was synthesized and subsequently used to prepare cerasome through ethanol injection method. RRC that has liposome-resembling lipid bilayer structure was proved being outstanding at drug loading capacity as well as morphological stability as compared to conventional liposomes. In addition, in vitro drug release tests of DOX/RRCs showed a redox-responsive drug release profile: accelerated DOX releasing compared to reduction-insensitive cerasomes (RICs) in the presence of 10mM of GSH. Under the same condition, the reduction sensibility of RRC was further proved by increased hydrodynamic diameter and destroying of integrity from DLS and SEM results. RRC showed non-toxic to human embryonic kidney 293 cells, indicating that this material has good biocompatibility. On the other hand, DOX/RRCs showed a resemble IC50 (half inhibitory concentration) value to that of free DOX to human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells and breast cancer MCF-7 cells. IC50 values at 48h were found to decrease in the following order: DOX/RIC>DOX/RRC>DOX. Taken together, the RRC developped in this study is of great potential to be utilized as a promising platform for intracellular anticancer drug delivery.
