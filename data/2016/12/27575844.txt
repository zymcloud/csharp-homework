Aim:This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of liver stiffness and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in differentiating small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from cirrhotic nodule.Methods:A total of 95 chronic hepatitis B patients who were diagnosed with small HCC (n = 53) or cirrhotic nodule (n = 42) underwent ultrasound elastography point quantification (ElastPQ) examinations on lesion and background liver. Three stiffness parameters, lesion stiffness value (SV), absolute stiffness difference (ASD) of lesion and background liver, stiffness ratio (lesion/background liver) (SR), and serum AFP were retrospectively analyzed. Then, the capabilities of lesion SV, ASD, SR, AFP, and the combination of each individual stiffness parameter with AFP were evaluated in differentiating small HCC from cirrhotic nodule.Results:Significantly higher lesion SV, ASD, SR, and serum AFP were observed in small HCC compared with cirrhotic nodule patients (all P â‰¤ 0.0001). By comparing the stiffness parameters on the patients with AFP greater than 20 ng/mL and AFP of 20 ng/mL or smaller, a higher lesion SV and comparable ASD and SR were found in the small HCC patients. The diagnostic accuracy of lesion SV, ASD, SR, and AFP in the discrimination of small HCC and cirrhotic nodule was 0.731, 0.825, 0.820, and 0.789, respectively. Moreover, the improved sensitivity was observed in the combination of liver stiffness with AFP (83%, 100%, and 92% for lesion SV/AFP, ASD/AFP, and SR/AFP, respectively).Conclusions:This study illustrated that the combination of liver stiffness and serum AFP has considerable clinical value in detecting suspicious small HCC from cirrhotic nodule.
