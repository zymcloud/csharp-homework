Background:Application of the Milan criteria is an effective strategy to select patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for liver transplantation, but HCC recurrence is still a major concern. The aim of this study was to determine whether interleukin 6 (IL6) polymorphisms and clinical variables are potential predictors for HCC recurrence and prognosis after transplantation.Methods:A total of 110 consecutive patients with HCC undergoing liver transplantation were enrolled in the study. Six tag single nucleotide polymorphisms in IL6 were genotyped in both the donors and recipients. Demographic characteristics, HCC features, and IL6 polymorphisms were assessed against HCC recurrence.Results:Pretransplant hepatitis B virus DNA (P = 0.014), pretransplant serum alpha-fetoprotein (P = 0.035), number of nodules (P = 0.011), diameter of main nodule (P = 0.001), macrovascular invasion (P = 0.001), microvascular invasion (P = 0.001), HCC exceeding the Milan criteria (P Conclusions:Our data suggest that donor IL6 rs2069852 polymorphisms may be a potential genetic marker for HCC recurrence after liver transplantation in the Han Chinese population.
