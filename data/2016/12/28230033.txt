Objective:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the postoperative infectious complications after liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma by logistic regression analysis.Materials and methods:One hundred and sixty-six hepatocellular carcinoma patients who received surgery were retrospectively reviewed and included in this study. Of the included 166 patients, 42 patients had the postoperative infectious complications (case group) and other 124 patients did not develop postoperative infection (control group). The clinical characteristics (gender, chronic disease history) and operation-related factors were compared between the two groups. Moreover, independent risk factors for postoperative infectious complications were assessed by logistic regression analysis.Results:Statistical difference was found in the aspects of diabetes (P 500 ml (OR = 2.65, P Conclusion:Patients with plasma albumin 500 ml, and postoperative drainage time >72 h are more likely to develop positive infectious complications.
