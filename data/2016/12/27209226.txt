Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been recognised as a worldwide health problem. HCV is the most common cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver transplantation. The HCV prevalence reported in pregnant women is similar to that found among the general population and does not appear to have an adverse effect on the course of pregnancy. The vertical transmission of HCV (HCV-VT) is a major route of HCV infection in children in the developed countries (>90%). The overall rate of mother-to-child transmission and chronification is about 3%-8%; however, this rate is higher for mothers who are co-infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (15-20%). In this review, we analyse the course of HCV infection during gestation, the risk factors associated with HCV-VT, the diagnostic methods/clinical monitoring recommended and the new possibilities of treatment in the era of direct-acting antiviral agents, which are essential to guide future public health efforts appropriately.
