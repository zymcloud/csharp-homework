Immunotherapy targeting programmed death receptor 1 and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) has shown impressive antitumor efficacy in several solid cancers, including advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Since response rates of various cancers to such immunotherapy appear to correlate with PD-L1 expression levels, several studies have examined whether PD-L1 expression correlates with HCC pathology and patient prognosis. In this paper, we analyzed the strength and limitations of a recent meta-analysis of associations of PD-L1 with HCC characteristics and patient prognosis.
