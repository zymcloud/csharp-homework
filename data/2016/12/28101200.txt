To aim of the present study was to investigate the association between special AT-rich DNA-binding protein-1 (SATB1) expression and liver cancer metastasis. SATB1 mRNA and protein expression in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and in two hepatocellular cancer cell lines, MHCC-97H (high metastatic potential) and HepG2 (low metastatic potential), by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Transwell migration and wound-healing assays were also performed to investigate the metastasis of liver cancer following upregulation or silencing of SATB1 expression. The results revealed that SATB1 expression was significantly higher in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues compared with carcinoma-adjacent tissues. Furthermore, SATB1 expression was correlated with tumor size, differentiation degree, hemorrhage and/or necrosis, invasion and/or metastases and TNM stage. Both the mRNA and protein expression of SATB1 was higher in MHCC-97H cells than HepG2 cells. In addition, the migration capability of MHCC-97H cells was decreased after SATB1 silencing, whereas the migration capability of HepG2 cells was increased after SATB1 upregulation. SATB1 expression was demonstrated to be positively correlated with liver cancer metastasis. These results indicate that liver cancer metastasis is regulated by SATB1 expression. Thus, immunohistochemical SATB1 expression may present an independent risk factor for the metastasis of liver cancer.
