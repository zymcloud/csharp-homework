Three novel copper(II), cobalt(II), and nickel(II) complexes of juglone (Jug) containing 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) ligand, [M(Jug)2(phen)] (M = Cu(II), 1, Co(II), 2, and Ni(II), 3), have been synthesized and characterized using, elemental analysis and spectroscopic studies. Their interactions with calf thymus DNA were investigated using viscosity measurements, UV-visible and fluorescence spectrophotometric methods. The catalytic activities on DNA cleavage of the complexes 1-3 were studied, which copper complex 1 showed better catalyst activity in the DNA cleavage process than complexes 2 and 3. The in vitro cytotoxic potential of the complexes 1-3 against human cervical carcinoma (HeLa), human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG-2), and human colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT-29) cells indicated their promising antitumor activity with quite low IC50 values in the range of 0.09-1.89 Î¼M, which are 75 times lower than those of cisplatin.
