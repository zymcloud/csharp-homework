The incidence of hepatobiliary malignancies, and especially intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), for patients with Wilson's disease (WD), is very low, even for cirrhotic patients. A 44-year-old male was admitted to our department for treatment of a liver tumor. He was diagnosed with WD at the age of 15. According to radiological findings, his liver tumor was a suspected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or a combined hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinoma. A partial resection of liver segments 8 (S8) and 5 (S5) was subsequently performed due to the intraoperative suspicion of intrahepatic metastasis at the surface of S5. Postoperative histology revealed that the resected portion of S8 contained an ICC; the removed S5 portion comprised a regenerative nodule with hemosiderosis. To date, the patient has survived without tumor recurrence for more than 44 months following surgery. A survey of the literature, inclusive of case reports, would suggest that surgical resection is the primary course of action for a WD patient with ICC, if liver function can be preserved and curative resection performed.
