Purpose:The aim of this study was to compare patient characteristics and midterm outcomes after RFA for unresectable Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Asian and European cohorts.Materials and methods:The study was based on retrospective analysis of 279 patients (mean 64.8 Â± 12.1 years; 208 males) treated with RFA for de novo HCC in tertiary referral centers in Singapore and the Netherlands, with median follow-up of 28.2 months (quartiles: 13.1-40.5 months). Cumulative incidence of recurrence and death were analyzed using a competing risk model.Results:Age was higher in the Asian group: 66.5 versus 60.1 years (p Conclusion:Similar short-term treatment outcomes are achieved with RFA in HCC patients in the South-East Asian and Northern-European populations. Midterm recurrence and death rates differ between the groups as a result of differences in baseline patient characteristics and patient selection. Our study provides insight relevant to the design of future international studies.
