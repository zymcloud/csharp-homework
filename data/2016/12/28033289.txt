The optimal treatment (liver transplantation [LT] vs surgical resection [SR]) for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial.A total of 209 SR patients and 129 LT patients were identified at our institution. After eliminating 27 patients with Child-Pugh C, the data from 209 SR patients and 102 LT patients were analyzed using a propensity score matching (PSM) model. Forty-six pairs were generated. A subgroup analysis was conducted based on the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level or platelet count (PLT). A survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method.Gender, satellite lesions, and the treatment method were predictors of HCC recurrence. The Ishak score and treatment methods were associated with long-term survival after surgery. Before PSM, LT patients had a better prognosis than those treated by SR. Among HCC patients with childhood A/B cirrhosis, after PSM, SR achieved similar overall survival outcomes compared with LT. LT and SR resulted in comparable long-term survival for patients with or without thrombocytopenia. Patients with an AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL might achieve more survival benefits from LT.Our propensity score model provided evidence that, compared with transplantation, surgical resection could result in comparable long-term survival for resectable early-stage HCC patients, except for the AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL HCC subgroup. Surgical resection might not be a contraindication for early-stage HCC patients with thrombocytopenia due to their similar prognosis after transplantation.
