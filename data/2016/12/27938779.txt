Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) appears mainly in patients with underlying liver disease and it is recognized as one of the most important causes of death in this population. Early detection by surveillance has been suggested as an effective tool for reducing cancer-specific mortality and the most accepted strategy is semiannual abdominal ultrasound in those patients at risk of HCC development. The benefit of HCC surveillance is proven by a randomized-controlled study, several prospective or retrospective analyses, and multiple modeling studies and according to the current scientific evidence, surveillance of HCC should be recommended and widely implemented. Major efforts should be done for improving the diagnostic accuracy of the screening tools and for better identifying those patients at risk of HCC development in whom a surveillance program would be cost-effective.
