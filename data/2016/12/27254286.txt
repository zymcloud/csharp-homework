Background & aims:Patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) after successful antiviral therapy remain at risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study was to determine whether liver stiffness measurement (LSM) was useful in HCC risk assessment and to develop a risk-score system for clinical use.Methods:This retrospective study enrolled patients with CHC achieving sustained virological response (SVR) after interferon-based therapy with LSM at/after SVR determination. The demographics, clinical characteristics and HCC development were obtained from medical chart reviews. The diagnosis of HCC was based on recommended criteria.Results:A total of 376 (M/F: 185/191, mean age: 54.1 years) patients, including 278 with pretreatment liver biopsy specimens, with a median follow-up period of 7.6 years were enrolled. Twenty-one patients developed HCC. The 5- and 10-year cumulative HCC incidences were 1.4% and 7.8%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, diabetes and LSM were associated with HCC developments with odds ratio (OR) of 12.38, 2.80 and 1.01, respectively. For LSM in HCC prediction, the performance and cut-off were 0.783 and 12 kilopascal (kPa), respectively. For 278 patients with pretreatment biopsy, a risk-score system (score 0-4) combining advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, diabetes and LSM >12 kPa was developed. With the low-risk group as a reference, patients in intermediate- (OR: 12.57) and high-risk (OR: 197.33) groups carried higher risk of HCC development.Conclusions:For patients with CHC achieving SVR, liver stiffness value at/after SVR determination was associated with HCC development independently. Patients with pretreatment advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, diabetes and LSM >12 kPa after SVR were at high risk of HCC development.
