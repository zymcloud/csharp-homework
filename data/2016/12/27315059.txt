Purpose:To assess the feasibility of conducting pretreatment mesenteric angiography, coil embolization, 99mTc macroaggregated albumin (99mTc-MAA) scintigraphy, and 90Y radioembolization treatment in a single, same-day, combined outpatient encounter.Methods:This was a retrospective study of 78 patients treated during the period 2008 - 2015 who were managed in a single outpatient encounter under the guidance of the Interventional Radiology Department and The Nuclear Medicine Department. Pretreatment planning was performed by reviewing baseline imaging and estimated perfused liver volume bearing the tumor. The region of interest was estimated using 3-D software; this value was used for dosimetry planning. Maximum lung shunting fractions of 10 % for hepatocellular carcinoma and 5 % for liver metastases were assumed. Subsequently, hepatic angiography and 99mTc-MAA scintigraphy were performed followed by 90Y treatment in one outpatient encounter. Total in-room procedure time was recorded.Results:All patients underwent same-day angiography, 99mTc-MAA scintigraphy and 90Y radioembolization. Of the 78 patients, 16 received multiple segmental treatments to both lobes, 44 received treatment to the right lobe, and 18 received treatment to the left lobe. The median dose was 106 Gy. The median number of 90Y vials needed was two (range one to six). The median in-room time was 160 min (75 - 250 min). The residential status of the patients was as follows, 18 % (14/78) were local residents, 55 % (43/78) traveled from outside the city limits, 18 % (14/78) were from out-of-state, and 9 % (7/78) were resident abroad. Of the 78 patients, 61 (77 %) had hepatocellular carcinoma, and 17 (22 %) had liver metastases. The median lung dose was 3.5 Gy.Conclusion:This study demonstrated the feasibility of same-day 90Y evaluation and treatment while maintaining the principles of safe and effective 90Y infusion including tumoricidal dosimetry (lobar, segmentectomy), minimization of nontarget flow, and minimization of lung dose. This paradigm translates into expeditious cancer care and significant cost savings.
