The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poor, with only one third of patients eligible for curative treatments and very limited survival benefits with the use of sorafenib, the current standard of care for advanced disease. Recently, agents targeting the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)/programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint were shown to display impressive antitumor activity in various solid or hematological malignancies, including HCC. PD-L1 immunohistochemical expression is thought to represent a biomarker predictive of drug sensitivity. Here, we investigated PD-L1 expression in a series of 217 HCCs and correlated our results with clinical and histological features and immunohistochemical markers (PD-1, cytokeratin 19, glutamine synthetase, and Î²-catenin expression). PD-L1 expression by neoplastic cells was significantly associated with common markers of tumor aggressiveness (high serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, P = 0.038; satellite nodules, P Conclusion:PD-L1 expression by either neoplastic or intratumoral inflammatory cells is related to tumor aggressiveness and suggests that the response to treatments targeting the PD-L1/PD-1 immune checkpoint could be restricted to particular HCC variants; thus, enrichment of these tumor subtypes in future clinical trials should be considered.
