Background:To assess the association between tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) G308A, G238A and C863T polymorphisms and hepatitis B virus related hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-HCC) susceptibility.Methods:We interrogated the databases of Pubmed, Sciencedirect and Viley online library up to March 8, 2016. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated in a fixed-effects model or a random-effects model when appropriate.Results:In total, 12 case-control studies which containing 1580 HBV-HCC cases, 2033 HBV carrier controls, 395 HBV spontaneously recovered (SR) controls and 1116 healthy controls were included. Compared with GG genotype, the genotypes GA/AA of G308A were associated with a significantly increased HBV-HCC risk when the controls were all healthy individuals (AA vs. GG, OR 2.483, 95%CI 1.243 to 4.959; GA vs. GG, OR 1.383, 95%CI 1.028 to 1.860; GA/AA vs. GG, OR 1.381, 95%CI 1.048 to 1.820). Meanwhile, only the AA vs. GG model of G238A and HBV-HCC showed a statistic significance when the controls were healthy individuals (OR 4.776, 95%CI 1.280 to 17.819). CT genotype of TNF-α C863T could increase HBV-HCC risk whenever the controls were healthy individuals, HBV carriers or HBV recovers.Conclusion:This meta-analysis shows that AA genotype in TNF-α G308A and TNF-α G238A and CT genotype in TNF-α C863T may increase HBV-HCC risk. Therefore, HBV infection seemed to be a more important factor for tumorigenesis of HCC than genetic predisposition in G308A of TNF-α, and interaction between TNF-α C863T polymorphisms and HBV infection might be associated with increased HCC risk.
