Aim:To evaluate outcomes associated with use of a saline coupled bipolar sealer during open partial liver resection.Methods:This retrospective analysis utilized the United States Premierâ„¢ insurance claims database (2010-2014). Patients were selected with codes for liver malignancy and partial hepatectomy or lobectomy. Cases were defined by use the saline-coupled bipolar sealer; controls had no use. A Propensity Score algorithm was used to match one case to five controls. A deviation-based cost modeling (DBCM) approach provided an estimate of cost-effectiveness.Results:One hundred and forty-four cases and 720 controls were available for analysis. Patients in the case cohort received fewer transfusions vs controls (18.1% vs 29.4%, P = 0.007). In DBCM, more patients in the case cohort experienced "on-course" hospitalizations (53.5% vs 41.9%, P = 0.009). The cost calculation showed an average savings in total hospitalization costs of $1027 for cases vs controls. In multivariate analysis, cases had lower odds of receiving a transfusion (OR = 0.44, 95%CI: 0.27-0.71, P = 0.0008).Conclusion:Use of a saline-coupled bipolar sealer was associated with a greater proportion of patients with an "on course" hospitalization.
