Three new palladium(II) complexes of lidocaine and phenylcyanamide derivative ligands of formula K[Pd(2,6-Me2pcyd)2(LC)], 1, K[Pd(2,6-Et2pcyd)2(LC)], 2, K[Pd(2,6-Cl2pcyd)2(LC)], 3 (LC: lidocaine, 2,6-Me2pcyd: 2,6-dimethyl phenylcyanamide, 2,6-Et2pcyd: 2,6-diethyl phenylcyanamide, 2,6-Cl2pcyd: 2,6-dichloro phenylcyanamide) have been synthesized and fully characterized. The complexes 1-3 revealed a significant in vitro antiproliferative activity against human ovarian carcinoma (A2780), colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT29), breast (MCF-7), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG-2) and lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cancer cell lines. All the complexes are more active than cisplatin and follow the trend 2 > 1 > 3. Mechanistic studies showed that the trend in cytotoxicity of the Pd(II) complexes is mainly consistent with their ability to accumulate into cancer cells and to increase intracellular basal reactive oxygen species levels, which consequently results in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis induction.
