Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with bile duct tumor thrombus (BDTT) is rare. The present study aimed to determine post-surgical prognoses in HCC patients with BDTT, as outcomes are currently unclear.Methods:We compared the prognoses of 110 HCC patients without BDTT (group A) to 22 cases with BDTT (group B). The two groups were matched in age, gender, tumor etiology, size, number, portal vascular invasion, and TNM stage. Additionally, 28 HCC patients with BDTT were analyzed to identify prognostic risk factors.Results:The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 90.9%, 66.9%, and 55.9% for group A and 81.8%, 50.0%, and 37.5% for group B, respectively. The median survival time in groups A and B was 68.8 and 31.4 months, respectively (P=0.043). The patients for group B showed higher levels of serum total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, a larger hepatectomy range, and a higher rate of anatomical resection. In subgroup analyses of patients with BDTT who underwent R0 resection, TNM stage III-IV was an independent risk factor for overall survival; these patients had worse prognoses than those with TNM stage I-II after R0 resection (hazard ratio=6.056, P=0.014). Besides, univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that non-R0 resection and TNM stage III-IV were independent risk factors for both disease-free survival and overall survival of 28 HCC patients with BDTT. The median overall survival time of patients with BDTT who underwent R0 resection was longer than that of patients who did not undergo R0 resection (31.0 vs 4.0 months, P=0.007).Conclusions:R0 resection prolonged survival time in HCC patients with BDTT, although prognosis remains poor. For such patients, R0 resection is an important treatment that determines long-term survival.
