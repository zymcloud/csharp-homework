Background:Recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with unsatisfactory survival is common after surgical resection. Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel was recently shown to prevent hepatic carcinogenesis in a murine model, but its effect in humans had not been clarified. This study aimed to investigate the association between antiplatelet therapy and the outcomes for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC after liver resection.Methods:By analyzing data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 9461 HBV-related HCC patients who had undergone liver resection between January 1997 and December 2011 were identified. After one-to-four matching by sex, age, and propensity score, 442 patients with antiplatelet therapy and 1768 patients without antiplatelet therapy were enrolled for the analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method and modified Cox proportional hazards models were used for survival and multivariable, stratified analyses.Results:Recurrence-free survival and overall survival after resection surgery were significantly better after 5 years in the treated cohort than in the untreated cohort (52.8 vs 47.9 %; p = 0.021 and 80.3 vs 65.4 %; p Conclusions:Use of aspirin or clopidogrel was associated with better recurrence-free survival and overall survival among patients with HBV-related HCC after liver resection. However, these agents should be used with caution due to the adverse effects of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
