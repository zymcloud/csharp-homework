Background:Combined liver and inferior vena cava (IVC) resection followed by IVC and/or hepatic vein reconstruction (HVR) is a curative operation for selected patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) invading the hepatocaval confluence. The present study aimed to elucidate the prognostic factors for patients with HCC invading the hepatocaval confluence.Methods:Forty-two consecutive patients underwent hepatectomy, combined with IVC replacement and/or HVR for HCC between January 2009 and December 2014 were included in this study. The cases were divided into three groups based on the surgical approaches of HVR: group 1 (n=13), tumor invaded the hepatocaval confluence but with one or two hepatic veins intact in the residual liver, thus only the replacement of IVC, not HVR; group 2 (n=23), the hepatic vein of the residual liver was also partially invaded, and the hepatic vein defect was repaired with patches locally; group 3 (n=6), three hepatic veins at the hepatocaval confluence were infiltrated, and the hepatic vein remnant was re-implanted onto the side of the tube graft. The patient characteristics, intra- and postoperative results, and long-term overall survival were compared among the three groups. The survival-related factors were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis.Results:The group 1 had higher preoperative alpha-fetoprotein level (P3 copies/mL; P=0.001), tumor size (≥9 cm; P<0.0001), age (≥60 years; P=0.010) and underwent HVR (P<0.0001).Conclusions:Patients with reconstructing hepatic vein with patches locally (group 2) or to the artificial graft (group 3) had worse long-term survival than those without HVR (group 1). HVR was one of the unfavorable prognostic factors of overall survival.
