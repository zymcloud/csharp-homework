Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma is a major type of liver cancer with poor prognosis.Aim:The aim of the study was to determine the prognostic significance of plasma interleukin-35 level in hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:A total of 153 hepatocellular carcinoma patients and 153 healthy controls were enrolled. Blood samples were obtained at admission. Plasma interleukin-35 level was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Distribution of T cell subset and expression of Fas/FasL protein were detected by flow cytometry. The patients were followed up for 2 years. Poor prognosis was defined as death of hepatocellular carcinoma.Results:The plasma levels of interleukin-35 were significantly higher in the patients than the controls (25.1 ± 13.1, 9.3 ± 6.3 pg/mL, P Conclusion:Circulating interleukin-35 concentration might be an independent prognostic indicator in hepatocellular carcinoma. Such prognostic significance could be partly involved in the activation of regulatory T cell and the apoptosis of CD8+ T cell.
