Cancer is defined as an uncontrolled proliferation of malignant cells in a host and it is one of the main causes of death worldwide. Genetic and environmental factors play an important role in its development, and the involvement of microbial communities has also recently been recognized. The close relationship that characterizes the colonization by human commensal communities involves health risks, particularly when the homeostasis is disturbed. It has been hypothesized that this process may lead to cancer by modulating the inflammatory response of the host, by the production of carcinogenic metabolic products or by the production of toxins, which disrupt the cell cycle. The metabolic effects of the intestinal microbiota have been studied in greater detail in the gastrointestinal tract, and it has been recognized that microbial communities of other body surfaces can cause effects either locally or at a distance. In vitro and in vivo studies have allowed the characterization of the microbiota and the establishment of a cause and effect relationship with some types of cancer. Nevertheless, despite the results, representative studies are necessary to validate the findings and definitively establish the role of microbiota in cancer development in order to open the possibility of promising therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Thus, the aims of this review are to briefly examine the available evidence, and to analyse the mechanisms described for pancreatic, lung, colorectal cancer , oral squamous cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma and the impact of the current knowledge about the effects of the microbiota on carcinogenesis.
