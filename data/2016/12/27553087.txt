Background and aim:We aimed to evaluate the outcome of patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis previously exposed to immunosuppressive (IMS) therapy.Methods:We retrospectively collected data from 86 consecutive patients from 2008. Early outcome was evaluated as response to steroids, rescue therapy, and colectomy rate, whereas colectomy free-survival was determined along the follow-up.Results:The overall response rates to steroids and rescue therapy was 33.7% and 90.5%, respectively, while early colectomy rate was 22.1%. Patients previously treated with IMS (n=47) showed a trend towards lower response to steroids (25.5% vs 43.6%; p=0.10), and a high-risk of early colectomy (29.8% vs 12.8%; p=0.07), but a similar response to rescue therapy (87.5% vs 94.4%, p=0.62) when compared with IMS-na√Øve patients (n=39). The overall cumulative probability to avoid the surgery was 67.5% and 56.6% at 12 and 60 months, respectively, regardless of previous exposure to IMS (p=0.30). At multivariate analysis the risk of early colectomy was increased by previous IMS (OR 5.16, p=0.017), anaemia (OR 4.26, p=0.02), and diagnosis above 40 years (OR 5.31, p=0.011).Conclusions:Patients previously treated with IMS showed a non-significant trend towards a worse response with steroid therapy, a satisfactory response rate to rescue therapy, and a similar probability of avoiding colectomy during the follow-up vs IMS-naive patients.
