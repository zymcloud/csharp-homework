To assess the value of transarterial embolization/chemoembolization (TAE/TACE) therapy via adrenal artery for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with HCC who underwent TAE/TACE therapy via adrenal artery between May 2003 and October 2015 across 4 medical centers were identified. Clinical information, procedural data, and imaging data were analyzed to assess technical success, disease control, and survival rates. A t test was used to compare the differences in serum alpha-fetoprotein before and after treatment. A total of 23 patients (23 men; mean age, 54.6 Â± 7.5 years; range, 37-72 years) were included in this study. All tumors were located under the capsule of the liver and adjacent to the adrenal gland (median tumor diameter, 8.2 cm). Lesions fed by the adrenal artery were demonstrated during initial TAE/TACE in 7 patients and during repeat TAE/TACE in 16 patients. The superior, middle, and inferior adrenal arteries were involved in 14, 3, and 6 patients, respectively. The technical success rate was 100%. The disease control rate at 3 months was 100%, with partial tumor response seen in 16 (69.6%) patients and stable disease seen in 7 (30.4%) patients. The cumulative survival rate from the time of TAE/TACE was 100% at 1 year. There were no embolization-related complications. TAE/TACE therapy via the adrenal arteries can improve the therapeutic efficacy of TAE/TACE and reduce the incidence of HCC recurrence and/or presence of residual HCC.
