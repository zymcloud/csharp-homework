An emerging hallmark of cancer is reprogrammed cellular metabolism, and several cancers involve increased glucose intake and glutamine addiction. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most fatal cancers, and its molecular basis needs to be delineated to identify biomarkers for its potential treatment without resection. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the metabolism status of HCC by evaluating the expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 and glutamine transporter ASCT2. We enrolled 192 patients with surgically resected HCC in this study. Their tissue samples were subjected to immunohistochemistry to detect GLUT1 and ASCT2 expression. The prognostic value of GLUT1 and ASCT2 expression and their combined metabolic index was determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox proportional hazards model. We found that GLUT1 and ASCT2 expression was significantly upregulated in tumor tissues as compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues and was positively associated with tumor size. Survival analysis revealed that patients with high GLUT1 or ASCT2 expression had poor overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). In HCC patients, ASCT2 expression was an independent negative prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.760; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.124-2.755; p = 0.013) and the metabolic index was an independent negative prognostic factor for OS (HR = 1.672, 95% CI = 1.275-2.193, p
