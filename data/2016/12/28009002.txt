Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) originate from tumor tissues and are associated with cancer prognosis. However, existing technologies for CTC detection are limited owing to a lack of specific or accurate biomarkers. Here, we developed a new method for CTC detection based on the karyoplasmic ratio, without biomarkers. Consecutive patients with liver cancer or non-cancer liver diseases were recruited. CTCs in blood samples were analyzed by imaging flow cytometry based on the karyoplasmic ratio as well as EpCAM and CD45. Microvascular invasion (MVI), tumor recurrence, and survival were recorded for all patients. A total of 56.2 ± 23.8/100,000 cells with high karyoplasmic ratios (HKR cells) were detected in cancer patients, which was higher than the number of HKR cells in the non-cancer group (7.6 ± 2.2/100,000). There was also a difference in HKR cells between liver cancer patients with and without MVI. Based on a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the threshold was 21.8 HKR cells per 100,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the area under the curve was higher than those of traditional methods (e.g., CD45 and EpCAM staining). These results indicate that the new CTC detection method was more sensitive and reliable than existing methods. Accordingly, it may improve clinical CTC detection.
