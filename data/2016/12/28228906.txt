A 58-year-old man was diagnosed with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT). The tumors were multiple and existed in both lobes. Drug-eluting beads transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) was performed for the tumors in the left lobe. Embosphere and Hepasphere were selected for embolization of the arterioportal shunt, followed by loaded epirubicin infusion into the left hepatic artery. Computed tomography showed reduction of PVTT. However, liver failure progressed, and the patient died 67 days after DEB-TACE. Autopsy showed that the beads reached the tumor thrombosis in the portal vein. The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma with PVTT is poor. Although there are no established treatments for unresectable PVTT, DEB-TACE might be a useful option for such cases.
