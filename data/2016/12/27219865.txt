Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a clinical challenge, but its relationship to clinicopathologic features and the risk of progression to malignant lymphoma (ML) are poorly defined. We estimated the prevalence of HBV infection of 1,358 patients with newly diagnosed ML. HBV infection was more prevalent in ML than in control patients. The occult HBV infection group had a higher median onset age, no liver or spleen involvement, and higher prevalence of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma than the other groups, indicating that occult HBV infection is a distinct clinicopathologic entity.
