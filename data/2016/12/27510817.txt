Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) as a novel tumor suppressive gene participates in multiple biological behaviors and plays an important role in regulating tumor cell growth and invasion. However, the functions of KLF6 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain poorly understood. The expression level of KLF6 was examined by immunohistochemical assay in human HCC tissues, and KLF6-overexpressed HCC cells (SMCC-7721 and HepG2) were used for evaluating cell proliferation and invasion by MTT and Transwell assays. A subcutaneous HCC tumor model was established for assessing tumor growth in vivo. Our results showed that the expression of KLF6 was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues compared with the adjacent non-cancerous tissues (50.0% vs. 72.0%, P = 0.034) and negatively associated with the lymph-vascular space invasion (LVSI) in HCC patients (P = 0.003). Furthermore, overexpression of KLF6 reduced cell proliferation and weakened the cell invasive potential followed with the decreased expression of PCNA and MMP-9 in HCC cells. The in vivo experiment indicated that KLF6 overexpression suppressed the xenograft tumor growth. Therefore, our findings show that KLF6 suppresses growth and invasion of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a tumor suppressive function in HCC and provides the potential therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.
