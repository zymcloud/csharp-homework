Background:Feline paraneoplastic alopecia (FPA) is a rare condition listed among the cutaneous paraneoplastic syndromes, which occurs in association with pancreatic carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic intestinal carcinoma.Objectives:To describe the clinicopathological findings of paraneoplastic alopecia in two cats each with an uncommon tumour not previously reported in association with FPA.Animals:Paraneoplastic alopecia was associated with neuroendocrine pancreatic neoplasia in a Persian cat and with a hepatosplenic plasma cell tumour in a domestic short hair cat.Results:FPA was suspected based on age, rapid onset of clinical signs, ventral distribution of alopecia, shiny appearance of the skin and telogenization/miniaturization of the follicles on histopathology. The nature of the tumours was determined through cytology, postmortem, histopathological and immunohistochemical examination, and capillary immunoelectrophoresis. A causative association between the skin lesions and the tumour was suggested by clinical and histopathological features shared with previously published cases.Conclusions and clinical importance:Pancreatic neuroendocrine and plasma cell tumour should be considered as differential diagnoses when evaluating FPA.
