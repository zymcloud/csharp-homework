To investigate the correlations among total liver CT perfusion parameters, unpaired arteries (UAs) and microvessel area (MVA) in a rabbit liver VX2 tumor model, and to learn the tumoral angiogenesis condition and the mechanisms for perfusion imaging. Methods: Rabbits with or without the inoculated VX2 tumor in the liver underwent total liver CT perfusion imaging 2 weeks after the operation. Perfusion parameters included blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), arterial liver perfusion (ALP), portal liver perfusion (PVP), hepatic perfusion index (HPI) for the tumor rim and the surrounding liver tissue. After the examination, the UAs and MVA of tumor tissues were obtained by immunohistochemical staining. The differences of perfusion parameters between the vital tumor rim and the surrounding liver tissue were compared. The correlations among perfusion parameters, UAs and MVA were analyzed. Results: There was significant difference between the CT perfusion parameters at the tumor rim and the surrounding liver tissue or liver tissue of the control group (P<0.05), but there was no significant difference between the perfusion parameters at the surrounding liver tissues of the experimental group and the control (P>0.05). There was positive correlation between UAs and MVA. UAs and MVA were positively correlated with BF, ALP and BV at the tumor rim. UAs and MVA were negatively correlated with PVP. HPI positively correlated with UAs, but it was not correlated with MVA. Conclusion: Total liver CT perfusion can provide quantitative information to evaluate the artery and portal vein perfusion of liver VX2 tumor, and to assess the degree of tumor angiogenesis.
