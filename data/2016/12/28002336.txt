This study aimed to investigate the utility of gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-MRI) in surveillance for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatectomy.This retrospective study analyzed 147 patients who underwent surveillance with alternating multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and Gd-MRI after hepatectomy for HCC. The patients were followed-up every 3 months during the first 2 years, and every 6 months thereafter. At each visit, MDCT was performed but once a year (every 12 months), Gd-MRI was performed instead of MDCT. Each HCC recurrence detection rate of MDCT and Gd-MRI was evaluated, and recurrent HCC characteristics were compared according to the detection test.A total of 63 patients had recurrent HCC. Among them, 9 were detected with Gd-MRI and 29 with MDCT. The baseline characteristics of patients with recurrent HCC showed no significant differences according to the detection test. The HCC recurrence detection rate of Gd-MRI and MDCT was 4.8% (9/180) and 4.3% (29/580), respectively, on the per test basis (P = 0.764). However, in the population with a follow-up period of â‰¥12 months, the detection rate of Gd-MRI and MDCT was 4.3% (7/150) and 1.5% (19/400), respectively (P = 0.035). Recurrent HCCs detected with Gd-MRI were smaller than those detected with MDCT (tumor size
