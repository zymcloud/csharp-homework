Context:Combination therapies provide a potential solution to address the tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance issues by taking advantage of distinct mechanisms of action of the multiple therapeutics.Objective:To design arginine-glycineaspartic acid (RGD) modified lipid-coated nanoparticles (NPs) for the co-delivery of the hydrophobic drugs against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:RGD modified lipid-coated PLGA NPs were developed for the targeted delivery of both sorafenib (SRF) and quercetin (QT) (RGD-SRF-QT NPs). Chemical-physical characteristics and release profiles were evaluated. In vitro cell viability assays were carried out on HCC cells. In vivo antitumor efficacies were evaluated in HCC animal model.Results and discussion:The combination of SRF and QT formulations was more effective than the single drug formulations in both NPs and solution groups. RGD-SRF-QT NPs achieved the most significant tumor growth inhibition effect in vitro and in vivo.Conclusion:The resulting NPs could provide a promising platform for co-delivery of multiple anticancer drugs for achievement of combinational therapy and could offer potential for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy on HCC.
