Purpose:To evaluate the effect of serum alpha-fetoprotein(AFP) on prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and put forward a proposal to modify BCLC staging system and the recommended treatment of patients with stage C.Results:AFP positive was an independent poor prognostic factor of HCC. Race, pathological grade, T stage, M stage were also regarded to be significant predicted factors for poorer prognosis. When combining AFP status with AJCC stage, patients with A1 disease had a worse prognosis compared with those with A0 disease within each stage. Patients with A1 disease of each T/N stage had a worse prognosis than patients with A0 disease of the respective stage, and the prognosis of patients with A1 disease with lower T stages was worse or similar to that of patients with A0 disease of higher T stages.Materials and methods:We performed a retrospective study of all patients histologically diagnosed HCC from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008, from the SEER database.Conclusions:AFP can be used as a subclassification index to modify the AJCC staging system of HCC. Since BCLC stage is the most widely used staging system, we recommend routine pre-treatment AFP testing as standard of care in HCC and incorporate AFP status into the BCLC staging system to modify the recommended treatment of patients with stage C.
