Purpose:To investigate socioeconomic and demographic factors associated with transplantation outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with bridging locoregional therapy (LRT) before orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).Materials and methods:The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was used to identify all patients in the United States with HCC who were listed for OLT between 2002 and 2013. Mean overall survival (OS) after OLT was stratified based on age, sex, ethnicity, transplant year, region, and insurance status. Kaplan-Meier estimation was used for survival analysis with log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model to assess independent prognostic factors for OS.Results:Of the 17,291 listed patients with HCC, 14,511 underwent OLT. Mean age was 57.4 years (76.8% male). Favorable sociodemographic factors were associated with increased rates of bridging LRT before OLT and longer wait time on the transplant list and were shown to be independent prognostic factors for prolonged OS after OLT using multivariate analysis. Favorable demographic factors included patient age Conclusions:Patients with favorable sociodemographics had higher rates of LRT before OLT performed for HCC cure. These patients had longer transplant wait times and longer OS after OLT.
