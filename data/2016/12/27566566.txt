We explored the hypothesis that sorafenib may improve the effect of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and that longer sorafenib duration was associated with additional survival benefits. In this retrospective, nested case-controlled study, 1126 cases of unresectable HCC were collected. Patients with unresectable disease treated with TACE+sorafenib (n=245) and TACE alone (n=245) and those with recurrence after surgery treated with TACE+sorafenib (n=127) and TACE alone (n=127) were identified and matched according to sex, age, and lesion size and number. The clinicopathological factors associated with survival were examined by univariate and multivariate analyses. The mean duration of sorafenib treatment was 10.8Â±10.51 months. Sorafenib significantly increased the median survival time as compared to TACE alone (unresectable HCC: 20.23 vs. 13.97 months, respectively; p=0.013 and recurrent HCC: 30.7 and 18.22 months, respectively; p=0.003). The survival of patients with unresectable HCC was associated with the presence of portal vein tumor thrombus (HR=1.47, p=0.004) and treatment method (TACE+sorafenib combination therapy; HR=0.72, p=0.003). For patients with recurrent HCC, the presence of extrahepatic metastasis (HR=1.71, p=0.012) and treatment method (TACE+sorafenib therapy; HR=0.60, p=0.002) also was associated with survival. For patients treated with TACE+sorafenib, multivariate analysis showed decreased hazard of death with longer duration of sorafenib treatment (HR=0.9, p
