An ultrasensitive biosensor for alpha-fetoprotein was developed based on electrochemically synthesized polyaniline (PANI) nanowires, which were functionalized with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and polyethylene glycols (PEG). The prepared PEG/AuNPs/PANI composite, combining the electrical conductivity of the AuNPs/PANI with the robust antifouling ability of PEG, offered an ideal substrate for the development of low fouling electrochemical biosensors. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a well-known hepatocellular carcinoma biomarker, was used as a model analyte, and its antibody was immobilized on the PEG/AuNPs/PANI for the construction of the AFP immunosensor. Using the redox current of PANI as the sensing signal, in addition to the good biocompatibility of PEG/AuNPs and the anti-biofouling property of PEG, the developed immunosensor showed improved biosensing performances, such as wide linear range and ultralow detection limit (0.007pgmL(-1)). More importantly, it is label-free, reagentless and low fouling, making it capable of assaying AFP in real serum samples without suffering from significant interference or biofouling.
