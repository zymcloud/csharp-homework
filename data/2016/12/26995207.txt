Purpose:To compare the accuracy of the conventional and portal vein tracing methods in the right hepatic lobe in multidetector computed tomography (MDCT).Materials and methods:This retrospective study included patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions in the right hepatic lobe who underwent multiphasic MDCT and C-arm CT hepatic arteriography (C-arm CTHA) for chemoembolization. The accuracies of the conventional and portal vein tracing methods were evaluated using C-arm CTHA as the gold standard.Results:A total of 147 patients with 205 HCC nodules were included. The C-arm CTHA could identify all the tumour-feeding arteries and consequently demonstrated that 120 lesions were located in the anterior section, 78 in the posterior section, and 7 in the border zone. The accuracy rates of conventional vs. portal vein tracing methods were 71.7 % vs. 98.3 % for the anterior section lesions, 67.9 % vs. 96.2 % for the posterior section, and 28.6 % vs. 57.1 % for the border zone. The portal vein tracing method was more accurate than the conventional method (PConclusions:The portal vein tracing method should be used for sectional localization of HCCs in the right lobe, because it predicts the location more accurately than the conventional method.Key points:• Portal tracing method is more accurate than conventional method for tumour localization. • The conventional method is especially inaccurate in right anteroinferior or posterosuperior quadrants. • Scissurae between right anterior and posterior section may not be vertical but tilted.
