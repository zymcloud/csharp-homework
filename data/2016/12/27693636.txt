Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection induces hepatocarcinogenesis and malignant progression, yet global effects of the redundant viral mRNAs produced during infection are unexplored. Here, microRNA (miRNA) target prediction and whole genome expression analysis revealed that HBV pre-C/C mRNA leads to upregulation of multiple let-7a targeted genes. A let-7a complementary region from nt 86 to 108 in the HBV genome was then identified in HBV pre-C/C, pre-S, and S mRNAs. The let-7a sequestration effect by HBV mRNAs was observed under transfection and virus infection, which is dependent on the let-7a response sequence. Moreover, we found reduced AGO2 binding, as well as functional mRNA and protein de-repression of let-7a targets (e.g., c-myc, K-RAS, and CCR7), upon viral mRNA expression. Let-7a levels in the liver were significantly decreased in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with HBV infection and were negatively correlated with intrahepatic pre-S2 mRNA levels. Finally, both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that let-7a inhibition by HBV mRNAs resulted in enhanced HCC cell colony formation and tumor growth, providing evidence of the oncogenic potential of HBV mRNAs.
