As an essential post-translational modification, O-GlcNAcylation has been thought to be able to modulate various nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins and is emerging as a key regulator of multiple biological processes, such as transcription, cell growth, signal transduction, and cell motility. Recently, authoritative glycomics analyses have reported extensive crosstalk between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation, which always dynamically interplay with each other and regulate signaling, transcription, and other cellular processes. Also, plentiful studies have shown close correlation between YB-1 phosphorylation and tumorigenesis. Therefore, our study aimed to determine whether YB-1 was O-GlcNAc modified and whether such modification could interact with its phosphorylation during the process of HCC development. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were firstly conducted to reveal obvious up-regulation of YB-1, OGT and O-GlcNAc modification in HCC tissues. What is more, not only YB-1 was identified to be O-GlcNAcylated but hyper-O-GlcNAcylation was demonstrated to facilitate HCC cell proliferation in a YB-1 dependent manner. Moreover, we detected four specific O-GlcNAc sites and confirmed T126A to be the most effective mutant in HCC cell proliferation via close O-GlcNAcylation-phosphorylation interaction. Even more interestingly, we discovered that T126A-induced HCC cell retardation and subdued transcriptional activity of YB-1 could be partially reversed by T126A/S102E mutant. From all above, it is not difficult to find that glycosylated-YB-1 mainly enhanced cell proliferation through congenerous actions with YB-1 phosphorylation and thus played indispensable roles in fine-tuning cell proliferation and procession of HCC.
