Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth-most common cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated that there was a relationship between modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS) and survival of HCC. However, the results were inconsistent.Evidence acquisition:The following databases were searched for relevant articles published until June 2016: PubMed; EMBASE; Web of Science and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure. The strength of association between mGPS and OS of HCC was estimated by pooled HRs with corresponding 95% CIs.Evidence synthesis:Seven studies with 2047 HCC patients were included in this meta-analysis. The mGPS was an independent marker of poor prognosis in patients with HCC (HR=2.21; 95% CI: 1.73-2.82; I2=51%). In the subgroup analysis of study design, both prospective studies (HR=1.68; 95% CI: 1.35-2.11; I2=0%) and retrospective studies (HR=2.64; 95% CI: 1.92-3.62; I2=39%) with higher mGPS had shorter OS. The patients with resectable HCC and high mGPS also showed shorter OS (HR=2.33; 95% CI: 1.65-3.29; I2=63%). In the subgroup analysis by sample size, both large sample size studies (HR=2.56; 95% CI: 1.50-4.38; I2=72%) and small sample size studies (HR=2.00; 95% CI: 1.62-2.48; I2=0%) showed the same results.Conclusions:In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggested that mGPS might be an independent prognostic factor for HCC.
