Background and aims: Hepatic steatosis is the basis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NALFD). Mere fat accumulation within hepatocytes is considered the mild form of NAFLD, but can progress in some patients to advanced steatohepatitis (NASH), which may lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. However, even hepatic steatosis alone may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Patients and methods: In the present real life study 106 patients from the outpatient clinic of the Department for Gastroenterology and Hepatology with either NAFLD (n = 60) or other typical diagnoses (n = 46) were included. Ultrasound examination identified 77 patients with hepatic steatosis. Liver enzymes, lipid profile, surrogate cell death markers, and adiponectin were determined. Transient elastography (FibroscanÂ®) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) were performed. Results: Mean patient age was 46 years (23 - 62) for non-NAFLD and 53 years (18 - 71) for the NAFLD group. ALT and AST did not differ significantly between the two groups. Adiponectin and HDL were significantly lower in NAFLD (p < 0.05) and BIA profiles showed higher fat and fat free mass. Non-NAFLD patients with steatosis also exhibited an adverse metabolic profile. Overall steatosis was associated with factors of metabolic syndrome (MS) and CVD. Prevalence of CVD and factors of MS hint to steatosis as an early event for these conditions. Conclusion: Patients with steatosis are at higher cardiovascular and metabolic risk without differences in transaminases levels compared to those without steatosis. Steatosis diagnosed by ultrasound needs to rise attention for further metabolic alterations including CVD.
