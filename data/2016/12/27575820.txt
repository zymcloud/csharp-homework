Background & aims:Conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) is used to treat patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Radioembolization is a minimally invasive procedure that involves implantation of radioactive micron-sized particles loaded with yttrium-90 (Y90) inside the blood vessels that supply a tumor. We performed a randomized, phase 2 study to compare the effects of cTACE and Y90 radioembolization in patients with HCC.Methods:From October 2009 through October 2015, we reviewed patients with HCC of all Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages for eligibility. Of these, 179 patients with BCLC stages A or B met our enrollment criteria and were candidates for cTACE or Y90 therapy. Patients were assigned randomly to groups that received Y90 therapy (n = 24; 50% Child-Pugh A) or cTACE (n = 21; 71% Child-Pugh A). The primary outcome was time to progression (TTP), evaluated by intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included safety, rate of response (based on tumor size and necrosis criteria), and Kaplan-Meier survival time. We performed inverse probability of censoring weighting and competing risk analyses.Results:Patients in the Y90 radioembolization group had significant longer median TTP (>26 mo) than patients in the cTACE group (6.8 mo; P = .0012) (hazard ratio, 0.122; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.027-0.557; P = .007). This was confirmed by competing risk and inverse probability of censoring weighting analyses accounting for transplantation or death. A significantly greater proportion of patients in the cTACE group developed diarrhea (21%) than in the Y90 group (0%; P = .031) or hypoalbuminemia (58% in the cTACE group vs 4% in the Y90 group; P Conclusions:In a randomized phase 2 study of patients with HCC of BCLC stages A or B, we found Y90 radioembolization to provide significantly longer TTP than cTACE. Y90 radioembolization provides better tumor control and could reduce drop-out from transplant waitlists. ClinicalTrials.gov no. NCT00956930.
