There is scarce information about the link between specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and risk of liver disease among Latinos, despite the disproportionate burden of disease among this population. Our aim was to investigate nine SNPs in or near the following genes: PNPLA3, LYPLAL1, PPP1R3B, GCKR, NCAN, IRS1, PPARG, and ADIPOR2 and examine their association with persistently elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in Mexican adults. Data and samples were collected from 741 participants in the Mexican Health Worker Cohort Study, in Cuernavaca, Mexico. We identified 207 cases who had persistently elevated levels of ALT or AST (â‰¥40 U/L) and 534 controls with at least two consecutive normal ALT or AST results in a 6 month period, during 2004-2006 and 2011-2013. TaqMan assays were used to genotype the SNPs. The risk allele of PNPLA3 rs738409 was found to be associated with persistently elevated levels of ALT or AST, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, type 2 diabetes, and ancestry: (OR 2.28, 95 % CI 1.13, 4.58). A significant association was found between the LYPLAL1, PPP1R3B, and GCKR risk alleles and elevated ALT or AST levels among overweight/obese adults. These results suggest that among Mexicans, the PNPLA3 (rs738409), LYPLAL1 (rs12137855), PPP1R3B (rs4240624), and GCKR (rs780094) polymorphisms may be associated with a greater risk of chronic liver disease among overweight adults. This study is the first to examine these nine SNPs in a sample of adults in Mexico.
