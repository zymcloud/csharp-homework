Nanoparticles have resulted in great progress in biomedical imaging and targeted drug delivery in cancer theranostics. To develop nanoparticles as an effective carrier system for therapeutics, chemical structures and physicochemical properties of nanoparticle may provide a reliable means to predict the in vitro characteristics of nanoparticles. However, in vivo fates of nanoparticles, such as pharmacokinetics and tumor targeting efficiency of nanoparticles, have been difficult to predict beforehand. To predict the in vivo fates of nanoparticles in tumor-bearing mice, differences in physicochemical properties and in vitro cancer cell/macrophage uptake of 5 different nanoparticles with mean diameter of 200-250nm were comparatively analyzed, along with their circulation in adult zebrafish. The nanoparticles which showed favorable cellular uptake by macrophages indicated high unintended liver accumulation in vivo, which is attributed to the clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). In addition, blood circulation of nanoparticles was closely correlated in adult zebrafish and in mice that the zebrafish experiment may elucidate the in vivo behavior of nanoparticles in advance of the in vivo experiment using mammal animal models. This comparative study on various nanoparticles was conducted to provide the basic information on predicting the in vivo fates of nanoparticles prior to the in vivo experiments.
