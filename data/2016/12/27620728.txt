Objective:Early diagnosis and treatment of cancer may contribute substantially to complete cure, but it remains unknown whether treatment of early hepatocellular carcinoma can actually result in cure. This study was performed to clarify the cancer risk of the background liver after treating early hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Early hepatocellular carcinoma is defined as very well-differentiated cancer containing Glisson's triad. The cumulative incidence of classical hepatocellular carcinoma, hypervascular liver cancer detected on imaging studies, after resection of early hepatocellular carcinoma positive for anti-hepatitis C antibody (early hepatocellular carcinoma group, n = 105) was compared with that in patients with chronic liver disease positive for anti-hepatitis C antibody (control group, n = 751) and propensity score-matched patients after resection of classical hepatocellular carcinoma (classical hepatocellular carcinoma group, n = 105).Results:After a median follow-up of 4.8 years (range, 0.3-15.0), the cumulative incidence of classical hepatocellular carcinoma at 5 years was 56.9% (95% confidence interval, 44.2-67.7%) in the early hepatocellular carcinoma group and 70.6% (52.5-81.8%) in the classical hepatocellular carcinoma group as compared with 4.6% (2.8-6.4%) in the control group. The risk of the development of classical hepatocellular carcinoma in the early hepatocellular carcinoma group was significantly higher than that in the control group (hazard ratio, 17.5; 95% confidence interval, 12.1-25.3; P Conclusions:Treatment of early hepatocellular carcinoma cannot provide complete cure due to the substantial risk of developing classical hepatocellular carcinoma.
