Small cell undifferentiated (SCUD) hepatoblastoma is a rare variant of hepatoblastoma with poor outcome and loss of INI1 expression, sharing this with malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT). We studied all tumors from the files of the Kiel Pediatric Tumor Registry (KTR) with the initial diagnosis of SCUD and MRT. After re-review, we performed immunistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification for loss of expression and deletion of INI1/SMARCB1 in 23 tumors. Morphologically, 12 of the tumors had a small cell morphology, 9 showed the typical picture of MRT, and 2 were composed of both small cells and rhabdoid cells. All but 1 of the 23 tumors showed loss of INI1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Nineteen of the INI1 negative tumors were analyzed by FISH technique and all showed a deletion of the INI1/SMARCB1 gene (17 homozygous deletions, 2 heterozygous deletions). We investigated 14 of these cases by multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification and verified the deletions in all cases. In conclusion, we postulate that SCUD hepatoblastoma is not a hepatoblastoma but represents a malignant rhabdoid tumor of the liver. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
