Background:Local tumor progression (LTP) in early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) remains high. Tumor feeding artery ablation (FAA) before target tumor ablation was reported to reduce LTP in patients with HCC >3 cm. The aim of our study is to investigate whether FAA before target tumor ablation may reduce LTP in HCC Methods:We retrospectively analysis the outcome of patients with HCC Results:FAA significantly reduces LTP (FAA vs. non-FAA: local tumor progression 17.6% vs. 48.6%, p = 0.038), but not in intrahepatic recurrence: 29.4% vs. 25.7%, p = 0.778; or in overall recurrence rate: 41.2% vs. 62.9%, p = 0.14). The cumulative 1-year and 2-year LTP rates in FAA group were 17.6% and 17.6%, while 11.4% and 42.9% in non-FAA group (p = 0.073), respectively. The cumulative overall recurrence rates at 1-year and 2-year were 29.4% and 35.3% in FAA group, while 14.3% and 57.1% in non-FAA group (p = 0.130), respectively.Conclusions:FAA before target tumor ablation may decrease LTP in HCC
