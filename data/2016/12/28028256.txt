The purpose of treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer is to maintain the patient's quality of life(QOL)with continued treatment for as long as possible.Eribulin was approved in April 2011 for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, further increasing the selection of therapies available for the management of this disease.The current study presents a retrospective review of 31 patients who received eribulin in our hospital, and analyzes the factors related to the continuation and safety of its use.The median treatment continuation was 114 days(range, 8-281 days), and the treatment involved an average of 5 courses(range, 1-13 courses).There were no significant differences in the continuation of eribulin with regard to the number of previous chemotherapy regimens and modifications undergone by the patients.Neutropenia accounted for 80.6% of adverse eventsBGrade 3; however, the recovery was rapid.The rates of peripheral neuropathy and liver function failures were 12.9% and 6.5%, respectively. These results suggest that eribulin can be continued to be administered with the aim of maintaining QOL, and the therapy can be adjusted according to the patient's situation and the occurrence of adverse events by reducing the dose and treatment delays.
