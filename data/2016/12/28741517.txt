Caveolin-1 (CAV1) has emerged as a promoter of proliferation, metastasis, and chemoresistance in hepatoma cells, as well as a marker of poor prognosis in liver cancer. We discuss here current knowledge and future approaches to elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying CAV1 action during hepatocarcinogenesis and evaluate its potential use in clinical therapies.
