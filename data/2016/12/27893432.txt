Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with bone metastasis (BM) suffer from pain and other symptoms that significantly reduce their quality of life. We screened a microRNA (miRNA) microarray to identify potential serum biomarkers for BM in HCC patients. A miRNA microarray was used to screen for BM-related miRNAs in paired serum samples from HCC patients with BM and from HCC patients without BM. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to quantify candidate miRNAs in serum samples from 106 independent HCC patients. Levels of candidate miRNAs in tissue samples from an independent cohort of 296 HCC patients were evaluated by in situ hybridization and intratumoral tissue microarray. The migration and invasion capabilities of HCCLM3 and SMMC-7721 cells were evaluated following treatment with a mimic and an inhibitor of miR-34a. Ninety miRNAs were differentially expressed in sera from HCC patients with BM when compared with sera from non-BM HCC patients (P
