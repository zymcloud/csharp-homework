Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is the second most common benign solid liver lesion after hemangioma, occurring more frequently in young women. The prime differential diagnoses include hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hypervascular metastasis. As the management of FNH is typically conservative, imaging plays a key role in diagnostic pathway, and misdiagnosis may have a major clinical effect. In this article, we describe the ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging features of FNH, underlining the importance of typical radiological features that allow a specific noninvasive diagnosis. We present a large spectrum of a typical imaging findings that FNH may present and discuss the up-to-date diagnostic strategy.
