Indocyanine green can selectively accumulate in primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and extrahepatic metastases. We report a patient who underwent resection of pulmonary metastasis of HCC using a thoracoscopic near-infrared imaging system and fluorescent navigation surgery. A 66-year-old man with suspicion of pulmonary metastasis of HCC was referred to our hospital. Indocyanine green was injected intravenously at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight, 20 h before thoracoscopic surgery. An endoscopic indocyanine green near-infrared fluorescence imaging system showed clear blue fluorescence, indicating pulmonary metastasis of HCC in a lingular segment. We performed wide wedge resection using the fluorescence image for navigation to confirm the surgical margins. The specimen was histologically confirmed as a pulmonary metastasis of HCC. In conclusion, thoracoscopic indocyanine green near-infrared fluorescence imaging for pulmonary metastases of HCC is useful in identifying tumor locations and ensuring resection margins.
