miRNAs are involved in substantial biological passways, including tumorigenesis, cancer development and progression. Angiogenesis plays a vital role in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and VEGF is closely associated with the angiogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism of miRNAs in regulation tumorigenesis of HCC remains to be investigated. In the present research, we confirmed that miR-338-3p was suppressed both in HCC tissues and HCC cell lines. Then the tube formation, transwell and Chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay were carried out, such indicated that down-regulation of miR-338-3p can sharply increased, while up-regulation drastically suppressed angiogenesis of HCC cells in vitro. Moreover, MACC1 is predicted to be a target of miR-338-3p and we checked the prediction through luciferase assay. And then, our research showed that negative correlation existed between miR-338-3p and MACC1, β-catenin and VEGF that has been reported participated in cancer behavior in HCC cell lines. Subsequently, our assays illustrated that suppression miR-338-3p can up-regulate MACC1, β-catenin and VEGF expression of HCC cells. In conclusion, our research discovered that miR-338-3p can contribute to HCC angiogenesis by targeting MACC1, β-catenin and VEGF.
