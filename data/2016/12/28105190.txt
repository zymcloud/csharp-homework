When assessing outcome in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it is important to consider prognostic factors in background non-tumorous liver tissue as well as in the tumor, since multiple occurrence is associated with background liver status such as hepatitis. The current study aimed to elucidate molecular prognostic predictors that have an association with HCC background non-tumorous tissue. Microarray expression profiling identified aldo-keto reductase family 1, member B10 (AKR1B10) as a putative non-tumorous prognostic factor, and AKR1B10 gene expression was investigated in 158 curatively resected HCC cases by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. AKR1B10 expression (AKR1B10 value/GAPDH value Ã— 1,000) was significantly higher in tumor tissue (median, 9.2200; range, 0.0003-611.0200; n=158) than in the corresponding non-tumorous tissue (median, 0.5461; range, 0.0018-69.0300; n=158) (P<0.001). When the samples were grouped according to AKR1B10 expression in tumor tissue relative to non-tumorous tissue, tumor<non-tumorous expression (n=26) significantly correlated with poor recurrence-free survival (P=0.0074) and overall survival (OS) (P<0.0001), and was an independent prognostic factor for OS (P=0.0011) in a multivariate analysis. The ratio of AKR1B10 messenger RNA levels in HCC and corresponding non-tumorous tissues may predict prognosis after curative hepatectomy, with low expression in HCC tissue relative to non-tumorous tissue indicative of poor prognosis.
