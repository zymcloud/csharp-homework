Introduction:The elucidation of the clinical impact of comorbidities is important to optimize the treatment and follow-up strategy in oesophageal cancer. We aimed to clarify the surgical and long-term outcomes following oesophagectomy in oesophageal cancer patients with comorbidity.Methods:A total of 658 consecutive patients who underwent oesophagectomy for oesophageal cancer between 1985 and 2008 at our institution were enrolled. Based on the criteria of comorbidity as we defined it, we retrospectively reviewed and compared the surgical outcomes and survival between the comorbid (n = 251) and non-comorbid group (n = 407).Results:Postoperative morbidity and mortality were not significantly different between the two groups. The 5-year overall survival rate of the comorbid group was significantly lower (39.3% vs. 45.2%, adjusted HR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.07-1.62) but the 5-year disease-specific survival rate was not significantly different between the comorbid and non-comorbid groups (53.9% vs. 53.1%, adjusted HR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.86-1.42). The 5-year incidence rate of death from other diseases in the comorbid group was significantly higher than that in the non-comorbid group (26.7% vs. 14.8%, P < 0.01). The leading cause of death from other diseases was pneumonia.Conclusions:Oesophagectomy in oesophageal cancer patients with comorbidity can be safely performed. However, the overall survival after oesophagectomy in these patients was unfavorable because of the high incidence of death from other diseases, especially pneumonia.
