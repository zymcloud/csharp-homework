Background:A bronchobiliary fistula, an intercommunication between the biliary tract and bronchial trees, is an extremely rare complication after hepatectomy.Case presentation:A 70-year-old male underwent partial resection of the liver for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma under a thoracoabdominal approach. The immediate postoperative clinical course was uneventful, but the patient was febrile and laboratory examinations revealed leukocytosis on the 15th postoperative day. An intraabdominal abscess was suspected based on the computed tomography findings, and percutaneous drainage was performed. Bile was drained, and fluoroscopy using a contrast medium from the drainage tube revealed a communication between the cavity and the common hepatic duct. Two weeks after drainage, bilioptysis was seen. Fistulography demonstrated the presence of the bronchus in the right lower lobe of the lung via the subphrenic space. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed to have a bronchobiliary fistula. Fistulography revealed closure of the communication with the bronchus about a month after drainage. However, the bile leakage and bilioptysis did not stop even after endoscopic nasogastric biliary drainage, and ethanol injection therapy were performed. Eventually, residual right bisectionectomy without resection of the fistulous tract and involved lung was performed to remedy the intractable bile leakage. The clinical course after the reoperation was good without bile leakage, bilioptysis, or pulmonary disorders, and the patient was discharged 40 days after reoperation.Conclusions:We experienced a rare case of bronchobiliary fistula that occurred after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma. Careful attention should be paid to prevent bile leakage during hepatectomy, since bile leakage has the potential to cause a bronchobiliary fistula.
