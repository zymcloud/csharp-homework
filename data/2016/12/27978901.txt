Objective: To discuss the association between ultrasound screening frequency and total mortality in patients with HCC before diagnosing HCC, and explore the optimal ultrasound screening frequency for HCC high-risk groups. Methods: Retrospectively collected clinical data of 615 cases of liver cirrhosis who developed to HCC from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2015. Before diagnosing HCC, all patients were divided into five groups according to ultrasound screening frequency: 0-6, 7-12, 13-24, 25-36 months and not screened within 3 years (never screened). The chance to receive curative therapy, 5-year cumulative mortalities and independent factors of mortality in patients with HCC were analyzed. Results: Chances to receive curative therapy among the 0-6, 7-12, 13-24, 25-36 months and never screened groups were 38.2%, 27.2%, 25.4%, 23.8% and 19.7%, respectively (P<0.05). The 5-year overall mortality rates were 76.4%, 77.7%, 79.3%, 82.5% and 84.6%, respectively. Compared with 0-6 months, the adjusted OR of mortality for the other groups were 1.112, 1.235, 1.305 and 1.451, respectively (all P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that ultrasound screening frequency, curative treatment and Child-Pugh (class A/B) were the factors to affect long-term survival in patients with HCC (all P<0.05). Conclusion: For HCC high-risk groups, optimal ultrasound screening frequency is within 6 months, and high-frequency ultrasound screening can increase the chance of receiving curative treatment, reduce total mortality, and improve overall survival.
