Background:Dorema aucheri is a plant of Apiaceae family which is used widely in some states of Iran. Different extracts and essential oil of Dorema species contain flavonoids and cumarin compounds which have anti-hypertensive, cholesterol- and triglycerides-lowering properties. This study was undertaken to evaluate the genotoxic properties of hydroalcoholic and aqueous extracts of D. aucheri on human hepatoma cells using the comet assay method for safety evaluation.Materials and methods:In this method, after incubation of cells with different concentrations of extracts, cell suspensions were added to pre-coated normal agarose slides. After lysis, electrophoresis and neutralization process, staining was done by ethidium bromide and comets were observed using a fluorescence microscope. Tail length, percentage of DNA in tail and tail moment parameters were measured.Results:Statistical analysis of the results demonstrated that concentrations more than 500 Î¼g/ml of hydroalcoholic and aqueous extract of D. aucheri were genotoxic.Conclusion:It can be concluded from the results that taking the concentrations less than these dosages of extracts are safe but more studies are required to determine genotoxic mechanisms of this plant.
