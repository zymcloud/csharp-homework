Case 1 involved an 87-year-old woman. She had increased serum amylase levels, and intraductal papillary mucinous adenocarcinoma( IPMC)in the accessory pancreatic duct was diagnosed following various medical examinations. Radical surgery is possible for such a lesion when there are no issues detected following evaluation. The patient and her family decided that she should undergo surgery; therefore, pancreatoduodenectomy was performed for Stage III IPMC. Various morbidities required medical treatment, but she was finally discharged from hospital 89 days after surgery. She has had no recurrence 2 years and 11 months after surgery. Case 2 involved a 90-year-old man. He had liver dysfunction, and progressive hepatocellular carcinoma( HCC)was diagnosed based on computed tomography(CT)findings. The tumor size reduced to around 10 cm with enforced 2 degrees TACE. The patient and his family chose for him to undergo radical surgery; therefore, right trisegmentectomy of the liver was performed for Stage III HCC. He was discharged from the hospital 22 days after surgery, and has had no recurrence for the past 1.6 years. More careful examination and a general assessment are necessary to make decisions on surgical indications in super elderly patients.
