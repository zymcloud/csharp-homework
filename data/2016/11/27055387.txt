Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer and is increasing in incidence. The overall prognosis of patients with liver cancer is poor. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification in 5 stages is endorsed by European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD). This classification is recommended for treatment allocation. Because a small proportion of patients are suitable for curative surgical treatment, various locoregional therapies are widely used to manage patients with HCC. The image-guided therapies, also called interventional radiology or interventional oncology (IO) techniques consisted in percutaneous or endovascular approach. This article reviews the different IO treatments available in HCC patients and the strength of the data.
