Backgrounds/aims:The roles of portal hypertension (PHT) on the postoperative course after hepatectomy are still debated. The aim of this study was to evaluate surgical outcomes of hepatectomy in patients with PHT.Methods:Data from 152 cirrhotic patients who underwent hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were collected retrospectively. Patients were divided into two groups according to the preoperative presence of PHT as follows: 44 patients with PHT and 108 without PHT. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was used to overcome selection biases.Results:There were no significant differences in morbidity (56.8% vs. 51.9%, p=0.578) and 90-days mortality (4.5% vs. 4.6%, p=0.982) between the two groups. Post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) was not significantly different between the two groups (43.2% vs. 35.2%, p=0.356). Patients without PHT had a better 5-year disease-free survival than those with PHT, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (30.9% vs. 17.2%, p=0.081). Five-year overall survivals were not significantly different between the two groups (46.6% vs. 54.9%, p=0.724). Repeat analyses after PSM showed similar rates of morbidity (p=0.819), mortality (p=0.305), PHLF (p=0.648), disease-free survival (p=0.241), and overall survival (p=0.619). The presence of PHT was not associated with either short-term or long-term poor surgical outcomes.Conclusions:Child-Pugh A and B patients with PHT have surgical outcomes similar to those without PHT. Hepatectomy can be safely performed and can also be considered as a potentially curative treatment in HCC patients with PHT.
