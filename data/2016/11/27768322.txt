Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Most current therapeutic agents lack the tumor-targeting efficiency and result in a nonselective biodistribution in the body. In our previous study, we identified a peptide Ala-Pro-Asp-Thr-Lys-Thr-Gln (APDTKTQ) that can selectively bind to the receptor of advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), an immunoglobulin superfamily cell surface molecule overexpressed during HCC malignant progression. Here, we report the design of a mixed micelles system modified with this peptide to target HCC cells. Specifically, we modified Pluronic F68 (F68) with APDTKTQ (F68-APDTKTQ), and we conjugated d-Î±-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) by a disulfide linker (TPGS-S-S-PLGA). We mixed TPGS-S-S-PLGA and F68-APDTKTQ (TSP/FP) to form a micelle, followed by the loading of oridonin (ORI). The prepared micelles showed a homogeneously spherical shape without aggregation, triggered an increased cellular uptake, and induced apoptosis in more cells than did the free ORI. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of this APDTKTQ-modified ORI-loaded TSP/FP mixed micelle system as a promising strategy for HCC-targeting therapy.
