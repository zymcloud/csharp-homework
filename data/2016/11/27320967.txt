A 2-year-old female beagle was referred to our hospital for evaluation of anemia. Laboratory tests, including bone marrow cytology, revealed non-regenerative immune-mediated anemia (NRIMA). Although initial immunosuppressive multi-drug therapy was not effective, additional administration of danazol was successful in treating the anemia. However, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) developed about 20 months after the administration of danazol. In humans, several cases of development of HCC after the administration of danazol have been reported. The present report describes a case of HCC development in a dog after chronic administration of danazol in addition to other immunosuppressive drugs.
