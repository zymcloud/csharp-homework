Background:Whether hepatic resection (HR) could be performed for patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) B/C stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial, and the safety and clinical value of HR combined with antiviral therapy for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC with BCLC-B/C stage remain to be investigated.Methods:We retrospectively evaluated 126 patients with BCLC stage B/C HCC who underwent HR. These patients were divided into the antiviral group (Group A, n = 86) and the control group (Group B, n = 40). The operative indications and prognosis of 126 patients were analyzed.Results:The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates for Group A and Group B were 55.4%, 36.1%, 33.7% and 53.8%, 28.2%, 23.1%, respectively. The corresponding overall survival (OS) rates for the two groups were 89.2%, 61.4%, 45.8% and 82.1%, 48.7%, 33.3%, respectively. The DFS and OS for Group A were better than for Group B (p = 0.013, and p = 0.038, respectively). Antiviral therapy was an independent protective factor of late tumor recurrence [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.391, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.190-0.806, p = 0.011] but not of early tumor recurrence.Conclusion:It is safe and feasible to perform HR combined with antiviral therapy for HBV-related HCC with BCLC stage B/C.
