History An asymptomatic 33-year-old woman was referred to the Hepatology Department in 2013 for work-up of indeterminate multifocal liver masses. These lesions were discovered incidentally at multiphase contrast material-enhanced multidetector computed tomography (CT) performed in 2004 to investigate right lower quadrant pain. Imaging surveillance at sporadic intervals revealed slow progressive growth of the lesions over time; however, the number of lesions remained constant. There was no history of cancer, nor were there predisposing factors for chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. The patient had a history of menorrhagia, which was managed with oral contraceptive use for 20 years; this was stopped in 2013 after hysterectomy. The patient's γ-glutamyl transferase (77 U/L [1.28 μkat/L]; normal level, <55 U/L [<0.92 μkat/L]) and C-reactive protein (97.1 mg/L [924.8 nmol/L]; normal level, <8 mg/L [<76.2 nmol/L]]) levels were chronically elevated at serum testing. In 2013, 9 years after the initial CT examination, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with gadoxetic acid (Primovist; Bayer Healthcare, Whippany, NJ) was performed. Finally, ultrasonography (US)-guided biopsy of one of the lesions (in segment 5/6) was performed a year after MR imaging.
