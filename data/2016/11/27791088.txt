Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped RNA virus that modifies intracellular trafficking processes. The mechanisms that HCV and other viruses use to modify these events are poorly understood. In this study, we observed that two different RNA viruses, HCV and Sendai, cause inhibition of ras-related protein Rab-7 (Rab7)-dependent endosome-lysosome fusion. In both cases, viral infection causes cleavage of the Rab7 adaptor protein RILP (Rab interacting lysosomal protein), which is responsible for linking Rab7 vesicles to dynein motor complexes. RILP cleavage results in the generation of a cleaved RILP fragment (cRILP) missing the N terminus of the molecule. Although RILP localizes in a perinuclear fashion, cRILP moves to the cell periphery. Both knockdown of RILP and expression of cRILP reproduced the HCV-induced trafficking defect, and restoring full-length RILP reversed the trafficking effects of virus. For the first 3 d after electroporation of HCV RNA, intracellular virus predominates over secreted virus, but the quantity of intracellular virus then rapidly declines as secreted virus dominates. The transition from the intracellular-predominant to the secretion-predominant phenotype corresponds to the time course of cRILP generation. Expressing cRILP directly prevents intracellular virus accumulation at early times without affecting net virus production. The ability of cRILP to promote virus secretion could be prevented by a kinesin inhibitor. HCV thus modifies cellular trafficking by cleaving RILP, which serves to redirect Rab7-containing vesicles to a kinesin-dependent trafficking mode promoting virion secretion. Cleavage of a Rab adaptor protein is thus a mechanism by which viruses modify trafficking patterns of infected cells.
