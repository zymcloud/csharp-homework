Spontaneous regression (SR) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a rare event. Several factors have been suggested as the underlying mechanism but the exact pathogenesis is not understood. The role of sofosbuvir in HCC regression has not been established yet. We report here a case of a 59 years old male who developed HCC secondary to chronic HCV infection. He failed treatment with interferon but the tumour regressed completely after treatment of hepatitis C with sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 48 weeks.
