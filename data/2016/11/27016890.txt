Aim:This study aimed to determine the association between visceral adipose tissue (VAT), liver fat (LF) content, and other markers of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) in dysmetabolic adults.Methods:Subjects from the NUMEVOX cohort were included if they fulfilled at least one MetS criterion. They then underwent a thorough metabolic and cardiovascular evaluation, including arterial stiffness, atherosclerotic plaques, homoeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) indices and OPG. VAT and LF content were measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrasound examination of arteries and arterial stiffness were recorded, and age- and gender-adjusted paired correlations calculated.Results:Body mass index, waist circumference and MRI-derived VAT correlated with OPG, whereas abdominal subcutaneous fat did not. OPG levels were strongly correlated with LF content (r=0.25, P=0.003), liver markers such as alanine aminotransferase (r=0.39, P<0.001) and HOMA-IR index (r=0.39, P<0.0001). Plasma OPG also correlated with arterial stiffness and the number of atherosclerotic sites.Conclusion:Plasma OPG levels are positively associated with both liver markers and increased LF content, but not with subcutaneous fat in dysmetabolic men. These findings suggest that elevated OPG levels may play a role in the link between fatty liver disease and enhanced cardiovascular risk.
