Purpose:We evaluated the value of metastasectomy in patients treated with targeted therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).Methods:The medical records of 325 patients who presented with mRCC were reviewed; among these patients, 33 underwent complete metastasectomy followed by targeted therapy (complete metastasectomy group), 29 underwent incomplete metastasectomy followed by targeted therapy (incomplete metastasectomy group), and 263 treated with targeted therapy alone (non-metastasectomy group). We estimated progression-free and overall survivals using Kaplan-Meier curves. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the prognostic significance of metastasectomy.Results:Clinicopathological variables did not differ among the three groups except for age, history of nephrectomy, type of metastasis, the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk groups, histology, and bone metastasis. The median progression-free survivals were 29.5, 18.8, and 14.8 months in the complete, incomplete, and non-metastasectomy groups (p < 0.001). Complete metastasectomy (hazard ratio 0.431, p = 0.001) was an independent predictor of disease progression, along with targeted agents, risk groups, sarcomatoid feature, and number of metastatic sites. The median overall survivals were 92.5, 29.6, and 23.5 months in the complete, incomplete, and non-metastasectomy groups (p < 0.001). Complete metastasectomy (hazard ratio 0.378, p = 0.001) was an independent predictor of overall survival, along with targeted agents, type of metastasis, risk groups, sarcomatoid feature, and number of metastatic sites.Conclusions:Complete metastasectomy performed before targeted therapy might improve progression-free and overall survivals in patients with mRCC.
