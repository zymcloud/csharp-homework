Chronic hepatitis B infection (CHB) is a known risk factor for malignancy. Unlike hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), less is known about the risk of non-HCC malignancy. However, epidemiology and pathologic evidence suggests a strong association between non-Hodgkin lymphoma and CHB. Data regarding the risk of other malignancies, such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, are mixed. Surveillance and appropriate treatment of infection and malignancy in these patients is essential. Further study of these associations is needed and may bring new insights in the pathogenesis and treatment of these diseases.
Chronic hepatitis B; Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; Non-Hodgkin lymphoma; Nonâ€“hepatocellular carcinoma malignancy; Pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
