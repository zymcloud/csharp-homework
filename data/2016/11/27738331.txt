MicroRNAs (miRNAs) inhibit or improve the malignant progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We previously reported that compared to health controls, patients with liver cirrhosis present the highest levels of circulating miR-885-5p, followed by those with chronic hepatitis B and those with HCC. However, the molecular involvement of miR-885-5p in HCC metastasis is presently unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the expression of miR-885-5p negatively correlated with the invasive and metastatic capabilities of human HCC tissue samples and cell lines. We found that miR-885-5p expression levels correlated with the survival of patients with HCC. Overexpression of miR-885-5p decreased metastasis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of miR-885-5p improved proliferation of non-metastatic HCC cells. Furthermore, we disclosed that miR-885-5p targeted gene encoding β-catenin CTNNB1, leading to decreased activity of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The present study indicates that miR-885-5p suppresses the metastasis of HCC and inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by its CTNNB1 target, which suggests that miR-885-5p to be a promising negative regulator of HCC progression and as a novel therapeutic agent to treat HCC.
