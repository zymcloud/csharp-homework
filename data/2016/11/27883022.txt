Guanine nucleotide binding protein alpha 13 (GNA13) has been found to play critical roles in the development of several human cancers. However, little is known about GNA13 expression and its clinical significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In our study, GNA13 was reported to be significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues, and this was correlated with several clinicopathological parameters, including tumor multiplicity (P = 0.004), TNM stage (P = 0.002), and BCLC stage (P = 0.010). Further Cox regression analysis suggested that GNA13 expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P = 0.014) and disease-free survival (P = 0.005). Moreover, we found that overexpression of GNA13 couldn't promote cell proliferation in vitro, but could significantly increase the invasion ability of HCC cells. Together, our study demonstrates GNA13 may be served as a prognostic biomarker for HCC patients after curative hepatectomy, in which high expression of GNA13 suggests poor prognosis of HCC patients.
