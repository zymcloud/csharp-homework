H19, one of the first found cancer-associated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), is involved in the development and progression of many types of tumors. An aberrant expression of H19 was observed in hepatocellular carcinoma, cervical cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and colorectal cancer. However, the exact effects and molecular mechanisms of H19 in glioma progression are still unknown up to now. In this study, we investigated the role of H19 in human glioma cell lines and clinical tumor samples in order to determine the function of this molecule. In our research, lncRNA-H19 was specifically upregulated in glioma cell lines and promoted glioma cell growth through targeting miR-140. Knockdown of H19 inhibited the proliferation and invasion of human glioma cell and suppressed its metastasis in vitro and in vivo. In addition, miR-140 dependent inhibitor of apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 (iASPP) regulation was required in H19 induced glioma cell growth. These findings indicated that H19 might regulate the tumor growth and metastasis via miR-140 dependent iASPP regulation. Taken together, our data indicated that H19 might be an oncogenic lncRNA that promoted proliferation and metastasis of glioma and could be regarded as a therapeutic target in human glioma.
