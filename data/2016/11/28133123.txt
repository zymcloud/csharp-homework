Needle tract implantation after percutaneous ethanol injection therapy(PEIT)for hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)is rare. Surgical treatment of such HCC implants is still controversial. We herein report the case of a patient who underwent laparoscopic resection for peritoneal dissemination after PEIT. An 81-year-old man underwent PEIT for primary HCC at another hospital. Thereafter, percutaneous radiofrequency ablation(RFA)was performed twice for intrahepatic recurrence. After the second RFA, a mass lesion was detected at the subhepatic space on computed tomography(CT). We reevaluated the CT and diagnosed the patient with peritoneal dissemination after PEIT. Laparoscopic resection was performed. However, the patient developed recurrences at the thoracic wall and peritoneum 12 months after laparoscopic surgery. Those 2 tumors were resected, and he remains alive, approximately 30 months after the laparoscopic resection. Laparoscopic extirpation of tract seeding may provide better clinical outcomes in select patients.
