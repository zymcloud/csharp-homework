We report a case of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma with stem cell features, cholangiolocellular subtype arising about 15 years after placement of an inferior vena cava stent for primary Budd-Chiari syndrome. Pre-surgical differentiation of the tumor from hepatocellular carcinoma was difficult because of elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein and hypervascularity in the arterial phase. Histopathological examination revealed atypical cells forming ductal and alveolar structures showing a vague border with the surrounding liver. Immunostaining showed positive results for epithelial membrane antigen, mainly localized to the apical surface of the tubules, representing a characteristic finding for combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma with stem cell features, cholangiolocellular subtype. Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma with stem cell features arising in the liver with hepatic damage from Budd-Chiari syndrome is not common, but diagnosis is important to manage the malignancy, which shows different clinical behaviors from hepatocellular carcinoma.
