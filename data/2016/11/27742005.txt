Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has a significant public health impact. There are currently 7 approved therapies for chronic HBV, including standard and pegylated interferon (IFN)-Î±, and 5 nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUCs). IFN offers benefits over NUCs, including a finite duration of therapy and a higher rate of clearance of hepatitis Be antigen and surface antigen. These benefits need to be weighed against the potential adverse effects of IFN therapy. Some patients should not receive IFN because of advanced liver disease or comorbidities. This article reviews the mechanisms of action, efficacy, and clinical use of IFN therapy for HBV infection.
