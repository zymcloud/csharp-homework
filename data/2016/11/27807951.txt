A 65-year-old Chinese male was referred to our hospital for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Aggressive combined therapy with surgical resection of the right upper lung lesion and chemotherapy was performed. One month later, continued Icotinib treatment was used as magnetic resonance imaging revealed liver metastasis (LM). Interestingly, complete remission of the patient's LM lesions was achieved in six months. To our knowledge, this is the first report documenting a successful case of an NSCLC patient with LM treated with Icotinib after receiving a radical resection for pulmonary carcinoma. Our experience could provide a treatment strategy for patients with similar disease.
