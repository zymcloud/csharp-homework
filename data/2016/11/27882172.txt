microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are crucial regulators of gene expression at the post-translational level through promoting mRNA degradation or the repression of translation of target genes. miRs have been confirmed to serve a dominant role in tumor biology. miR-486-5p has been ascertained to be involved in non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma; however, the expression and function of miR-486-5p in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has yet to be elucidated. The present study aimed to analyze the expression levels of miR-486-5p in ESCC tissues and paired normal adjacent tissues, and determine the effects of miR-486-5p on esophageal cancer cells using MTT, wound scratch and apoptosis assays. The current results showed that miR-486-5p was significantly downregulated in ESCC specimens. Ectopic expression of miR-486-5p by synthetic mimics reduced cell proliferation and migration and induced increased cell apoptosis. The results indicated miR-486-5p may function as a tumor suppressor in ESCC. The present study demonstrated that miR-486-5p was downregulated in ESCC and served a anti-oncogene role in ESCC via affecting cellular migration.
