Purpose:To explore whether superb microvascular imaging (SMI) technology could be helpful for the evaluation of hepatic tumors.Materials and methods:Our institutional review board approved this study, and informed consent was obtained from all of the patients. Twenty-three patients with 29 hepatic tumors were enrolled in our study. The tumors consisted of hemangiomas (n=15), focal nodular hyperplasias (FNHs) (n=7), and hepatocellular carcinomas (n=7). All lesions were pathologically (n=2) or radiologically (n=27) confirmed. The mean tumor diameter was 1.9cm (range, 0.9cm to 5.0cm). Using SMI technology, all lesions were scanned and categorized into subgroups according to the flow pattern on the SMI.Results:The hemangiomas exhibited nodular rim patterns (33%) and spotty dot-like patterns (20%), and both of these findings were very specific for the diagnosis of hemangioma. The FNHs exhibited spoke-wheel patterns (43%) and radiating vessel patterns (29%) that were very specific findings for the diagnosis of FNH. The other tumors did not exhibit any specific patterns on SMI.Conclusion:Evaluations of the inner vascularities of hepatic tumors with the SMI technique were feasible, and the SMI features were significantly different between the different types of hepatic tumors. These differences could aid the diagnoses of hepatic tumors with US.
