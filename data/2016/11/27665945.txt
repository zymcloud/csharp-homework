Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most prevalent type of tumor among primary tumors affecting the liver. Rapamycin is currently used as a basis for chemotherapy in the treatment of cancers, including the liver. Because it shows several adverse effects, minimizing these effects without compromising efficacy is important. In this sense other drugs may be used concomitantly. One of these drugs is fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), which has shown therapeutic effect in various pathological situations, having antioxidant and anti-inflammatory proprieties. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the activity of rapamycin in combination with the FBP in HepG2 cell proliferation and the mechanisms involved. HepG2 cells were analyzed after 72 h of treatment with both drugs. Cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, cytokines, apoptosis, senescence, autophagy and oxidative stress were accessed. Î™t was demonstrated that the combination is more efficient than the single use of substances, because subtherapeutic doses of rapamycin, when associated to FBP become effective, reducing cell proliferation, through a significant increase in the production of tiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), suggesting that this might be the cause of death by apoptosis. According to these results, we believe that the association of both drugs may be a promising choice for the treatment of hepatocarcinoma.
