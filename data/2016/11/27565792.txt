Fucosylation of N-glycoproteins has been implicated in various diseases, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, few studies have performed site-specific analysis of fucosylation in liver-secreted proteins. In this study, we characterized the fucosylation patterns of liver-secreted proteins in HCC plasma using a workflow to identify site-specific N-glycoproteins, where characteristic B- and/or Y-ion series with and without fucose in collision-induced dissociation were used in tandem mass spectrometry. In total, 71 fucosylated N-glycopeptides from 13 major liver-secreted proteins in human plasma were globally identified by LC-MS/MS. Additionally, 37 fucosylated N-glycopeptides were newly identified from nine liver-secreted proteins, including alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, ceruloplasmin, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1/2, alpha-2-macroglobulin, serotransferrin, and beta-2-glycoprotein 1. Of the fucosylated N-glycopeptides, bi- and tri-antennary glycoforms were the most common ones identified in liver-secreted proteins from HCC plasma. Therefore, we suggest that this analytical method is effective for characterizing fucosylation in liver-secreted proteins.
