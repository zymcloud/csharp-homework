We analyzed whether TUR was feasible in 4 cases of urinary bladder recurrence of sigmoid colon cancer that invaded into the bladder. Case No. 1 involved a 66-year-old male who presented with sigmoid colon cancer that had invaded the urinary bladder; he underwent sigmoidectomy with partial bladder resection. Six months after the operation, a small, protruded lesion in his urinary bladder was detected and TUR was performed. He has been cancer free for 10 years. Case No. 2 involved a 53- year-old female who underwent sigmoidectomy and hepatectomy for her sigmoid colon cancer and liver metastasis. She developed bladder and liver metastases, which were resected. Four months later, she underwent TUR because she developed a small recurrent tumor in the bladder. Since then, she has had no intrapelvic recurrence for 6 years. Case No. 3 was a 44- year-old male who underwent bladder-preserving resection for a sigmoid colon cancer that had invaded his bladder. He developed a relatively large bladder tumor 1 year 6 months later. TUR was performed and he was administered CRT. He has had no recurrences for 2 years 5 months. Case No. 4 was a 68-year-old male who underwent bladder-preserving surgery for a sigmoid colon cancer that had invaded his bladder. Because he developed a recurrence in the bladder, he underwent TUR 3 months later. He developed a recurrence in the bladder again 1 year 7 months later, and he underwent TUR again. Multiple organ metastases became evident and was prescribed chemotherapy for 2 years. From these cases, we conclude that TUR may be a feasible option for small, protruded recurrences in the bladder, but we should not hesitate to perform total cystectomy if the first TUR is unsuccessful.
