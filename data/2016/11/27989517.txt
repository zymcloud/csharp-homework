Aim:Diabetes mellitus (DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) among chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients increases risks for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and more rapid progression to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aim to evaluate the prevalence of DM and MetSyn among HCV patients, focusing on age-specific and race/ethnicity-specific disparities.Methods:We retrospectively evaluated 2003-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data for age and race disparities in concurrent DM and MetSyn among HCV patients. Multivariate logistic regression models evaluated for independent predictors of DM and MetSyn among HCV patients.Results:Overall U.S. prevalence of HCV was 1.29% from 2003 to 2012 and prevalence of DM and MetSyn among HCV patients was 17.5% and 35.0%, respectively. Higher rates of DM (36.9% vs. 3.3%, pConclusion:Among chronic HCV patients, the highest risk of DM and MetSyn was seen among older patients, African Americans, and women. These groups are at higher risk of cirrhosis and HCC due to concurrent NAFLD.
