The clinical efficacy of thymosin α1 (Tα1) therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) subsequent to radical hepatectomy is unclear. In the present study, the impact of Tα1 therapy on outcomes in HCC patients after radical hepatectomy was retrospectively evaluated. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for 146 patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCC who were treated by radical hepatectomy and subsequently with Tα1 therapy, as well as for 412 control patients with HBV-associated HCC treated by radical hepatectomy. Propensity score matching was used to minimize confounding variables due to baseline differences. Liver function, recurrence-free survival and overall survival rates were compared between the two groups. Serum markers of liver function were significantly improved in the Tα1 group compared with the control group. The 1-, 2- and 3-year overall survival rates were 87.2, 82.0 and 68.4% in the Tα1 group and 78.2, 64.2 and 49.7% in the control group (P=0.011). The 1-, 2- and 3-year recurrence-free survival rates were 79.7, 70.8 and 67.3% in the Tα1 group and 69.9, 61.5 and 51.6% in the control group (P=0.019). The results suggested that post-hepatectomy Tα1 therapy improves liver function and significantly prolong recurrence-free and overall survival in patients with HBV-associated HCC.
