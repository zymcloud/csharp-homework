BACKGROUND Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is the most frequent skin cancer in solid organ recipients, and also a typical malignancy in HIV-infected persons. CASE REPORT We describe here a rare case of primary nodal KS without mucocutaneous manifestations, diagnosed in a 20-year-old HIV/HBV co-infected patient 12 months after liver transplantation (LT), the first one performed in a HIV-positive patient in Poland. The course of the disease was very aggressive; the patient died four weeks after general lymphadenopathy appearance. In the autopsy, KS infiltration was found in numerous lymph nodes and in the lung' apexes without skin or other organs' involvement. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, posttransplant KS may present as general lymphadenopathy without mucocutaneous manifestations, thus mimicking posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, which is often the first clinical suspicion. Lymph node histopathological examination is necessary to make the right diagnosis.
