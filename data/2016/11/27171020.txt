Purpose To retrospectively compare the perfusion parameters of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) measured with dynamic contrast material-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with surrounding liver parenchyma to determine the relationship between these parameters and uncensored overall survival (OS). Materials and Methods This retrospective study had institutional review board approval, and informed consent was waived. DCE MR imaging was performed in 92 patients with advanced HCC before systemic treatment was administered (19 patients received a placebo). Three semiquantitative (peak, slope, and area under the gadolinium concentration-time curve [AUC]) and six quantitative (arterial fraction, arterial flow, portal flow, total blood flow, distribution volume, and mean transit time) parameters were calculated by placing regions of interest in the largest area of the tumor and background liver parenchyma. The DCE MR imaging parameters between the tumor and normal liver were compared with paired Wilcoxon test. By using the Cox proportional hazards model for univariate and multivariate analyses, the association of DCE MR imaging parameters and OS was investigated. Results HCC demonstrated significantly higher peak, slope, AUC, arterial fraction, and arterial flow but lower portal flow, distribution volume, and mean transit time than did the background liver (all P Â© RSNA, 2016 An earlier incorrect version of this article appeared online.
