TTF1-NP (5,2',4'-trihydroxy-6,7,5'-trimethoxyflavone nanoparticles), derived from the traditional Changbai Mountain medicinal plant Sorbaria sorbifolia (SS), has been showed its anti-cancer effect in various liver cancer cell types and tissues. The present study was designed to evaluate the antitumor mechanism of the TTF1-NP against HepG2 hepatoma cells and HepG2 cells-induced hepatocarcinoma (HCC) in nude mouse model. Here we demonstrated that TTF1-NP inhibits tube formation of HUVECs and HepG2 cell migration and invasion, and inhibits tumor growth in nude mice implanted with HepG2 cells through the downregulation of STAT3 protein and activation, along with VEGF, KDR, bFGF, MMP2 and MMP9 levels. We further revealed that TTF1-NP decreased the DNA-binding capacity of STAT3. Together our results provide a mechanism by which TTF1-NP suppresses cancer cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis through the action of STAT3 and suggests TTF1-NP as a potential therapy for hepatocellular cancer treatment.
