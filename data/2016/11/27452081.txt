Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) refers to a family of mesenchymal neoplasms composed of angiomyolipomas, clear cell "sugar" tumors of the lung, and lymphangioleiomyomatoses. These tumors have a distinctive and common component of perivascular epithelioid cells that show an association with blood vessel walls and immunohistochemically display myomelanocytic differentiation. The unique neoplasms have been shown to have an expanded range through a variety of case reports, including visceral, intra-abdominal, soft tissue, and bone tumors. The retroperitoneum, abdominopelvic region, and uterus have been reported to be the most common sites. Most PEComas follow a benign course. However, reports of malignant PEComas are increasing. Many papers have described uterine PEComas, but to our knowledge, there have not yet been any reports of a malignant PEComa arising concomitant with another epithelial tumor and mesenchymal tumor. We report herein the case of a 67-year-old woman who experienced a malignant uterine PEComa infiltrating a preexisting intramural leiomyoma with synchronous well differentiated endometrial carcinoma and multiple liver and lung metastases.
