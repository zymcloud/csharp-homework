HIF-1α and LDH-A are important targets for hypoxia-driven drug resistance. Mitochondria targeted fluorescent manganese(II)-complexes can be used as potential fluorescence imaging agents, MRI contrast agents and HIF-1α and LDH-A involved anticancer complexes. In this study, a fluorescent manganese(II) nanoparticle, labeled as (PEG-Mn-BDA), was synthesized and used as both fluorescent and MRI imaging agents in cancer cells. In vitro bioassay results indicate that PEG-Mn-BDA was able to inhibit LDH-A activity and depolarize mitochondrial membrane potential with the generation of intracellular ROS, which contributed to the induction of apoptosis. Moreover, the pro-apoptotic protein, caspase 3 was highly expressed. In vivo, PEG-Mn-BDA could also exert inhibition on a mouse hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft. These results suggest that mitochondria targeted PEG-Mn-BDA was able to simultaneously induce selective inhibition on cancer cells and a mouse carcinoma xenograft, label cancer cells with fluorescence and enhance MRI contrast. Therefore, PEG-Mn-BDA is a good candidate for cancer treatment and imaging.
