Oligometastasis is defined as a transitional state between localized and widespread systemic metastatic cancers. In colorectal cancer, the prognostic factors and prognostic value of preoperative serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) for patients with colorectal liver oligometastases (CLOM) undergoing hepatic resection have not been well explored. Therefore, the present study included 141 patients with CLOM (â‰¤5 liver metastases) who underwent R0 resection from 2005 to 2012. The association of clinicopathological factors including preoperative CA19-9 and CEA levels with overall survival (OS) was analyzed with univariate and multivariate analyses. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with high CA19-9 levels tended to have poorer OS than those with low levels (median OS 21.5 vs. 64.0 months, P = 0.002). Preoperative CEA levels were not significantly associated with OS (P > 0.05). Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that larger tumor size of liver metastases (HR 1.911; 95 % CI 1.172-3.114; P = 0.009), bilobar distribution (HR 1.776; 95 % CI 1.097-2.873; P = 0.019), and higher preoperative CA19-9 levels (HR 1.954; 95 % CI 1.177-3.242; P = 0.010) were independent predictors of poor OS for patients with CLOM. Our study identified tumor size, distribution, and preoperative CA19-9 levels as independent prognostic factors for OS of patients with CLOM. In particular, measurement of preoperative CA19-9 levels offers an easy tool that could help identify high-risk patients and aid in improving the management of patients with CLOM.
