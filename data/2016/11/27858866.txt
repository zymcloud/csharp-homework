Objective:To investigate the relationship between excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1)-4533/8092, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-238/308 polymorphisms, and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Guangxi Zhuang population of China.Methods:Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method was used to detect the ERCC1-4533/8092 and TNF-α-238/308 polymorphisms in 88 cases with HCC and 82 cases of normal control.Results:There were no differences in the frequency distribution of ERCC1-4533 and TNF-α-238 polymorphisms in the HCC group and the control group (P > 0.05). The genotype frequency distributions of the ERCC1-8092 and TNF-α-308 in the HCC group and the control group were different (P Conclusion:The genetic polymorphisms of ERCC1-8092 and TNF-α-308 are associated with the risk of HCC in Guangxi Zhuang population of China.
