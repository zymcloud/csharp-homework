Purpose:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with various metabolic abnormalities that can increase the risk of an osteoporotic fracture. Across the few previous studies of the association between NAFLD and bone mineral density (BMD), the association was not consistent. We examined the association between BMD and NAFLD in generally healthy adults.Methods:The subjects who visited the Seoul National University Hospital for health checkup between 2005 and 2015 were included. Men aged more than 40 and postmenopausal women were included. Lumbar spine and femoral neck (FN) BMD were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Liver ultrasonography was conducted to evaluate the extent of fatty changes. After excluding subjects with a secondary cause of liver disease such as heavy drinking or viral hepatitis, multivariable linear regression analysis adjusted for possible cofactors was performed to investigate the association between BMD and NAFLD.Results:A total of 6634 subjects was included in this study (men:women = 3306:3328). Multivariate regression analysis revealed a significant negative association between FN BMD and NAFLD in men (β = -0.013, p = 0.029). However, there was a positive correlation between lumbar spine BMD and NAFLD in postmenopausal women (β = 0.022, p = 0.005).Conclusions:Moderate or severe NAFLD exerted a detrimental effect on FN BMD in men. However, moderate or severe NAFLD had a positive effect on lumbar spine BMD in postmenopausal women. Potential sex-specific differences of the effect of NAFLD on BMD need to be elucidated further.
