Purpose:Aberrant expression of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) has been observed in human malignancies. However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be established. The purpose of this study was to detect eIF4E expression and to evaluate its clinical relevance.Methods:The eIF4E expression was studied in ninety HCC and randomly selected thirty-one non-tumor tissues from the same patient cohort, as well as in normal hepatic and HCC cell lines. The relation between its expression and clinicopathological parameters was also analyzed.Results:eIF4E expression was higher in HCC samples and cell lines compared with that in non-tumor tissues (P Conclusions:eIF4E protein might result in the malignant progression of HCC, and its overexpression may be a powerful prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC patients.
