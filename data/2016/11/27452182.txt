Objective:Substantial evidence indicates that serum sE-cadherin is a pivotal regulator that contributes to the initiation and development of various types of diseases. However, very little is known about the relationship between levels of serum sE-cadherin and HBV-related disorders. The overall goal of the study is to get a better insight into whether or not serum sE-cadherin is involved in HBV-related diseases.Design and methods:Serum levels of sE-cadherin and IFN-Î³, from 113 patients with chronic hepatitis B, 101 patients with HBV-related cirrhosis, 75 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and 125 healthy individuals were measured with commercial available sandwich ELISA kits.Results:sE-cadherin values were significantly higher in patients compared to healthy control (pConclusions:Serum sE-cadherin levels maybe an important indicator of the pathogenesis of progression of HBV-related disorders.
