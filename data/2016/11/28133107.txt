Mismatch repair(MMR)protein deficiency in colorectal cancer is well correlated with high-level microsatellite instability (MSI-H). There are little data on mismatch repair deficiency(dMMR)colorectal cancers in Japan. In addition, we have no available data on the therapeutic efficacy of oxaliplatin(oxa)-based chemotherapy, one of the standard treatment regimens for metastatic colorectal cancer, for patients with dMMR colorectal cancer. The subjects were 254 patients with Stage IV colorectal cancer whose tumors were immunohistochemically stained for MMR proteins, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. Patients who underwent R0 resection were excluded. Clinicopathologic factors and the efficacy of oxa-based chemotherapy were compared between patients with dMMR colorectal cancer and those with mismatch repair proficient(pMMR)colorectal cancer. There were 7(2.8%)patients with dMMR. Four patients demonstrated both MLH1 and PMS2 loss, while 3 patients demonstrated both MSH2 and MSH6 loss. Though the dMMR had a higher frequency in female patients(p=0.02) and a lower frequency in those with liver metastasis(p<0.01), the other clinicopathologic factors evaluated did not significantly differ between the dMMR group and the pMMR group. One hundred and fifty patients with unresectable disease or R1/2 resection received first-line oxa-based chemotherapy. The median overall survival was 23.2 months and 16.2 months in patients with dMMR(n=4)and those with pMMR, respectively(n=146)(p=0.33). The frequency of dMMR amongStag e IV colorectal cancers was lower than those(4-11%)reported in Western countries. Therefore, the clinical significance of universal screeningfor dMMR in all colorectal cancer samples may not be valid. Concerningsurvival benefit, oxa-based chemotherapy seems to be an effective alternative in clinical practice for metastatic colorectal cancer patients with dMMR.
