Sox2 overlapping transcript (Sox2ot) serves as an unfavorable prognostic factor in lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, but the clinical significance and biological function of Sox2ot in gastric cancer is still unknown. The objective of our research is to explore the significance of Sox2ot in gastric cancer. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine Sox2ot in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, the Sox2ot status in one hundred and thirty two gastric cancer samples was detected to analyzed correlations between Sox2ot and clinicopathological features. The biological function of Sox2ot on tumor cell growth and mobility were explored through MTT, colony formation, Transwell migration assay and invasion assay in vitro. In our results, the expression of Sox2ot was overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. High levels of Sox2ot were correlated with malignant status and poor prognosis. Silencing Sox2ot expression effectively inhibited gastric cancer cell growth and motility in vitro. In conclusion, Sox2ot is a potential therapeutic target and a new biomarker for gastric cancer patients.
