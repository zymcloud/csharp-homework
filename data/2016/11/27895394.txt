Chronic hepatitis C is a major reason for development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and a leading cause for liver transplantation. The development of direct-acting antiviral agents lead to (pegylated) interferon-alfa free antiviral therapy regimens with a remarkable increase in sustained virologic response (SVR) rates and opened therapeutic options for patients with advanced cirrhosis and liver graft recipients. This concise review gives an overview about most current prospective trials and cohort analyses for treatment of patients with liver cirrhosis and liver graft recipients. In patients with compensated cirrhosis Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CTP) class A, all approved agents are safe and SVR rates do not significantly differ from patients without cirrhosis in general. In patients with decompensated cirrhosis CTP class B or C, daclastasvir, ledipasvir, velpatasvir, and sofosbuvir are approved, and SVR rates higher than 90% can be achieved. Especially for patients with a model of end stage liver disease score higher than 15 and therefore eligible for liver transplantation, data is scarce. Reported SVR rates in patients with cirrhosis CTP class C are lower compared to patients with a less severe liver disease. In liver transplant recipients with a maximum of CTP class A, SVR rates are comparable to patients without LT. Patients with decompensated graft cirrhosis should be treated on an individual basis.
