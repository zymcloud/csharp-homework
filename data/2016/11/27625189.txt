HBV testing and diagnosis of HBV-related liver disease in low-income and middle-income countries differs substantially from that in developed countries in terms of access to resources and expensive technologies requiring highly specialized staff. For identification and classification of HBV infection, genomic amplification methods to detect and quantify HBV DNA are often nonexistent or available only in central laboratories of major cities. When samples from peripheral locations do arrive, delays in receiving results generate loss to follow-up. Testing is often limited to measurement of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), alanine aminotransferase levels, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) to determine indications for antiviral therapy (AVT). Utilization of AVT is limited by cost and availability, particularly when patients are not covered by health insurance. The natural history of HBV infection is influenced by genotypes B and C in East Asia, where decades of immune tolerance have led to mostly vertical transmission; in sub-Saharan Africa, where genotypes A1 and E predominate, infection is transmitted horizontally between young children, followed by a nonreplicative phase. In both regions, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are common and would be considerably ameliorated by AVT. Implementation of the HBV vaccine since the 1990s in Asia and 2000s in Africa has decreased the incidence of HBV, but vaccine failure and insufficiently effective prevention remain concerning issues.
