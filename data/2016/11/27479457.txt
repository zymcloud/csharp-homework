The occurrence of bromocarbazoles and chlorocarbazoles was studied in 86 forest soil samples from different regions in Germany. Carbazole, 3-chlorocarbazole, 3-bromocarbazole and 3,6-dibromocarbazole were qualitatively detected in the humic layer of 59 soil samples with bromocarbazoles reported here for the first time in soil. Furthermore, the halogenated carbazoles, PCDD/Fs and PCBs were detected in the humic and mineral soil horizons (0-5 cm and 5-10 cm) of a subset of 11 soil samples subjected to quantitative analysis. Concentrations ranged from 0.6 to 267.6 ng/g (carbazole); 0.2-7.2 ng/g (3-bromocarbazole); 0.0-9.1 ng/g (3-chlorocarbazole); 0.2-19.8 ng/g (3,6-dibromocarbazole); 0.4-67.6 ng/g (3,6-dichlorocarbazole); 0.0-0.7 ng/g (PCDDs); 0.0-0.3 ng/g (PCDFs) and 0.0-33.7 ng/g (PCBs). Concentrations decreased with depth and correlated positively to total organic carbon (TOC). When it was based on TOC%, an increase in concentration with depth was observed in most soil samples. With respect to dioxin-like toxicity, 3-bromocarbazole, 3-chlorocarbazole, 3,6-dibromocarbazole and 3,6-dichlorocarbazoles caused induction of CYP1A1-dependent EROD activity in HII4E rat hepatoma cell line. Their relative effect potency after 72 h exposure ranged from 0.00005 to 0.00013 and was directly related to the degree of halogenation with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin as reference. Furthermore, their contribution to overall soil dioxin-like toxicity was not significant in comparison to PCDD/Fs and PCBs though the sum toxic equivalency was limited to three halogenated carbazole congeners. Bromocarbazoles and chlorocarbazoles are emerging dioxin-like toxic environmental contaminants with potential for wide distribution occurring simultaneously with PCDD/Fs and PCBs.
