Preoperative aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) has been identified as a biochemical marker for histological fibrogenesis and fibrosis in cirrhosis and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Whether preoperative APRI can predict postoperative short-term outcomes has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of preoperative APRI to predict short-term outcomes following liver resection for HCC. APRI was evaluated in 360 patients undergoing liver resection for HCC. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was conducted to determine the cutoff value of the APRI in predicting postoperative morbidity. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify the risk factors for postoperative outcomes. The correlation of the preoperative APRI value with clinicopathological parameters was also examined. We found that the optimal cutoff value of the APRI was set at 9.5 for postoperative complications. APRI was an independent risk factor for overall complications by univariate and multivariate analyses. HCC patients with elevated APRI (>9.5) had a worse liver function and significantly higher postoperative complication rate. In conclusion, preoperative APRI is a useful biochemical marker to predict postoperative outcomes in HCC patients.
