We report 2 resected cases of superficial type basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Case 1 is a 67-year-old man who underwent endoscopic submucosalresection for superficialel evated type esophagealcancer of the middle thoracic esophagus. Because the pathological diagnosis of the resected specimen was basaloid squamous cell carcinoma invading to the submucosal layer with lymphatic vessel invasion, esophagectomy was indicated. The resected specimens showed no tumor in the esophagus. However, metastasis was diagnosed in the dissected mediastinall ymph nodes. Left cervicall ymph node recurrence was detected 1 years 10 months after surgery, and lymphadenectomy was performed after irradiation therapy. He survived 4 years after the first operation. Case 2 is a 60-year-old man who underwent esophagectomy for superficial elevated type adenosquamous cell carcinoma with submucosal invasion. The pathological diagnosis revealed basaloid squamous cell carcinoma with submucosal invasion. The pathological diagnosis revealed basaloid squamous cell carcinoma invading the submucosal layer with lymphatic and blood vessel invasion. The patient died of recurrent disease in the lungs and liver 3 months after surgery. Although these 2 cases were superficial type esophageal basaloid squamous cell carcinoma, both had severe vessel invasion and lymph node metastasis. In basaloid squamous cell carcinoma, adjuvant therapies are needed after surgery, even if the lesion is diagnosed as superficial type. Multimodality treatment is needed for greater survival benefit.
