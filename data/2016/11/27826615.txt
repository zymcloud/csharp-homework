PDCD5 (programmed cell death 5) is an apoptosis related gene cloned in 1999 from a human leukemic cell line. PDCD5 protein containing 125 amino acid (aa) residues sharing significant homology to the corresponding proteins of species. Decreased expression of PDCD5 has been found in many human tumors, including breast, gastric cancer, astrocytic glioma, chronic myelogenous leukemia and hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent years, increased number of studies have shown the functions and mechanisms of PDCD5 protein in cancer cells, such as paraptosis, cell cycle and immunoregulation. In the present review, we provide a comprehensive review on the role of PDCD5 in cancer tissues and cells. This review summarizes the recent studies of the roles of PDCD5 in inflammation and cancer. We mainly focus on discoveries related to molecular mechanisms of PDCD5 protein. We also discuss some discrepancies between the current studies. Overall, the current available data will open new perspectives for a better understanding of PDCD5 in cancer.
