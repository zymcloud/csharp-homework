Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma in humans. We showed previously that HCV induces autophagy for viral persistence by preventing the innate immune response. Knockdown of autophagy reduces extracellular HCV release, although the precise mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we observed that knockdown of autophagy genes enhances intracellular HCV RNA and accumulates infectious virus particles in cells. Since HCV release is linked with the exosomal pathway, we examined whether autophagy proteins associate with exosomes in HCV-infected cells. We observed an association between HCV and the exosomal marker CD63 in autophagy knockdown cells. Subsequently, we observed that levels of extracellular infectious HCV were significantly lower in exosomes released from autophagy knockdown cells. To understand the mechanism for reduced extracellular infectious HCV in the exosome, we observed that an interferon (IFN)-stimulated BST-2 gene is upregulated in autophagy knockdown cells and associated with the exosome marker CD63, which may inhibit HCV assembly or release. Taken together, our results suggest a novel mechanism involving autophagy and exosome-mediated HCV release from infected hepatocytes.Importance:Autophagy plays an important role in HCV pathogenesis. Autophagy suppresses the innate immune response and promotes survival of virus-infected hepatocytes. The present study examined the role of autophagy in secretion of infectious HCV from hepatocytes. Autophagy promoted HCV trafficking from late endosomes to lysosomes, thus providing a link with the exosome. Inhibition of HCV-induced autophagy could be used as a strategy to block exosome-mediated virus transmission.
