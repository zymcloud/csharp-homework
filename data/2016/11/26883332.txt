Objectives:To prospectively compare the accuracies of PET/MR and PET/CT in the preoperative staging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods:Institutional review board approval and patients' informed consents were obtained. 45 patients with proven or radiologically suspected lung cancer which appeared to be resectable on CT were enrolled. PET/MR was performed for the preoperative staging of NSCLC followed by PET/CT without contrast enhancement on the same day. Dedicated MR images including diffusion weighted images were obtained. Readers assessed PET/MR and PET/CT with contrast-enhanced CT. Accuracies of PET/MR and PET/CT for NSCLC staging were compared.Results:Primary tumour stages (n = 40) were correctly diagnosed in 32 patients (80.0 %) on PET/MR and in 32 patients (80.0 %) on PET/CT (P = 1.0). Node stages (n = 42) were correctly determined in 24 patients (57.1 %) on PET/MR and in 22 patients (52.4 %) on PET/CT (P = 0.683). Metastatic lesions in the brain, bone, liver, and pleura were detected in 6 patients (13.3 %). PET/MR missed one patient with pleural metastasis while PET/CT missed one patient with solitary brain metastasis and two patients with pleural metastases (P = 0.480).Conclusions:This study demonstrated that PET/MR in combination with contrast-enhanced CT was comparable to PET/CT in the preoperative staging of NSCLC while reducing radiation exposure.Key points:• PET/MR can be comparable to PET/CT for preoperative NSCLC staging. • PET/MR and PET/CT show excellent correlation in measuring SUVmax of primary lesions. • Using PET/MR, estimated radiation dose can decrease by 31.1 % compared with PET/CT.
