Paclitaxel has been widely used in the treatment of breast cancer. However, the development of drug resistance often increases the failure of chemotherapy. Growing evidence has reported the significant role of microRNAs (miRs) in drug resistance. The present study identified that miR-24 was significantly downregulated in paclitaxel-resistant (PR) breast cancer patients and in MCF-7/PR human breast carcinoma cells, and that overexpression of miR-24 could increase the effect of paclitaxel on drug-resistant breast carcinoma cells. Furthermore, miR-24 could directly bind to the 3'-untranslated region of ATP binding cassette B9 to downregulate its expression, thereby reducing drug transportation and improving the anti-tumor effect of paclitaxel on breast cancer cells. In vivo experiments also demonstrated that overexpression of miR-24 could increase the sensitivity of drug-resistant MCF-7 cells to paclitaxel. In conclusion, the present results suggested a novel function for miR-24 in reducing paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer, which may be of important clinical significance.
