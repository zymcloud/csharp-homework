A man aged 53 years was admitted to our hospital due to general malaise, fever and chills for the past 24 hours. He had a history of chronic alcoholic liver disease. The blood tests showed leucocytosis with neutrophilia, lactic acidosis and acute-phase reactants. The blood cultures were positive for Parvimonas micra, an anaerobic pathogen which is part of the flora of the oral cavity. There was no evidence of abscess formation in either the examination or the imaging tests, but in the work-up that followed, a gastroscopy showed a stenotic oesophageal mass that turned out to be an invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
