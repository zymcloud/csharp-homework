Background:The reported protocol was difficult to expose the hepatic veins for laparoscopic anatomical hepatectomy of segments VII and VIII. We introduce a new, convenient, applicable approach with the hepatic vein exposed from the head side.Methods:This study included 10 patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resection for HCC in the segments VII and VIII between October, 2014 and November, 2015. Their perioperative course and operative techniques were retrospectively evaluated.Results:All patients underwent laparoscopic anatomical segmentectomy of segments VII and/or VIII of the liver with the hepatic vein exposed from the head side. None of the cases was converted to open surgery. The average procedure duration was 326.20 ± 51.13 min, and the average blood loss volume was 375.0 ± 166.42 ml. No postoperative complications were observed. The average postoperative hospital stay was 6.7 ± 0.82 days. No recurrence or metastasis was observed.Conclusions:Laparoscopic anatomical segmentectomy of liver segments VII and VIII, with the hepatic vein exposed from the head side, may be safe, convenient, and applicable to perform.
