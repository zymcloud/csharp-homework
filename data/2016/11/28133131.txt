We treated an 82-year-old man with early gastric cancer using endoscopic submucosal resection.Ultrasonography, which was performed to screen for metastasis, revealed hepatocellular carcinoma, and the tumor was curatively resected.Ultrasonography can be considered a useful examination tool to detect double cancer, even in cases of early cancer.
