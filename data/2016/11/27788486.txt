GATA4 is a zinc finger DNA-binding protein that plays an important role in mammalian liver development. However, the effects of GATA4 in hepatoblastoma (HB), a common liver cancer in pediatric patients, remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that GATA4 promotes growth and survival in the Huh6 human hepatoblastoma cell line. GATA4 expression was high in Huh6 cells, and its knockdown decreased expression of Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3), a gene that may contribute to premature or undifferentiated phenotypes in HB. GATA4 also directly bound to the promoter regions of the miRNA miR125b and inhibited its expression in Huh6 cells. DKK3 was a direct target of miR125b in Huh6 cells. Inhibition of miR125b or overexpression of DKK3 promoted proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion in Huh6 cells. This is the first report to demonstrate that GATA4 promotes oncogenesis by inhibiting miR125b-dependent suppression of DKK3 expression. This GATA4/miR125b/DKK3 axis may be a major regulator of growth, migration, invasion, and survival in hepatoma cells, and is therefore a potential therapeutic target or biomarker for progression in HB patients.
