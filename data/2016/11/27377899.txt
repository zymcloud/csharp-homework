Purpose:Hepatic resection is the only potentially curative treatment for patients with colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM). Many multidisciplinary approaches, including the associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) procedure, have been proposed to increase the resectability rate in these patients. ALPPS is the most recently described staged liver resection technique, representing an advantageous strategy to induce a rapid and marked increase in the future liver remnant (FLR) volume. The aim of this article is to describe the radiological evaluation of this procedure and its variation.Methods:This retrospective study included 9 patients with CRLM who underwent the ALPPS procedure. Abdominal imaging studies were reviewed, with an emphasis on a rational radiological approach. The number of liver metastases, the FLR volume (pre- and postportal vein ligation), anatomical variations, potential pitfalls related to disease progression, and postoperative complications were evaluated.Results:The types of hepatic resection included 4 classical ALPPS cases, 3 right ALPPS variations, and 2 left ALPPS variations. The mean FLR volume calculated in the initial evaluation was 453 mL (213-790 mL). Following the first surgery, the mean FLR volume increased to 634 mL (410-957 mL), which indicated a mean volume increase of 181.1 mL (95% CI 149.7-212.5 mL; p < 0.001) and a mean absolute volume increase of 48% (19%-88%).Conclusion:The ALPPS procedure is an emerging form of two-stage hepatectomy. In this context, radiologists should provide crucial preoperative and perioperative information that may change surgical planning and contribute to an improvement in the oncologic outcome.
