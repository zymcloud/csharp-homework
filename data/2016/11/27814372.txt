Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal cancer types, and chronic infection with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is identified as the strongest risk factor for HCC. Transmembrane Protein 173 (TMEM173) is a pattern recognition receptor which functions as a major regulator of the innate immune response to viral and bacterial infections. However, the prognostic value of TMEM173 in HCC remains elusive. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the potential prognostic significance of TMEM173 expression in HCC patients following curative resection. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect TMEM173 expression in 96 HCC patients. We found that TMEM173 protein expression was remarkably decreased in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, and that TMEM173 staining intensity was inversely correlated with tumor size, tumor invasion TNM stage and overall survival (OS) in HCC patients. Multivariate analysis supported TMEM173 as an independent prognostic factor, and identified that combining TMEM173 expression with TNM stage showed better prognostic efficiency for OS in HCC patients. In summary, TMEM173 was discovered having an independent prognostic value and may serve as a potential immunotherapeutic target for HCC.
