Aim:The treatment of large (>5 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial. The aim of this study was to report short and long term outcomes and analyze the factors associated with long term survival for patients who underwent hepatic resection for large HCC.Methods:All patients who underwent hepatic resection for large HCC at the department of Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Surgery of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University between August 2005 and December 2011 were identified and included for analysis. Demographic and operative data, pathological findings and post-operative outcomes were entered into a computer database. Prognostic factors were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis.Results:Ninety-nine patients were included for analysis. Two patients died within 30 days of surgery secondary to hepatic failure. The 1-, 3-, 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates following hepatic resection were 67%, 49%, 37% and 77%, 56%, 43%, respectively. Poor histological grade was the only independent predictor of a reduced 5-year disease-free survival. Spontaneous tumor rupture and tumor recurrence were independent predictors of a reduced 5-year overall survival.Conclusions:For selected patients with large HCC, hepatic resection can be performed safely and effectively with moderate expectation of long term survival. True cure however remains rare.
