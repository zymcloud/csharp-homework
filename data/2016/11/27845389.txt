Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is refractory to chemotherapies, necessitating novel effective agents. The lysosome inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) at high concentrations displays cytotoxicity in a variety of cancers. Here we show that BafA1 at nanomolar concentrations suppresses HCC cell growth in both 2 dimensional (2D) and 3D cultures. BafA1 induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and triggered Cyclin D1 turnover in HCC cells in a dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1B (DYRK1B) dependent manner. Notably, BafA1 induced caspase-independent cell death in HCC cells by impairing autophagy flux as demonstrated by elevated LC3 conversion and p62/SQSTM1 levels. Moreover, genetic ablation of LC3 significantly attenuated BafA1-induced cytotoxicity of HCC cells. We further demonstrate that pharmacological down-regulation or genetic depletion of p38 MAPK decreased BafA1-induced cell death via abolishment of BafA1-induced upregulation of Puma. Notably, knockdown of Puma impaired BafA1-induced HCC cell death, and overexpression of Puma enhanced BafA1-mediated HCC cell death, suggesting a role for Puma in BafA1-mediated cytotoxicity. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of JNK with SP600125 enhanced BafA1-mediated cytotoxicity both in vitro and in xenografts derived from HCC cells. Taken together, our data suggest that BafA1 may offer potential as an effective therapy for HCC.
