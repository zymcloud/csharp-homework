Background:The characterization of small lesions in cirrhotic patients is extremely difficult due to the overlap of imaging features among different entities in the step-way of the hepatocarcinogenesis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of gadoxetic-acid MRI in the differentiation of small (≤2 cm) well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas from regenerative and dysplastic nodules.Methods:Seventy-three cirrhotic patients, with 118 focal liver lesions (≤2 cm) were prospectively recruited. MRI examination was performed with a 3T magnet and the study protocol included T1 - and T2-weighted pre-contrast sequences and T1 -weighted gadoxetic-acid enhanced post-contrast sequences obtained during the arterial, venous, late dynamic and hepatobiliary phases. All lesions were pathologically confirmed. Two radiologists blinded to clinical and pathological information evaluated two imaging datasets; another radiologist analysed the signal intensity characteristics of each lesion. Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy were considered for statistical analysis.Results:Good agreement was reported between the two readers (κ 0.70). Both readers reported a significantly improved sensitivity (57.7 and 66.2 vs 74.6 and 83.1) and diagnostic accuracy (0.717 and 0.778 vs 0.843 and 0.901) with the adjunction of the hepatobiliary phase 57.7 vs 74.6 and 66.2 vs 83.1 (p ≤ 0.04).Conclusions:Gadoxetic-acid MRI is a reliable tool for the characterization of HCC and lesions at high risk to further develop.
