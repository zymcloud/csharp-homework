Purpose:To compare MR imaging features of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) in normal, fibrotic, and cirrhotic livers.Methods:A total of 64 patients with 67 pathologically proven cHCC-CCs were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were classified into three groups according to the patients' liver condition: patients with normal liver (F0, group 1), fibrosis without cirrhosis (F1-3, group 2), and cirrhosis (F4, group 3). The morphological and MR signal features on T1- and T2-weighted, dynamic contrast-enhanced, diffusion-weighted imaging, as well as the accompanying imaging findings, were evaluated and compared.Results:There were 12, 19, and 33 patients in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Tumors in the fibrotic and cirrhotic livers were smaller than those in the normal liver, and tumors with cirrhosis had the smallest size (P = 0.0326). No statistical difference was found when comparing the signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging (P = 0.496), but iso- or hypointense lesions were only found in the fibrosis (n = 2) or cirrhosis group (n = 2). Enhancement pattern was different between groups, the washout pattern was more often seen in the cirrhosis group (P = 0.049), and the accompanying mosaic architecture was also more commonly seen in the cirrhosis group (P = 0.048). The ADC values of the lesions were not different among the three groups (P = 0.899).Conclusion:MRI may provide valuable information for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of cHCC-CC in normal, fibrotic, and cirrhotic livers. The nodule size, enhancement pattern, and the presence of mosaic architecture in cHCC-CC differ between different degrees of background liver disease.
