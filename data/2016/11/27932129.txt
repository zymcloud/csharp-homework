Background:Hepatitis C is a common indication for liver transplantation (LT). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) recurrence is universal in viremic patients. This recurrence is frequently very aggressive, with graft loss in less than 5 years. Our aim is to detect which factors are related to worse fibrosis at 1 year post-LT.Patients and methods:Records of all HCV-positive transplanted patients in Hospital Universitario Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria from 1996 to 2014 were collected. The variables analyzed were donor and recipient age and gender, hypertension, diabetes, viral genotype, viral load at LT, hepatocellular carcinoma in the explant, anticoagulation or antiplatelet treatment, year of transplantation, and mean levels of tacrolimus in the first month. Severe recurrence was defined as fibrosis F3 by biopsy, liver stiffness > 9.5 kPa by transient elastography, or hepatic venous pressure gradient > 5 mm Hg at 1 year post-LT. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.Results:From a sample of 112 patients, 88 patients met inclusion criteria. Mean recipient age was 52.8 ± 8.0 years and 70.5% were men. Mean donor age was 46.4 ± 16.1 years and 59.1% were men. Severe recurrence occurred in 23.9%. Univariate analyses showed 3 variables were statistically significant: donor age (P = .03), recipient age (P = .008), and presence of hepatocellular carcinoma (P = .01). Only the 2 first variables remained significant in the multivariate model (P = .009 and P = .044 respectively). Hepatocellular carcinoma was probably related to older recipients becoming a confounding factor.Conclusions:In our study, donor and recipient age both conferred a worse prognosis in terms of fibrosis progression in patients with liver transplant due to HCV.
