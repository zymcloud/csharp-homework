Introduction:The objectives of this study are the determination of the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), by means of the IsoFlux enrichment system (Fluxion Biosciences Inc, San Francisco, California, United States) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in compliance with the Milan criteria and on the waiting list for hepatic transplantation, as well as the study of its relation with the of α-fetoprotein levels (AFP) and positron-emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) findings.Patients and methods:An oncologycal evaluation with PET-CT, CTCs, and AFP was conducted in 24 consecutive patients with HCC eligible for orthotopic liver transplantation according to the Milan criteria. The diagnosis of HCC was made according to clinical, biological, and radiological findings.Results:We detected CTCs in peripheral blood in 21 of 24 patients (87.5%) before liver transplantation, with a mean number CTCs of 156 ± 370 (range, 2 to 1768) with statistically significant association between number of CTCs detected in peripheral blood and the time within the waiting list (P .05).Conclusions:PET-TC, CTCs, and AFP levels could be an essential key for the correct management of the patients with HCC on the waiting list for liver transplantation.
