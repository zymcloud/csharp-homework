Objective:To evaluate the safety of CyberKnife stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and identify the treatment-related risk factors of hepatic toxicity.Materials and methods:One hundred and four HCC patients treated with CyberKnife SBRT were included in this study between August 2009 and December 2012. The average dose of prescribed radiation was 42.81±4.78 Gy (28-55 Gy) with the average fraction size of 8-16 Gy to the planning target volume. The average fractions were 3.31±0.81 (2-6 fractions). Response rates were determined, and the Child-Pugh (CP) score and class following CyberKnife SBRT were obtained to evaluate hepatic toxicity.Results:Seventeen patients experienced progression in CP class and 24 patients experienced CTCAE V. 4.0 grade 2-3 hepatic toxicity during the five-month follow-up period, while no patient experienced grade 4 liver toxicity. Multivariate analysis indicated that only V25 was an independent factor in grade 2-3 hepatic toxicity (P=0.029, <0.05). Radiation-induced hepatic toxicity (RIHT), defined as an increase of at least two points within three months following CyberKnife SBRT, occurred in 13 of the 104 patients (13/104, 12.5%), and only the normal liver tissue was found to be associated with RIHT (P=0.008, <0.05).Conclusion:CyberKnife SBRT is a feasible and safe treatment for HCC with regard to hepatic toxicity, while V25 and normal liver volume may be an independent factor of grade 2-3 hepatic toxicity and RIHT, respectively.
