With an estimated prevalence of about 170 million people worldwide, chronic hepatitis C is an important cause of chronic liver disease associated with a substantial risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The recent past has borne witness to remarkable advancements in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C with the development of novel, effective, and well tolerated medications that have resulted in paradigm shifts in treatment approaches and may potentially affect the natural history of the disease. We provide a clinical review of current concepts and future developments in the management of chronic hepatitis C to aid in the understanding and individualization of chronic hepatitis C treatment.
