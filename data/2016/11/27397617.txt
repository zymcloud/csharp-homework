Purpose:To assess safety and efficacy of doxorubicin drug-eluting embolic (DEE) transarterial chemoembolization of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by extrahepatic collateral arteries.Materials and methods:Records of 177 patients with HCC who underwent 338 consecutive DEE chemoembolization procedures from 2011 to 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. A subgroup of 16 patients (13 men, 3 women, median age 66 y) underwent 24 procedures for 17 HCCs via extrahepatic arteries and was included in the study. Median tumor size was 3.1 cm (range, 1.0-10.3 cm). Extrahepatic collaterals included right inferior phrenic (19 procedures; 12 patients), adrenal (4 procedures; 3 patients), and cystic arteries (2 procedures; 2 patients). Radiographic response was assessed by Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria. Complications were defined by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.Results:DEE chemoembolization achieved stable disease in 6 (35.3%), partial response in 6 (35.3%), and complete response in 4 (23.5%) HCCs. Disease progression was ultimately observed in 8 tumors (47.1%), with mean time to progression of 8.3 months after chemoembolization (range, 2-13 mo). Three minor and 5 major complications occurred in 8 patients; 2 minor complications were rash in vascular distribution after right inferior phrenic artery DEE chemoembolization. The 5 major complications were transient hepatotoxicity that resolved within 4-80 days; 1 was accompanied by pleural effusion requiring hospitalization. A mean 13.4 months after DEE chemoembolization, 67% of transplant candidates proceeded to liver transplant.Conclusions:DEE transarterial chemoembolization via extrahepatic collaterals was effective and facilitated bridging to transplant. It was generally well tolerated; transient hepatotoxicity was the most common major complication.
