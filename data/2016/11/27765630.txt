Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) have played very important roles in the malignancy behaviors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Linc-cdh4-2 (TCONS_00027978) is a novel LncRNA that has been identified in HCC tissues from our previous study. Overexpression of linc-cdh4-2 in HCC cell lines (SK-Hep-1 and Huh7) significantly decreases the migration and invasion abilities of these cells, while knockdown the expression of linc-cdh4-2 significantly increases the migration and invasion abilities. Interestingly, neither the over expression nor the knock down of linc-cdh4-2 could affect the viability and proliferation of HCC cells. Mechanistically, the linc-cdh4-2 could up-regulate the protein level of R-cadherin through direct binding that might improve the protein stability. Over expression of linc-cdh4-2 could significantly increase the protein levels of R-cadherin and decrease the protein levels of small GTPase RAC1, and vice-versa. Further knockdown R-cadherin in linc-cdh4-2 stably overexpressed cells, could significantly upregulate the protein levels of RAC1 and improve the cell migration and invasion abilities. Taken together, the novel linc-cdh4-2 may negatively regulate the motility of the HCC cells through targeting R-cadherin-RAC1 signaling pathway.
