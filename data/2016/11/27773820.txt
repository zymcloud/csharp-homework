Background and aim:Aberrant expression of miR-107 is involved in the development of several human cancers. However, the role of miR-107 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well documented. In the present study, we aim to explore the function of miR-107 in hepatocarcinogenesis.Methods:Bioinformatics analysis was applied to predict the target genes of miR-107. Luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to verify the miR-107 binding sites in 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of high mobility group A2 (HMGA2) mRNA. The expression levels of mRNA and protein were examined using qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Functionally, MTT and EdU assays were carried out for proliferation analysis. Clinically, thirty HCC samples and their corresponding peritumor liver tissues were collected.Results:Bioinformatics analysis revealed that miR-107 might target HMGA2 mRNA 3'UTR. Luciferase reporter gene assays verified that the miR-107 binding site was located in the 3'UTR of HMGA2 mRNA. Furthermore, miR-107 could down-regulate HMGA2 at the levels of mRNA and protein in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, miR-107 inhibited the proliferation of hepatoma cells, while anti-miR-107 could promote the cell proliferation, which was blocked by the interference of HMGA2. Clinically, miR-107 was lower in HCC samples relative to peritumor liver tissues. The expression levels of miR-107 were negatively correlated with those of HMGA2 mRNA in HCC samples.Conclusion:MiR-107 suppresses the proliferation of hepatoma cells by targeting HMGA2 mRNA. Our finding provides new insights into the mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis.
