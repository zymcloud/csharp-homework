We report here a case of CR of all target lesions in a patient with esophageal cancer with multiple metastases treated with systemic chemotherapy after nutritionalsupport. A 75-year-old man was referred to our hospital with a diagnosis of multiple- metastatic esophagealcancer in June 2014. He showed generalized weakness with poor dietary intake, and he was initially admitted for nutritional support by parenteral nutrition. Biopsy specimens revealed mixed squamous- and adenocarcinoma: MtLtUtAeG, 13 cm, type 2, cT3, IM1-St, cN3, cM1(liver, lungs, and stomach), cStage IV b esophagealcarcinoma. We had initiated 5-FU/CDDP/docetaxel(DCF)chemotherapy in July 2014. The target lesions exhibited PR after 2 courses of chemotherapy, and the primary esophageal lesion was markedly reduced, but was still present. The patient's renalfunction deteriorated after 8 courses of DCF, and the chemotherapy protocolwas changed to single-agent docetaxelonce every 3 weeks. The patient underwent 20 courses of the chemotherapy, and over a period of approximately 1 year from March 2015, CR of all target lesions was noted, with IR/SD of the primary tumor. The patient has survived and remained in good condition for 23 months following the initial diagnosis.
