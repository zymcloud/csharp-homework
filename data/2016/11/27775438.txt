Context:Selectins probably participate in the interactions between platelets and other inflammatory cells in cancer invasion and metastasis formation. We assessed a potential relationship of P-, L- and E-selectin in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in relation to tumour advancement according to TNM classification, and tumour location.Materials and methods:The study group was composed of 53 CRC patients and 25 healthy subjects. Plasma levels of soluble P-, L- and E-selectins were measured using the immunoenzymatic method with Quantikine kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).Results:The mean levels of all selectins were significantly higher in CRC patients compared to healthy controls. The highest level of sP-selectin was observed in patients with metastases to the liver (stage IV), and was significantly higher than in patients without metastases (stage I/II) and with lymph node metastases (stage III), p = .02. The highest levels of sL- and sE-selectin were observed in patients with lymph node metastasis. We also found sP-selectin to be the best predictor of CRC.Conclusion:Our finding show possible involvement of tested selectins in CRC advancement and forming metastasis. Among sL- and E- selectins, P-selectin plays an important role in the progression of CRC and could be an attractive biomarker with clinical significance.
