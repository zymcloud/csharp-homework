A 62-year-old woman was diagnosed with carcinoma of the stomach at another hospital. Distal gastrectomy with D2 dissection was performed and she was referred to our hospital. Histopathological and immunopathological examinations showed the tumor to be composed of adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma. The patient was followed until 4 months after the operation when an abdominal computed tomographic(CT)scan showed a metastatic tumor at S2 and S5/6 of the liver. No other organ metastases were found, and a hepatectomy was performed. The primary tumor of the stomach consisted of adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma; however, the resected metastatic liver tumor consisted of only neuroendocrine carcinoma. Liver and lung metastases appeared 2 months after the operation, and we started chemotherapy with VP-16 and cisplatin. After 8 courses of treatment, the lung metastases showed a CR, and the liver metastasis was SD. She is alive without lung metastases 9 months after the hepatectomy.
