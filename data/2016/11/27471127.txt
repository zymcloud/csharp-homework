Objective:The aim of this study was to validate clinical risk scores in patients underwent laparoscopic resection of colorectal liver metastases (CLM) with 5 years follow-up or more, and assess 5- and 10-year actual survival in this group.Methods:A total of 516 laparoscopic liver resections were performed in 406 patients with CLM between February 1998 and September 2015. A follow-up of 5 and 10 years could be assessed in 144 and 29 patients, respectively. The Fong score, pre- and postoperative Basingstoke Predictive Index (BPI), Nordlinger score, and Iwatsuki score were validated.Results:Five- and ten-year cancer-related actual survival was 54% and 32%, respectively. The Fong score, pre- and postoperative BPI and the Nordlinger score divided patients into risk groups with significant difference in survival between the groups. However, predicted 5-year survival rates were lower than the actual 5-year survival (mean difference in 17%,13%, 20%, and 30%, respectively).Conclusion:The Fong score, pre- and postoperative BPI and the Nordlinger score systems can be used to predict survival for laparoscopically operated patients in the era of multimodal-treatment after adjusting of survival rates. The actual five- and 10-year survival after laparoscopic resection of CLM is similar to results previously published for open liver resection. J. Surg. Oncol. 2016;114:757-763.
