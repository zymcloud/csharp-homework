Background:Diagnosis of metastatic disease is important in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to prevent futile liver transplantation. Some of these patients have metastatic lymphadenopathy; however, it is difficult to perform percutaneous fine-needle aspiration due to presence of collateral and anatomic location. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of lymph nodes offers several advantages like real-time vision, proximity to target, and avoidance of collaterals.Aim:The aim of this study was to look for metastatic lymphadenopathy by EUS-guided FNA (EUS-FNA) in prospective liver transplant recipients with HCC.Methods:A prospective study was conducted from January 2013 to January 2016 at a tertiary care center. All prospective liver transplant recipients with HCC had PET-CT and bone scan to look for metastatic disease. EUS-FNA was done in patients with abdominal or mediastinal lymphadenopathy and no evidence of extrahepatic disease. Data is shown as median (25-75 interquartile range).Results:EUS-guided FNA was done for 50 patients (42 abdominal and 8 mediastinal lymph nodes), age 57 (53-62) years, Child-Turcotte-Pugh 7 (6-9), and model for end-stage liver disease 10 (7-16). FNA material was adequate in 92% patients, metastasis in 15 (30%), granulomatous lymphadenopathy in 4 (8%), and reactive change in 27 patients (54%). The material was inadequate for diagnosis in 4 (8%) patients. Thus, EUS-guided FNA precluded transplantation in 30% of patients with lymphadenopathy, and 4 (8%) patients received anti-tubercular therapy before liver transplantation.Conclusion:In patients with HCC and lymphadenopathy, EUS-guided FNA detected metastatic disease and precluded liver transplantation in approximately one third of patients.
