Sorafenib and regorafenib are small-molecule kinase inhibitors approved for the treatment of locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, differentiated thyroid carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma (sorafenib) and of colorectal cancer (regorafenib). As of now, the mechanisms, which are responsible for their antitumor activities, are not completely understood. Given the lipophilic nature of the molecules, it can be hypothesized that the pharmacological impact is mediated by the interaction with cellular membranes as it is true for many pharmacologically active molecules. However, an interaction of sorafenib or regorafenib with lipid membranes has not yet been investigated in detail. Here, we characterized the interaction of both drugs with lipid membranes by applying a variety of biophysical approaches including nuclear magnetic resonance, electron spin resonance, and fluorescence spectroscopy. We found that sorafenib and regorafenib bind to lipid membranes by inserting into the lipid-water interface of the bilayer. This membrane embedding causes a disturbance of bilayer structure leading to an increased permeability of the membrane for polar molecules. One approach shows that the extent of the effects depends on the membrane lipid composition underlining a particular role of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. Our data for the first time characterize the impact of sorafenib and regorafenib on the lipid membrane structure and dynamics, which may contribute to a better understanding of their effectiveness in the treatment of malignancies as well as of their side effects.
