Introduction:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is common in patients with inherited bleeding disorders treated with clotting factor concentrates prior to the introduction of viral inactivation of these products. The long-term consequences of hepatitis C infection in Swedish patients are not fully understood.Aim:To examine the impact of HCV infection on liver-related morbidity and mortality in Swedish patients with inherited bleeding disorders.Methods:We retrospectively collected data on 183 patients with inherited bleeding disorders infected with HCV who attended the Coagulation Unit at Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden. Data regarding end-stage liver disease (ESLD), defined as presence of ascites, encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, hepatocellular carcinoma or liver-related death, were collected from the patient records and the national registers.Results:The median follow-up time was 35.9 years (IQR 29.0-41.2). A total of 41% had achieved sustained virological response (SVR) after treatment. In total, 14.2% developed ESLD at the median age of 52.6 years (IQR 46.5-64.7). Nineteen (35.8%) of all deaths were due to liver-related causes. Co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), older age at time of infection and severe form of bleeding disorder was associated with higher risk of developing ESLD, while SVR was a strong protective factor.Conclusions:This study demonstrated that liver-related morbidity and mortality was significant in patients with bleeding disorders and HCV infection in Sweden. Patients with HCV-infection should be candidates for treatment with the new highly effective antiviral drugs, since SVR proved to be a strong protective factor.
