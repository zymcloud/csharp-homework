Ruxolitinib is a selective and potent inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and JAK2. It is approved for the treatment of patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis, or those with polycythemia vera who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea. To investigate its carcinogenic potential, ruxolitinib was administered by oral gavage once daily to Tg.rasH2 mice for 6 months at doses of 15, 45 or 125 mg/kg/day, and to Sprague-Dawley (Crl:CD) rats for 2 years at 10, 20 or 60 mg/kg/day. Ruxolitinib had no effect on survival, and did not increase the incidence of any neoplastic findings in either species. Exposure (AUC) was similar to or exceeded that associated with therapeutic use. Lymphoid depletion and a decrease in extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen occurred in rats, which were attributed to the pharmacologic activity of ruxolitinib. In Tg.rasH2 mice, increased inflammation in the nasal cavity was observed. Dose-dependent decreases in a number of spontaneous neoplastic/preneoplastic lesions were observed in rats, including mammary tumors in females, adrenal pheochromocytomas in males, hepatocellular adenomas/carcinomas in males, and hepatic basophilic (males and females) and eosinophilic (males) foci. Peribiliary fibrosis was also decreased. Clear cell foci in the liver were increased in females. Based on the results of these studies, ruxolitinib is not considered to be carcinogenic.
