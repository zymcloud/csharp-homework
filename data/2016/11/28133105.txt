We report 2 cases of metastatic rectal cancer patients who received chemotherapy with FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab(Bev). Case 1: A 54-year-old woman diagnosed with advanced rectal cancer with synchronous liver metastasis underwent a laparoscopic low anterior resection. After the operation, she received FOLFOXIRI plus Bev treatment, and experienced Grade 4 adverse events, including dyspnea and ventricular fibrillation(Vf). After chemotherapy, no other metastasis was detected except a liver metastasis, and partial resection of the liver was performed. Histopathological evaluation revealed that the effect of the chemotherapy was Grade 1a. After liver resection, FOLFOXIRI plus Bev was administered, and a recurrence of the rectal cancer was not detected. Case 2: A 44-year-old woman was diagnosed with advanced rectal cancer with synchronous liver metastasis, distant lymph nodes metastasis, and vaginal invasion. First a colostomy was performed and FOLFOXIRI plus Bev treatment was administered. Grade 3 adverse events, including tremor, neuralgia, and anemia occurred, and chemotherapy was stopped for 3 months. Her adverse events were not under control when progression of the disease was detected, and her treatment was changed to another chemotherapy regimen.
