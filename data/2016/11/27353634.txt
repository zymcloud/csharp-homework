Background:Laparoscopic liver resection is an attractive option for treating liver tumors. Laparoscopic liver resection is more difficult for hepatocellular carcinomas located in the posterosuperior segments than for hepatocellular carcinomas in the anterolateral segments. We compared perioperative and long-term outcomes between laparoscopic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinomas located in the posterosuperior and anterolateral segments.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data for 230 patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinomas between September 2003 and July 2014. Of these, 116 patients were selected by case-matched analysis using age, sex, tumor number and size, Child-Pugh class, and extent of liver resection. Patients were classified into 2 groups according to tumor location: the anterolateral group (n = 58) and the posterosuperior group (n = 58).Results:Operation time (355 minutes vs 212 minutes, P Conclusion:Although laparoscopic liver resection is more difficult for hepatocellular carcinomas located in the posterosuperior segment, there were no differences in the short- and long-term outcomes between the posterosuperior and anterolateral groups. The perceived impact of tumor location on patient outcomes could be overcome by experience and technical improvements.
