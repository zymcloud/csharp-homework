Objective:The transradial approach (TRA) has been shown to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with arterial coronary interventions. Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) performed via the TRA can enhance patient comfort, compared with the traditional transfemoral approach (TFA), by allowing immediate ambulation and precluding potential complications associated with the TFA, such as closure device injury or retroperitoneal hematoma. We report our initial experience with and technique for using the TRA for SIRT.Materials and methods:Between May 1, 2012, and April 30, 2015, a total of 574 procedures, including planning angiograms (n = 329) and infusions of 90Y (n = 245), were performed for 318 patients (mean age, 64.5 years). Of the 245 patients who received 90Y infusions, 52 had SIRT performed with the use of a permanent single-use implant of 90Y resin microspheres and 193 had SIRT performed with the use of millions of small glass microspheres containing radioactive 90Y. Procedural details, technical success, the radial artery (RA) occlusion rate noted at 30 days (as assessed via pulse examination), and the major and minor adverse events noted at 30 days were evaluated.Results:Technical success was achieved in 561 of 574 cases (97.7%). The reasons for crossover to use of the TFA included an RA loop (n = 2), RA occlusion (n = 9), and type D response as determined by use of a Barbeau test (n = 2). Patients had undergone between zero and six previous TRA procedures. The mortality rate at 30 days was 0%. Superficial bruising occurred in 13 of 574 cases (2.3%). A grade 2 hematoma that required a second nonocclusive hemostasis cuff occurred in one case. Transient forearm numbness or pain occurred in two of 574 cases. One patient had a transient convulsive event occur after receiving intraarterial infusion of verapamil. RA occlusion occurred in nine of 574 cases (1.6%).Conclusion:Use of the TRA for SIRT is safe, feasible, and well tolerated and is associated with high rates of technical success and rare complications.
