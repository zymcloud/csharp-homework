Objective:The goal of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of combined transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in terms of the frequency of aggressive intrasegmental recurrence.Materials and methods:Sixty-one patients (43 men and 18 women; mean [± SD] age, 65.8 ± 8.6 years; age range, 44-82 years) with 71 HCCs (mean [± SD] size, 2.8 ± 0.9 cm; range, 0.7-4.2 cm) underwent combined TACE and RFA. Aggressive intrasegmental recurrence was defined as initial tumor recurrence at least 6 months after treatment and the simultaneous development of recurrence of multiple (at least three) nodular or infiltrative tumors in the treated segment. Tumor contact with a thick (diameter, ≥ 3 mm) portal vein (i.e., periportal HCC) was evaluated. The frequency of aggressive intrasegmental recurrence, the local tumor progression (LTP) rate, and the complication rate were assessed.Results:The median follow-up period was 25.6 months (range, 6.1-75.5 months). Twenty-two HCCs (31%) were in contact with a thick portal vein. Aggressive intrasegmental recurrence was observed in one patient (representing 1.4% of all treated HCCs and 4.5% of periportal HCCs) after treatment of a 4.0-cm periportal HCC. The cumulative LTP rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 6.7%, 21.0%, and 30.5%, respectively. The rate of major complications was 6.6%.Conclusion:The frequency of aggressive intrasegmental recurrence after combined TACE and RFA for HCCs was very low.
