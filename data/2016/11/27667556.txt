Cyperus amuricus (C. amuricus) is one of the most common herbs in Oriental folk medicine for exerting astringent, diuretic, wound healing and other intestinal problems. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of C. amuricus on anticancer activity. In the present study, the underlying mechanism of the anticancer effect of C. amuricus were elucidated. The methyl alcohol extract from the whole plant of C. amuricus exhibited cytotoxicity against Hep3B cells, but not against A549 and HaCaT cells. Consistent with an acceleration of the sub-G1 phase, downregulation of cdc25A, cyclin D1 and cyclin E, CDK4 and 2 as well as E2F-1, phospho-Rb, with concomitant of upregulation of p21CIP1/WAF1, p27KIPI and p16INK4a proteins, as evidenced by the appearance of cell cycle arrest, were detected in C. amuricus-treated Hep3B cells. Additionally, the sequential activation of various caspases (cleaved caspase-8, -9, -3, -7 and -6, and cleaved PARP) and the changed expression of other proteins related to the apoptosis pathway were observed after C. amuricus exposure. An increment in the pro-apoptotic proteins (Bim, tBid, Bax and Bak) and a reduction of anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2) regulate Hep3B cell death by controlling the permeability of mitochondrial membranes and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol with Apaf-1 after C. amuricus treatment. This is the first study indicating the potential of C. amuricus as a complementary agent for prevention and treatment of human liver cancer.
