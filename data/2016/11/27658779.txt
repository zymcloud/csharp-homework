The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of dicarbonyl/L-xylulose reductase (DCXR) in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays were used to evaluate DCXR protein expression levels. Image-Pro Plus was used to calculate the integral optic density (IOD) in each tissue sample, which represented the expression level of DCXR. DCXR proteins were found to be significantly lower in HCC tumor tissues (P
