Objective:To investigate immunohistochemical markers of angiogenesis and their association with pathological prognostic features in hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhotic liver.Methods:Vascular endothelial growth factor, CD105, and cyclooxygenase-2 were immunohistochemically detected in 52 hepatocellular carcinoma tissue samples and 48 cirrhotic liver tissue samples. Semiquantitative measurements of vascular endothelial growth factor and cyclooxygenase-2 were evaluated considering the degree and intensity of immunostaining based on a 7-point final scoring scale. CD105 microvascular density (MVD-CD105) was measured using automated analysis. Morphological aspects evaluated in the hepatocellular carcinoma samples included size (≤2 and >2 cm), differentiation grade, and microvascular invasion.Results:The mean vascular endothelial growth factor immunoreactivity score was slightly higher in the hepatocellular carcinoma samples (4.83±1.35) than the cirrhotic liver (4.38±1.28) samples. There was a significant and direct correlation between these mean scores (rs=0.645, p=0.0001). Cyclooxygenase-2 was expressed in all the cirrhotic liver samples but was only found in 78% of the hepatocellular carcinoma samples. The mean cyclooxygenase-2 score was higher in the cirrhotic liver samples (4.85±1.38) than the hepatocellular carcinoma samples (2.58±1.68), but there was no correlation between the scores (rs=0.177, p=0.23). The mean CD105 percentage in the hepatocellular carcinoma samples (11.2%) was lower than that in the cirrhotic samples (16.9%). There was an inverse relationship in MVD-CD105 expression between the hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhotic samples (rs=-0.78, p=0.67). There were no significant associations between vascular endothelial growth factor expression and morphological characteristics. Cyclooxygenase-2 and CD105 were associated with hepatocellular carcinoma differentiation grade (p=0.003 and p=0.05, respectively).Conclusion:Vascular endothelial growth factor, cyclooxygenase-2, and MVD-CD105 were highly expressed in cirrhotic liver compared to hepatocellular carcinoma and might be involved in liver carcinogenesis. Additionally, cyclooxygenase-2 and CD105 might be involved in hepatocellular carcinoma differentiation grade.
