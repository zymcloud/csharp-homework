Introduction:Variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) can trigger acute hypoxic hepatitis (AHH). The aim of this study was to analyse the incidence, associated risk factors and mortality of AHH after variceal UGIB.Patients and methods:Retrospective study of cirrhotic patients with variceal UGIB, classified into 2 groups according to the development of AHH. AHH was diagnosed when AST and ALT reached levels 10 times above the upper limit of normal, after ruling out other causes of hepatitis. The standard initial treatment consisted of haemodynamic support, emergency endoscopy with rubber band ligation, somatostatin and antibiotics. In the case of failure of primary haemostasis, a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) was implanted. Both groups (AHH and non-AHH) were compared.Results:Sixty-eight cirrhotic patients with variceal UGIB admitted to the gastroenterology department of Hospital Ramón y Cajal between January 2007 and March 2012 were analysed. Eleven of these patients (16.2%) developed AHH. Univariate analysis showed the following items as risk factors: diabetes (OR: 7.5; CI: 1.9-29), shock (OR: 8.5; CI: 2.06-34) and persistent bleeding (OR: 9.0, CI: 1.6-49, P=.03). However, multivariate analysis confirmed only diabetes (OR: 8.61; CI: 1.4-52.5) and shock (OR: 7.58; CI: 1.26-45.51) as risk factors. Mortality rate in the AHH group was 45%, compared to 10.5% in the non-HAA group (P=.012).Conclusions:AHH after variceal UGIB occurred in 16.2% of cirrhotic patients and was associated with a poorer prognosis, with a mortality rate of 45%. Our findings suggest that diabetes and shock are risk factors for the development of AHH. Early identification of at-risk patients could therefore help prevent AHH.
