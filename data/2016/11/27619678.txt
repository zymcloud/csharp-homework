Dysregulation of TRIM44 has been reported to be involved in tumorigenesis, but its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the clinicopathological and biological significance of TRIM44 in HCC. We found that TRIM44 mRNA and protein expression was upregulated in HCC compared with matched normal tissues. Intriguingly, we also found that TRIM44 expression was significantly correlated with tumor size (P
