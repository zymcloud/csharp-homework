Background:The severity of liver fibrosis has been reported to be correlated with the risk of intractable ascites after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma. Since 2009, we have measured routinely the serum concentrations of type IV collagen 7s domain (7s collagen), a biochemical marker of liver fibrosis and applied limited resection to patients with elevation of the serum 7s collagen concentrations above the upper limit of normal (6.0 ng/mL). The aim of this study was to assess the potential benefits of our treatment strategy on the postoperative outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:A propensity score-matched analysis was performed to compare the outcomes between patients who underwent initial hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma before or after 2009 (2009 to April 2015; period 2) and those who underwent the operation prior to 2009 (1990-2008; period 1; n = 129 in each period).Results:The incidence of intractable ascites was significantly lower in period 2 than in period 1 (2.3 vs 14.7%; P Conclusion:Modification of the surgical procedure according to the serum 7s collagen concentration is beneficial for reducing the risk of development of intractable ascites after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma.
