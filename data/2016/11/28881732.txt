Secretory clusterin (sCLU) is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression by contributing to angiogenesis, chemoresistance, cell survival, and metastasis. However, the sCLU expression at early stage of HCC progression remains to be clarified. In this study, the alteration of sCLU oncogenicity was firstly evaluated in HCC- and their para-cancerous- tissues. The incidence of sCLU expression in HCC was significantly higher than that in their non-tumorous tissues at message RNA (mRNA) or protein level, gradually increasing with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging. Abnormal sCLU expression was associated with the poor differentiation, TNM stage, and considered as an independent prognostic factor for HCC patients. Furthermore, silencing sCLU gene transcription inhibited the colony formation and proliferation of HCC cells, with decreasing phosphorylation level of AKT and GSK-3Î² in HCCLM3 cells in vitro and significantly suppressed the HCC xenograft growth in vivo, suggesting that sCLU with oncogenicity should be not only an early indicator but also novel potential molecular-targeted therapy for HCC.
