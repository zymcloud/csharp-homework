Introduction:Sorafenib is an oral multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor and is currently the only evidence-based treatment recommended for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. We report a case of osteonecrosis of the jaw that occurred during sorafenib therapy in a patient with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma not treated with bisphosphonates or other antiangiogenic drugs.Methods:A systematic search in PubMed yielded some cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients treated with antiangiogenic agents, alone or in combination with bisphosphonates, for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The only case of osteonecrosis observed during sorafenib therapy not combined with other predisposing agents was described by Guillet et al.Results:A 74-year-old man diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma ensuing in hepatitis C virus infection, who was treated with sorafenib at a daily dose of 400 mg, developed osteonecrosis of the right mandibular body. The lesion was documented by a dental CT scan and surgical evaluation did not lead to an indication for curettage treatment. Sorafenib was discontinued because of the radiological and laboratory features of hepatocellular carcinoma progression and the high risk of jaw fracture.Conclusions:To our knowledge, this is the first description of osteonecrosis of the jaw detected in a cirrhotic patient on sorafenib therapy not combined with bisphosphonates.
