Background:Current biochemical indicators cannot discriminate between parenchymal, biliary, vascular, and neoplastic hepatobiliary diseases. MicroRNAs are promising new biomarkers for hepatobiliary disease in humans and dogs.Objective:To measure serum concentrations of an established group of microRNAs in dogs and to investigate their concentrations in various types of hepatobiliary diseases.Animals:Forty-six client-owned dogs with an established diagnosis of hepatobiliary disease and stored serum samples and eleven client-owned healthy control Labrador Retrievers.Methods:Retrospective study. Medical records of dogs with parenchymal, biliary, vascular, or neoplastic hepatobiliary diseases and control dogs were reviewed. Concentrations of miR-21, miR-122, miR-126, miR-148a, miR-200c, and miR-222 were quantified in serum by real-time polymerase chain reaction.Results:No different microRNA concentrations were found in the adenoma and congenital portosystemic shunt groups. In all other diseases, miR-122 concentrations were elevated with the highest concentration in the mucocele group (267-fold, CI: 40-1,768, P Conclusions and clinical importance:A microRNA panel consisting of miR-21, miR-122, miR-126, miR-200c, and miR-222 can distinguish between parenchymal, biliary, and neoplastic hepatobiliary diseases. Serum microRNA profiling is a promising new tool that might be a valuable addition to conventional diagnostics to help diagnose various hepatobiliary diseases in dogs.
