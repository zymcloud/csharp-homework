Great strides have been made in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related fibrosis and cirrhosis. Available evidence indicates that HBV viral suppression causes regression of advanced fibrosis and even cirrhosis, and therefore should be attempted in all patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. The preferred agents in patients with cirrhosis are entecavir and tenofovir, primarily because the risk of breakthrough is low. HBV viral suppression leads to improved clinical outcomes even in patients with cirrhosis and complications. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is reduced, but not eliminated. Thus, patients with HBV cirrhosis should continue to have routine screening for hepatocellular carcinoma, even after viral suppression.
