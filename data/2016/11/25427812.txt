In the present work we undertook the complete mitochondrial genome sequencing of an important hepatocellular carcinoma model inbred Sprague-Dawley strain for the first time. The total length of the mitogenome was 16,308 bp. It harbored 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes and one non-coding control region (D-loop region). The mutation events were also reported.
