Purpose:To investigate how elevation of the arms affects diaphragm height.Materials and methods:We retrospectively reviewed angiography and computed tomography (CT) portography data from 44 patients who were treated for hepatocellular carcinoma at our institution from July 2013 to May 2014. Diaphragm height was determined independently by two radiologists as the distance from the upper edge of the first lumbar vertebra to the highest point of the right diaphragm. The differences in height between angiography and CT images were compared using a paired t-test. We also evaluated the influence of table height and distance between X-ray tube and flat panel detector [source-image distance (SID)] on a phantom model.Results:Diaphragm height was higher on CT images [mean ± standard deviation (SD), 113.2 ± 27.2 mm] than on angiography images (105.5 ± 27.8 mm; P Conclusion:The diaphragm elevation was observed on CT with arm elevation compared with angiography without arm elevation.
