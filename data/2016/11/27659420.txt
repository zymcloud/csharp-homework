Glycosylation is involved in various pathophysiological conditions. N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V), catalyzing Î²1-6 branching in asparagine-linked oligosaccharides, is one of the most important glycosyltransferases involved in cancer and the immune system. Recent findings indicate that aberrant N-glycan structure can modify lipid metabolism. In this study, we investigated the effects of aberrant glycosylation by GnT-V on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) assembly. We used GnT-V transgenic (Tg) mice and GnT-V Hep3B cell (human hepatoma cell line) transfectants. The study also included 96 patients who underwent medical health check-ups. Total serum cholesterol levels, particularly HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, were significantly increased in Tg vs. wild-type (WT) mice. Hepatic expression of apolipoprotein AI (ApoAI) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), two important factors in HDL assembly, were higher in Tg mice compared with WT mice. ApoAI and ABCA1 were also significantly elevated in GnT-V transfectants compared with mock-transfected cells. Moreover, ApoAI protein in the cultured media of GnT-V transfectants was significantly increased. Finally, we found a strong correlation between serum GnT-V activity and HDL-C concentration in human subjects. Multivariate logistic analyses demonstrated that GnT-V activity was an independent and significant determinant for serum HDL-C levels even adjusted with age and gender differences. Further analyses represented that serum GnT-V activity had strong correlation especially with the large-size HDL particle concentration. These findings indicate that enhanced hepatic GnT-V activity accelerated HDL assembly and could be a novel mechanism for HDL synthesis.
