Introduction:The prevalence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in patients that have undergone liver transplantation (LT) is 9.7% (SD 4.5). The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence, assess the factors that are associated with PVT and clarify their association with prognosis in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) and LT.Aims and methods:From 2005 to 2014, laboratory, radiological and surgical data were collected from patients with LC in our center who had undergone LT for the first time.Results:One hundred and ninety-one patients were included. The mean age was 55 (SD 9), 75.4% of patients were male and 48.7% had HCV. The Child-Pugh scores were A/B/C 41.9%/35.9%/25.5% and the MELD score was 15 (SD 6). Previous decompensations were: ascites (61.4%), hepatic encephalopathy (34.4%), variceal bleeding (25.4%), hepatocellular carcinoma (48.9%) and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SPB) (14.3%). The mean post-transplant follow-up was 42 months (0-113). PVT was diagnosed at LT in 18 patients (9.4%). Six patients were previously diagnosed using imaging tests (33.3%): 2 patients (11.1%) by DU and 4 patients (22.2%) by CT scan. All patients with PVT had DU in a mean time of 6 months before LT (0-44) and 90 patients (47.1%) had a CT scan in a median time of 6 months before LT (0-45). PVT was significantly related to the presence of SBP (33.3% vs 12.6%; p = 0.02) and lower levels of albumin (3.1g/dl vs 3.4g/dl; p = 0.05). MELD was higher in patients with PVT (16.6 vs 14.9; p = 0.3). There were no significant differences with regard to the need for transfusion of blood components. Moreover, the surgery time was similar in both groups. PVT correlated with a higher mortality in the first 30 days (8.8% vs 16.7%; p = 0.2).Conclusion:Prior history of SBP and lower levels of albumin were identified as factors associated with PVT. The pre-transplant diagnosis rate is very low and the presence of PVT may have implications for short-term mortality.
