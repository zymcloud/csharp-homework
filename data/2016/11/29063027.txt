Regulatory T-cells (Tregs), known for their immune suppressive function, have been reported in higher numbers, with activated phenotypes and greater potency, in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver diseases than in normal conditions. The numbers, phenotypes, and function of intrahepatic and/or tumor-infiltrating Tregs in HBV-related liver diseases also differ from those of Tregs in the peripheral blood. By inhibiting the function of effector T-cells (Teffs), Tregs play a substantial role in the formation and maintenance of the liver's suppressive microenvironment, which might account for the progression of HBV-related hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In acute hepatitis B virus infection, Tregs can safeguard the liver from damage at the cost of prolonged antiviral processes, which results in chronic HBV infection in the liver. Furthermore, Tregs play a role in the development of cirrhosis, the transformation of cirrhosis to HCC, and the progression and metastasis of HCC. Higher levels of Tregs in the peripheral blood and/or tumor sites signify a poorer prognosis in HBV-related liver conditions, and observational data from mouse models and human patients support the theory that depleting Tregs may be therapeutic in HBV-related liver diseases by inducing antiviral and antitumor immunity.
