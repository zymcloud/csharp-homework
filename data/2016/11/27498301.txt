Background:The impact of reoperation for complications after major liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma was evaluated.Methods:In this retrospective study covering 25 years, patients with reoperation for complications after major liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma were compared with patients without reoperation in terms of demographics, tumor characteristics, operative details, postoperative results, oncologic outcomes, and survival. Reasons for reoperation were also investigated.Results:Forty-nine out of 1,092 patients underwent reoperation within a median of 0.2 days (range, 0-6.9 days) after hepatectomy. Patients with and without reoperation had similar baseline characteristics and liver function. Nonetheless, patients with reoperation had a higher indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes (12.55% vs 10.5%, P = .015), more operative blood loss (1.4 L vs 1 L, P = .012), a higher blood transfusion rate (44.9% vs 29.2%, P = .029), longer hospital stay (21 days vs 11 days, P Conclusion:Postoperative hemorrhage was associated with a high mortality, signifying the importance of meticulous hemostasis and careful perioperative management. Oncologic outcomes, however, were not affected by reoperation.
