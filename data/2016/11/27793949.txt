Aim:To compare in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) 3-year survival of cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accompanied by portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) treated with sorafenib plus percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of both intraparenchymal HCC and PVTT (combination Group) or sorafenib alone (sorafenib-alone Group).Patients and methods:Ninety-nine consecutive Child A cirrhotics were randomized to receive RFA of both HCC and main portal vein tumor thrombus (MPVTT) plus sorafenib (n=49) or sorafenib alone (n=50).Results:One-, 2- and 3-year survival rates were 60%, 35% and 26%, respectively, in the combination group and 37% and 0 % at 1- and 2-year, respectively, in the sorafenib alone group. At multivariate analysis, the combination of RFA of both HCC and MPVTT was the only factor predicting survival.Conclusion:Use of RFA of both HCC and MPVTT plus sorafenib significantly increases 3-year survival compared to sorafenib alone.
Hepatocellular carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; portal vein tumor thrombus; radiofrequency ablation; sorafenib.
