Aim:In general, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(TACE)can obtain a high therapeutic effect on hypervascular tumors, but the definition of"hypervascular"is unclear. In this study, stainedtumor images on enhancedcomputedtomography( CT)were assessedaccord ing to CT-attenuation value. We investigatedwhether it is possible to estimate the treatment effect(TE)of TACE for hepatocellular carcinomas(HCCs).Study population and methods:We studied 50 patients with unresectable HCCs who underwent TACE. A total of 141 tumors were diagnosed as HCC on enhanced CT. We measured andcalculatedthe ratios of CT-attenuation values of HCCs in the arterial phase to normal enhancedliver parenchyma in the portal phase(CT value ratio). We then evaluatedTE on each target nodule by enhancedCT, to examine the correlation between TE andthe CT value ratio.Results:The CT-attenuation values were 119(range 61-180)hounsfieldunits(HU)for HCC and8 3(49-141)HU for liver parenchyma, andthe CT value ratio was 1.47(0.7-2.6). TE was positively correlatedwith the CT value ratio(p=0.0005). The cut-off value that suggestedfavorable results for TACE was 1.7 by receiver operating characteristic(ROC)analysis.Conclusion:The CT value ratio is useful for recognition of hypervascular tumors. We obtained favorable results in cases with a CT value ratio of 1.7 or more.
