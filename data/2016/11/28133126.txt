A 59-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with liver dysfunction. Examinations revealed a huge liver tumor in the right hepatic lobe and a mass in each adrenal gland. The preoperative diagnosis was hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)with synchronous bilateral adrenal metastases. The patient underwent right hepatic lobectomy, cholecystectomy, and bilateral adrenalectomy. Histopathological examination of the specimens confirmed the diagnosis of HCC with synchronous bilateral adrenal metastases. After surgery, he received steroid replacement therapy and had a favorable clinical course without complications. Six months after surgery, the patient has experienced no recurrence and is being followed up on an outpatient basis. Although further postoperative follow-up is necessary, the findings of this case suggested a positive oncological impact of surgical resection for HCC and synchronous bilateral adrenal metastases.
