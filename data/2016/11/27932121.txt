Introduction:The expansion of criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) liver transplantation should produce satisfactory outcomes in terms of survival and recurrence.Objectives:To investigate if the up-to-7 criteria are applicable to liver transplantation for HCC.Methods:A review of all liver transplantations performed at our unit between January 2002 and December 2010 was conducted (645 patients). The 91 patients of the sample who had HCC were divided into 3 groups: in Milan criteria (MC; n = 74), in up-to-7 criteria (UTSC; n = 12), and outside of up-to-7 criteria (OUTSC; n = 5). A descriptive retrospective study was carried out to analyze the characteristics of liver tumors and recipients and to estimate recurrence and survival rates for this population of patients.Results:The characteristics of transplant recipients of the 3 groups were comparable. Statistically significant differences were observed in the number of tumors (1 ± 0.65 for MC, 3 ± 1.05 for UTSC, 6 ± 4.10 for OUTSC; P Conclusions:Survival in patients with HCC transplanted under up-to-7 criteria is acceptable. However, the expansion of criteria involves an increase in the number of patients included in the waiting list and a higher probability of relapse.
