Abernethy malformation is a rare congenital anomaly of the portal vein where the portal blood bypasses the liver. We report the first case of a patient with Abernethy malformation and tetralogy of Fallot associated with nodular regenerative hyperplasia and focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), which finally evolved to a giant hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-CC) of the liver, successfully resected. (Hepatology 2016;64:1800-1802).
