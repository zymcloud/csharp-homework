Hepatocellular carcinoma is a complex polygenic disease. Despite the huge advances in genetic epidemiology, it still remains a challenge to unveil the genetic architecture of hepatocellular carcinoma. We, therefore, decided to meta-analytically assess the association of six non-synonymous coding variants from XRCC1, XRCC3 and XPD genes with hepatocellular carcinoma risk by pooling the results of 20 English articles. This meta-analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA statement, and data collection was independently completed in duplicate. In overall analyses, the minor alleles of four variants, Arg280His (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval, P: 1.37, 1.13-1.66, 0.001), Thr241Met (1.93, 1.17-3.20, 0.011), Asp312Asn (1.22, 1.08-1.38, 0.001) and Lys751Gln (1.42, 1.02-1.97, 0.038), were associated with the significant risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. There were low probabilities of publication bias for all variants. Subgroup analyses revealed significant association of XRCC1 gene Arg399Gln with hepatocellular carcinoma in Chinese especially from south China (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval, P: 1.57, 1.16-2.14, 0.004), in larger studies (1.48, 1.11-1.98, 0.007) and in studies with population-based controls (1.33, 1.06-1.68, 0.016). Taken together, our findings demonstrated that XPD gene Asp312Asn and XRCC1 gene Arg399Gln might be candidate susceptibility loci for hepatocellular carcinoma. Considering the ubiquity of genetic heterogeneity, further validation in a broad range of ethnic populations is warranted.
