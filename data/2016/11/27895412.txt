Spontaneous rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a life-threatening complication and its prognosis is significantly poor because of the high recurrence rate after initial hepatectomy. Resection of isolated extrahepatic metastasis of HCC has been advocated to obtain a possibility of long-term survival. However, it is a challenge for clinicians to detect implantation metastasis of spontaneously ruptured HCC. Accurate re-staging plays the most important role in making a decision on isolated metastasis resection. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is useful in detecting intra-abdominal implantation metastasis from a variety of malignancies and shows superior accuracy to conventional imaging modalities in determining the location of metastasis. We present one patient with a new isolated pelvic implantation metastasis detected by 18F-FDG PET/CT and pathologically confirmed by PET/CT-guided percutaneous biopsy, who had a history of resection of spontaneously ruptured HCC two years ago. The patient's condition was stable at the 6-mo follow-up after resection of the isolated pelvic metastasis.
