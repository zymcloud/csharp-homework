Purpose:To quantify the arterial flow change during transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using digital subtraction angiography, quantitative color-coding analysis (d-QCA), and real-time subtraction fluoroscopy QCA (f-QCA).Materials and methods:This prospective study enrolled 20 consecutive patients with HCC who had undergone TACE via a subsegmental approach between February 2014 and April 2015. The TACE endpoint was a sluggish antegrade tumor-feeding arterial flow. d-QCA and f-QCA were used for determining the relative maximal density time (rTmax) of the selected arteries. The rTmax of the selected arteries was analyzed in d-QCA and f-QCA before and after TACE, and its correlation in both analyses was evaluated.Results:The pre- and post-TACE rTmax of the embolized segmental artery in d-QCA and f-QCA were 1.59 ± 0.81 and 2.97 ± 1.80 s (P < 0.001) and 1.44 ± 0.52 and 2.28 ± 1.02 s (P < 0.01), respectively. The rTmax of the proximal hepatic artery did not significantly change during TACE in d-QCA and f-QCA. The Spearman correlation coefficients of the pre- and post-TACE rTmax of the embolized segmental artery between d-QCA and f-QCA were 0.46 (P < 0.05) and 0.80 (P < 0.001). Radiation doses in one series of d-QCA and f-QCA were 140.7 ± 51.5 milligray (mGy) and 2.5 ± 0.7 mGy, respectively.Conclusions:f-QCA can quantify arterial flow changes with a higher temporal resolution and lower radiation dose. Flow quantification of the embolized segmental artery using f-QCA and d-QCA is highly correlated.
