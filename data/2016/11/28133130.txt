A 74-year-old man underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for intraductal pupillary mucinous neoplasm(IPMN)of the pancreatic head. Histopathological examination of the specimen revealed non-invasive intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma( IPMC). Two years after surgery, recurrent IPMN developed in the remnant pancreas, and a liver tumor was identified in S8 of the liver. The patient underwent total pancreatectomy of the remnant pancreas and partial resection of S8. These tumors were histopathologically diagnosed as invasive IPMC and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. Five years after the resec- tions, another liver tumor was identified in S4/3 of the liver, and partial resection of S4/3 was performed. The tumor was histopathologically identified as cholangiocellular carcinoma. Seven months after the last surgery, the patient remains in good health without any recurrences. IPMN is characterized by IPMN recurrence in the remnant pancreas and malignant neoplasms in other organs, and the present case showed both characteristics. The case suggested the importance of postoperative follow-up of IPMN patents with regard to the characteristics of IPMN.
