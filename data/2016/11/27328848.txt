Hepatitis C genotype 3 (GT-3) infection comprises up to 30 % of all HCV infections worldwide, with roughly 54.3 million cases concentrated in South and Southeast Asia. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated significantly increased rates of steatosis, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma in GT-3 disease, thus distinguishing this genotype as both the most difficult and urgent to treat. However, novel direct-acting antiviral agents currently approved have not demonstrated the uniform potency seen in GT-1 disease for GT-3. This review outlines (1) the epidemiology and natural history, (2) phase II and III clinical trials demonstrating effective treatment options, and (3) current and future therapeutic issues in the quest to eradicate hepatitis C genotype 3 disease.
