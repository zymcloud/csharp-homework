Purpose:To assess the correlation between DWI diffusion parameters obtained using Intravoxel Incoherent Motion Method (IVIM) and histological grade of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Results:According to Edmondson-Steiner grade lesions were classified with grade 1 (14), grade 2 (30), grade 3 (18), and grade 4 (0). Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), perfusion fraction (fp), tissue diffusion coefficient (Dt) median values were statistically different in HCC groups with 1, 2, 3 histological grade (pMaterials and methods:A retrospective approved study was performed including 34 patients with 62 HCCs. IVIM was performed to obtain ADC, fp, pseudo-diffusion coefficient (Dp), Dt coefficients. Kruskal Wallis, Spearman Correlation Coefficient, ROC analysis were performed.Conclusions:ADC and IVIM-derived fp showed significantly better diagnostic performance in differentiating high-grade from low-grade HCC, and significant correlation was observed between ADC, fp, Dt and histological grade.
