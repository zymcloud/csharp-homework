Association between variable agent-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and both PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) levels compared to healthy controls have been reported in earlier studies. We aimed to assess serum PAI-1 and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced HCC, HCV-induced liver cirrhosis, and viral infection-free apparently healthy control subjects. Forty nine HCC, 52 cirrhosis, and 105 controls were genotyped for PAI-1 4G/5G using an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis. In addition, for 31 HCC, 24 cirrhosis, and 28 controls, serum PAI-1 level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There was no significant difference in PAI-1 4G/5G genotype distribution between cirrhosis and controls (p = 0.33, p = 0.15, and p = 0.38 for the codominant, dominant, and recessive models, respectively) or between HCC and cirrhosis (p = 0.5, p = 0.24, and p = 0.69 for the codominant, dominant, and recessive models, respectively). Serum PAI-1 was significantly higher in cirrhosis than controls and significantly lower in HCC than cirrhosis (p
