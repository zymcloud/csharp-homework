Background:H19 is one of the long non-coding RNAs (LncRNA) that is related to the progression of many diseases including cancers. This work was carried out to study the level of the long non-coding RNA; H19, in plasma of patients with gastric cancer (GC) and to assess its significance in their clinical management.Methods:Sixty-two participants were enrolled in the present study. The first group included 32 GC patients. The second group was formed of 30 age and sex matched healthy volunteers serving as a control group. Plasma samples were used to assess H19 gene expression using real-time quantitative PCR technique.Results:H19 expression was up-regulated and closely related to TNM cancer stages in GC patients. Using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, a cutoff level of 0.5 was set for H19 expression to diagnose GC cases achieving a sensitivity of 68.75%, specificity of 56.67%, positive predictive value (PPV) 62.86% and negative predictive value (NPV) 62.96% with an area under the curve (AUC) of 72.4%. Combined use of Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) and H19 level in GC diagnosis was evaluated using ROC curve revealing improvement in performance with an area under the curve of 80.4%.Conclusions:Up-regulation of H19 is closely associated with gastric cancer displaying progressive up-regulation in advanced stages of the disease implementing its role as a potential non-invasive diagnostic biomarker in gastric cancer and as a novel tool in gastric cancer management with better performance achieved on using both CEA and H19 simultaneously.
