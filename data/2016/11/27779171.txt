Background:Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) binds to Fas ligand (FasL) and inhibits FasL-induced apoptosis. The receptor is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and it is associated with the growth and metastatic spread of tumors. DcR3 holds promises as a new target for the treatment of HCC, but little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying the oncogenic properties of DcR3. The present work, therefore, examined the role of DcR3 in regulating the growth and invasive property of liver cancer cell HepG2.Methods:HepG2 cells were stably transfected with lentivirus-based short hairpin RNA vector targeting DcR3. After the knockdown of DcR3 was confirmed, cell proliferation, clone formation, ability of migrating across transwell membrane, and wound healing were assessed in vitro. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP 9) and vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF)-C and D expressions of the DcR3 knockdown were also studied. Comparisons between multiple groups were done using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), while pairwise comparisons were performed using Student's t test. PResults:DcR3 was overexpressed in HepG2 compared to other HCC cell lines and normal hepatocyte Lo-2. Stable knockdown of DcR3 slowed down the growth of HepG2 (P Conclusions:Loss of DcR3 impaired the growth and invasive property of HCC cell line of HepG2. Targeting DcR3 may be a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of HCC.
