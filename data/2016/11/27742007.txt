The goal in patients with immune active hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is to significantly suppress viral replication and prevent progression of fibrosis to cirrhosis and liver decompensation and decrease the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. This is achievable by the highly active antivirals, entecavir and tenofovir, which are considered first-line therapy in most patients with immune active hepatitis C virus and after liver transplantation to prevent HBV recurrence. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis should be referred for liver transplantation and treated with first-line antivirals as early as possible, with the goal of achieving complete viral suppression in the shortest time possible.
