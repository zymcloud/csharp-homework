Background:Several reports have suggested that hepatic resection provides a survival benefit in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at the intermediate stage of the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification (BCLC-B). The operative indications for multiple BCLC-B have not been established, however. The aim of this study was to clarify the survival benefit of hepatic resection for multinodular BCLC-B HCC.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 85 patients with BCLC-B HCC who underwent liver resection. To evaluate clinicopathologic factors and survival, we divided the patients into 3 types based on radiologic findings regarding tumor number and maximum tumor diameter: type 1, up to 3 lesions 4 nodules.Results:Thirty-four patients were classified as type 1, 32 as type 2, and 19 as type 3. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival in type 1 were 97.1%, 87.4%, and 75.2%, respectively. Those in type 2 were 84.0%, 74.0%, and 63.0%, and those in type 3 were 64.9%, 55.7%, and 37.1%, respectively. The overall survival of type 1 patients was significantly better than that of type 3 patients. The prognosis of type 2 patients was worse than that of type 1 patients and better than that of type 3. Multivariate analysis identified radiologic tumor size and tumor number as independent prognostic factors.Conclusion:Our findings suggest that hepatic resection should be considered a radical treatment for multinodular BCLC-B HCC. Our subclassification can be applied to select the initial treatment and when making decisions regarding hepatic resection of BCLC-B HCC with multiple nodules.
