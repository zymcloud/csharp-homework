The current curative treatment modalities for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are unfortunately fraught with high rates of HCC recurrence. Hence there is a need to prevent or reduce HCC recurrence after initial curative therapy. Peretinoin is a synthetic oral retinoid showing significant reduction in the incidence of recurrent or new HCC in patients who had received curative HCC therapy. Areas covered: Peretinoin is analysed against the background of molecular pathogenesis of the different causes of HCC. Publications related to peretinoin since 1996 are reviewed, covering clinical characteristics, safety and tolerance profile as well as the current status of clinical development. Expert commentary: Early phase studies are promising but we need to await the results of the ongoing phase III study of peretinoin in hepatitis C related HCC. Long term impact of peretinoin may be diminished by the foreseeable near eradication of hepatitis C by the direct acting antivirals.
