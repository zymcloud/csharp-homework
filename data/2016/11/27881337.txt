Objective:To explore the inhibitory effect of migration-inducing gene 7 (Mig-7) gene silencing induced by retroviral-mediated small hairpin RNA (shRNA) on vasculogenic mimicry (VM), invasion and metastasis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in vitro.Methods:Two target sequences (Mig-7 shRNA-1 and Mig-7 shRNA-2) and one negative control sequence (Mig-7 shRNA-N) were synthesized. The recombinant retroviral vectors carrying Mig-7 shRNA were constructed, and HCC cell line MHCC-97H were transfected with Mig-7 shRNA-1, Mig-7 shRNA-2, Mig-7 shRNA-N, or the empty vector, or treated with 125 Âµg/mL recombinant human endostatin (ES). Mig-7 expression in the treated cells was detected using semi-quantitative PCR and Western blotting. The inhibitory effect of Mig-7 silencing on VM formation was investigated in a 3-dimensional cell culture system; the changes in cell adhesion, invasion and migration were assessed with intercellular adhesion assay, Transwell invasion assay and Transwell migration assay, respectively.Results:The expression of Mig-7 at both mRNA and protein levels decreased significantly, VM formation, invasion and metastasis were suppressed, while intercellular adhesion increased significantly in MHCC-97H cells in Mig-7 shRNA-1 and Mig-7 shRNA-2 groups (PConclusions:Mig-7 silencing by retroviral-mediated shRNA significantly inhibits VM formation, invasion and metastasis and increases the intercellular adhesion of the HCC cells, while ES does not have such inhibitory effects.
