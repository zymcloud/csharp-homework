Purpose:To evaluate the impact of intermittent portal clamping (IPC) during surgery on the early recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The subjects of this retrospective study were 266 patients who underwent curative liver resection for HCC. The patients were grouped as follows: an intermittent portal clamping (IPC) group, n = 78; a continuous portal clamping (CPC) group, n = 128; and a non-portal clamping (NPC) group, n = 60.Results:The median recurrence-free interval within 2 years of follow-up was significantly shorter in the IPC group (14.2 ± 4.6 months) than in the CPC group (18.0 ± 4.8 months, P = 0.008) or the NPC group (19.04 ± 4.1 months, P = 0.023). Moreover, 2-year recurrence-free survival was much lower in the IPC group than in the CPC group (63.6 vs. 75.8 %, P = 0.025) or the NPC group (63.6 vs. 78.0 %, P = 0.030). However, the 2-year OS rate among the three groups was comparable (72.7 vs. 79.9 %; P = 0.101) and 83.1 %, (P = 0.125). According to univariable analysis, tumor size (>5 cm), tumor number (≥2), tumor grade (low/undifferentiated), TNM stage (III), vascular infiltration, blood transfusion, and IPC were significantly associated with the early postoperative recurrence of HCC. After multivariate analysis, significance of tumor grade (low/undifferentiated) and TNM stage (III) disappeared, whereas tumor size (>5 cm), tumor number (≥2), vascular infiltration, blood transfusion, and IPC remained significant.Conclusions:IPC is an independent risk factor for the early recurrence of HCC after surgery.
