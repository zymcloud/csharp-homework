Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most frequent malignant tumor with poor prognosis, and its clinical therapeutic outcome is poor. Volasertib, a potent small molecular inhibitor of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), is currently tested for treatment of multiple cancers in the clinical trials. However, the antitumor effect of volasertib on HCC is still unknown. In this study, our data show that volasertib is able to induce cell growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and apoptosis with the spindle abnormalities in human HCC cells. Furthermore, volasertib also increases the intracellular reactive oxidative species (ROS) levels, and pretreated with ROS scavenger N-acety-L-cysteine partly reverses volasertib-induced apoptosis. Moreover, volasertib markedly inhibits the subcutaneous xenograft growth of HCC in nude mice. Overall, our study provides new therapeutic potential of volasertib on hepatocellular carcinoma.
