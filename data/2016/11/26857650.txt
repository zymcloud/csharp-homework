Aim:Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a member of the calcium-dependent collectin family involved in the innate immune system that mediates phagocytosis and activates complement by binding to carbohydrate motifs. We studied allele and haplotype frequencies of -221C/G and codon 54G/A in MBL2 gene to reveal their relationship with the developing and progression of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver diseases.Methods:This study was performed in 171 healthy controls, 133 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, 97 patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC) and 334 HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. The genotypes of these two polymorphisms in these subjects were detected using polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR) method. Stratification analyses by clinical characteristics and survival analysis of HCC patients were also performed according to their genotypes.Results:The genotype and allele frequencies at codon 54 manifested a significant difference between healthy controls and patients with progressive HBV-related liver diseases, especially liver cirrhosis. Allele A appeared to have protective effect from developing LC and HCC compared with G allele. The percentages of the patients with G allele at -221C/G increased in HBV-related disease groups. When combined together as a haplotype, lower haplotype AC frequency was associated with a decreased risk for the progression of HBV-related liver diseases and HCC developing. Furthermore, HCC patients with G allele at codon 54 showed to have better survival than those with A allele.Conclusion:These results indicated that polymorphisms in MBL2 gene may influence susceptibility, progression and prognosis of HBV-related liver diseases.
