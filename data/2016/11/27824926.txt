Objective:Recently, numerous studies have reported that hexokinase-2 (HK2) is aberrantly expressed in cancer, indicating that HK2 plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of cancer. However, its prognostic significance in solid tumor remains unclear. Accordingly, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the prognostic value of HK2 in solid tumor.Methods:Eligible studies were identified using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS)/disease-free survival (DFS)/relapse-free survival (RFS) were estimated with random effects or fixed effects models, respectively. Subgroup analysis was also performed according to patients' ethnicities, tumor types, detection methods, and analysis types.Results:Data from 21 included studies with 2532 patients were summarized. HK2 overexpression was significantly associated with worse OS (pooled HR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.51-2.38, p Conclusion:In this meta-analysis, we identified that elevated HK2 expression was significantly associated with shorter OS and PFS in patients with solid tumor, but the association varies according to cancer type.
