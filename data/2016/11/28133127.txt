We report a long-term survival case of hepatocellular carcinoma with lymph node metastasis that was successfully treated with multidisciplinary therapy. The patient was a 52-year-old man. He underwent right lobe liver resection with lymph node sampling at the hepatic portal section for hepatocellular carcinoma. Histopathological examination revealed hepatocellular carcinoma with lymph node metastasis. Residual liver recurrences were treated by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and percutaneous ethanol injection therapy, and lymph node recurrences were treated by radiation therapy and lymph node dissection combined with systemic chemotherapy. The patient has been in good health without recurrence for 10 years and 9 months after the first surgery.
