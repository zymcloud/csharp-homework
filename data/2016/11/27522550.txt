Background:The cause of Napoleon Bonaparte's death remains controversial. Originally suggested to be gastric cancer, whether this was truly neoplastic or a benign lesion has been recently debated.Aims:To interpret findings of original autopsy reports in light of the current knowledge of gastric cancer and to highlight the significance of accurate macroscopy in modern-day medicine.Methods:Using original autopsy documents, endoscopic images and data from current literature, Napoleon's gastric situation was reconstructed. In a multicenter collection of 2071 gastric cancer specimens, the relationship between tumor size and features of tumor progression was assessed.Results:Greater tumor size was associated with advanced pT, nodal metastases and Borrmann types 3-4 (p<0.001). The best cut-off for predicting pT3-4 tumors was 6.5cm (AUC 0.8; OR 1.397, 95% CI 1.35-1.446), and 6cm for lymph node metastases (AUC 0.775; OR 1.389, 95% CI 1.338-1.442). The 6cm cut-off of had a positive predictive value of 0.820 for nodal metastases and a negative predictive value of 0.880 for distant metastases.Conclusion:This analysis combines Napoleon's autopsy with present-day knowledge to support gastric cancer as his terminal illness and emphasizes the role of macroscopy, which may provide valuable information on gastric cancer progression and aid patient management.
