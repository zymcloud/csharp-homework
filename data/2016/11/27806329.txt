Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment remains lack of effective chemotherapeutic drugs, therefore, discovering novel anti-HCC drugs is a very attractive and urgent task. In this study, we reported VOSL (volatile oil from Saussurea lappa root) exhibits potent therapeutic effect on SMMC-7721 xenografts without obvious side effects. In the in vitro experiments, VOSL inhibited HCC cell proliferation by arresting cell cycle at S and G2/M phases, and induced HCC cell apoptosis by activating the Caspase3 pathway. VOSL also decreased the capability of HCC cell migration and invasion through MMP-9 depression. Moreover, mechanistic study indicated that VOSL can act as an epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor to suppress EGFR activation and then to suppress its downstream MEK/P38 and PI3-K/Akt pathways. These results suggested that VOSL may be a novel anti-HCC drug candidate.
