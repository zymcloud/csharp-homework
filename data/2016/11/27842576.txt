Background:The purpose of present work is to synthesize novel (+)-Dehydroabietylamine derivatives (DAAD) using N-acetyl-α-amino acid conjugates and determine its cytotoxic effects on hepatocellular carcinoma cells.Methods:An analytical study was conducted to explore cytotoxic activity of DAAD on hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. The cytotoxicity effect was recorded using sulforhodamine B technique. Cell cycle analysis was performed using Propidium Iodide (PI) staining. Based on cell morphology, anti growth activity and microarray findings of DAAD2 treatment, Comet assay, Annexin V/PI staining, Immunoperoxidase assay and western blots were performed accoringly.Results:Hep3B cells were found to be the most sensitive with IC50 of 2.00 ± 0.4 μM against (+)-N-(N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine)-dehydroabietylamine as DAAD2. In compliance to time dependent morphological changes of low cellular confluence, detachment and rounding of DAAD2 treated cells; noticeable changes in G2/M phase were recorded may be leading to cell cycle cessation. Up-regulation (5folds) of TUBA1A gene in Hep3B cells was determined in microarray experiments. Apoptotic mode of cell death was evaluated using standardized staining procedures including comet assay and annexin V/PI staining, Immuno-peroxidase assay. Using western blotting technique, caspase dependant apoptotic mode of cell death was recorded against Hep3B cell line.Conclusion:It is concluded that a novel DAAD2 with IC50 values less than 8 μM can induce massive cell attenuation following caspase dependent apoptotic cell death in Hep3B cells. Moreover, the corelation study indicated that DAAD2 may have vital influence on cell prolifration properties.
