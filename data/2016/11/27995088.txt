Primary liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide. Apart from liver transplantation, surgical resection has been accepted as the effective local treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common primary liver cancers. Recent technological innovations including navigation technology and intraoperative real-time fluorescence guidance have been utilized for liver resections in clinical practice. With respect to liver resection techniques, the laparoscopic approach has been increasingly gaining popularity as one of the minimally-invasive treatments of HCC. These technological innovations and technical advancements are expected to further improve the safety and efficacy of liver resections.
