Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) showing portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) have an extremely poor prognosis. According to treatment guidelines, the only option for HCC patients with PVTT is sorafenib chemotherapy. However, in Asia, various treatments have been attempted and possible prolongation of overall survival has been repeatedly reported. We herein report the first case of a patient with an initially unresectable advanced HCC with PVTT who underwent curative hepatectomy after sorafenib and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) showing complete histological response. Two months after induction with sorafenib, a significant decrease in serum alpha-fetoprotein level was observed and computed tomography imaging showed a significant decrease in tumor size. Because of remaining PVTT, TACE and curative resection were performed. The combination of sorafenib and TACE may be an effective treatment for HCC patients with PVTT.
