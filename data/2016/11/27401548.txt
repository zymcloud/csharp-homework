Background & aims:Delayed hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnosis may increase risk of advanced liver disease complications, including decompensated cirrhosis (DC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to characterise "late hepatitis notification" among people with an HBV/HCV notification and advanced liver disease in New South Wales, Australia.Methods:HBV/HCV notifications 1995-2012 were linked to cancer registry and hospital admissions. Late hepatitis notification was defined by a notification after, at the time, or within two years before DC/HCC diagnosis.Results:HBV and HCV cohorts comprised 50,958 and 79,727 individuals, respectively. Among people with DC (n=3869), late HBV notification declined from 64% (88/138) during 2001-2002 to 31% (46/149) in 2011-2012 (pConclusions:Despite significant declines in late hepatitis notification since early 2000s, efforts to enhance hepatitis screening, particularly for HBV, are required. Late hepatitis notification as described in this study could be used as a measure of population-level HBV/HCV screening.Lay summary:Delayed hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnosis may increase the risk of advanced liver disease complications, including decompensated cirrhosis (DC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to characterise "late hepatitis notification" among people with an HBV or HCV notification in New South Wales, Australia. Late hepatitis notifications have significantly declined since early 2000s; however, efforts to enhance hepatitis screening, particularly for HBV, are required.
