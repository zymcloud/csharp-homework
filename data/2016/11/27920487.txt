Myelolipoma is a rare tumor composed of fat and bone marrow components, most of which are located in the adrenal gland. Myelolipoma in the liver is extremely rare. To date, only 10 cases have been reported in the English-language medical literature. In one of these cases, the hepatic myelolipoma was found within a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we report the first case of the synchronous occurrence of hepatic myelolipoma and HCCs in different liver sections of one patient, a 26-year-old female who was admitted to our hospital because of a 4-d history of upper abdominal pain. The unenhanced computed tomography (CT) images showed a well-defined low-density mass with adipose components in the right liver lobe, 4.2 cm × 4.1 cm in size. Two inhomogeneous low-density masses were found in the left liver lobe, 8.6 cm × 7.7 cm and 2.6 cm × 2.6 cm in size. The masses in both the right and left liver lobes were heterogeneously enhanced in the contrast-enhanced CT images. Based on the results of the imaging examination, the mass in the right liver lobe was preliminarily considered to be a hamartoma, and the two masses in the left liver were preliminarily considered to be HCCs. We performed a right hepatectomy, a left hepatic lobectomy, and a cholecystectomy. Microscopic and immunohistochemical results revealed that the tumor in the right liver lobe was a hepatic myelolipoma, and that the two tumors in the left liver lobe were HCCs.
