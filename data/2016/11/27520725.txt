The present study aims to identify distinctive Raman spectrum metabolic peaks to predict hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed a label-free, non-invasive surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) test on 230 serum samples including 47 HCC, 60 normal controls (NC), 68 breast cancer (BC) and 55 lung cancer (LC) by mixing Au@AgNRs with serum directly. Based on the observed SERS spectra, discriminative metabolites including tryptophan, phenylalanine, and etc. were found in HCC, when compared with BC, LC, and NC (P
