Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant cancers with a poor prognosis. For decades, more and more biomarkers were found to effect on HCC prognosis, but these studies were scattered and there were no unified identifiers. Therefore, we built the database of prognostic biomarkers and models for hepatocellular carcinoma (dbPHCC).Methods:dbPHCC focuses on biomarkers which were related to HCC prognosis by traditional experiments rather than high-throughput technology. All of the prognostic biomarkers came from literatures issued during 2002 to 2014 in PubMed and were manually selected. dbPHCC collects comprehensive information of candidate biomarkers and HCC prognosis.Results:dbPHCC mainly contains 567 biomarkers: 323 proteins, 154 genes, and 90 microRNAs. For each biomarker, the reference information, experimental conditions, and prognostic information are shown. Based on two available patient cohort data sets, an exemplified prognostic model was constructed using 15 phosphotransferases in dbPHCC. The web interface does not only provide a full range of browsing and searching, but also provides online analysis tools. dbPHCC is available at http://lifecenter.sgst.cn/dbphcc/Conclusions:dbPHCC provides a comprehensive and convenient search and analysis platform for HCC prognosis research.General significance:dbPHCC is the first database to focus on experimentally verified individual biomarkers, which are related to HCC prognosis. Prognostic markers in dbPHCC have the potential to be therapeutic drug targets and may help in designing new treatments to improve survival of HCC patients.
