Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard therapy for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification intermediate stage B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, other transcatheter methods, such as transcatheter arterial infusion (TAI), also play an important role in the treatment of advanced HCC. Although it has been reported that TAI with a high concentration of a fine-powder formulation of cisplatin (DDP-H) reduced intrahepatic recurrence and improved survival, the combined use of TAI with DDP-H and TACE has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate which TACE chemotherapeutic agent in combination with DDP-H TAI contributes more to improved survival in BCLC-B HCC. Survival was analyzed in 55 patients who underwent DDP-H TAI and TACE for BCLC-B HCC. The patients were classified into two groups; Epirubicin was used as the TACE agent in 29 patients, whereas miriplatin was used in 26 patients. The cumulative survival rates at 1 and 2 years were 66.4 and 36.0% in the epirubicin and 95.8 and 61.30% in the miriplatin group, respectively. Survival time was significantly prolonged in the miriplatin group compared with that in the epirubicin group. Multivariate analysis identified Child-Pugh classification and up-to-seven criteria as factors affecting survival. In addition, the selection of miriplatin as the TACE chemoagent was the treatment factor that most significantly affected survival. Thus, double-platinum therapy with DDP-H TAI and miriplatin TACE may be a useful treatment strategy for improving survival in BCLC-B HCC patients.
