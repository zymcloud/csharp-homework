The efficacy of conventional transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) approaches in liver cancer treatment is limited by the lack of effective drug carriers and/or the inability to monitor drug delivery to the targeted tumor tissues. Recent years have seen rapid advances in drug carriers for TACE. Bioabsorbable and MRI- or CT-visible microspheres that are trackable in vivo have been developed as a form of nanocomposite. Herein, we review notable progress in nanocomposite microspheres drug carriers available for TACE.
