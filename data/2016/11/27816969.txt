Transmembrane 4 superfamily member 5 protein (TM4SF5) is a potential therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colon cancer. In a previous study, we demonstrated the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of a TM4SF5-specific peptide vaccine and monoclonal antibody in HCC and colon cancer in a mouse model. Here, we designed a cyclic peptide targeting TM4SF5. Cyclic peptide-specific antibodies were produced in mice after immunization with a complex of the peptide, CpG-DNA, and liposomes. Intravenous injection of the CT-26 mouse colon cancer cell line into mice induced tumors in the lung. Immunization with the peptide vaccine improved the survival rate and reduced the growth of lung tumors. We established a monoclonal antibody specific to the cyclic TM4SF5-based peptide and humanized the antibody sequence by complementarity determining region-grafting. The humanized antibody was reactive to the cyclic peptide and TM4SF5 protein. Treatment of CT-26 cells with the humanized antibody reduced cell motility in vitro. Furthermore, direct injection of the humanized anti-TM4SF5 antibody in vivo reduced growth of lung tumors in mouse metastasis model. Therefore, we conclude that the immunization with the cyclic peptide vaccine and injection of the TM4SF5-specifc humanized antibody have an anti-metastatic effect against colon cancer in mice. Importantly, the humanized antibody may serve as a starting platf.
