Background:Patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 0+A are considered to have early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade is a significant predictor of overall survival (OS) for HCC. However, data are lacking to support its significance for patients with early-HCC.Methods:We recruited 318 patients with early-HCC who underwent curative resection between January 2012 and August 2013. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests were used to compare OS of patients with different ALBI grades. Cox regression analysis was applied to evaluate ALBI grade as an independent predictor of OS.Results:Early-HCC patients with ALBI grade II experienced significantly shorter OS (pConclusion:ALBI grade predicted OS in patients with early-HCC. Reclassification of C-P grade according to ALBI grade might improve the management of HCC.
