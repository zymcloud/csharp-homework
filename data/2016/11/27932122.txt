The goal of this work has been to analyze the first 1000 liver transplantations (LTs) performed in the Virgen del Rocío Hospital of Seville and to evaluate the changes in that time. We included 916 patients who had 1000 LTs. We distinguish 2 stages in the follow-up: the first stage, between 1990 and 2002, and the second, from 2003 to 2013 (Model for End-stage Liver Disease [MELD] stage). We analyzed recipient features, LT indications, donation criteria, surgical technique, complications, and survival both for patients and grafts. The median age of recipients was 53.50 ± 46.49 years old, with a noticeable increase after 2000. There were 3 times as many men as women. The most frequent indications for LT were hepatocellular disease (48.8%), followed by hepatocarcinoma (17.8%), retransplantation (8.1%), and cholestatic diseases (3.6%). Donors of Andalusian centers accounted for 88.2% of LTs, and 8.3% of LTs presented some arterial or venous complication. Biliary complications occurred in 15.6%. Patient survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 77%, 63.5%, and 51.3%, respectively. In conclusion, some of the factors that negatively influenced survival of the patient were stage of the LT, hepatitis C virus-positive recipient, emergency cases, hepatocarcinoma, high consumption of blood products, and second transplantations.
