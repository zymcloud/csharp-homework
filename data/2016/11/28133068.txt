In the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, atypical, off guideline multidisciplinary approaches are sometimes effective. A 70-year-old man was diagnosed with multiple hepatocellular carcinomas, multiple bone metastases, and a right adrenal metastasis. Sunitinib was started and the primary hepatic lesions and bone metastases disappeared. However, his adrenal metastasis worsened. Sorafenib, radiotherapy, and some investigational agents were administered, but the adrenal metastasis did not respond. There were no other new lesions except the adrenal lesion 4 years after the initial treatment, so we decided to perform a resection. In the left half lateral decubitus position, the adrenal mass was removed with right thoracolaparotomy. After the surgery, his tumor markers quickly returned to normal. Seven years after the initial treatment(2 years and 4 months after the last surgery), he is alive without any recurrence. Multidisciplinary treatment with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery may result in long term survival even for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with multiple extra-hepatic lesions.
