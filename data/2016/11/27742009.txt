Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide, and its incidence has been increasing in the last decade largely in parallel to the incidence and duration of exposure to hepatitis B and C. The widespread implementation of hepatitis B vaccine, hepatitis B antivirals, and the introduction of direct antiviral therapies for hepatitis C virus may have a substantial impact in reducing the incidence of HCC. This report reviews the risk factors and underlying mechanisms associated with the development of HCC in hepatitis B, along with advances in the diagnosis, imaging, and management of HCC.
