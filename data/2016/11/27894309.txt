Background:Dysregulation of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expression contributes to the pathogenesis of many human diseases, including liver diseases. Several lncRNAs have been reported to play a role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, most studies have analyzed lncRNAs only in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC or in a single group of HCC patients regardless of the viral etiology.Methods:To investigate whether lncRNAs are differentially expressed in HCC of different viral etiology, we profiled 101 disease-related lncRNAs, including 25 lncRNAs previously associated with HCC, in liver specimens obtained from well-characterized patients with HBV-, hepatitis C virus (HCV)-, or hepatitis D virus (HDV)-associated HCC.Results:We identified eight novel HCC-related lncRNAs that were significantly dysregulated in HCC tissues compared to their surrounding non-tumorous tissues. Some of these lncRNAs were significantly dysregulated predominantly in one specific hepatitis virus-related HCC, including PCAT-29 in HBV-related HCC, aHIF and PAR5 in HCV-related HCC, and Y3 in HDV-related HCC. Among the lncRNAs previously reported in HCC, we found that DBH-AS1, hDREH and hPVT1 were differentially expressed in HCC of different viral etiology.Conclusions:Our study suggests that HCC of different viral etiology is regulated by different lncRNAs. The identification of lncRNAs unique to specific hepatitis virus-related HCC may provide new tools for improving the diagnosis of HCC and open new avenues for disease-specific therapeutic interventions.
