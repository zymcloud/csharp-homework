The majority of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in China were infected via blood transfusion prior to the year 1996. In this systematic retrospective cohort study, disease progression in 804 consecutive patients with transfusion-acquired HCV is investigated. In addition, the occurrence of compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is analyzed among these patients, along with the risk factors for disease progression. Patients with cirrhosis or HCC were classified as the serious development group (SD group) and the remaining patients with chronic hepatitis were classified as the hepatitis group (H group). Significant differences were found between the two groups in age at the time of infection, duration of infection and age at the time of observation. SD group patients were significantly older at the time of transfusion (33.73 vs. 23.56 years; P
