We treated a 91-year-old man with squamous cell carcinoma that originated from his jejunum, which is very rare; only 8 cases have been reported previously.Surgery was performed because of the small bowel obstruction caused by the large cancerous mass, but he died 23 days later.Early detection and early treatment are important, especially for the ultra-elderly from a standpoint of tolerating surgery.
