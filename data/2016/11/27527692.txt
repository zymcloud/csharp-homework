The high heme content in red meat is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer. Pharmacologic concentrations of ascorbate can specifically kill a wide range of cancer cells. In this study, the impact of ascorbate at pharmacologic concentrations on hemoglobin (Hb)-modulated human hepatoma HepG2 cell survival was investigated. It was found that HepG2 cells were proliferated by Hb (5-25μM), but killed by high pharmacologic concentrations of ascorbate (2-10mM). Although ascorbate at the low pharmacologic concentration (0.5mM) alone exhibited insignificant effect on cell viability, it effectively inhibited Hb (10μM)-induced cancer cell proliferation. The mechanism of this cytotoxicity was based on the production of extracellular H2O2 and involved transition iron. The influence of ascorbate on Hb-dependent redox reactions (i.e. the oxidative stability of Hb and its cytotoxic ferryl intermediate) was further investigated to illustrate the reaction mechanism of ascorbate toxicity, where H2O2 was generated in the reaction of ascorbate with Hb. Furthermore, circular dichroism demonstrated no significant change in the secondary structure of Hb after ascorbate addition and molecular docking revealed binding modes of ascorbate with Hb. These results demonstrated that ascorbate could possess anti-cancer activity through interfering in Hb-dependent redox reactions.
