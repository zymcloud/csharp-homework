Malignant transformation of hepatocellular adenoma (HA) is relatively rare and has been reported to be associated with dysregulation of the β-catenin pathway. The presence of bone marrow metaplasia in HA is an uncommon histological characteristic. The current report presents the case of a 46-year-old woman with glycogen storage disease type I (von Gierke's disease) who underwent resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) arising in a HA with associated bone marrow metaplasia producing three series of hematopoietic cells. The serum level of proteins induced by des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) gradually increased as the tumors grew; following hepatic resection, DCP levels returned to normal. Nuclear accumulation of β-catenin was shown in HCC by immunohistochemistry; however, no mutation was detected in exon 3 of β-catenin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of HA with absolute bone marrow metaplasia producing three series of hematopoietic cells. This occurrence suggests that elevated DCP may be an indicator of malignant transformation of HA.
