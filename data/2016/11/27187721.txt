Background & aims:The lack of histopathological confirmation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis for patients receiving ablation may result in misdiagnosis of benign liver nodule as HCC occasionally, contributing to false treatment efficacy. This underestimated issue is one reason why the ablation efficacy remains undetermined compared with hepatic resection. Our aim is to compare the efficacy of ablation and resection for HCC within the Milan criteria after excluding the impact of misdiagnosis.Methods:Alpha-fetoprotein > 200 ng/ml was introduced as an inclusion criterion to improve diagnosis accuracy. A total of 435 (resection, 310; ablation, 125) HCC patients within the Milan criteria and without portal hypertension were enrolled. Propensity score matching analysis identified 259 (resection, 150; ablation, 109) patients to compare treatment efficacy.Results:Before matching, the survival of resection group were superior to ablation group with 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of 77.6% vs. 53.8% (P Conclusions:Hepatic resection provides better OS and RFS than ablation for alpha-fetoprotein positive HCC patients within the Milan criteria and without portal hypertension.
