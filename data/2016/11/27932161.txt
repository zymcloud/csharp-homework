Renal transplant recipients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) have a high risk of progressing to cirrhosis, end-stage liver diseases, and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is also considered as an independent risk for graft loss and is correlated with proteinuria, transplant glomerulopathy, HCV-associated glomerulonephritis, and chronic rejection. Previous therapy involving interferon alfa and ribavirin led to treatment complications, including toxicity, anemia, sepsis, and drug-drug interactions with calcineurin inhibitors, as well as reduced tolerability and efficacy. New direct-acting antiviral drugs simplify and shorten the treatment along with increasing tolerability and efficacy. Nevertheless, limited data and no specific regimen with direct-acting antiviral drugs have been described in the literature for renal transplant recipients with chronic HCV. We describe here the case of a 52-year-old Chinese man who diagnosed with chronic renal failure in 1997 and underwent renal transplantation the same year. In 2012, he was diagnosed with renal graft failure and again underwent hemodialysis. The patient then underwent his second renal transplantation and was administered an immunosuppressive cyclosporine-based regimen in 2015. During hemodialysis, he acquired asymptomatic genotype 1b HCV infection. Serologic test results reflecting liver cirrhosis were all negative, and ultrasound showed no abnormalities in the liver. The patient later required oral sofosbuvir monotherapy for 12 weeks after the second kidney transplantation. Curing HCV in renal transplant recipients is necessary. Although our treatment did not successfully result in a sustained virologic response, it suggests that genotype 1b HCV may have a poor response to a sofosbuvir monotherapy regimen. Specific and effective regimens for renal transplant recipients with HCV infection need to be confirmed in the future.
