A 74-year-old man was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC; S4/8)and underwent anterior segment resection of the liver in 2015. He was hospitalized with a wound infection 2 months after surgery. On the 8th hospital day he complained of respiratory discomfort. A CT showed multiple lung metastases and a ground-glass appearance in both lungs. We diagnosed interstitial pneumonia with metastatic lung tumors. Steroid therapy was performed for the interstitial pneumo- nia(prednisolone 1,000mg/day√ó3 days), and sorafenib therapy was initiated for the metastatic lung cancer(starting from 200mg/day to 800mg/day). The prednisolone improved his symptoms. The lung metastatic tumors shrunk by the 36th hospital day after the CT. However, he developed difficulty in breathing again on the 58th hospital day, and again showed a ground-glass appearance in both lungs by CT. We thought it was drug-induced interstitial pneumonia and we discontinued oral sorafenib. He underwent steroid pulse therapy, but his symptoms did not improve and he died.
