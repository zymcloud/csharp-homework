Heme metabolism system is involved in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. The complicated interplay between heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and miRNA has been observed in various tissues and diseases, including human malignancy. In the present study, our data showed that stable HO-1 overexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells downregulated several oncomiRs. The most stably downregulated are miR-30d and miR-107. Iron, one of HO-1 catalytic products, was an important mediator in this regulation. Cell function analysis demonstrated that HO-1 inhibited the proliferation and metastasis of HepG2 cells, whereas miR-30d/miR-107 improved the proliferative and migratory ability of HepG2 cells. The beneficial effect of HO-1 in HCC inhibition could be reversed by upregulating miR-30d and miR-107. Akt and ERK pathways may be involved in the regulation of HO-1/miR-30d/miR-107 in HCC. These data indicate that HO-1 significantly suppresses HCC progression by regulating the miR-30d/miR-107 level, suggesting miR-30d/miR-107 regulation as a new molecular mechanism of HO-1 anticancer effect.
