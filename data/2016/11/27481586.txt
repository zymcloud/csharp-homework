Background:Cytokine-induced killer cells have been used as an adjuvant treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma with curative treatment. However, the outcomes remain controversial.Aim:We conducted this meta-analysis to assess the safety and efficacy of cytokine-induced killer cells.Methods:Randomized controlled trials on cytokine-induced killer cells for hepatocellular carcinoma after curative treatments were identified by electronic searches. A meta-analysis was carried out to examine disease-free survival, overall survival rate and adverse effect.Results:Six randomized controlled trials with 844 patients (85.9% with hepatitis B or C) were included. Our meta-analysis showed that cytokine-induced killer cells can not only improve the 1-year (RR=1.23, P0.05). At the same time, cytokine-induced killer cells treatment was proved to be a safe strategy with the comparable adverse events comparing to the control group (P=0.39).Conclusions:This review provides the best available evidence that adjuvant cytokine-induced killer cells treatment can be safely used to improve the early disease-free survival and survival of hepatitis B or C related hepatocellular carcinoma.
