The patient was a 73-year-old man, diagnosed with advanced huge hepatocellular carcinoma with a tumor thrombus extending into the inferior vena cava and extrahepatic metastases. Radiation therapy(50 Gy)was applied for the bone metastases, primary tumor, and tumor thrombus, and the patient received a cisplatin transcatheter arterial infusion(100mg/ body, 5 courses). Sorafenib was administered orally once the local lesion was under control. The tumor showed a partial response according to the RECIST criteria, but the tumor thrombus in the inferior vena cava almost disappeared. The presence of a tumor thrombus in the inferior vena cava must be regarded as an oncologic emergency. Acisplatin transcatheter arterial infusion and radiation therapy may be treatment options for unresectable cases.
