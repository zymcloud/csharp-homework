Aim:To compare the outcome of 5-fluorouracil (FU)-based hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) with sorafenib monotherapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) refractory to transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).Patients and methods:In this retrospective cohort study, 123 patients with HCC refractory to TACE, with Child-Pugh A and free of extrahepatic metastasis, were divided into two groups: 65 received HAIC and 58 received sorafenib. Since the size of main tumor and portal vein invasion were significantly different between the HAIC and sorafenib groups, we selected 48 patients from the 65 patients of the HAIC group and 48 from the 58 patients of the sorafenib group. The model used one-to-one matching between the two groups using the case-control method matching method. The clinical characteristics of patients of the case-control HAIC (n=48) and sorafenib groups (n=48) were similar. Overall survival, time to progression and time to treatment failure (TTTF) were compared between the two groups.Results:The median survival time and TTTF were significantly longer in the sorafenib group than in the HAIC group (15 and 12.2 months versus 8 and 4.4 months, respectively; p=0.021 and p=0.002, respectively). Multivariate analysis identified male gender (p=0.008), relative tumor size Conclusion:In patients with HCC refractory to TACE, overall survival was favorable in those treated with sorafenib rather than HAIC.
