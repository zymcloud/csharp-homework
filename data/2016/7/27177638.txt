Treatment with direct-acting antiviral agents has revolutionized the approach to hepatitis C. We are now able to obtain high sustained virological response (SVR) rates, even in the historically difficult-to-treat patient populations. SVR translates into improved clinical outcomes, particularly overall and liver-related mortality, and benefits are more striking in patients with cirrhosis. A 2.5- to 5-fold risk reduction in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and improvement in complications derived from portal hypertension have been reported as well. It is hypothesized that the benefits from SVR occur largely due to regression of fibrosis, which arises from the halt on the fibrogenic stimuli and activation of extracellular matrix reabsorption signals. Non-invasive markers of fibrosis are being utilized to assess regression, but it is still unclear how accurate they are in this clinical scenario. Interventions aiming to improve liver wellness and screening for cirrhosis-related complications should continue to be the norm after SVR.
