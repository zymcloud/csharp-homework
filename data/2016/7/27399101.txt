Liver fibrosis and cirrhosis is associated with the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after treatment. The Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase to platelet ratio (GPR) is reported to predict significant liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive value of preoperative GPR on the recurrence and survival of patients with HCC who underwent curative hepatectomy.A retrospective review of demographics, medical records, and prognosis of patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC was performed. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was used to analyze differences in recurrence and survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used for significance of prognostic factor.A total of 357 patients with HBV-related HCC were included in this analysis. The preoperative GPR was associated with recurrence and survival rates, independent of HCC progression or tumor marker levels, in a multivariate analysis. OS was higher in patients with a GPR
