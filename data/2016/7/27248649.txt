Purpose:To evaluate transarterial alcohol-lipiodol therapy (TAL) with low concentrations of alcohol for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:17 patients (69.3 ± 10.7a, 13 male, 4 female) with previously untreated HCC (tumor diameter: 7.7 ± 5.8 cm), who underwent 20 transarterial alcohol-lipiodol injections, were evaluated retrospectively. 14 patients had HCC with coexistent cirrhosis (Child-A n = 9, Child-B n = 4, Child-C n = 1). 9 patients presented an Okuda stage I, 7 patients an Okuda stage II and 1 patient an Okuda stage III. Infiltration of the portal vein was seen in 3 patients.Results:15 patients underwent TAL with an alcohol:lipiodol ratio of 1:2, another one with a ratio of 1:3 and yet another one with a ratio of 1:5. The median survival was 23 months, and the 1-year and 2-year survival rates were 62.7 % and 31.4 %, respectively. The median survival of patients with HCC Conclusion:TAL with low concentrations of alcohol was a safe and effective treatment in our cohort in spite of extensive tumors and impaired liver function. TAL could be a treatment option for patients who cannot receive other therapies (e. g. TACE, RFA) because of their advanced tumor disease, liver cirrhosis or other contraindications.Key points:• TAL can be performed safely in advanced tumor disease and liver cirrhosis Citation Format: • Mohné F, Meyer C, Kuhl CK et al.
