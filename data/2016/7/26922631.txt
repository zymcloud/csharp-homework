Background:Both microwave ablation (MWA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are commonly employed local ablation techniques for malignant liver tumors. However, comparative data on long-term results between these two techniques is scarce in the literature.Methods:This is a retrospective comparative study between MWA and RFA for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using surgical approach.Results:The MWA group consisted of 26 patients while the RFA group consisted of 47 case-matched patients. The two groups were comparable, except patients were older and their platelet count was lower in the MWA group. The median follow-up period was 47.5 months in MWA group and 52.9 months in RFA group (p = 0.322). There was no difference in 5-year overall survival (MWA 73.1%, RFA 46.3%, p = 0.082) and 5-year disease free survival (MWA 13.8%, RFA 14.6%, p = 0.736). When a subgroup analysis of tumors ≥ 3.5 cm was performed, there were 16 patients in the MWA group and 21 patients in the RFA group, the 5-year overall and disease-free survival were MWA 75.0%, RFA 28.6% (p = 0.022) and MWA 25.0%, RFA 4.8% (p = 0.207), respectively.Conclusion:MWA is comparable to RFA for HCC in terms of long-term outcomes. For tumors ≥ 3.5 cm, MWA is associated with a better overall 5-year survival.
