Several indices have been proposed to evaluate the systemic inflammatory response (SIR), which has been reported to be a useful prognostic factor in various types of cancer. We investigated the usefulness of the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) as prognostic factors in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with extrahepatic metastasis (stage IVB). Between April, 1997 and March, 2013, a total of 434 HCC patients who developed extrahepatic metastasis were enrolled in the present study. The GPS was defined on the basis of pretreatment C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin (Alb) levels, and the subjects were grouped according to GPS 0-2. The NLR was calculated as the neutrophil count/lymphocyte count, and the PLR was calculated as the platelet count/lymphocyte count. A comparative examination was performed using a survival analysis with approximate median values to determine the cut-off value for both ratios. The median survival time (MST) of the 434 patients overall was 7.3 months, with cumulative survival rates of 31.8, 14.5 and 7.7% at 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively. The patient backround was as follows: The male:female ratio was 363:71, with a median age of 67.0 years (range, 15.0-92.0 years). Hepatitis B virus patients:hepatitis C virus patients:non-B, non-C hepatitis patients = 75:303:56. Child-Pugh class A:B:C = 218:153:63. As regards T stage, ≤T2:T3:T4 = 60:190:181. The median white blood cell count was 4,650/l (range, 1,400-20,500/l); the platelet count was 11.1×104/µl (range, 3.1×104-45.5×104/µl); the aspartate aminotransferase level was 40.0 U/l (range, 7.0-338.0 U/l) and the alanine aminotransferase level 64.5 U/l (range, 16.0-407.0 U/l); the α-fetoprotein level was 622.1 ng/ml (range, 1.5-3,311,794.0 ng/ml); and the des-gamma-carboxyprothrombin level was 1,285.0 mAU/ml (range, 8.0->75,000 mAU/ml). The principal sites of metastasis included the lungs (53.9%), bone (38.9%), lymph nodes (21.4%) and adrenal glands (10.1%). The survival analysis revealed that hepatic functional reserve [Child-Pugh class B+C; hazard ratio (HR)=2.055; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.592-2.651, P<0.001], T stage (T3; HR=2.359; 95% CI: 1.648-3.376, P<0.001), AFP (≥200 ng/ml; HR=1.416; 95% CI: 1.125-1.783, P=0.003), NLR (≥3; HR=1.569; 95% CI: 1.253-1.963, P<0.001) and GPS (1+2; HR=1.410; 95% CI: 1.060-1.874, P=0.018) were independent risk factors. A total of 136 patients were included in the GPS 0 group, 169 patients in the GPS 1 group and 129 patients in the GPS 2 group. The low together with the high NLR groups comprised 217 patients. The MST was 480 days in the GPS 0 group, 154 days in the GPS 1 and 2 groups, 115 days in the high NLR group and 321 days in the low NLR group; a significant difference in survival was observed for the GPS and NLR groups. Therefore, we consider GPS and NLR to be useful prognostic factors in patients with stage IVB HCC.
