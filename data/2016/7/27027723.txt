Background:Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) affects children without underlying liver disease. A consistent mutation in FL-HCCs leads to fusion of the genes encoding a heat shock protein (DNAJB1) and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PRKACA). We sought to characterize the resultant chimeric protein and its effects in FL-HCC.Methods:The expression pattern and subcellular localization of protein kinase A (PKA) subunits in FL-HCCs were compared to paired normal livers by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence. PKA activity was measured by radioactive kinase assay, and we determined whether the FL-HCC mutation is present in other primary liver tumors.Results:The fusion transcript and chimeric protein were detected exclusively in FL-HCCs. DNAJB1-PRKACA was expressed 10-fold higher than the wild-type PRKACA transcript, resulting in overexpression of the mutant protein in tumors. Consequently, FL-HCCs possess elevated cAMP-stimulated PKA activity compared to normal livers, despite similar Kms between the mutant and wild-type kinases.Conclusion:FL-HCCs in children and young adults uniquely overexpress DNAJB1-PRKACA, which results in elevated cAMP-dependent PKA activity. These data suggest that aberrant PKA signaling contributes to liver tumorigenesis.
