Assessing the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by the number and size of tumors is sometimes difficult. The main purpose of the study was to evaluate the prognostic value of total tumor volume (TTV), which combines the two factors, in patients with HCC who underwent liver resection. We retrospectively reviewed 521 HCC patients from January 2001 to December 2008 in our center. Patients were categorized using the tertiles of TTV. The prognostic value of TTV was assessed. With a median follow-up of 116 months, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of the patients were 93.1 , 69.9, and 46.3 %, respectively. OS was significantly differed by TTV tertile groups, and higher TTV was associated with shorter OS (P
