The cardiac chamber's involvement with neoplastic embolism has been rarely reported; it is mostly associated with gastric, breast, lung, liver, and prostate cancers, and usually affects the pulmonary arteries. This paper reports a case of a 31-year-old man with a malignant testicular germ cell tumor who presented with multiple episodes of pulmonary thromboembolism and died of sudden respiratory failure 1 year after the initial diagnosis. Death was attributed to massive pulmonary embolism and pulmonary infarction associated with a neoplastic thrombus that extended from the gonadal veins to pulmonary arteries. A postmortem computerized tomographic angiography and autopsy confirmed this finding.
