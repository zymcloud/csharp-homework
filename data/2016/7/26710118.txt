Liver fibrosis is a common outcome of chronic liver disease that leads to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. No US Food and Drug Administration-approved targeted antifibrotic therapy exists. Activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) are the major cell types responsible for liver fibrosis; therefore, eradication of aHSCs, while preserving quiescent HSCs and other normal cells, is a logical strategy to stop and/or reverse liver fibrogenesis/fibrosis. However, there are no effective approaches to specifically deplete aHSCs during fibrosis without systemic toxicity. aHSCs are associated with elevated expression of death receptors and become sensitive to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced cell death. Treatment with recombinant TRAIL could be a potential strategy to ameliorate liver fibrosis; however, the therapeutic application of recombinant TRAIL is halted due to its very short half-life. To overcome this problem, we previously generated PEGylated TRAIL (TRAILPEG ) that has a much longer half-life in rodents than native-type TRAIL. In this study, we demonstrate that intravenous TRAILPEG has a markedly extended half-life over native-type TRAIL in nonhuman primates and has no toxicity in primary human hepatocytes. Intravenous injection of TRAILPEG directly induces apoptosis of aHSCs in vivo and ameliorates carbon tetrachloride-induced fibrosis/cirrhosis in rats by simultaneously down-regulating multiple key fibrotic markers that are associated with aHSCs.Conclusion:TRAIL-based therapies could serve as new therapeutics for liver fibrosis/cirrhosis and possibly other fibrotic diseases.
