Background & aims:Various grades of adverse events are associated with sorafenib and have recently been considered as a surrogate of response in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this prospective study was to measure the efficacy of a sorafenib dose reduction regimen, adjusted on patient's tolerability, and aimed at increasing the exposure to the drug.Methods:A total of 73/140 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma receiving sorafenib developed relevant adverse events (grade â‰¥2) and were managed with a tolerable-adverse-event-protocol consisting of a drug stepwise dose reduction adjusted on patient's tolerability. The remaining 67 patients with toxicity grade 0-1 (minor adverse event group) were managed conventionally with just symptomatic treatment.Results:Median follow-up was 7 months. By adopting the tolerable-adverse-event-protocol, 48% of patients meant to transiently or definitively interrupt the drug were kept on treatment. Macrovascular invasion with/out extra-hepatic spread (HR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.8; P = 0.001) and sorafenib exposure Conclusions:In patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, sorafenib dose adjustments based on inducing tolerability of relevant adverse events prolong drug exposure and maximize survival.
