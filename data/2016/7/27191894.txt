We evaluated radiotherapy using helical tomotherapy (HT) combined with sorafenib for treatment of pulmonary metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We also analyzed potential prognostic factors and further validated the combination treatment. The objective response rate in the total cohort of 45 patients treated with HT (with or without sorafenib) was 66.7% (complete response, n = 1; partial response, n = 29), with no adverse events > grade 2 in severity. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 7.50 ± 0.53 and 26.40 ± 2.66 months, respectively. The addition of sorafenib was associated with increased PFS (11.80 ± 1.55 vs 5.80 ± 0.52 months, p = 0.006) and increased OS (29.60 ± 5.23 vs 21.90 ± 5.17 months, p = 0.007). After multivariate adjustment, the risk of disease progression associated with combination treatment was significantly lower (p = 0.022) compared with HT only, and survival was significantly longer (p = 0.014). Further validation confirmed the benefit of combination treatment. Prognostic factors were number of pulmonary metastases for PFS (19.00 ± 7.15 months for ≤3 lesions vs 5.80 ± 0.26 months for >3 lesions, p
