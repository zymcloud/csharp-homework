Background and aim:Endoscopic injection of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (2-OCA) is used on an off-label basis for gastric variceal hemorrhage (GVH) in the United States. We assessed the efficacy, safety, and predictors of rebleeding after gastric variceal obturation (GVO) with 2-OCA in patients with acute GVH.Materials and methods:A retrospective analysis was performed of patients with GVH who underwent 2-OCA injection for GVO over a 15-year period. Rates of acute hemostasis, predictors of rebleeding, and cyanoacrylate-related adverse events were assessed.Results:A total of 95 patients (63 males, median age 59Â±14 y) were analyzed. Gastric varices were categorized as GOV-1 (3%), GOV-2 (61%), and isolated gastric varices type 1 (36%) per Sarin classification. Initial hemostasis was achieved in all patients. Successful GVO, defined as sustained hemostasis within a month after injection, was achieved in 87 (92%) patients. Failed GVO with in-hospital rebleeding was observed in 8 (8%) patients. On univariate analysis, only the model for end-stage liver disease score was associated with an increased risk of rebleeding (odds ratio 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.4; PConclusions:Injection of 2-OCA was effective at achieving hemostasis in a high proportion of patients (92%) admitted for acute GVH. The risk of glue-related pulmonary embolism approximated 2% in our patient cohort, including 1 fatality.
