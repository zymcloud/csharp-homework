Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein plays an important role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. octamer-binding protein 4 (OCT4) is critically essential for the pluripotency and self-renewal of embryonic stem cells. Abnormal expression of OCT4 has been detected in several human solid tumors. However, the relationship between HCV core and OCT4 remains uncertain. In the present study, we found that HCV core is capable of upregulating OCT4 expression. The effect of HCV core-induced OCT4 overexpression was abolished by RNAi-mediated scilencing of HCV core. In addition, HCV core-induced OCT4 overexpression resulted in enhanced cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Inhibition of OCT4 reduced the CCND1 expression and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, OCT4 protein directly binds to CCND1 promoter and transactivates CCND1. These findings suggest that HCV core protein regulates OCT4 expression and promotes cell cycle progression in hepatocellular carcinoma providing new insight into the mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis by HCV infection.
