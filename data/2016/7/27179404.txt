Purpose:To investigate feasibility, safety, and effect of transarterial chemoembolization using sorafenib on degree of tumor necrosis in a rabbit VX2 liver tumor model.Materials and methods:New Zealand White rabbits (n = 20) with a VX2 tumor were divided into two groups; one group was treated with hepatic arterial administration of 0.5 mL ethiodized oil alone (Lipiodol; Guerbet, Aulnay-sous-Bois, France) (transarterial embolization with Lipiodol [TAE-L] group), and one group was treated with 0.5 mL ethiodized oil plus 10 mg sorafenib (transarterial embolization with sorafenib [TAE-S] group). Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure sorafenib concentration in peripheral blood and tissue. Hepatic enzymes, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) were measured at 0, 24, and 72 hours after treatment. Histopathologic examination was performed to evaluate extent of tumor necrosis and normal parenchymal damage.Results:Serum sorafenib concentration peaked at 2 hours after treatment. The mean tissue concentration was 406.8 times greater than the serum concentration. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were significantly elevated in the TAE-S group at 24 hours after treatment. Serum VEGF and HIF-1α concentrations were not significantly different between the TAE-L and TAE-S groups. Hepatic parenchymal damage was more severe in the TAE-S group. Mean fraction of tumor necrosis after treatment was significantly greater in the TAE-S group.Conclusions:Transarterial chemoembolization using sorafenib resulted in a high intrahepatic concentration of sorafenib. The degree of tumor necrosis was significantly greater in the TAE-S group compared with the TAE-L group, but more severe toxicity of normal liver tissue also occurred.
