Objective To investigate the effect of interferon-β (IFN-β) combined with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) on the proliferation and apoptosis of HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells and the role of Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signal pathway in the process. Methods HepG2 cells were randomly divided intro three groups and treated with 1000 U/mL IFN-β, 10 μmol/L ATRA and 1000 U/mL IFN-β combined with 10 μmol/L ATRA, respectively for 24 hours. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay and apoptosis rate was detected by flow cytometry. Western blotting was applied to detect the protein levels of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, gene associated with retinoid-interferon-induced mortality-19 (GRIM-19), Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and Bax. Results IFN-β or ATRA inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of HepG2 cells. The effect was enhanced when IFN-β was combined with ATRA. The expressions of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 were down-regulated while the expressions of GRIM-19 and Bax were up-regulated after treated with IFN-β or ATRA on HepG2 cells, especially the combination of IFN-β and ATRA. Conclusion Combination of IFN-β and ATRA could suppress the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells by inhibiting JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway.
