Background:The mitochondrial GTPase mitofusin-2 (MFN2) gene encodes a mitochondrial membrane protein that can induce apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as validated in our previous research. However, little is known of the clinical significance of MFN2 expression and its signaling pathways in HCC.Methods:MFN2 mRNA expression in tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from 115 patients with HCC was investigated using quantitative real-time PCR. The association of the MFN2 mRNA expression level with clinical and pathological parameters was evaluated statistically, while a comparative microarray analysis was used to identify MFN2 signaling pathways in HepG2 cells.Results:MFN2 was significantly (p Conclusions:Low MFN2 expression in HCC indicated a worse overall survival. Crucial signaling molecules such as PI3K-AKT, cytokine receptor, and focal adhesion may participate in MFN2-mediated signaling pathway changes in HCC.
