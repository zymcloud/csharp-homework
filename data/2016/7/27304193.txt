Background and aims:Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an inflammatory-based marker. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to explore the prognostic role of NLR in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Results:Overall, 598 papers were identified, of which 90 papers including 20,475 HCC patients were finally included. Low baseline NLR was significantly associated with better overall survival (HR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.59-2.04, p Materials and methods:All relevant literatures were identified via PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases. Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was calculated. Subgroup meta-analyses were performed according to the treatment options, NLR cut-off value ranges, and regions.Conclusions:NLR should be a major prognostic factor for HCC patients. NLR might be further incorporated into the prognostic model of HCC.
