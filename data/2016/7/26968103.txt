Objectives:Wnt/β-catenin signaling has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study aimed to determine whether genetic variation in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is associated with the development and/or progression of HCC and the survival of patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCC.Design and methods:We assessed seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the AXIN1, AXIN2, CTNNB1, and WNT2 genes in 245 patients with HBV-associated HCC and 483 chronic HBV carriers without HCC. We analyzed the association of each SNP with HCC development or progression and overall survival.Results:The CTNNB1 rs3864004 A allele was associated with a decreased risk of HCC development (P=0.049). Haplotype analysis revealed a significantly higher frequency of CTNNB1 G-A/G-A haplotype at rs3864004 and rs4135385 positions in patients with HCC than in chronic HBV carriers without HCC (P=0.042). The AXIN1 rs1805105 T>C SNP was associated with small tumor size and early tumor stage and the WNT2 rs39315 G allele was associated with advanced tumor stage in HCC. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, carriers of the AXIN1 rs214252 C allele showed longer survival than those with the TT genotype (P=0.020). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, absence of CTNNB1 haplotype A-A at rs3864004 and rs4135385 positions and advanced tumor stage were independent poor predictors of patient survival in patients with HCC.Conclusion:These findings suggest that the genetic polymorphisms in CTNNB1 gene might affect tumor development and survival in patients with HBV-associated HCC.
