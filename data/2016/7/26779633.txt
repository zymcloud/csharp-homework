The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after surgical resection remains unsatisfactory for the majority of HCC patients who developed early recurrence or metastasis. There is still a lack of reliable biomarkers that can be used to predict the possibility of recurrence/metastasis in HCC patients after operation. In the current study, annexin A4, a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein, has been found to be significantly elevated in HCC patients with early recurrence/metastasis, and had a strong correlation with portal vein tumor thrombosis (p = 0.03) and advanced BCLC stage (p = 0.002). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that annexin A4 was an independent prognostic predictor for both early recurrence/metastasis (HR = 1.519, p = 0.032) and overall survival (HR = 1.827, p = 0.009) after surgical resection. Meanwhile, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that Patients with high-expression levels of annexin A4 had higher recurrence rate and shorter overall survival than those with low expression (log-rank test, p
