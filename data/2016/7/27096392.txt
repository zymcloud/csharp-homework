A 47-year-old woman was referred to our department for a hepatic mass. She denied history of hepatitis or alcohol consumption and regular oral contraceptive use, except for the emergency contraceptive pill taken once a decade ago. Hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C antibody were negative, α-fetoprotein was within normal limit. CT scan revealed an enormous mass measuring 26.0×16 5×13 0 cm that almost totally replaced the right hepatic lobe. The neoplasm was completely resected and pathologically diagnosed as hepatic adenoma. Literature review indicates this is the largest hepatic adenoma reported so far. At the same time, clinical examination also revealed a hepatic mass in the patient's 42-year-old brother, which was pathologically confirmed as hepatic adenoma, too. He denied history of anabolic steroid use. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the subtypes of both tumors as the inflammatory hepatic adenoma. Literature review indicates this is the first report of synchronous hepatic adenomas in siblings.
