Objective To investigate the effect of IL-12 on autophagy and the relative possible mechanism in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 human hepatoma cells. Methods The hepatoma cells were treated with IL-12 (10 ng/mL) for 6 hours. Western blotting was applied to detect the expressions of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC-3), Beclin 1 and the phosphorylated levels of protein kinase B (AKT), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3); immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to observe the formation of autophagosome. After STAT3 was inhibited by STATTIC or siSTAT3 and AKT was activated by insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), Western blotting and IFA were performed again to analyze the change of IL-12-induced autophagy. After the cells were treated with IL-12 (10 ng/mL) for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, CCK-8 assay was used to determine the growth ability. After the hepatoma cells were treated with IL-12 (10 ng/mL) for 48 hours, trypan blue staining was used to detect the death rate of the cells. After cell autophagy was inhibit by siBeclin 1, CCK-8 assay and trypan blue staining were performed again to study the effect of IL-12 on the proliferation and death of human hepatoma cells. Results IL-12 induced autophagy and inhibited cell growth in the hepatoma cells. Silencing Beclin 1 gene enhanced IL-12-mediated growth inhibition and cell death. Furthermore, IL-12 treatment also decreased the expressions of p-AKT, p-mTOR and p-STAT3. The pretreatment of siSTAT3 or STATTIC inhibited STAT3-enhanced IL-12-induced autophagy. Accordingly, activation of AKT with IGF-1 decreased IL-12-induced autophagy. Conclusion IL-12 could induce autophagy through AKT/mTOR/STAT3 signaling pathways and the induction of autophagy attenuates the growth-inhibitory effect of IL-12 on hepatoma cells.
