Background/aim:Sorafenib and chemoembolization of the liver (TACE) have both produced increased survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Some patients cannot tolerate TACE due to portal vein thrombosis or risk of liver failure. In this pilot trial, we aimed to combine intrahepatic infusion (IA) of cisplatin or carboplatin with sorafenib for unresectable HCC.Patients and methods:Patients with Child's A or early B received IA cisplatin or carboplatin every 6 weeks with oral sorafenib. MRI/CT scans were performed every 6 weeks.Results:Eleven patients were accrued. Of 10 evaluable patients, 6 had clinical benefit (4 partial responses for 2+, 3+, 8+ and 18 months, 2 minor responses). Two patients were down-staged enough for ablation therapy or liver transplant and remain free of disease for 32+ and 36+ months. Toxicity was generally tolerable.Conclusion:Preliminary results are encouraging and this combination may down-stage some patients with unresectable disease.
