Objective:To evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficiency of ex situ liver resection (ESLR)technique in patients with hepatocaval region involvement.Methods:A systematic research of the data bases CNKI, Wan Fang, CQVIP, PubMed, CENTRAL, Medline, Embase, Cochrane, International Clinical Transplantation Registration Platform and Transplant Library was performed. All the current data regarding the feasibility, safety, and oncological efficiency of ESLR was systematically reviewed. Feasibility, conversion to allo-transplantation rate, complication and 90-day mortality were analyzed.Results:A literature search revealed a total of 46 publications with 191 patients who underwent ex situ liver resection (101 autotransplantation, 90 ante-situm liver resection). The most common indication was hepatocellular carcinoma (49), followed by colorectal liver metastasis (37), hepatic alveolar echinococcosis (33) and cholangiocarcinoma (26). The feasibility rate was 84.5% (CI=76.6%-90.1%), the conversion to allo-transplantation rate was 13.5% (CI=8.5%-21.0%). Overall complication rate was 58.1% (CI=48.5%-67.1%), and complications grade â…¢a or higher occurred in 43.1% (CI=33.6%-53.1%).90-day mortality was 19.5% (CI=12.7%-28.8%).Conclusion:ESLR and autotransplantation technique is an effective surgical approach for hepatic tumor with hepatocaval region involvement. Strict control of surgical indications, preoperative evaluation and precise surgical technique is essential to success.
