Background:Mucormycosis is a kind of rare opportunistic fungal disease and the incidence of which has gradually increased. Disseminated mucormycosis (DM) is a life-threatening infection that mostly occurs in immunocompromised patients. The lung and brain are usually involved in disseminated mucormycosis, and other sites are scare. We report the first case of disseminated mucormycosis whose infection sites included lung, skin, liver, vertebra, and spinal cord that ensued after a right lung pneumonectomy in an immunocompetent patient.Case presentation:A 20-year-old female underwent a right lung pneumonectomy for "lung cancer" presented with an intermittent fever for two years. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed an enclosed outstanding mass in the right chest wall. The patient also suffered from lower limb numbness and weakness, difficulty walking, and dysuria. Medical examination showed superficial feeling of the abdominal wall was decreased from the T7 and T8 level; muscle strength for both lower limbs was decreased; muscle tension of both lower limbs was also diminished. A biopsy through the right chest wall mass and thoracic mass by fistula of chest wall showed broad nonseptate hyphae with right-angle branching, consistent with mucormycosis. With titration of amphotericin B and its lipid complex, the patient recovered.Conclusions:Our case showed an unusual clinical presentation of disseminated mucormycosisin an immunocompetent patient.
