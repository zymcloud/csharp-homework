YKL-40, a chitinase-like glycoprotein, is expressed at a high level in cancer patients. Its exact function is unknown and is the subject of current investigation. Here, we report the correlation of plasma YKL-40 levels with clinicopathological features of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a lethal bile duct cancer, particularly prevalent in Northeastern Thailand. Statistical analysis of plasma YKL-40 concentrations in 57 CCA patients and 41 normal healthy subjects gave a median value of 169.5 ng/mL for CCA patients compared with 46.9 ng/mL for the control subjects (P < 0.0001). There was no significant association of plasma YKL-40 levels with patient age, tumor grade, or histology type. However, Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested that the elevated plasma YKL-40 level was particularly associated with short survival in CCA patients (P = 0.038). Immunohistochemical examination of 34 CCA tissues revealed low expression of YKL-40 in CCA cells, but high expression in adjacent intratumoral stroma, liver, and connective tissues. Univariate analysis showed significant association of the intratumoral YKL-40 expression in CCA tissues with the non-papillary type CCA. Addition of rYKL-40 in the culture medium and transient expression of YKL-40 in CCA cell lines were shown to promote the growth and migration of the tumor cells, and that YKL-40 interacted with a cell-surface receptor involved in the Akt/Erk-mediated pathway. In conclusion, our results support the proposal of YKL-40 as a new candidate prognostic biomarker for cancer diseases.
