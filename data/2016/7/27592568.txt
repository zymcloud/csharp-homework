Objective:To explore the regulatory effect of microRNA-141 (miR-141) on expression of high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) in mouse hepatoma carcinoma cell line (hepal-6 cells).Methods:The hepal-6 cells were divided into 4 groups: a miR-141 mimic group, a miR-141 mimic control group, a miR-141 inhibitor group and a miR-141 inhibitor control group. The miR-141 was transfected into hepal-6 cells with lipofectamine 2000. The levels of miR-141 and HMGB1 mRNA in the hepal-6 cells were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and then HMGB1 protein was examined by Western blot. The regulatory effect of miR-141 on 3'-UTR of candidate target gene (HMGB1) was determined by dual-luciferase reporter assay.Results:Compared with the control group, the level of miR-141 was up-regulated in the miR-141 mimic group, while down-regulated in the miR-141 inhibitor group. Moreover, the levels of HMGB1 mRNA and protein decreased in the miR-141 mimic group, while increased in the miR-141 inhibitor group. The dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-141 could target the 3'-UTR of HMGB1 gene.Conclusion:MiR-141 can up-regulate the expression of HMGB1 protein at the post-transcriptional level by targeting to the specific sequence of 3'-UTR of HMGB1 gene, which suggests that HMGB1 gene may be a target gene of miR-141.
