Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is the third most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Previous anti-HCV therapies using interferon-based regimens lead to sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in only approximately 50% of patients infected with HCV genotype 1. Along with recent advances in treatment for HCV infection by direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), the efficacy of anti-viral therapy has markedly improved, and almost 100% of sustained HCV eradication has been achieved by interferon-free regimens. Although combination therapy with DAAs with- out interferon offers fewer side effects and higher SVR rates, this may introduce issues regarding affordability and accessibility, including the emergence of drug-resistant HCV mutants and hepatocarcinogenesis. Espe- cially, HCC continues to develop in patients, even in those who have achieved an SVR, particularly in those showing signs of advanced liver fibrosis or severe steatosis, or those from an older age group. Therefore, the assessment of liver fibrosis and/or the risk of HCC development is essential for the management of pa- tients with chronic hepatitis C, not only before treatment but also after achieving an SVR. In this article, recent advances in anti-HCV treatment are reviewed and the future perspective is discussed. [Review].
