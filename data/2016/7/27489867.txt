Purpose:To investigate the utility of computed 3T diffusion-weighted imaging (c-DWI) for the diagnosis of non-complicated hepatic cysts with a focus on the T2 shine-through effect.Materials and methods:In 50 patients with non-complicated hepatic cysts we acquired one set of DWIs (b-value 0 and 1000 s/mm(2)) at 1.5T, and two sets at 3T (b-value 0 and 1000 s/mm(2), TE 70 ms; b-value 0 and 600 s/mm(2), TE 60 ms). We defined the original DWIs acquired with b = 1000 s/mm(2) at 1.5T and 3T as "o-1.5T-1000" and "o-3T-1000". c-DWIs were calculated with 3T DWI at b-values of 0 and 600 s/mm(2). c-DWI with b = 1000 and 1500 s/mm(2) were defined as "c-1000" and "c-1500". Radiologists evaluated the signal intensity (SI) of the cysts using a 3-point score where 1 = not visible, 2 = discernible, and 3 = clearly visible. They calculated the contrast ratio (CR) between the cysts and the surrounding liver parenchyma on each DWIs and recorded the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) with a b-value = 0 and 1000 s/mm(2) on 1.5T- and 3T DWIs.Results:Compared with o-1.5T-1000 DWI, the visual scores of all but the c-1500 DWIs were higher (p = 0.07 for c-1500- and p Conclusions:Non-complicated hepatic cysts showed higher SI on o-3T-1000- than o-1.5T-1000 DWIs due to the T2-shine through effect. This high SI was suppressed on c-1500 DWIs.
