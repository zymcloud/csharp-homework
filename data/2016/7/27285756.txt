Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common kinds of malignancies and is closely correlated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Recent evidence has proved that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in development and progression of cancer. However, the contributions of lncRNAs to HBV-related HCC remain largely unknown. Here, we comprehensively investigated lncRNA expression profiles in HBV-related HCC by annotating and analyzing microarray datasets. By analyzing 42 HCC tissue samples with different etiology (HBV-related, alcohol-related, and primary HCC) and 15 normal liver tissues, we identified 182 lncRNAs that were specifically differentially expressed in HBV-related HCC, namely HBV-related HCC specific lncRNAs(HH-lncRNAs). Using an online function annotation tool, we found these HH-lncRNAs were associated many oncogenes and immunity related biological processes. 6 candidate HH-lncRNAs were selected and further validated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis in a cohort of HCC tissue samples. Function of a candidate HH-lncRNAs, BAIAP2-AS1, was further predicted by co-expression network and gene set enrichment analysis. These findings provide insights into HH-lncRNAs and offer resource for further search of biomarkers and therapeutic targets of HBV-related HCC.
