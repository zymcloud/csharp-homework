Objective: To investigate the expression of sal-like 4 (SALL4) in tissues of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its association with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and clinicopathological characteristics. Methods: Immunohistochemistry and nucleic acid in situ hybridization were used to measure the mRNA expression of SALL4, epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin), vimentin, and Snail in 72 HCC samples, 2 fetal liver samples, and 2 normal adult liver tissue samples. Results: Strong expression of SALL4 was observed in hepatoblasts in fetal liver, but SALL4 expression was not observed in primitive hematopoietic cells and normal adult hepatocytes or biliary epithelial cells. In the HCC samples, the positive rate of SALL4 was 47.2% (34/72), showing focal positive nuclear staining. The HCC patients with microscopic microvascular tumor thrombus and portal vein tumor thrombus, a serum alpha-fetoprotein level of≥ 350 ng/ml, International Union Against Cancer (UICC) stage III+IV, and an age of < 46 years showed higher positive expression of SALL4 than those with no microscopic microvascular tumor thrombus or portal vein tumor thrombus, a serum alpha-fetoprotein level of < 350 ng/ml, UICC stage I+II, and an age of≥46 years. The HCC patients with positive SALL4 showed lower postoperative disease-free survival rate and overall survival rate than those with negative SALL4 (P < 0.05). Sixty percent of the patients with microvascular tumor thrombus (21/35) showed positive expression of SALL4. The positive rate of SALL4 was negatively correlated with E-cadherin (r = -0.434, P < 0.01), but positively correlated with vimentin and Snail (vimentin: r = 0.516, P < 0.01; Snail: r = 0.571, P < 0.01). Conclusion: In patients with primary HCC, the expression of SALL4 greatly affects EMT, which helps with the research on invasion and metastasis of liver cancer and prognostic evaluation.
