Background data:In compensated cirrhotics with early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC-cirr), upfront liver resection (LR) and salvage liver transplantation (SLT) in case of recurrence may have outcomes comparable to primary LT (PLT).Objective:An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis comparing PLT and SLT strategies.Methods:Of 130 HCC-cirr patients who underwent upfront LR (group LR), 90 (69%) recurred, 31 could undergo SLT (group SLT). During the same period, 366 patients were listed for LT (group LLT); 26 dropped-out (7.1%), 340 finally underwent PLT (group PLT). We compared survival between groups LR and LLT, LR and PLT, and PLT and SLT.Results:Feasibility of SLT strategy was 34% (31/90). In an ITT analysis, group LLT had better 5-yr/10-yr overall survival (OS) compared with group LR (68%/58% vs. 58%/35%; P = 0.008). Similarly, 5-yr/10-yr OS and disease-free survival (DFS) were better in group PLT versus group LR (OS 73%/63% vs. 58%/35%, P = 0.0007; DFS 69%/61% vs. 27%/21%, P Conclusions:In initially transplantable HCC-cirr patients, ITT survival was better in group PLT compared with group LR. SLT was feasible in only a third of patients who recurred after LR. Post SLT, short and long-term outcomes were comparable with PLT. Better patient selection for the "resection first" approach and early detection of recurrence may improve outcomes of the SLT strategy.
