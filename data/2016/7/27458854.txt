Background/aims:The Wnt/ÃŸ-catenin pathway plays a prominent role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The Dickkopf (DKK) proteins (DKK1-4) are known Wnt antagonists; the overexpression of DKK1 has been demonstrated in HCC, and increased DKK3 methylation in the HCC tissue is associated with worse prognosis. Thus, the aim of our study was to demonstrate the diagnostic accuracy of serum DKK1 and DKK3 in HCC in comparison with that of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).Materials and methods:We included consecutive 40 HCC patients, 54 cirrhosis patients, and 39 healthy controls. Serum DKK1 and DKK3 levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and serum AFP levels were measured by a chemiluminescence assay.Results:The AFP levels differed in each group and could help differentiate between groups (p Conclusion:Although AFP is superior to DKK1 and DKK3 in the diagnosis of HCC, the combination of DKK1 and AFP showed a better diagnostic yield than AFP alone.
