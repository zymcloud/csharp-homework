In the absence of an effective therapy against Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), chemoprevention remains an important strategy to circumvent morbidity and mortality. Here, we examined chemopreventive potential of Acteoside (ACT), a plant derived phenylethanoid glycoside against an environmental and dietary carcinogen, diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced rat hepatocarcinogenesis. ACT treatment (0.1 and 0.3% supplemented with diet) started 2 weeks before DEN challenge and continued for 18 weeks thereafter, showed a remarkable chemopreventive activity. ACT treatment resulted in reduced HCC nodules. Histopathology showed progressive tissue damage, necrosis (5 weeks), hepatocytic injury (10 weeks), anisonucleosis with presence of prominent nucleoli, sinusidal dilations, and lymphomono nuclear inflammation (18 weeks). Biochemical analysis showed hepatocytic injury (raised ALT, p
