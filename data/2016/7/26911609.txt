Background:The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages 0 and A, and portal hypertension (PHT) who underwent liver resection (LR) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Methods:The study population consisted of 121 patients with PHT and HCC of BCLC stage 0 and A who underwent LR (n = 81) or RFA (n = 40). To reduce bias in patient selection, the different covariate distributions in two groups were adjusted using inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW). The prognostic outcomes of LR- and RFA-treated patients were then analyzed.Results:Before IPTW adjustment, the 5-year overall survival (OS) of LR and RFA patients was comparable. Five-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was significantly better in the LR group than in the RFA group (P Conclusions:By reducing postoperative complications, LR may be a treatment option for patients with BCLC stage 0 or A HCC and PHT.
