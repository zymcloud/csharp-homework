Chrysin is a major active ingredient of flavonoids, known to exhibit protective effects against various types of cancer. However, the anticancer role of chrysin against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In order to evaluate the effects of chrysin on cell viability and apoptosis in human HCC, HepG2 and QGY7701 cells were used in the present study. Cell viability was monitored using an MTT assay. In addition, an Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide kit was used for the labeling of the apoptotic cells, which were then measured using flow cytometry. Western blotting was used to examine the protein expression of p53, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X (Bax), Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bad), Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak), caspases-3 and -9, and cleaved-caspases-3 and -9. The results of the present study revealed that chrysin suppressed the cell viability of HepG2 and QGY7701 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, chrysin induced significant apoptosis in HepG2 and QGY7701 cells. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that chrysin treatment increased the expression of proapoptotic proteins, including p53, Bax, Bad and Bak, while it decreased the protein level of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. It was also demonstrated that chrysin induced apoptosis in the HCC cells by regulating the p53/Bcl-2/caspase-9 signaling pathway. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that chrysin may be a potential candidate agent for the induction of cell apoptosis in human HCC.
