Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within microRNAs (miRNAs) are considered potential markers for risk and prognosis of various cancers. In the current study, we aimed to determine whether miR-608 rs4919510 affected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis. We genotyped rs4919510 using DNA from blood samples of 362 HCC patients receiving surgical resection of HCC tumor. Associations between rs4919510 and overall survival (OS) and demographic characteristics and clinical features were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Results showed that HCC patients who carried the rs4919510 CC genotype had a significantly longer OS compared to those who carried the GG genotype (P = 0.013, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.600, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.402-0.897) and the CG + GG genotype (P = 0.033, HR = 0.681, 95 % CI 0.479-0.970) in univariate analysis. Similar results were obtained in multivariate analysis. Further stratification analysis indicated that rs4919510 was significantly associated with OS in patients who were satisfied with one of the following criteria: male gender, HbsAg-positive, Î±-fetoprotein (AFP)-positive, tumor size >5 cm, cirrhosis, solitary tumor, I + II pTNM stage, or no tumor capsule. Finally, a significantly higher frequency of rs4919510 CC genotype was observed in patients with cirrhosis (22.9 %, 55/240) than those without cirrhosis (14.0 %, 17/121) (P = 0.047). In conclusion, our results illustrated the potential role of miR-608 rs4919510 as a prognostic marker for HCC patients undergoing surgical resection of the tumor.
