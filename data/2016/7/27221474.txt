Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), a multifunctional kinase, is an important regulator of cancer cell survival. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is also a key factor for controlling several cellular events including the cell cycle, senescence, and apoptosis, in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). The role of GSK-3β regulating the activity and protein level of ASK1 in the cancer cells remains largely unexplored. In this study, we showed that GSK-3β inhibits ROS-induced hepatocellular carcinoma cell death by suppressing ASK1. We first found that ectopic expression of GSK-3β suppressed hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cell death in HepG2 cells and knockdown of endogenous GSK-3β expression exhibited opposite effects. Moreover, GSK-3β expression clearly inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of ASK1 in HepG2 cells, in association with a decrease in ASK1 protein level. Further exploration revealed that GSK-3β induced ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of ASK1 via inhibition of ubiquitin-specific protease USP9X. Our results thus suggest that GSK-3β is a key factor involved in ASK1 activation and ROS-induced cell death.
