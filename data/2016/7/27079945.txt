Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects 130 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of liver cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. The interactions between viral elements and host factors play critical role on HCV invade, replication and release. Here, we identified adaptor protein complex 1 sigma 3 subunit (AP1S3) as a dependency factor for the efficient HCV infection in hepatoma cells. AP1S3 silencing in cultivated Huh7.5.1 cells significantly reduced the production of HCV progeny particles. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that AP1S3 interacted with the HCV E2 protein. With this interaction, AP1S3 could protect HCV E2 from ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Using in vivo ubiquitylation assay, we identified that E6-Associated Protein (E6AP) was associated with HCV E2. In addition, treatment with synthetic peptide that contains the AP1S3-recognized motif inhibited HCV infection in Huh7.5.1 cells. Our data reveal AP1 as a novel host network that is required by viruses during infection and provides a potential target for developing broad-spectrum anti-virus strategies.
