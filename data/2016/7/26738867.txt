This study examined the association between hector battifora mesothelial antigen-1 (HBME-1) expression and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). A total of 206 patients were enrolled in the current study including 96 PTC patients and 110 patients with benign thyroid nodules (BTN). Immunohistochemistry (Envision) were performed to assess the expression of HBME-1. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) curves were applied to evaluate the diagnostic tumor node metastasis (TNM) value of HBME-1. Specimens from 96 patients with PTC and 110 patients with BTC were reviewed. HBME-1 was positively immunostained in PTC tissue, which was significantly higher than that in BTN tissues (77.1 vs. 5.77 %, P < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry also identified that HBME-1 expression did not show any statistically significant differences based on gender, age, tumor size, TNM stage, and lymph node metastasis (P > 0.05). Importantly, HBME-1 expression was correlated with infiltration levels and differential levels in PTC (both P < 0.05). HBME-1 was found to have high sensitivity (94.5 %) and specificity (77.08 %) for PTC diagnosis. Moreover, HBME-1 had a high specificity (83.33 %) at identifying the differential levels of PTC, but a low sensitivity (22.92 %). The sensitivity and specificity of HBME-1 identifying the infiltration levels of PTC were, respectively, 72.70 and 72.00 %. HBME-1 was highly expressed in PTC tissues, and HBME-1 can serve as a potential biomarker in the diagnosis of PTC.
