Background:Spontaneous rupture is one of the most fatal complications of HCC. The incidence of HCC still remains a significant health problem in Eastern Asia. Many studies have shown that the in-hospital or 30-day mortality rates are as high as 25-100 %. It is often difficult to stratify these patients based on clinical manifestations and biochemical data, for deciding on an appropriate treatment strategy, especially when the patient's hemodynamic status is unstable. This study aimed to explore the clinical outcomes of treatment of spontaneously ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma with hemorrhagic shock.Methods:One hundred and sixty two patients with hemorrhagic shock secondary to spontaneous rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma were included in this retrospective study. The therapeutic methods included conservative treatment, transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) and hepatectomy. The outcomes in terms of 30 day and 1 year survival were analyzed.Results:Thirty five (21.6 %) received only conservative management, TAE was performed in 48 (29.6 %) and partial hepatectomy (emergency and staged) in 106 (65.4 %) patients. The 30-day survival rate was lower in patients receiving conservative treatment (8.6 %) than in those receiving either hepatectomy or TAE (88.2 %; P Conclusions:Partial hepatectomy, tended to provide better survival than transcatheter arterial embolization alone or conservative treatment in the management of patients with hemorrhagic shock secondary to spontaneous rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma.
