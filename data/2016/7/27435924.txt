Background & aim:Aflibercept known as ziv-aflibercept in the United States is a soluble decoy receptor of both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-1 and -2 known to inhibit the binding of VEGF and placental growth factor (PlGF) to VEGF receptor-1 and -2. Here, we analyzed the mechanisms of the antitumor effects of aflibercept in mouse hepatoma models.Methods:In in vitro studies, we determined the effects of aflibercept on human umbilical vein cell (HUVEC) proliferation and bone marrow (BM) cell differentiation to endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). In in vivo experiments, aflibercept was injected intraperitoneally in hepatoma cell tumor-bearing mice, and its inhibitory effects on tumor growth and BM cell migration to tumor tissues were evaluated.Results:Aflibercept suppressed phosphorylation of VEGF receptor-1 and -2 in HUVEC and dose-dependently inhibited VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation. It suppressed the differentiation of BM cells to EPCs and migration of BM cells to tumor tissues. It also suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival time of tumor-bearing mice without side effects. In tumor tissues, aflibercept upregulated the expression of hypoxia inducible factor1-α, VEGF, PlGF, fibroblast growth factor-2, platelet derived growth factor-BB, and transforming growth factor-α and reduced microvascular density. It also reduced sinusoidal density in noncancerous liver tissues.Conclusions:Our results demonstrated potent antitumor activity for aflibercept in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma. These effects were mediated through inhibition of neovascularization, caused by inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation, EPC differentiation, and BM cell migration to tumor tissues.
