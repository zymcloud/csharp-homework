Background/aims:We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an immunosuppressive regimen without steroids after liver transplantation (LT) for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Sixty-six HCC patients who underwent an immunosuppressive regimen without steroids after LT were enrolled in the steroid-free group. The preoperative characteristics and postoperative outcomes of these patients were compared with those of 132 HCC recipients who were placed on an immunosuppressive regimen using steroids (steroid group). The incidence of acute rejection, HBV recurrence, infection, and new-onset diabetes mellitus and the overall and tumor-free survival rates were compared between the two groups.Results:Differences were not observed in the 1-year (83.3% vs 97.0%, p=0.067), 3-year (65.4% vs 75.8%, p=0.067) or 5-year (56.3% vs 70.7%, p=0.067) patient survival rates or in the 1-year (62.1% vs 72.7%, p=0.067), 3-year (49.8% vs 63.6%, p=0.067) or 5-year (48.6% vs 63.6%, p=0.067) tumor-free survival rates between the two groups, respectively. In the steroid-free group, the patients who fulfilled the Milan criteria had higher overall and tumor-free survival rates than those in the steroid group (pConclusions:After LT, an immunosuppressive regimen without steroids could be a safe and feasible treatment for HBVrelated HCC patients, thus resulting in the reduction of HBV recurrence. Based on the observed survival rates, patients who fulfill the Milan criteria may derive benefits from teroidfree immunosuppression.
