MicroRNA-126 (miR-126) has been found to promote angiogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. So, we conducted this study to explore the effect of miR-126 expression on angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). The expression levels of miR-126 and sprouty-related, EVH1 domain containing protein (Spred)1 in surgically resected HCC tissue, HCC tissue with TACE + operation, and tumor-adjacent tissues were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expression levels of miR-126, Spred1, and vascular endothelial growth factor were found by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. The microvessel density (MVD) of tumor tissues was determined by immunohistochemical staining. The miR-126 and Spred1 expressions in HCC tissue with TACE + operation were elevated and decreased, respectively, as compared to those in surgically resected HCC tissues and tumor-adjacent tissues (all P
