Objective To investigate the effect of endogenous interferon β (IFN-β) on the polarization of M1 macrophages as well as the proliferation and invasion activities of hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCCs) mediated by M1 macrophages. Methods U937-M1 macrophages derived from human monocytic tumor cells U937 was established and the cell phenotypes were identified by real-time quantitative PCR, ELISA and flow cytometry. After IFN-β gene was knocked down with siRNA or IFN-β was neutralized with IFN-β monoantibody in U937-M1 macrophages, the change of M1/M2 phenotype was again analyzed by the above methods. The expressions of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and IRF5 were detected by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting. The proliferation and invasion activities of HCCs, which were cultured with conditioned medium (CM) collected from different macrophage groups, were analyzed by CCK-8 assay and Transwell(TM) experiments, respectively. Results U937-M1 macrophages showed higher expressions of interleukin 12p35 (IL-12p35), interleukin 12p40 (IL-12p40), interleukin 12p70 (IL-12p70), interleukin 23p19 (IL-23p19), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and CD86 than U937-M0 did. But both U937-M0 macrophages and U937-M1 macrophages showed low expression of CD206. However, compared with the U937-M1 macrophages, the IFN-β-blocked U937-M1 macrophages presented decreased expressions of the above M1 macrophages-associated markers, but increased expressions of M2 macrophages-associated markers IL-10 and CD206, as well as lower expressions of IRF1 and IRF5. The inhibited proliferation/invasion activities of HCCs mediated by U937-M1 macrophages were reversed by IFN-β-blocked U937-M1 macrophages. Conclusion Blocking endogenous IFN-β could inhibit the U937-M1 polarization status and U937-M1 macrophages-mediated anti-tumor activity of HCCs. IFN-β might be involved in modulating the expressions of IRF1 and IRF5 as well as maintaining the M1 polarization status and its function.
