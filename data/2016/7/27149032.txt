Introduction:The use of antiangiogenic strategy in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancers has been largely evidence-based. More recently, novel vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors have been studied in other gastrointestinal diseases. Ramucirumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody that binds to VEGFR2 extracellular domain with a much greater affinity compared to its natural ligand, showed second-line effectiveness for patients with gastric or colorectal carcinomas.Areas covered:We perform a narrative literature review. The aims of our work are to recall the current evidence of its efficacy in the treatment of gastric, hepatocellular and colorectal cancers and to present the ongoing studies enrolling gastrointestinal cancer patients in which ramucirumab is being tested. Expert commentary: The landscape of angiogenesis-inhibition for the treatment of GI malignancies is rapidly evolving. The results of the REGARD and RAINBOW trials renewed the interest for antiangiogenic agents in gastric cancer and determined a swift change in the treating paradigm for this disease. Accordingly, ramucirumab was shown to be effective in pretreated colorectal cancer patients and it is being tested in other gastrointestinal malignancies.
