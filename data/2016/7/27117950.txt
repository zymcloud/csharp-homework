Purpose:To differentiate benign periablational enhancement (BPE) from residual tumor after radiofrequency (RF) ablation by using a stress contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (US) test with phenylephrine in a rabbit VX2 liver tumor model.Materials and methods:VX2 tumors were implanted in the livers of 40 rabbits for two experiments. In experiment one, liver tumors from 32 animals were completely ablated. On days 2, 7, 14, and 21 after RF ablation, eight animals were randomly chosen for contrast-enhanced US before and after phenylephrine administration, and the microvessel density (MVD) of BPE at these four time points was assessed. In experiment two, liver tumors from eight animals were partly ablated, and each animal underwent contrast-enhanced US before and after phenylephrine administration on day 7 after RF ablation. Perfusion parameters were observed, including maximum intensity (IMAX), rise time (ie, time between 10% and 90% of IMAX), time to peak, mean transit time, and area under the curve (AUC), along with the profile of time-intensity curves (TICs) in BPE and residual tumor in response to phenylephrine.Results:Among the four time points after ablation, the IMAX and AUC before phenylephrine administration and the MVD of BPE were greatest on day 7 (P Conclusions:Contrast-enhanced US with phenylephrine stress may be helpful in differentiating BPE from residual tumor after RF ablation in hepatocellular carcinoma.
