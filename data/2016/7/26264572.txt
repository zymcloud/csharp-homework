Objective:To investigate the effect of direct moxibustion at Ganshu (BL18) on the serum concentrations of tumor specific growth factor (TSGF) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in a rat model with precancerous lesion of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), so as to explore the mechanism of moxibustion underlying improvement of HCC.Methods:Sixty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control group (n=10), model group (n=20), prevention group 1 (n=15) and prevention group 2 (n=15). The normal rats were injected with physiological saline as blank control. At the same time, the rats of other three groups were injected with diethylnitrosamine to establish the HCC model. Direct moxibustion with grain-sized moxa was applied to bilateral Ganshu acupoint of the rats in the prevention group 1 (1 treatment course, 20 days) and prevention group 2 (2 treatment courses, 40 days), 5 doses for each acupoint, 0.5 mg/dose, once every other day. At each time point (before model establishment, the end of 1st course prevention, the end of 2nd course prevention and the end of model establishment), serum levels of TSGF and TNF-α were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Results:Compared with the control group, there was a remarkably increase of serum TSGF and TNF-α contents in the model group at the end of the experiment (PConclusion:It was possible that direct moxibustion could inhibit precancerous lesion and postpone hepatocarcinogenesis, and the therapeutic effect of two courses were better than one course.
