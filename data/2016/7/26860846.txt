Background and aim:The Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score is a commonly used staging system for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) helpful with predicting prognosis of advanced HCC. CLIP uses the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score to evaluate liver reserve. A new scoring system, the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade, has been proposed as they objectively evaluate liver reserve. We examined whether the modification of CLIP with ALBI retained its prognosis prediction for patients with advanced HCC.Methods:We included patients who received first-line antiangiogenic therapy for advanced HCC. Liver reserve was assessed using CTP and ALBI scores, which were then incorporated into CLIP and ALBI-CLIP, respectively. To assess their efficacies of prognostic prediction, the Cox's proportional hazard model and concordance indexes were used.Results:A total of 142 patients were included; 137 of them were classified CTP A and 5 patients CTP B. Patients could be divided into four or five groups with different prognosis according to CLIP and ALBI-CLIP, respectively. Higher R(2) (0.249 vs 0.216) and lower Akaike information criterion (995.0 vs 1001.1) were observed for ALBI-CLIP than for CLIP in the Cox's model predicting overall survival. ALBI-CLIP remained an independent predictor for overall survival when CLIP and ALBI-CLIP were simultaneously incorporated in Cox's models allowing variable selection with adjustment for hepatitis etiology, treatment, and performance status. The concordance index was also higher for ALBI-CLIP than for CLIP (0.724 vs 0.703).Conclusions:Modification of CLIP scoring with ALBI, which objectively assesses liver reserve, retains and might have improved prognosis prediction for advanced HCC.
