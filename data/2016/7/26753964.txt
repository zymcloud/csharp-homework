Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of microRNAs (miRNAs) are considered potential markers of cancer risk and prognosis in various cancers. In the current study, the primary aim is to determine whether the miR-492G>C polymorphism (rs2289030) altered hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis. The SNP rs2289030 of miR-492 was genotyped using DNA from blood samples of 362 HCC patients that had undergone surgical resection of a HCC tumor. The associations between overall survival and demographic characteristics, clinical features, and the SNP rs2289030 were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Results showed that patients who carried the CG genotype (P = 0.015, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.704, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.530-0.934) and CG+GG genotype (P = 0.011, HR = 0.703, 95 % CI 0.536-0.924) had significantly decreased risk of death compared to those with the CC genotype. Similar results were found in the multivariate analysis adjusted by tumor size and venous invasion. Further stratification analysis indicated that the effect of rs2289030 had more prominence in patients â‰¤50 years old and that reported ever using alcohol, male gender, a family history of HCC, being HbsAg or alpha fetoprotein (AFP) positive, differentiation I + II, presence of venous invasion or cirrhosis, multiple tumors, and pTNM stage I + II. Results from this study illustrate the potential use of miR-492 rs2289030 as a prognostic marker for HCC patients that have undergone a surgical resection of the tumor.
