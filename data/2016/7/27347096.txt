Cytochromes P450 (CYPs) are a major source of variability in pharmacokinetics and drug response. CYPs utilize a variety of small and large molecules as substrates in enzymatic reactions. The CYP genes may be divided into two groups: Endogenous CYPs (CYP family 7-51) and xenobiotic CYPs (CYP family 1-4). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether endogenous CYPs exhibit similar gene expression and mutations in various cancer types. The gene expression profiles and somatic mutations exhibited in colon adenocarcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma were analyzed using data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The expression of CYP11A1 was significantly downregulated in all six cancer types. In addition, CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 exhibited the highest number of mutations among endogenous CYPs in all samples. As the CYP11 family is important for steroid biosynthesis, and previous studies have demonstrated that steroid hormones are associated with certain cancers, these results indicate a common role of the CYP11 family in various cancer types.
