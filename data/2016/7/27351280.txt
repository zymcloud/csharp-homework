Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) are a group of RNAs that are more than 200 nt in length but cannot encode proteins. Accumulating evidences showed that abnormal LncRNA expressions are highly involved in many kinds of tumor. By using gene trap methods which could knockdown gene expression to find important genes, we found one LncRNA which called intergenic non-protein coding RNA 52 (LINC00052) has the ability to inhibit invasion and migration of hepatocarcinoma cells. We found that invasion, migration and proliferation abilities in SMMC7721 cell were inhibited after up-expressing LINC00052. We identified that NTRK3 was the target gene of LINC00052. Down-expression of NTRK3 could increase SMMC7721 cell invasion, migration and proliferation. Meanwhile, we discovered that LINC00052 could regulate NTRK3 expression by forming complementary base pairing with miR-128 and miR-485-3p to reduce the luciferase activity of NTRK3 3'UTR. These results reveal a new mechanism for understanding hepatocarcinoma cells invasion and migration.
