Objective:To compare the treatment outcomes of sorafenib plus transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) vs TACE alone in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatic vein tumor thrombus (HVTT).Methods:Twenty patients who were initially diagnosed with HCC and HVTT and received TACE combined with sorafenib during February 2009 to October 2013 were included in the study. To minimize selection bias, these patients were compared with 60 case-matched controls selected from a pool of 81 patients (in a 1:3 ratio) who received TACE alone during the same period. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). The secondary end points were time to progression, disease control rate, and adverse events.Results:After a median follow-up period of 12.5 months (range, 1.03-44.23 months), the OS of the combined group was found to be significantly higher compared with the monotherapy group (14.9 vs 6.1 months, P=0.010). The time to progression was found to be significantly longer in the combined group (4.9 vs 2.4 months, P=0.016). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the treatment allocation was an independent predictor of OS.Conclusion:Sorafenib plus TACE was well tolerated and was more effective in treating patients with advanced HCC and HVTT. Future trials with prospective larger samples are required to validate these results.
