Context Four gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) fractions with different molecular weights (big-, medium-, small- and free-GGT) are detectable in human plasma. Objective Verify if liver cells can release all four GGT fractions and if the spatial cell organization influences their release. Methods Hepatoma (HepG2) and melanoma (Me665/2/60) cells were cultured as monolayers or spheroids. GGT released in culture media was analysed by gel-filtration chromatography. Results HepG2 and Me665/2/60 monolayers released the b-GGT fraction, while significative levels of s-GGT and f-GGT were detectable only in media of HepG2-spheroids. Bile acids alone or in combination with papain promoted the conversion of b-GGT in s-GGT or f-GGT, respectively. Conclusions GGT is usually released as b-GGT, while s-GGT and f-GGT are likely to be produced in the liver extracellular environment by the combined action of bile acids and proteases.
