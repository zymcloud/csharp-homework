Interleukin-33 (IL-33), a newly-discovered cytokine belonging to the IL-1 family, serves an important role in inflammation. However, it is not clear whether IL-33 is of clinical significance in hepatocarcinogenesis. The present study was designed to investigate the role of IL-33 during oncogenesis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). IL-33 protein expression was detected in 76 HCC (including 36 para-carcinoma), 33 cirrhosis, 30 hepatitis, and 20 normal liver tissues using immunohistochemistry. IL-33 mRNA expression in carcinoma and para-carcinoma tissues was evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The possible correlation between IL-33 and clinicopathological parameters of HCC was also analyzed. Significant differences in IL-33 expression were not observed among normal, hepatic, and cirrhotic tissues (P>0.05), whereas the level of protein positive rate was markedly reduced in HCC tissues (P0.05). Therefore, the aberrant expression of IL-33 is associated with oncogenesis and progression of HCC and the cytoplasmic accumulation of the protein may serve a role in hepatocarcinogenesis.
