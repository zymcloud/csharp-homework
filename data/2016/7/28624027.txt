Background:We investigated if there were any differences in disease presentation and survival between the 3 major ethnicities in New Mexico; non-Hispanic whites (NHW), native Americans (NA), and Hispanics (H).Methods:A retrospective analysis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated at our institution between 2000 and 2014 was performed. Overall survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models.Results:We identified 326 patients; 106 (32.5%) NHW, 183 (56.1%) H, and 37 (11.4%) NA. No difference in disease stage, resectability, rate of offering surgery, or chemotherapy was found. Advanced cirrhosis was more common in H and NA than NHW (P = .01). NA had a higher incidence of nonviral hepatocellular carcinoma (P = .0009). NHW were more likely to receive transarterial chemoembolization/radiofrequency than NA or H (P = .04). Median survivals for NA, NHW, H were 24, 14, and 11 months, respectively, (P = .01).Conclusions:Although there was no difference in disease stage or resectability, NA and H had more advanced cirrhosis and were less likely to undergo transarterial chemoembolization and/or radiofrequency than NHW. NA had the best survival, whereas H had the worst survival.
