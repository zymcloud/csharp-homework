Objectives:There is increasing evidence that Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), based on systemic inflammatory response and albumin level, is a useful predictor of overall survival in patients with various types of cancer.Methods:Patients with lung metastasis from colorectal carcinoma who underwent a lung metastasectomy from 2000 to 2015 were retrospectively investigated. Routine laboratory measurements including serum C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, and the tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen were performed before the metastasectomy.Results:Ninety-nine patients underwent 132 lung metastasectomy procedures during the study period. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that GPS (p = 0.017), number of metastases (p = 0.004), and the presence of liver metastasis (p = 0.010) were associated with overall survival, while univariate analysis selected GPS (p = 0.028), number of metastases (p = 0.005), and liver metastasis (p = 0.014) as predictive factors associated with overall survival. Multivariate analysis also indicated GPS (p = 0.004), number of metastases (p = 0.004), and liver metastasis (p = 0.013) as predictive factors associated with overall survival.Conclusion:In addition to number of metastases and liver metastasis, GPS is an important predictor of overall survival in colorectal cancer patients who undergo a lung metastasectomy.
