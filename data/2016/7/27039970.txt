Background & aims:Clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) via antiviral treatment changes the course of liver disease. We evaluated the benefit of sustained virologic response (SVR) in patients with HCV and cirrhosis without (stage 1) and with (stage 2) esophageal varices (EV).Methods:We performed a prospective cohort study of 444 patients with HCV and compensated cirrhosis (218 with stage 1 and 226 with stage 2 disease) treated with peg-interferon and ribavirin from June 2001 through December 2009 at the University of Palermo, Italy and followed for a median of 7.6 years (range, 1-12.6 years). We used Cox regression analysis to identify variables associated with appearance or progression of EVs, development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver decompensation, and overall survival.Results:In the intention-to-treat analysis, 67 patients with stage 1 disease (30.7%) and 41 patients with stage 2 disease (18.1%) achieved an SVR (P = .003). Patients with stage 1 disease and an SVR were less likely to develop EVs than stage 1 patients without an SVR (hazard ratio [HR], 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.48; P Conclusions:In a prospective study of 444 patients with HCV and compensated cirrhosis, HCV eradication reduced risk for liver decompensation, HCC, and death, regardless of whether the patients had EVs.
