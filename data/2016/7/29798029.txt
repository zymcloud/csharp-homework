Objective:To analyze the clinical significance of phosphatase of regenerating liver-3(PRL-3) and vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF)expression in sinonasal squamous cell carcinomas.Method:We use immunohistochemical analysis and RT-PCR to detecte the expression of PRL-3 and VEGF protein in 62 cases of sinonasal squamous carcinoma tissues(SNSCC),30 cases of nasal polyps(NP),and 25 cases of normal nasal mucosa(NM).Result:①The expression of PRL-3 and VEGF in sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma tissues were statistically higher than in nasal polyps and normal nasal mucosa tissues (P<0.05).②The expression of PRL-3 and VEGF were not correlated with patient's age or gender(P>0.05).But the High expression of PRL-3 and VEGF in SNSCC was significantly related with advanced,lower tumor differentiation and lymph node metastasis(P<0.05).③The expression of PRL-3 and VEGF was positively correlated in sinonasal squamous cell carcinomas.Conclusion:The expression of PRL-3 and VEGF in SNSCC may involve in the regulation of tumor growth and differentiation.The expressing intensity may reflect the proliferation activity of sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma cell.PRL-3 and VEGF may promote the tumor metastasis in a synergistic manner.
