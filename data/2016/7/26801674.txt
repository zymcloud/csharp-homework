Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer mortality and carries a dismal prognosis. The present study aimed to identify the tumour-suppressive role and clinical implications of PTPN13 in HCC progression. We tested the effects of PTPN13 expression in proliferation, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and associated pathways in HCC cell lines in vitro. Furthermore, its clinical relevance was evaluated in a tissue microarray analysis of samples from 282 HCC patients. Various HCC cell lines expressed relatively low PTPN13 protein levels in vitro. PTPN13 overexpression significantly inhibited the progression of HCC cells, possibly by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition through inactivation of the EGFR/ERK signalling pathway. Tissue microarray analysis revealed that high PTPN13 expression was correlated with a favourable prognosis in postoperative HCC patients. This study demonstrated the tumour suppressor, PTPN13, as an alternative therapeutic target for HCC.
