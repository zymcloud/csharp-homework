Objective:This study aimed to build VX2 liver tumor model in rabbits and to investigate the sequential transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and portal vein embolizations (PVE) vs. TACE or PVE alone on rabbit VX2 liver carcinoma and liver regeneration.Materials and methods:VX2 liver tumor models were built in the rabbit. Rabbits carrying VX2 liver tumors were divided into four groups, including TACE+PVE, TACE, PVE and Sham groups respectively. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was performed to visualize the structures of tumor tissues. The volume data of caudal liver on day 3 and day 7 was measured by CT. Western blot analysis of active caspase-3 was performed to examine cell apoptosis. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of Ki-67 was performed to visualize hepatocyte regeneration. Serum IL-6, TNF-alpha, HGF and TGF-beta1 on 6th h, 24th h, day 3 and day 7 were measured by ELISA assay.Results:The TACE+PVE group had the strongest suppressive effect on tumor growth and induced the highest level of tumor cell apoptosis. TACE+PVE can induce evident liver regeneration, which is reflected by the largest caudal liver volume increase and the highest ratio of Ki-67 positive cells. ELISA assay showed that during the first 7 days since day 0, TACE+PVE group had the highest level of HGF, IL-6 and TNF-alpha.Conclusions:TACE+PVE can significantly inhibit VX2 tumor growth, induce tumor cell apoptosis and liver regeneration, the effects of which are stronger than TACE or PVE alone. In the first 7 days since day 0, TACE+PVE group had the highest level of IL-6, TNF-alpha and HGF. This might be the reason why TACE+PVE induced the strongest liver regeneration.
