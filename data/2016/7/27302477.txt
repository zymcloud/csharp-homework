Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is one of the worst malignancies in females with poor overall survival due to the rapid metastasis and the absence of ideal biomarkers. Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7), an important deubiquitinating enzyme, was reported to be upregulated in several cancers, including liver, prostate and colon cancers. Membrane associated RING-CH protein 7 (MARCH7) belongs to the member of the E3 ubiquitin ligases. In addition, MARCH7 regulates T cell proliferation and the neuronal development and participates in the membrane trafficking and protein degradation. Importantly, MARCH7 itself is ubiquitinated and acts as a potential substrate of USP7. However, the roles of USP7 and MARCH7 in EOC remain to be investigated. We collected 121 EOC patients and analyzed the expression levels of USP7 and MARCH7 in tumor tissues with immunohistochemical staining. We found that the high expression of the two proteins was correlated with lymph node metastasis in EOC patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the patients with high expression of the two proteins showed poorer prognosis compared with other patients. Subsequently, using SKOV3 human ovarian adenocarcinoma cells, we showed that either USP7 or MARCH7 enhanced the proliferation and invasion abilities. Moreover, USP7 could regulate the expression levels of E-cadherin and Î²-catenin through the MARCH7 signaling pathway. Our findings indicate that USP7 and MARCH7 are involved in the progression of EOC. In conclusion, analyzing the expression of USP7 and MARCH7 has high prognostic value in predicting EOC prognosis.
