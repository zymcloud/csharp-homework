Introduction:Sorafenib chemotherapy is the first-line therapy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in an advanced stage. The aim of this study was to evaluate prognostic factors of survival in HCC patients treated with sorafenib, in real-life clinical practice.Material and methods:Retrospective study of HCC patients who initiated treatment with sorafenib, following assessment and indication from the multidisciplinary group.Results:There were included 36 patients, mostly male (89%) and with a mean age of 65 years. The main etiologies were chronic hepatitis C (44%) and alcoholic liver disease (36%). Twenty patients (56%) were classified as Child-Pugh A and 16 patients (44%) as Child-Pugh B. Half of the patients group were staged as BCLC C and the remaining as BCLC B. Significant adverse events were observed in 15 patients (42%) and were associated with longer survival (21.5 vs. 3.2 months, p < 0.001). The most frequent adverse events were diarrhea and palmar-plantar syndrome. Median survival was 17.3 months for Child-Pugh A versus 3.2 months for Child-Pugh B patients (p = 0.001). Within Child-Pugh A, median OS was 21.5 months for BCLC B patients and 15.7 months for BCLC C patients (p = 0.001).Discussion and conclusions:The main prognostic factors beyond Child-Pugh class and BCLC stage included the occurrence of significant adverse events. Being related to increased time of exposure to the drug, it points out the need of dose reducing instead of discontinuation whenever significant adverse events occur.
