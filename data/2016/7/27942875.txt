Background:Several studies have suggested no difference in the liver function of early gastric cancer (EGC) patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) between laparoscopic and open distal gastrectomy. However, the number of patients and comparison of long-term survival rates between the two groups are limited. The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term survival and immediate postoperative liver function of EGC patients with LC after laparoscopic and open distal gastrectomy.Materials and methods:The clinical data of EGC patients with LC who had no other malignancy and underwent distal gastrectomy at Asan Medical Center between January 2005 and April 2013 were investigated retrospectively. All patients were divided into two groups: the open group (OG) and laparoscopic group (LG). The clinicopathologic data of the two groups were compared.Results:The number of patients in each group was 48 and 27 in the OG and LG, respectively. There were no significant differences in the age, sex ratio, ASA score, cause of liver cirrhosis, preoperative Child-Pugh classification, tumor location, TNM stage, total postoperative drain amount, albumin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, prothrombin time, morbidity and recurrence rate. Shorter hospital stay, longer operative time and more retrieved lymph nodes were observed in LG. The long-term overall survival rate was not different between the two groups (P = 0.356).Conclusions:For EGC patients with liver cirrhosis, especially Child A cirrhosis, laparoscopic or laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy can be a safe surgical procedure in comparison to open distal gastrectomy in terms of the long-term survival rate and immediate postoperative liver function.
