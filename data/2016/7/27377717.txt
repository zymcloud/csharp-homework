Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a raising liver disease with increasing prevalence due to the epidemics of obesity and diabetes, with end points in cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. A multitude of genetic and metabolic perturbations, together with environmental factors, likely drive the disease. However, to date only a few genes, primarily PNPLA3 and TM6SF2, associate with NAFLD and there is no specific treatment. In this review we focus on the therapeutical aspects of NAFLD, taking into account drugs and lifestyle interventions. Sex also influences disease progression and treatment outcomes. Lastly, we discuss the present and potential future of personalized approaches to tackle NAFLD and how the known polymorphisms of NAFLD associated genes influence the choice and success of therapy.
