Background:The incidence of esophagogastric junction (EGJ) carcinoma is increasing, but its optimal surgical management remains controversial.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the database of 400 patients with Siewert type II EGJ carcinoma who were treated surgically at 7 institutions between March 1986 and October 2010. We examined the clinicopathological characteristics, prognostic factors, and risk factors associated with each recurrence pattern.Results:The 5-year overall survival rate of all patients with Siewert type II EGJ carcinoma was 58.4 %. Multivariate analysis showed that T and N stages were independent prognostic factors. We also found that the incidence of lower mediastinal lymph node metastasis (17.7 %) and para-aortic lymph node metastasis (16.1 %) was relatively high. In addition, the para-aortic lymph nodes (N = 39, 9.8 %) were the most frequent node recurrence site, followed by the mediastinal lymph nodes (N = 23, 5.8 %). Lung recurrence was more common than was peritoneal recurrence. Considering each type of recurrence, multivariate analysis showed that the differentiated type was associated with a higher risk of lung recurrence than was the undifferentiated type, and N stage (pN2-3) and positive venous invasion were independent risk factors for liver recurrence.Conclusions:This study is one of the largest retrospective studies to evaluate patients with Siewert type II EGJ carcinoma. Para-aortic and mediastinal lymph node metastasis and recurrence rates were relatively high. During the postoperative follow-up of patients with differentiated Siewert type II EGJ carcinoma, patients should be monitored for lung recurrence more closely than that for peritoneal recurrence.
