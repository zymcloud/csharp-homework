(18)F-FDG PET is an effective method of predicting recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation. We compared recently introduced metabolic and volumetric (18)F-FDG PET/CT indices with the current clinicopathologic predictors for ability to predict recurrence.Methods:In total, 110 HCC patients who underwent (18)F-FDG PET and liver transplantation were enrolled. On PET, SUVs and tumor-to-background ratios (TBRs) were measured as metabolic activity indices. Various metabolic tumor volumes and uptake-volume products (UVP) were also measured as volumetric indices. The ability of these indices and other clinicopathologic factors to predict recurrence was compared.Results:All metabolic and volumetric indices were significant for recurrence prediction on receiver-operating-characteristic curve analyses (P Conclusion:Volumetric and metabolic activity indices of (18)F-FDG PET are effective predictors of posttransplantation HCC recurrence. In addition to clinicopathologic factors, these indices need to be considered in the selection of candidates for liver transplantation.
