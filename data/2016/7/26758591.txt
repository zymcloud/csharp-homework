Background and aim:Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10), a cancer-related oxidoreductase, was recently reported to be upregulated in some chronic liver diseases. However, its relevance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development is not fully assessed, especially in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.Methods:Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 expression in the liver of 550 patients with chronic HCV infection was immunohistochemically assessed and quantified. A multivariate Cox model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of AKR1B10 expression for HCC development, and the cumulative incidence of HCC was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 expression in the patients ranged from 0% to 80%. During the median follow-up of 3.2 years, 43 of 550 patients developed HCC. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that high AKR1B10 expression (â‰¥6%) was an independent risk factor for HCC (HR, 6.43; 95% confidence interval, 2.90-14.25; P Conclusion:Various degrees of AKR1B10 upregulation in the liver were observed in patients with chronic HCV infection, and high AKR1B10 expression could be a novel predictor of HCC.
