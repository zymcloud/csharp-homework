Background:In 1998, the technique of laparoscopic hepatectomy by curettage and aspiration was developed and a special instrument, laparoscopic multifunctional operative dissector (LPMOD), was designed for this procedure. In the past 17 years, this procedure was developed gradually and had become the routine procedure for laparoscopic hepatectomy in local area. This paper is to report results of 17-year practice of this procedure.Methods:Patients who underwent laparoscopic hepatectomy from August 1998 to March 2015 were reviewed. Hepatectomies were performed using the technique of laparoscopic hepatectomy by curettage and aspiration. By using the LPMOD, liver parenchyma was crashed and aspirated immediately and the intrahepatic ducts and small vessels were preserved and were safely dissected for ligation. Laparoscopic selective hepatic flow occlusion was performed routinely for hemi-hepatectomies to control intraoperative blood loss.Results:A total of 855 cases underwent laparoscopic hepatectomy by curettage and aspiration. No perioperative death, 105 patients were converted to open operation, and 84 of them were converted before liver transection without any emergency. Postoperative bleeding occurred in three patients (0.4 %), and bile leakage occurred in seven patients (0.8 %).Conclusion:Laparoscopic hepatectomy by curettage and aspiration is a safe procedure for liver resection with acceptable morbidity and mortality.
