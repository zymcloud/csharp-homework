Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted mainly via percutaneous or permucosal exposure to HBV- containing body fluids. Because HB vaccination is effective and safe, it is recommended for all children, ado- lescents, and all unvaccinated adults at risk of HBV infection (individuals with occupational risk, immunosup- pressed individuals, and sexually active individuals). In Japan, universal HB vaccination will be introduced for all infants in October 2016. In Japan, the prevalence of HBV genotype A, which is frequently found in North America, northwestern Europe, India, and Africa, has been increasing as a sexually transmitted infection. HBV reactivation under anticancer chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy is well-known as a seri- ous complication in HBV-resolved patients. Monthly monitoring of HBV-DNA is recommended for prevent- ing HBV reactivation-related hepatitis among HBV-resolved patients with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma under steroid plus rituximab chemotherapy. Recently, a highly sensitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) for HBsAg detection by Lumipulse HBsAg-HQ was reported as the latest clinical application. Although the sensitivity of this assay (â‰¥5 mIU/mL) is 10-fold higher than the conventional assay, it is still lower than that of the HBV-DNA assay. The useful HBsAg-HQ will be applied for detecting occult HBV infection and HBV reactivation. The aim of treatment for chronic HBV infection is to reduce the risk of complications, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Pegylated interferon alfa and nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NAs) are the current treatments for chronic HBV infection. NAs have improved the outcomes of patients with cirrhosis and HCC, and decreased the incidence of acute liver failure. [Review].
