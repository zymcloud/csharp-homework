Telomeres are DNA tandem repeats at the ends of chromosomes in eukaryotic cells and play important roles in maintaining the stability and integrity of chromosomes. Telomeres are gradually shortened with cell proliferation, and when they are shortened to a certain length, the cells experience senescence and apoptosis. However, a small number of cells can maintain the length of telomeres and restore their function through related mechanisms (activation of telomerase or other mechanisms), and some cells may even be immortalized. Therefore, telomere and telomerase are thought to be closely associated with tumor development and progression. It has been confirmed that telomerase activation is an early event in the development of primary liver cancer, especially the important component of telomerase telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), which plays an important role in this process. Here this article reviews the latest research advances in the function and regulation mechanisms of telomerase and the role of TERT in the development, progression, and treatment of primary liver cancer, especially hepatocellular carcinoma, so as to provide a molecular genetic basis for intervention of liver cancer and related targeted therapy.
