Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and lethal human cancers. Recently, exome sequencing has revealed that mutation of ARID1A is frequent in HCC. Herein, we determined the clinicopathologic significance of ARID1A expression in HCC. We detected the level of mRNA and protein expression of ARID1A in 12 paired HCC tumors and adjacent non-cancerous tissues by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). In addition, we determined the expression of BAF250a on 121 HCC tumors by IHC and assessed the association between BAF250a expression and clinicopathologic and prognostic features. The levels of ARID1A mRNA were significantly elevated in 10 of 12 HCC tumors compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The level of BAF250a protein expression was higher in 10 of 12 HCC tumors compared with adjacent liver tissues. IHC indicated that 12.17 % of HCC tumors (14/115) were BAF250a-negative. Loss of BAF250a was significantly associated with larger tumor size, but not associated with other clinicopathologic features. There was no significant difference in disease-free or overall survival between BAF250a-positive and BAF250a-negative patients. Most HCCs had an increased level of ARID1A mRNA and BAF250a expression. Loss of BAF250a was significantly more frequent in larger HCC tumors, but had no prognostic significance.
