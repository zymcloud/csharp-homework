Background:The rapid development of multi-drug resistance (MDR) process has hindered the effectiveness of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatments. Notch-1 pathway, which mediates the stress-response, promotes cell survival, EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) process and induces anti-apoptosis in cancer cells, would be a potential target for overcoming MDR process. This study investigated the potential application of rhamnetin, a specific inhibitor of Notch-1 pathway, in anti-tumor drug sensitization of HCC treatment.Methods:The expression of miR-34a, proteins belonging to Notch-1 signaling pathway or MDR-related proteins was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot assay. To identify whether rhamnetin induces the chemotherapeutic sensitization in HCC cells, the MTT-assays, flow cytometry, soft agar, trans-well and nude mice assays were performed.Results:The endogenous expression of miR-34a was significantly increased and the expression of Notch-1 and Survivin was downregulated after rhamnetin treatment. Treatment of rhamnetin also reduced the expression of MDR related proteins P-GP (P-glycoprotein) and BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein). Rhamnetin increased the susceptibility of HCC cells and especially HepG2/ADR, a MDR HCC cell line, to a small molecular kinase inhibitor sorafenib or chemotherapeutic drugs etoposide and paclitaxel. The IC(50) value of those drugs correspondingly decreased.Conclusions:Together, our findings suggest that rhamnetin treatment may attenuate the MDR process in HCC cells. These findings may contribute to more effective strategies for HCC therapy.General significance:Rhamnetin acts as a promising sensitizer to chemotherapy and may be a novel approach to overcome the MDR process of HCC.
