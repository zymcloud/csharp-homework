Background:The treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is complicated and challenging because of the frequent presence of cirrhosis. Therefore, we propose a novel surgical approach to minimize the invasiveness and risk in patients with HCC, hypersplenism, and esophagogastric varices.Methods:This was a retrospective study carried out in 25 patients with HCC and hypersplenism and who underwent simultaneous laparoscopic-guided radio-frequency ablation and laparoscopic splenectomy with endoscopic variceal ligation. Tumor size was restricted to a single nodule of Results:Mean operative time was 128 ± 18 min. Mean blood loss was 206 ± 57 mL. Length of stay was 7.0 ± 1.5 days. Mean total costs were 8064 USD. Cytopenia and thrombocytopenia recovered quickly after surgery. No procedure was converted to open surgery. Two patients showed worsening liver function after surgery, three patients showed worsening of ascites, and five patients suffered from portal vein thrombosis. The 1-year tumor-free survival was 78.8 %, and the 21-month tumor-free survival was 61.4 %. According to a literature review, these outcomes were comparable to those of simultaneous open hepatic resection and splenectomy.Conclusions:Laparoscopic-guided radio-frequency ablation with laparoscopic splenectomy and endoscopic variceal ligation could be an available technique for patients with HCC
