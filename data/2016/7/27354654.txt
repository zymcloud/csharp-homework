Background/aim:Heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27), a low molecular weight stress protein, is recognized as a molecular chaperone. The expression of HSP27 has been detected in some human tumors and while HSP27 is phosphorylated as a reresponse to stress, the function of phosphorylated HSP27 (p-HSP27) is not known. The aim of this study was to investigate what kind of effect expression of HSP27 and p-HSP27 in HCC has on clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis.Materials and methods:An immunohistochemical study for HSP27 and p-HSP27 was performed on 194 resected HCC cases. We analyzed the correlation of HSP27 expression with various parameters statistically.Results:There was no correlation between expression of HSP27 and the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis from the analysis of 194 cases. From the analysis of the hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive group of 142 cases, those that were p-HSP27-positive had a larger tumor diameter and the portal vein invasion rate was high.Conclusion:The expression of total HSP27 may serve as a new, clinically useful marker of HCC. In addition, the present study suggests that the expression of phosphorylated HSP27 is useful in the screening and grading of HCC occurring in the setting of HCV.
