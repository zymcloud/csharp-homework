Background:Human epidermal growth factor (HER) 2 positivity and its association with clinicopathological factors remain unclear in Japanese gastric cancer (GC) patients. We performed a prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study to evaluate HER2 protein expression and gene amplification in Japanese metastatic and recurrent GC patients, and explored its correlations with clinicopathological features.Methods:HER2 protein expression and gene amplification were centrally assessed in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded GC tissue by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Patient information was collected, and associations between clinicopathological factors and HER2 positivity (IHC score 3+ and/or FISH positive) and low HER2 expression (IHC score 0/FISH positive or IHC score 1+/FISH positive) were examined.Results:From September 2011 to June 2012, 1461 patients were registered across 157 sites, and the HER2 status of 1427 patients was evaluated. The rate of HER2 positivity was 21.2 %, whereas the rate of high HER2 expression (IHC score 2+/FISH positive or IHC score 3+) was 15.6 % and that of low HER2 expression was 7.0 %. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified intestinal type, absence of peritoneal metastasis, and hepatic metastasis as significant independent factors related to HER2 positivity. The intestinal type was confirmed to be the GC subtype predominantly associated with lower HER2 expression. Sampling conditions including number of biopsy samples, formalin concentration, and formalin-fixation time did not significantly affect HER2 positivity.Conclusions:HER2 expression in Japanese patients was comparable to that in other populations examined. Intestinal type was an independent factor related to HER2 positivity and low HER2 expression.
