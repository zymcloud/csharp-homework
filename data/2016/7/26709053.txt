This study evaluated the antitumour activity of the mesoionic compound sydnone 1 (Syd-1) against Walker-256 carcinosarcoma. Tumour cells were subcutaneously inoculated in the hind limb in male Wistar rats. The animals were orally treated for 12 days with Syd-1 (75 mg/kg) or vehicle. At the end of treatment, considerable decreases in tumour volume and tumour weight were observed in treated animals. Samples of these tumours presented increases in apoptotic bodies and pro-apoptotic protein expression (Bax and p53), while the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was reduced. A decrease in reduced glutathione levels and an increase in glutathione peroxidase activity were observed in tumour after Syd-1 treatment. However, significant splenomegaly was evident in animals that received Syd-1, most likely attributable to the induction of haemolysis. This study demonstrated the antitumour activity of Syd-1 against Walker-256 carcinosarcoma. Its mechanism of action is linked to the activation of apoptotic pathways that lead to tumour cell death.
