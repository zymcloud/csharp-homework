Conclusion:Down-regulation of ECD may associate with infiltrative tumor growth and result in poor prognosis. However, ECD expression is not significantly associated with tumor metastasis.Aim:To investigate the prognostic role of E-cadherin (ECD) expression in laryngeal cancer.Methods:In a clinical study, a total of 79 laryngeal cancer patients who received surgery were included in this study. The expression of ECD in laryngeal cancer tissue was detected by immumohistochemical staining. In an in vitro study, ECD up-regulated cells (Ad-ECD) and ECD down-regulated cells (sh-ECD) were cultured, along with interference by siRNA. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. In an in vivo study, nude mice were injected with Ad-ECD, sh-ECD, and Hep-2 cells. The ECD expression and tumor metastasis in the brain, liver, and lung tissues were detected.Results:Clinical data showed that expression of ECD was statistically correlated with survival rate (p < 0.05), but not with other clinical characteristics, such as age, gender, lymphatic metastasis, and TNM staging. ECD was down-regulated in sh-ECD cells and the down-regulation significantly reduced apoptosis of Hep-2 cells. Tumor growth was significantly inhibited in the Ad-ECD group. Except the tumor tissue, no positive ECD expression or significant tumor cells were found in the brain, liver, and lung tissues.
