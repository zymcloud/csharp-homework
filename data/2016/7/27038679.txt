An 18-year-old man underwent liver transplantation due to an Abernethy malformation associated with multiple hepatocellular nodules including one which was rapidly enlarging and was suspicious for malignant transformation. Analysis of the explanted liver showed a spectrum of multiple hepatocellular nodules ranging in appearance from focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatocellular adenoma and to a well-differentiated hepatocellular neoplasm borderline for hepatocellular carcinoma. Mutational analysis revealed wild-type β-catenin expression in the background liver and some nodules, whilst different variants were present in other lesions irrespective of their morphological appearance. No telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutation was identified. Abernethy malformations can lead to independent genetic events which can result in β-catenin mutations associated with malignant transformation of hepatocellular nodules. When following up such patients, one must therefore have a high index of suspicion, particularly if radiological surveillance reveals a change in the nature of hepatic lesions.
