The objectives of this present study were to investigate oncofetal antigen glypican-3 (GPC-3) expression in HCC and their match para-cancerous tissues by the array technology with immunohistochemistry and estimate its value as a novel prognostic marker for HCC. The incidence of GPC-3 expression was 95.7 % in the cancerous tissues with significantly higher (Ï‡2 = 33.824, P
