Although third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) can overcome T790M-mediated resistance in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), rebiopsy to confirm T790M status is occasionally difficult. We aimed to investigate the current tendency and the limitations of rebiopsy in clinical practice. This study included 139 consecutive NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations, who had experienced progressive disease (PD) after EGFR-TKI treatment. We retrospectively reviewed patient characteristics, tumor progression sites and rebiopsy procedures. Of 120 patients (out of the original 139) who were eligible for clinical trials, 75 (63%) underwent rebiopsy for 30 pleural effusions, 32 thoracic lesions, four bone, two liver, and seven at other sites. Rebiopsy procedures included 30 thoracocentesis, 24 transbronchial biopsies, 13 computed tomography (CT)-guided needle biopsies and 8 other procedures. Of the 75 rebiopsied patients, 71 (95%) were pathologically diagnosed with malignancy; and 34 (45%) had available tissue samples for EGFR analyses. Of the 75 biopsied patients, 61 (81%) were analyzed for EGFR mutation, using tissue or cytology samples; T790M mutations were identified in 20 (33%) of the 61 patients. Of the 120 patients, 45 (38%) did not undergo rebiopsy, because of inaccessible tumor sites (n = 19), patient refusal (n = 6) or decision of physician (n = 10). In conclusion, among patients with EGFR mutations who had PD after EGFR-TKI treatment, 63% underwent rebiopsy. Most rebiopsy samples were diagnosed with malignancy. However, tissue samples were less available and T790M mutations were identified less frequently than in previous studies. Skill and experience with rebiopsy and noninvasive alternative methods will be increasingly important.
