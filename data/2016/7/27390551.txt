Background:To evaluate plasma chaperonin containing TCP1 complex subunit 3 (CCT3) and IQ-motif-containing GTPase-activating protein-3 (IQGAP3) as biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening and diagnosis.Methods:Blood samples were collected from 126 HCC patients with HCC, 88 patients with cirrhosis and 50 healthy volunteers to detect plasma α-fetoprotein (AFP), CCT3 and IQGAP3 levels. Plasma AFP, CCT3 and IQGAP3 protein levels were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Results:In the plasma of HCC patients, both CCT3 and IQGAP3 were significantly higher than in patients with cirrhosis and in healthy controls (P Conclusions:CCT3 and IQGAP3 are novel complementary biomarkers for HCC screening and diagnosis, especially for AFP-negative and small HCC patients.
