Genetic variants in zinc ribbon domain-containing 1 antisense RNA 1 (ZNRD1-AS1) have been reported to be associated with development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We sought to determine the influences of ZNRD1-AS1 polymorphisms and their interactions with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes on the risk of HCC. In this study, we conducted a large population case-control study with 1,507 HBV-related HCC cases and 1,560 HBV persistent carriers. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ZNRD1-AS1 (rs3757328, rs6940552 and rs9261204) were genotyped using a TaqMan allelic discrimination assay, and the HBV genotypes were identified by multiplex PCR. We found consistently significant associations between the ZNRD1-AS1 rs6940552 and rs9261204 SNPs with an increased risk of HCC (additive genetic model: adjusted OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.03-1.32 for rs6940552; adjusted OR =1.20, 95% CI = 1.06-1.35 for rs9261204) and found a borderline association between rs3757328 and HCC risk. Besides, we observed a dose-dependent relationship between increasing numbers of variant alleles of the SNPs and HCC risk (P for trend
