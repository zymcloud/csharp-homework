Background/aim:Angiogenesis is a known factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to assess the property of iguratimod, that is an anti-inflammatory drug for rheumatoid arthritis, on anti-angiogenesis and anti-carcinogensis for HCC.Materials and methods:In vitro, human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured under interleukin-8 (IL-8) with or without iguratimod. In vivo, a rat model with HCC received iguratimod or distilled water for 6 weeks. Diameter of the largest tumor, number of tumors and serum interleukin-8 concentration were compared between iguratimod and control groups.Results:By an in vitro angiogenesis assay, it was found angiogenesis in iguratimod group was significantly lower than that in control group (p=0.013). In vivo, largest tumor diameter (p=0.036), number of the tumor (p=0.011) and serum interleukin-8 concentration (p=0.036) in the iguratimod group were significantly smaller and lower than those in the control group.Conclusion:Iguratimod may inhibit hepatocellular carcinogensis by inhibition of interleukin-8 production in a rat model.
