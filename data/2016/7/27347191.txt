In the present study, a case of unresectable massive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) alone is reported. Although the treatment induced chest wall hernia, its efficacy in treating the HCC was demonstrated. The medical records of a patient with an unresectable massive tumor that was effectively treated with serial HIFU ablation were retrospectively studied. Chest wall hernia was detected as a complication of the HIFU treatment, which has not been reported thus far in the literature. The patient has survived for 44 months since the first diagnosis in September 2010. Treatment resulted in partial remission of the tumor, pain relief, decreased levels of alpha-fetoprotein and chest wall hernia, as a complication. Therefore, HIFU may be an effective approach for the treatment of unresectable HCC, although it may occasionally cause complications.
