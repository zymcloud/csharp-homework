Introduction:Recurrence after liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of mortality. Knowledge on biomarkers may contribute to better surveillance based on the patients' risk of recurrence. Reviewing the literature, we aimed to identify serological and molecular biomarkers for recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after liver transplantation.Methods:A literature search was performed in the databases PubMed and Scopus to identify observational studies evaluating serological or molecular biomarkers for recurrence of HCC after LT using adjusted analysis to correct for confounding.Results:Of 502 records, 69 mainly retrospective studies were included with a total of 15,213 patients. Of these, 41 studies were suitable for meta-analyses, which showed that the serum markers pre-transplant Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) (hazard ratio (HR) 2.69 [2.08-3.47]), pre-transplant des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) (HR 5.99 [3.27-10.98]), and allelic imbalance in microsatellites in DNA of tumor tissue (HR 13.49 [3.17-57.30]) were related to recurrence.Conclusions:AFP, DCP and allelic imbalance in microsatellites may be used to predict recurrence. Together with other modalities, biomarkers may be used in future transplantation criteria to optimize selection of suitable patients.
