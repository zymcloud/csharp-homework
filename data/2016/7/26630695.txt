Background:An elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is associated with aging, nutrition, alcohol abuse and more, and it is known as a survival predictor in chronically ill patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between MCV levels and mortality from all-causes, cancer and site-specific cancer in a non-anemic healthy population.Methods:A total of 36,260 participants aged 40 years or older who underwent routine check-ups at Seoul National University Hospital Health Promotion Center between 1995 and 2008 were followed-up for mortality until December 31, 2008, retrospectively.Results:During an average follow-up of 8.0 years, 1107 deaths including 547 cancer deaths were observed. The adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of the subjects with the highest quartile of MCV ≥95.8 fL in men and MCV ≥94.2 fL in women for all-cause and cancer mortality were 1.44 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.15-1.80] and 1.51 (95% CI, 1.10-2.07) for men and 1.55 (95% CI, 1.08-2.22) and 1.25 (95% CI, 0.74-2.11) for women, respectively, compared with those in the reference group (90.5 fL≤MC <93.0 fL in men and 89.2 fL≤MCV<91.6 fL in women). Elevated MCV level was related to an increased risk of liver cancer mortality in men (aHR, 3.55; 95% CI, 1.75-7.21).Conclusions:This study suggests that the elevated MCV level in non-anemic cancer-free individuals was associated with increased all-cause mortality in both men and women, and with cancer mortality, in particular liver cancer mortality in men. Future prospective studies are required to consolidate our findings.
