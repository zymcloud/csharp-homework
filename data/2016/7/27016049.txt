Cystic kidney disease includes a wide range of hereditary, developmental, and acquired conditions of the kidneys. Some of the inherited causes of cystic kidney disease include autosomal dominant polycystic kidney diseases (caused by mutations in PKD1 or PKD2), autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, tuberous sclerosis complex, von Hippel-Lindau disease, oral-facial-digital syndrome type I, and Hadju-Cheney syndrome. Acquired cystic kidney disease has been reported in patients receiving long-term hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis and in children after liver transplantation. Acute kidney injury can occur in patients with neuroblastoma, usually as a result of thrombotic microangiopathy associated with bone marrow transplantation. End-stage renal disease is described in long-term survivors. However, in this case report, we provide what is to our knowledge the first description of multiple kidney cysts in long-term survivors of stage IV neuroblastoma. None of the 7 patients we describe with neuroblastoma and multiple kidney cysts had a family history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Also, all lacked stigmata of tuberous sclerosis complex, von Hippel-Lindau disease, or Hadju-Cheney syndrome. Two patients progressed to end-stage renal disease; in addition, one of them developed an oncocytoid renal cell carcinoma.
