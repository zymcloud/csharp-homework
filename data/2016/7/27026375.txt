Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major cause of acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, particularly in Asia-Pacific countries. The major complications in HBV carriers are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver failure and esophageal varices following the progression to cirrhosis, while some develop HCC without cirrhosis. The progression to liver fibrosis and these other complications could be prevented by treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs); however, NUCs must be continuously administered for a long time. Peginterferon could lead to HBV surface antigen loss. It is difficult to use peginterferon in HBV-infected patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Acute liver failure due to HBV infection and acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B could be treated by NUCs. Universal vaccination programs against HBV could prevent new HBV infections globally. Here, we review the currently available treatments for HBV infection.
Chronic hepatitis B; HCC; Interferon; Nucleos(t)ide analogue.
