Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive solid malignancy throughout the world. Dysregulation of miRNAs play essential roles in HCC progression via aberrant regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, as well as metastasis. miR-663a is a poorly investigated miRNA. Whether miR-663a regulates HCC development remains unknown. The aim of the study was to explore the role of miR-663a in HCC development. To determine the expression level of miR-663a in HCC, we analyzed the data from GSE21362 and TCGA. The results showed that miR-663a was significantly down-regulated in HCC tissue compared with adjacent non-tumor tissue. Gain of function and loss of function assays revealed that miR-663a distinctly inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that miR-663a modulated cell functions through targeting and suppressing high mobility group A2 (HMGA2). In addition, overexpression of HMGA2 remarkably attenuated the tumor repressive effect of miR-663a. Taken together, miR-663a inhibits HCC cell proliferation and motility by targeting HMGA2.
