Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive and life-threatening disease often diagnosed at intermediate or advanced stages, which substantially limits therapeutic approaches to its successful treatment. This indicates that the prevention of HCC may be the most promising strategy in reducing its incidence and mortality. Emerging evidence indicates that numerous nutrients and nonnutrient dietary bioactive components can reduce the occurrence and/or delay the development of HCC through modifications of deregulated epigenetic mechanisms. This review examines the existing knowledge on the epigenetic mechanism-based studies in in vitro and in vivo models of HCC on the chemopreventive potential of epigenetic food components, including dietary methyl-group donors, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, sodium butyrate, resveratrol, curcumin, and sulforaphane, on liver carcinogenesis. Future direction and potential challenges in the effective use of bioactive food constituents in the prevention of HCC are highlighted and discussed.
