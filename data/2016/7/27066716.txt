A seco-cucurbitane triterpene and two aristolane sesquiterpenes, named (24E)-3,4-seco-cucurbita-4,24-diene-3-hydroxy-26,29-dioic acid, (+)-1,2-didehydro-9-hydroxy-aristlone, and (+)-12-hydroxy-aristlone, were isolated from fruiting bodies of the medicinal mushroom Russula lepida, together with (24E)-3,4-seco-cucurbita-4,24-diene-3,26,29-trioic acid and (+)-aristlone. The structures of the first three compounds, including their absolute configurations, were assigned on the basis of their NMR and ECD spectra. Two seco-cucurbitane triterpenes, (24E)-3,4-seco-cucurbita-4,24-diene-3-hydroxy-26,29-dioic acid and (24E)-3,4-seco-cucurbita-4,24-diene-3,26,29-trioic acid, inhibited the activity of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), with IC50 values of 20.3 and 0.4μM, respectively. All isolated compounds did not show cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines, Huh-7 (hepatoma) and EJ-1 (bladder), at 50μM.
