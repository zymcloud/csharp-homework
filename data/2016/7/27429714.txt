Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects 3% of the world population. It represents the main cause of chronic liver disease and is responsible for extra-hepatic complications, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. HCV includes 7 genotypes differing in the nucleotide sequence variability, the geographic distribution, the rates of viral clearance, the risk of progression to liver fibrosis and to hepatocellular carcinoma, and the response to therapy. Last years have seen remarkable advances in the field of HCV infection with the approval of direct antiviral agents (DAAs) targeting key viral proteins involved in the HCV replication. Several oral regimens combining DAAs from different families have been developed and these regimens showed increased and sustained virological response rates to above 90% reducing the treatment duration to 12 wk or less. In particular, sofosbuvir, a nucleotide analogue nonstructural (NS)5B polymerase inhibitor, and velpatasvir, a NS5A inhibitor, have been tested in two phase 3 trials, the ASTRAL-2 (against HCV genotype 2) and the ASTRAL-3 (against HCV genotype 3), demonstrating to be effective, safe, and well tolerated in patients who were 18 years of age or older and had at least a 6-mo history of HCV infection with a compensated liver disease.
