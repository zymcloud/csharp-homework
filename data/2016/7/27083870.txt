The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus is approved for rejection prophylaxis after liver transplantation. The current article pools the experience of French liver transplant surgeons and physicians in use of everolimus and, particularly, practical guidance on dosing, appropriate concomitant immunosuppression and management of adverse events. In terms of indication, introduction of everolimus from week 4 after liver transplantation, with or without concomitant calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) therapy, offers a significant renal benefit without loss of immunosuppressive efficacy. De novo treatment with everolimus, either selectively or systematically, may play a role in the prevention and treatment of recurrence of hepatocellular cancer and de novo malignancies. For maintenance patients, the most frequent indications for introducing everolimus are in response to renal dysfunction, recurrent hepatocellular cancer, diabetes, hypertension, or neurotoxicity, or as a preventative approach to avoid malignancies. Of these, the strongest evidence exists for a renoprotective effect. However, the low rate of acute rejection following switch of maintenance patients from CNI-based to everolimus-based therapy means that this can be considered even where robust data are not yet available. Most adverse events associated with mTOR inhibitors can usually be managed successfully, often with concentration-controlled dose reductions. Dosing algorithms are provided, with suggestions for target ranges in specific settings, and treatment strategies for the most common side effects are proposed. Although further research is required, everolimus has become an established part of the immunosuppressive arsenal for liver transplant recipients over the last decade. Sharing experience from units which have embraced its use may help other centers develop their own protocols.
