Background and aim:There are no large series on hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from India. We present the results of consecutive patients of HCC treated with hepatic resection at a tertiary care center in India.Methods:The records of all patients who underwent hepatic resection for HCC in the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (New Delhi), were reviewed. The relevant perioperative and follow up data were extracted from a prospectively maintained database.Results:Between January 1987 and December 2013, 81 patients [71 males; mean age: 49.2 ± 15.6 years] underwent hepatic resection for HCC. Of these, 23 (28 %) were cirrhotic and 36 (49 %) had hepatitis B. Hepatitis B was significantly more common in cirrhotic (77 % vs. 37 %; p = 0.001). Most patients had locally advanced disease at presentation [tumor size ≥10 cm in 61 (75 %); vascular tumor thrombus in 10 (12 %)]. Anatomical resection was done in 61 (75 %) including 56 major hepatic resections (≥3 segments). Overall in-hospital mortality was 13 (16 %) [cirrhotic 5 (22 %) vs. noncirrhotic 8 (14 %), p = 0.503]. Grade III-V complications (modified Clavien-Dindo classification) occurred in 25 (31 %) patients (cirrhotic 48 % vs. noncirrhotic 24 %; p = 0.037). Follow up information was available for 51 (75 %) patients. The median time to recurrence was 12 months, and most (86 %) occurred within 1 year. The recurrence-free survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 48 %, 40 %, and 36 %, respectively. Positive resection margin and vascular invasion were significantly associated with very poor prognosis.Conclusion:Majority of Indian HCC patients present with locally advanced disease. Despite this, surgical resection provides a chance for long-term recurrence-free survival in a third of them.
