Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor that regulates cellular lipid and glucose metabolism and also plays an inhibitory role in various cancers. However, the role of PPARγ in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of PPARγ in HCC and its role in inhibiting tumor progression, namely, HCC cell growth, migration, and angiogenesis. Immunohistochemical PPARγ staining was examined in 83 HCC specimens to investigate the clinicopathological correlations between PPARγ expression and various parameters. The functional role of PPARγ was determined via PPARγ overexpression and knockdown in HCC cells. Patients with low HCC tissue PPARγ expression were significantly younger (p = 0.006), and exhibited more tumor numbers (p = 0.038), more macroscopic vascular invasion (MVI) (p = 0.008), and more advanced TNM (size of primary tumor, number of regional lymph nodes, and distant metastasis) stages at diagnosis (p = 0.013) than patients with high HCC tissue PPARγ expression. PPARγ knockdown increased HCC cell growth, migration, and angiogenesis, while PPARγ overexpression reduced HCC cell growth, migration, and angiogenesis. These results suggest that low PPARγ expression is an independent predictor of more MVI in HCC patients. PPARγ contributes to the suppression of HCC cell growth, migration, and angiogenesis. Therefore, PPARγ may be a therapeutic target in HCC patients.
