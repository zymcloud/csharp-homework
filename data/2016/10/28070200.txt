Introduction:Since directly acting antivirals (DAAs) for treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) were introduced, conflicting data emerged about the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after interferon (IFN)-free treatments. We present a case of recurrent, extra-hepatic HCC in a liver-transplanted patient soon after successful treatment with DAAs, along with a short review of literature.Case presentation:In 2010, a 53-year old man, affected by chronic HCV (genotype 1) infection and decompensated cirrhosis, underwent liver resection for HCC and subsequently received orthotopic liver transplantation. Then, HCV relapsed and, in 2013, he was treated with pegylated-IFN plus ribavirin; but response was null. In 2014, he was treated with daclatasvir plus simeprevir to reach sustained virological response. At baseline and at the end of HCV treatment, computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen excluded any lesions suspected for HCC. However, alpha-fetoprotein was 2.9 ng/mL before DAAs, increasing up to 183.1 ng/mL at week-24 of follow-up after the completion of therapy. Therefore, CT scan of abdomen was performed again, showing two splenic HCC lesions.Conclusions:Overall, nine studies have been published about the risk of HCC after DAAs. Patients with previous HCC should be carefully investigated to confirm complete HCC remission before starting, and proactive follow-up should be performed after DAA treatment.
