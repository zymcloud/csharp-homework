Background:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH) are frequent comorbidities in perioperative patients. However, the predictive role of the hepatokine fetuin A was not evaluated in this collective.Objective:To study fetuin A as predictor of NAFLD/NASH in preoperative patients.Methods:58 subjects were included. Fetuin A was studied in patients undergoing open abdominal surgery and in a subset with acute liver failure. Blood and liver specimens were sampled. NAFLD was histologically evaluated. Liver fat was additionally analyzed by an enzymatic approach, circulating fetuin A by enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay, fetuin A mRNA by reverse-transcription PCR.Results:Univariate correlation studies linked fetuin A to liver steatosis (r = 0.40, p = .029) and hepatocellular ballooning degeneration (r = 0.34, p = .026). Compared to non-NAFLD subjects fetuin A was increased in NAFLD (p = .009) and in NASH (p = .029). However, when corrected for main confounders by linear modeling, fetuin A remained related to hepatic steatosis, but not to ballooning degeneration or other NAFLD features. In support of this, biochemically analyzed liver lipids correlated with fetuin A in plasma (r = 0.34, p = .033) and with hepatic fetuin A mRNA (r = 0.54, p Conclusion:Fetuin A is suggested as noninvasive biomarker of hepatic steatosis in preoperative settings.
