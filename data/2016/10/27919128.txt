A 70-year-old man underwent left partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (pT1aN0M0). One year after the surgery, he presented with hematuria and fatigue. Computed tomography showed a left 8 cm renal tumor and multiple liver and lung metastases. We performed percutaneous renal and liver biopsy with echo guidance. The diagnosis of both kidney and liver was urothelial carcinoma. He died 3 weeks after the diagnosis. Ipsilateral occurrence of the pelvic renal carcinoma after partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma is extremely rare. To our knowledge, this case is the first to be reported in Japan and elsewhere.
