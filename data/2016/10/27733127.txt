Background:Although elevated levels of lactoferrin provide a biomarker for inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer, the clinical significance of these elevated levels in ascitic fluid of patients with ascites caused by liver cirrhosis is limited. The aims of our study were to investigate the usefulness of ascitic fluid lactoferrin levels for the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in patients with cirrhosis and to evaluate the association between lactoferrin levels and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 102 patients with ascites caused by cirrhosis were consecutively enrolled into the study, from December 2008 to December 2011. Ascitic fluid lactoferrin levels were quantified using a human lactoferrin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit.Results:The median ascitic fluid lactoferrin levels were significantly higher in patients with SBP than in those without SBP (112.7 ng/mL vs. 0.6 ng/mL; p Conclusions:Ascitic fluid lactoferrin level can be a useful diagnostic tool to identify SBP in patients with ascites caused by cirrhosis. Elevated ascitic fluid lactoferrin level in patients without SBP may be indicative of a developing hepatocellular carcinoma.
