Background & aims:Most regions of the world have â‰¤3 co-circulating hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes, which limits direct comparisons of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk among HBV-infected persons by genotype. We evaluated HCC incidence by HBV genotype in a cohort of Alaska Native (AN) persons where five HBV genotypes (A, B, C, D, F) have been identified.Methods:Our cohort comprised AN persons with chronic HBV infection identified during 1983-2012 who consented to participate in this study. Cohort persons were offered annual hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) testing and semi-annual HCC screening. We developed a logistic regression model to compare HCC risk by genotype, adjusting for age, sex, region and HBeAg status.Results:Among the 1235 consenting study participants, 711 (57.6%) were male, 510 (41.3%) were HBeAg positive at cohort entry and 43 (3.5%) developed HCC. The HBV genotype was known for 1142 (92.5%) persons (13.5% A, 3.9% B, 6.7% C, 56.9% D, 19.0% F). The HCC incidence/1000 person-years of follow-up for genotypes A, B, C, D and F was 1.3, 0, 5.5, 0.4 and 4.2 respectively. Compared with persons with HBV genotype B/D infection, the HCC risk was higher for persons with genotypes A [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.9, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-13.74], C (aOR: 16.3, 95% CI: 5.20-51.11) and F (aOR: 13.9, 95% CI: 5.30-36.69).Conclusion:HBV genotype is independently associated with HCC risk. AN persons with genotypes A, C and F are at higher risk compared with genotypes B or D.
