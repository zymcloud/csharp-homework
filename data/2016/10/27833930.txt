Background:Our objective was to study the prognostic value of liver stiffness (LS) in HIV-infected patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC).Methods:We analyzed HIV-infected patients with compensated CHC and at least 1 determination of LS. The primary outcome was the occurrence of liver-related events (LRE), namely, decompensation or hepatocellular carcinoma, whichever occurred first. We selected patients without sustained viral response (SVR) or end-of-treatment response (ETR) during follow-up and allocated them to an estimation cohort (EC) and a validation cohort (VC).Results:The study population comprised 1292 patients. After a median follow-up of 5.8 years, 90 patients experienced LRE and 73 died. In the subgroup of 957 patients without SVR or ETR, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) (95% confidence interval [CI]) of LS for prediction of LRE in the EC (n = 634) and the VC (n = 323) were 0.87 and 0.88, respectively. The best cutoff value of LS to rule out LRE in the EC was 12 kPa, with a negative predictive value of 98.3% in the EC and 98.2% in the VC. Per each 1 kPa and 5 kPa increase above 12 kPa, the hazard ratio of LRE (taking into account death as a competing risk) was 1.07 (95% CI, 1.05-1.08) and 1.38 (95% CI, 1.31-1.46), respectively.Conclusions:Liver stiffness is very accurate for predicting LRE in coinfected patients.
