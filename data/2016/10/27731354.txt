A apoptotic model was established based on the results of five hepatocellular carcinoma cell (HCC) lines irradiated with carbon ions to investigate the coupling interplay between apoptotic signaling and morphological and mechanical cellular remodeling. The expression levels of key apoptotic proteins and the changes in morphological characteristics and mechanical properties were systematically examined in the irradiated HCC lines. We observed that caspase-3 was activated and that the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was significantly increased over time. Cellular morphology and mechanics analyses indicated monotonic decreases in spatial sizes, an increase in surface roughness, a considerable reduction in stiffness, and disassembly of the cytoskeletal architecture. A theoretical model of apoptosis revealed that mechanical changes in cells induce the characteristic cellular budding of apoptotic bodies. Statistical analysis indicated that the projected area, stiffness, and cytoskeletal density of the irradiated cells were positively correlated, whereas stiffness and caspase-3 expression were negatively correlated, suggesting a tight coupling interplay between the cellular structures, mechanical properties, and apoptotic protein levels. These results help to clarify a novel arbitration mechanism of cellular demise induced by carbon ions. This biomechanics strategy for evaluating apoptosis contributes to our understanding of cancer-killing mechanisms in the context of carbon ion radiotherapy.
