The authors present a case of a 38-year-old man with a 4-hour history of accidental removal of a jejunostomy balloon-tube replacement (PEG-18-BRT-S, Cook Medical Inc., Bloomington, USA). The patient had undergone a direct percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (DPEJ) ten months ago, before chemoradiotherapy treatment for an esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (uT3N2cM0). His past medical condition included alcoholic liver disease and distal gastrectomy from a life-threatening duodenal bleeding ulcer.
