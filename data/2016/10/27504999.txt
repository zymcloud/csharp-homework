Globally, over half a billion people are persistently infected with hepatitis B (HBV) and/or hepatitis C viruses. Chronic HBV and HCV infection frequently lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Co-infections with hepatitis delta virus (HDV), a subviral satellite requiring HBV for its propagation, accelerates the progression of liver disease toward HCC. The mechanisms by which these viruses cause malignant transformation, culminating in HCC, remain incompletely understood, partially due to the lack of adequate experimental models for dissecting these complex disease processes in vivo.
