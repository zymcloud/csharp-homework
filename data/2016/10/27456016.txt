Background:Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) and conventional hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) share the same American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging. The worse survival with HCC is attributed to the underlying cirrhosis.The aim of this study was to compare stage-matched prognosis after resection of FLC and non-cirrhotic HCC.Methods:Outcomes after resection of 65 consecutive patients with FLC and 158 non-cirrhotic patients with HCC were compared. Patients were staged according to the 7th edition AJCC staging.Results:The AJCC stage distributions for FLC and HCC demonstrated a predominance of stage IV disease in FLC and stage I in HCC (FLC stage I-23 %, II-15 %, III-15 %, IV-46 % vs. HCC stage I-42 %, II-32 %, III-20 %, IV-6 %, p Conclusions:When compared to non-cirrhotic HCC, patients with FLC are not adequately stratified by AJCC staging with respect to RFS. Our results support classifying lymph node metastases in FLC as regional disease, rather than systemic disease. Important prognostic factors in FLC are the number of tumors and vascular invasion.
