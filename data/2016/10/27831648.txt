Objective:This work aimed to identify disturbed pathways in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on individualized pathway aberrance score (iPAS) method.Materials and methods:First of all, gene expression data and pathway data were recruited and preprocessed. Next, iPAS method, which contained three steps (gene-level statistics based on average Z algorithm, pathway-level statistics and pathway significant analysis based on Wilcoxon-test), was performed to identify differential pathways in HCV-cirrhosis with HCC. Then, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was conducted based on the genes enriched in the differential pathways. Finally, topological analysis of the PPI network combined with cancer genes was conducted to identify hub disease genes.Results:After a systematic operation by the iPAS method, a total of 34 differential pathways were identified (p-value Conclusions:The altered pathways and several key genes identified by this method were predicted to play important roles in HCV-cirrhosis with HCC and might be potentially novel predictive and prognostic markers for HCV-cirrhosis with HCC.
