Purpose:The aim of this study was to assess the detection rate of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in arterial phase using multiarterial CAIPIRINHA-Dixon-TWIST-VIBE (MA-CDT-VIBE).Materials and methods:Fifty-eight patients with possible recurrence of HCC were retrospectively included in this cohort. Patients were scanned with a prototype dynamic contrast-enhanced breath-hold CDT-VIBE sequence, which included 6 arterial subphases with a temporal resolution of 2.64 seconds on a 3 T scanner. Absence and presence of recurrence was documented by consensus of 2 experienced radiologists using magnetic resonance imaging multiphase imaging and follow-up evaluation. The third of 6 arterial subphases was considered the equivalent-to-conventional single arterial phase from the contrast bolus timing perspective. The detection rate of recurrent HCCs in arterial phase by another 2 independent experienced readers was compared for all 6 arterial subphases of MA-CDT-VIBE and the equivalent-to-conventional single arterial phase. Interreader agreement was also calculated.Results:Of the 55 patients reviewed, 46 patients (201 lesions) had recurrent HCC and 9 patients had no recurrence. There was an excellent interreader agreement for both MA-CDT-VIBE (Îº = 1.000, P Conclusions:Compared with the equivalent-to-conventional single arterial phase, MA-CDT-VIBE with 6 arterial subphases demonstrated higher detection rate of recurrent HCCs in arterial phase and provided a wider arterial observation window, especially for recurrent HCCs less than 2 cm in diameter.
