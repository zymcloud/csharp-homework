Nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (ENTPD1/CD39) is the rate-limiting enzyme in a cascade leading to the generation of immunosuppressive adenosine and plays an important role in tumor progression. This study aimed to evaluate the expression of CD39 and CD39Foxp3 regulatory T cells (Tregs) and to determine their prognostic role in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after radical resection.Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and double IHC were used to analyze CD39 expression or the expression of CD39 and Foxp3 in a cohort of 324 HCC patients who underwent curative resection. The quantification of CD39 expression levels was determined using a computerized image analysis system and was evaluated by mean optical density (MOD), which corresponded to the positive staining intensity of CD39. The number of positive Foxp3 cells and both CD39 and Foxp3 positive cells in each 1-mm-diameter cylinder were counted under high-power magnification (Ã—400). The "minimum P value" approach was used to obtain the optimal cutoff value for the best separation between groups of patients in relation to time to recurrence (TTR) or overall survival (OS). The expression of CD39 in HCC cell lines with stepwise metastatic potential and in human umbilical vein endothelial cells was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. The SPSS 17.0 statistical package was used for statistics.CD39 was principally expressed on vascular endothelial cells, macrophagocytes, Tregs, and tumor cells in HCC. Compared with paired peritumoral tissues, tumoral tissues had a significantly higher expression level of CD39 (P
