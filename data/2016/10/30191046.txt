Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent and deadly malignancies worldwide. Studies are urgently needed on its molecular pathogenesis and biological characteristics. Dysregulation of fatty acid (FA) metabolism, in which aberrant activation of oncogenic signaling pathways alters the expression and activity of lipid-metabolizing enzymes, is an emerging hallmark of cancer cells, and it may be involved in HCC development and progression. The current review summarizes what is known about dysregulated FA metabolism in HCC and pathways through which this dysregulation may regulate HCC survival and growth. Our understanding of dysregulated FA metabolism and associated signaling pathways may contribute to the development of novel and efficient antitumor approaches for patients with HCC.
