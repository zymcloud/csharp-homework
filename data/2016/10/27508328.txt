Background:The surgical therapy of choice for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is liver transplantation (LT) or hepatic resection, although only a small percentage of patients can undergo these procedures. Microwave thermal ablation (MWTA) can be an effective alternative treatment for HCC that complicates a cirrhotic liver disease, either as a final procedure or for downstaging patients on the waiting list for LT, or in combination with resective surgery to achieve oncological radicality.Objective:The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate experience with the laparoscopic approach of MWTA at our center.Materials and methods:In a cohort of 35 consecutive patients undergoing MWTA with laparoscopic approach between January, 2013 and May, 2016, we reviewed the demographic data, the Barcelona clinic liver cancer stage, the severity of cirrhotic liver disease, the size of the ablated lesion, the duration of the procedure, and complications occurring within 90 days of surgery.Results:MWTA was performed by applying one to three hepatic parenchymal insertions (mean 1.8) per patient. The mean duration of surgery was 163 Â± 18 minutes. There was no blood loss in any of the procedures. Complete necrosis on CT scan was achieved in 26/35 patients (75%). The mean hospital stay was 4.6 (range 2-7) days; major complications were postablation syndrome in 2/35 (5.7%), peritoneal fluid in 4/35 (11.4%), and transient jaundice in 1/35 (2.8%) patients. There was no mortality.Conclusions:Laparoscopic MTWA is a safe and effective treatment for unresectable HCC and when a percutaneous procedure is not feasible.
