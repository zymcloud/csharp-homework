Purpose:This study examines safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of chemoembolization with loadable microspheres ≤100 μm for hepatocellular carcinoma.Materials and methods:A pilot safety study was performed in 19 patients with size and dose escalation and then 52 patients were enrolled prospectively and randomly assigned to chemoembolization with TANDEM™ loaded with 150 or 100 mg of doxorubicin.Results:The mean diameter of the tumors was 7.28 ± 2.09 cm (range 4-12) and distribution dominant/multiple 51.9/48.1 %. Child A/B distribution was 32/20 (61.5/38.5 %) and etiology HBV/HCV/HBV/HCV-hemochromatosis was 61.6/9.6/9.6/15.4 %. Twenty-five patients were assigned in the low and 27 in the high loading group. There was 1.92 % thirty-day mortality due to lesion rupture. Biliary damage was seen in 3 patients (5.7 %) in the high loading. Mean maximum plasma concentration of doxorubicin C max ± SD was 284.9 ± 276.2 ng/mL for the high and 108.5 ± 77.6 ng/mL for the low loading (p Conclusion:Initial evidence shows that (a) TANDEM™ achieves high rates of local response and mid-term survival, (b) high loading provides no clinical benefit and is associated with biliary toxicity.
