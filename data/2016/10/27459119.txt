The combination of Western medicine and Chinese prescription is the most effective tumor therapy in China market. In our previous report, a new prescription composed by Rhizoma Paridis and Rhizoma Curcuma longa called LouHuang preparation (LH) shows good antitumor activity. 10-Hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) as a chemotherapy agent is used for treatment of solid tumors in clinical. In this study, we investigated the combination effect of LH and HCPT on H22 tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. In vitro test, combination of LH and HCPT presented a synergistic effect on H22 cancer cells. Because of the toxicity of HCPT in normal dosage with intraperitoneal injection, we chose a low dose in the study. LH increased the tumor inhibition rate of HCPT in H22 tumor model from 39% to 55% and showed additive effect by the q value method. The concentration of HCPT in plasma was detected by HPLC-FLD method and increased from 60 to 75ng/mL when combined with LH. For the absorption research, LH significantly enhanced the absorption transport of HCPT from 7019.04 to 11569.02ng/cm2, while improved the permeation flux (F) and apparent permeability (Papp) of HCPT from 10.62 to 21.47 (ng/cm2min) and 9.92-20.07 (10-6cm/s), respectively. The study indicates that LH could boost the efficacy of HCPT by increasing the plasma concentration regardless of the formulation and combined administration of HCPT and LH might be used as an adjuvant drug for treatment of liver cancer.
