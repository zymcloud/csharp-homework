Background:Repeat liver resection is effective for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (rHCC). This study aimed to determine the outcomes of laparoscopic repeat liver resection (LRLR) for rHCC.Methods:Eight consecutive patients who underwent LRLR for rHCC were retrospectively reviewed.Results:Six patients had previous open and two had laparoscopic liver resection (LLR). There was one (12.5%) open conversion for bleeding and one (12.5%) post-operative morbidity. The median tumour size was 24 mm (range: 8-50 mm). LRLR was performed for rHCC in the ipsilateral lobe as compared to the index surgery in 4/8 (50%) patients. Five of eight (62.5%) patients had rHCC in the difficult posterosuperior segments. Six patients had previous open LR, and two had previous LLR. One patient (patient 4) had two prior open LR for rHCC, and LRLR was performed for the second recurrence. The median duration from the first surgery to LRLR was 29 months (range: 6-109 months). The median post-operative stay was 3.5 days. All eight patients had R0 resections, and at a median follow-up of 7.5 months, all patients were disease-free.Conclusion:LRLR for rHCC is feasible and safe. This can be performed even for patients with previous open liver resections, cirrhosis, lesions in the posterosuperior segments and prior LR of the ipsilateral lobe. LRLR for rHCC is feasible and safe in highly selected patients.
