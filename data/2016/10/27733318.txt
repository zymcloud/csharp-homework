Background:Chemoembolization with doxorubucin-eluting beads (DEB) has been used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) since 2007. This study compared the efficacy and survival between transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with DEB and conventional approach (cTACE) in HCC treatment.Methods:This retrospective case-control study compared the overall survival and tumor response of HCC patients to cTACE (n=190) and DEB (n=143) by the reassessment of computed tomography and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Multivariate analysis was used to determine the factors affecting tumor response.Results:The median post-treatment to pre-treatment AFP level was 0.8 for a DEB session (n=258) and 1.0 for a cTACE session (n=452), showing a significantly greater decrease in AFP after DEB (P80 months after the first TACE session in the DEB group.Conclusion:DEB is a safe alternative to cTACE in HCC patients with better therapeutic efficacy.
