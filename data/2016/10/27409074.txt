Background:The aim of this study was to determine the long-term efficacy of nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) and low-dose hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) combination treatment for preventing post-transplant hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence.Methods:A total of 296 patients with HBV-associated liver disease who underwent liver transplantation (LT) were enrolled. A combination of a daily NA and low-dose HBIG was used after LT.Results:The median follow-up period was 46 months. HBV recurrence occurred in eight patients. The cumulative probability of HBV recurrence at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years was 1%, 3%, 3%, and 4%, respectively. Seven were on lamivudine (LMV) or adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), or LMV and ADV and HBIG combination treatment and one entecavir (ETV) and HBIG. With Cox regression analysis, HBV recurrence was determined to be associated with the presence of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) prior to LT (HR: 12.3, P=.02). Overall, 44 patients died. Survival was significantly better in the ETV or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and HBIG group than the other group (P<.001).Conclusion:The combination of ETV or TDF and low-dose HBIG achieved a more favorable prophylaxis against HBV recurrence after LT. The presence of HCC prior to LT was associated with post-transplant HBV recurrence.
