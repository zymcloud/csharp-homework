Solitary renal tumours are often primary clear cell carcinoma. A 48-year-old man with chronic hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and orthotropic liver transplant 6 years ago presented with a solitary left renal mass. Histology revealed metastatic HCC of the left kidney with extensive reactive changes in lymph nodes. Interestingly, biopsy of the transplanted liver showed no evidence of HCC recurrence. Metastatic disease to the kidney often disseminate locally through transcelomic spread, or hematogenous affecting both kidneys. It is important to recognize extrahepatic HCC metastases to the contralateral kidney, especially in patients with active hepatitis, and radical lymph node clearance is needed.
