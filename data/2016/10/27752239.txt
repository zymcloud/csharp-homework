Aim:This study was aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficiency of a non-virus based specific chimeric multi-domain DNA transferred with apoptin in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HepG-2 cells in vitro and in mice H22 cells in vivo.Methods:We firstly constructed the multi-domain recombinant chimeric proteins based on recombinant proteins [G (yeast GAL4), NG (none GAL4), TG (GAL4 + Tat protein) and TNG (Tat protein)] and pUAS-Apoptin plasmid, and transfected them into human HepG-2 cells. The antitumor effect of this multi-domain recombinant chimeric proteins to HCC cells were detected by MTT assay, AO/EB staining, DAPI staining and Annexin V assay. In order to find the pathway of cell apoptosis, the Caspase (1, 3, 6 and 8) activity was detected. We then constructed the H22 liver cancer mice model and analyzed the anti-tumor rate and mice survival rate after treated with G/pUAS-Apoptin NG/pUAS-Apoptin TG/pUAS-Apoptin, and TNG/pUAS-Apoptin.Results:MTT results showed that the Tat protein (TG and TNG) significantly induced cell death in a time dependent manner. AO/EB, DAPI, Annexin V and Caspases assay results indicated that the Caspase 1, 3, 6 and 8 were highly expressed in TG/pUAS-Apoptin, and TNG/pUAS-Apoptin treated mouse groups. The antitumor rate and survival rate in TG/pUAS-Apoptin, and TNG/pUAS-Apoptin treated mouse groups were higher than in the other groups.Conclusion:The Tat-apoptin is a potential anti-tumor agent for HCC treatment with remarkable anti-tumor efficacy and high safety based on non-virus gene transfer system. The anti-tumor function may be associated with high expression of Caspase 1, 3, 6 and 8.
