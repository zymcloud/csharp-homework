Ecosystems are exposed to a wide variety of individual substances, including at the nano-scale; and the potential adverse effects of their interactions are an increasing concern. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) at a no-observed-effect concentration modulate the cytotoxicity of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) in the fish hepatoma cell line PLHC-1 after 48 h of exposure and the contribution of the released ions to these effects. Cells were exposed to 50-nm CuNPs (0.39-25.0 µg/mL), alone or in combination with ZnONPs (25 nm or 100 nm), at 6.25 µg/mL. Cells were exposed to suspensions of NPs or to their supernatants, as well as to their combinations. The effects on cell viability were assessed through cytotoxicity assays. Changes in cell morphology and metal internalization were also evaluated. The cytotoxicity exerted by CuNPs was enhanced in the presence of nontoxic concentrations of ZnONPs. On the contrary, Zn ions protected the cell line from the CuNP toxicity, this effect being related to an increase in the intracellular levels of Zn. This increase of metal was not observed in cells exposed to both ZnONPs and CuNPs, even when they were visualized inside the cell. The results indicated that the internalization of ZnONPs, but not the Zn ions, was responsible for the enhanced toxicity of the CuNPs. Environ Toxicol Chem 2016;35:2562-2570. © 2016 SETAC.
