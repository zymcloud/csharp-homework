We describe and assess our technique of preceding diaphragm resection and partial mobilization of the hepatic right lobe to treat a huge hepatic tumor with diaphragm invasion. The right hepatic artery and portal vein were divided at the hepatic hilum, and the mesenteries were then dissected with a vessel sealing device (LigaSure Impactâ„¢). The invaded diaphragm was dissected roundly using a vessel sealing device and the right lobe was partially mobilized. A soft catheter was then passed along the anterior aspect of the retrohepatic inferior vena cava and the liver parenchyma was dissected via a liver hanging maneuver. We performed eight hepatectomies using this technique. The median blood loss was 532.5 ml and the mean excised liver weight was 1859 g. Our results demonstrate the safety and efficiency of the preceding diaphragm resection and partial mobilization technique using a vessel sealing device for right hepatectomy to resect a very large tumor with diaphragm invasion.
