Background:Some biliary complications after liver transplantation (LT) are difficult to manage by endoscopic or radiologic intervention alone. In these cases, percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy (PTCS) can be used as an adjuvant option.Methods:Patients who underwent PTCS for post-LT biliary complications between August 1992 and January 2016 were retrospectively reviewed.Results:Fifteen patients underwent PTCS for post-LT biliary complications. The median age at LT was 47 years and 11 patients were male. Indications for LT were as follows: decompensated liver cirrhosis (n = 9), hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 5), and acute fulminant liver failure (n = 1). Single living donor was common (n = 11) and duct-to-duct anastomosis was performed in 11 patients. The median age at PTCS was 52 years and indications for PTCS were as follows: intrahepatic duct stone (n = 10), common bile duct stone (n = 1), biliary cast (n = 1), and biliary stricture (n = 3). There were no significant PTCS-related morbidity and mortality. However, four patients (26.7%) needed additional radiologic intervention (n = 2) or surgery (n = 2) after PTCS.Conclusions:Percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy in conjunction with endoscopic and radiologic interventions can aid in managing post-LT biliary complications and avoiding reoperation.
