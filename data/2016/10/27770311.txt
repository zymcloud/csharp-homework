Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) as a novel molecular species may have significant and comprehensive influences on the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We recently characterized snoRNA transcriptome signatures in HCC tissues by small RNA sequencing and found that small nucleolar RNA 78 (SNORD78) was associated with HCC. However, little is known about the pathological role of SNORD78 in HCC patients. This study aimed to profile SNORD78 expression signature and then to explore the pathogenesis of SNORD78 in HCC. The real-time PCR results showed that SNORD78 was greatly upregulated in HCC tissues than adjacent noncancerous tissues (p = 0.004). Correlation analysis showed that high-level expression of SNORD78 was notably associated with tumor number (single vs. multiply, p = 0.02), stage (I∼II vs. III∼IV, p = 0.014), and distant metastasis (absent vs. present, p = 0.01) in HCC patients. Univatiate and multivariate analyses showed that SNORD78 was a significant prognostic predictor for overall survival and recurrence-free survival of HCC patients (hazard ratio = 1.375, 95 % CI = 1.125-1.680, p = 0.002; hazard ratio = 1.418, 95 % CI = 1.201-1.675, p
