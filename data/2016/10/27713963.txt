Tocotrienol (T3) has recently gained increasing interest due to its anti-cancer effect. Here, we investigated the modulating effect of δ and γ T3 on the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK oncogenic upstream signaling pathway in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. The results indicated that T3 regulated the upstream signaling cascades of this pathway.
