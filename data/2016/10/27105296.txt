Background & aims:The discontinuation rules of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for patients who were assessed as progressive disease (PD) but stage progression-free (SP-free: still belongs to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer B) after TACE are unclear. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the PD-pattern on the survival of these patients retreated with TACE.Methods:In total, 115 consecutive patients who were assessed as PD but SP-free after TACE and then underwent at least one subsequent TACE session were included. Sixty patients were assessed as PD with target lesion progression (TP), and 55 patients were assessed as PD with target lesion non-progression (TNP). Survival and treatment-related adverse events were compared between the two groups. Additional external validation was performed using a data set (n = 103) from another institution.Results:Patients with TNP had significantly longer median post-progression survival (PPS) than those with TP (21.0 vs. 11.9 months, P = 0.004). After TACE retreatment, the incidence of liver dysfunction was significantly higher for patients with TP than for patients with TNP (45% vs. 20%, P = 0.031). In the multivariate analysis, the target lesion response was one of the most significant prognostic factors for PPS (HR = 2.01; 95% confidence interval: 1.23-3.27; P = 0.005). The findings were supported by an independent external cohort.Conclusions:Compared to patients with TNP, patients with TP might exhibit no improvement in survival and even present damaged liver function after retreatment with TACE. Target lesion response is useful as a clinical decision for repeated TACE in these patients.
