Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has mostly been used in hypervascular tumours such as hepatocellular carcinoma, and may be an effective palliative treatment in patients with metastatic liver cancer. Our goal is to determine whether TACE increases overall survival (OS) of in patients with liver metastases. The retrospective cohort study included 171 patients with liver metastases diagnosed between 2001 and 2015. OS was compared between the TACE and non-TACE groups after propensity score matching to reduce the effects of selection bias and potential confounders. Multivariate analysis was conducted to confirm the confounding factors with OS. After excluding 43 patients, 128 patients were analysed and among thses 64 patients (50%) were included in the TACE group. In the propensity score matched cohort (42 pairs), the OS was non-significantly longer in the TACE group than in the non-TACE group (p = 0.789). Multivariate analysis revealed that international normalized ratio (INR) (HR 0.058, 95%CI: [0.005, 0.681]; p = 0.023) and Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) (HR 3.054, 95%CI: [1.418, 6.579]; p = 0.004) were independent risk factors for OS in patients with unresectable liver metastases. There were no significant differences in patients with unresectable liver metastases with or without TACE. INR and RFA can significantly affect OS in patients with unresectable liver metastases.
