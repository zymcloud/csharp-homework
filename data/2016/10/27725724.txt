The recent identification of "Side Population" (SP) cells in a number of unrelated human cancers has renewed interests in the hypothesis of cancer stem cells. Here we isolated SP cells from HepG2 cells and 18 of the 21 fresh hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue samples. These SP cells have higher abilities of forming spheroids, invasion and migration. Tumors could generate only from SP, not non-SP (NSP), cells in a low dose of subcutaneous injection to the NOD/SCID mice (5 Ã— 102 cells/mouse). The mRNA microarray analysis of the SP vs. NSP cells isolated from HepG2 cells revealed that the SP cells express higher levels of pluripotency- and stem cell-associated transcription factors including Klf4, NF-Ya, SALL4 and HMGA2. Some of the known hepatobiliary progenitor/stem cell markers, such as Sox9 was also up-regulated. RT-qPCR analysis of the gene expression between SP cells and NSP cells isolated from both HepG2 cells and HCC tissue samples showed that most of the tested mRNAs' changes were in consistent with the microarray data, including the general progenitor/stem cells markers such as Klf4, NF-Ya, SALL4 and HMGA2, which were up-regulated in SP cells. Our data indicates that HCC cancer stem cells exist in HepG2 and HCC fresh tissue samples and can be isolated by SP assay.
