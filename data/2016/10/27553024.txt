Paraoxonase (PON) enzymes possess antioxidant properties and protect against cardiovascular diseases. As a member of PON family, PON3 is primarily synthesized in the liver and poorly investigated. This study aimed to examine the expression of PON3 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and investigate the clinical significance and biological function of PON3 in HCC patients. We first analyzed PON3 expression in 50 paired HCC samples (HCC tissues vs matched para-cancerous tissues) and 160 clinical HCC specimens by using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Our results showed that the expression of PON3 was downregulated in HCC and significantly associated with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, tumor size, and tumor number. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses showed that PON3 was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) and time to recurrence (TTR). Finally, we aimed to reveal the biological function of PON3 in HCC growth and metastasis, and our results showed that overexpression of PON3 potently inhibited growth and metastasis of HCC. Collectively, our study demonstrated that PON3 exhibited tumor-suppressive effects toward HCC and it might serve as a novel prognostic marker in HCC.
