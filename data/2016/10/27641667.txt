MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the pathogenesis of many types of cancers by negatively regulating gene expression at posttranscriptional level. Here, we found that miR-361-5p is down-regulated in 135 patients with HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Moreover, the expressions of miR-361-5p were highly correlated with VEGFA in these HCC patients. Further, CCK-8 proliferation assay indicated that miR-361-5p mimics inhibited the cell proliferation of HepG2 and SNU-398 HCC cells. Transwell assay showed that miR-361-5p mimics inhibited the invasion and migration of HepG2 and SNU-398 HCC cells. Luciferase assays revealed that miR-361-5p directly bound to the 3'untranslated region of VEGFA, and western blotting showed that miR-361-5p inhibited the expression of VEGFA. Generally, this study indicated that miR-361-5p is down-regulated in HCC and inhibits proliferation and invasion of HCC cell lines via VEGFA. In future, miR-361-5p will be a potential therapeutic agent for HCC.
