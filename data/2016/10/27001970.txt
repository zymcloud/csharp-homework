Deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) and c-Myc (Myc) contributes to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression, but how miRNAs and Myc regulate each other in hepatocarcinogenesis is still poorly understood. Using a functional screen, we identified miR-129-5p as a miRNA that inhibits HCC cell growth. miR-129-5p targets the mitochondrial matrix protein pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), which leads to decreased phosphorylation of the E1Î± subunit of pyruvate dehyrogenase (PDH) complex, inhibition of glycolysis, retarded tumor growth, and impaired lung colonization. Enforced expression of PDK4 refractory to inhibition by miR-129-5p rescued all of these phenotypes. Targeting PDK4 by shRNA recapitulated the effects caused by miR-129-5p. miR-129-5p is transcriptionally repressed by a complex comprised of Myc, histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), and enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 (EZH2). Levels of miR-129-5p negatively correlated with clinical stages in human HCC. Restoring miR-129-5p expression suppressed the diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in mice. Thus, we concluded that miR-129-5p, which is a negative target of Myc, blocks glycolysis to retard hepatocarcinogenesis via targeting PDK4. The critical link between miR-129-5p and PDK4 in the progression of HCC suggests potential points of therapeutic intervention for this disease.
