Purpose:The purpose of this study is to investigate dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and plasma cytokines and angiogenic factors (CAFs) as pharmacodynamic and prognostic biomarkers of bevacizumab monotherapy in colorectal cancer with liver metastasis (CRCLM).Materials and methods:From July 2011 to March 2012, 28 patients with histologically confirmed CRCLM received bevacizumab monotherapy followed by combined FOLFOX therapy. The mean age of the patients was 57 years (range, 30 to 77 years). DCE-MRI (Ktransand IAUC60) was performed at baseline, first follow-up (3 days after bevacizumab monotherapy), and second follow-up (3 days after combined therapy). CAF levels (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], placental growth factor [PlGF], and interleukin-8) were assessed on the same days. Progression-free survival (PFS) time distributions were summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank tests.Results:The median PFS period was 11.2 months. Ktrans, IAUC60, VEGF, and PlGF values on the first follow-up day were significantly different compared with baseline values. No differences were observed on the second follow-up day. A > 40% decrease in Ktrans from baseline to first follow-up was associated with a longer PFS (hazard ratio, 0.349; 95% confidence interval, 0.133 to 0.912; p=0.032). Changes in CAFs did not show correlation with PFS time.Conclusion:DCE-MRI parameters and CAFs are pharmacodynamic biomarkers of bevacizumab for CRCLM. In our study, change in Ktrans at 3 days after bevacizumab monotherapy was a favorable prognostic factor; however, the value of CAFs as a prognostic biomarker was not found.
