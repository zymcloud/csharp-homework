Cyclase-associated protein 2 (CAP2) protein is reported to be upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, data regarding its expression pattern and clinical relevance in breast cancer are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate CAP2 expression and its prognostic significance in breast cancer. CAP2 expression at the mRNA and protein levels was examined by real‑time quantitative-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting in 10 paired breast cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. The expression level of CAP2 protein in normal breast epithelial cells and breast cancer cell lines was quantified by western blotting. CAP2 protein expression was analyzed in paraffin‑embedded breast cancer samples, paired adjacent non‑tumor and normal breast tissues by immunohistochemical analysis. Statistical analyses were also performed to evaluate the clinicopathological significance of CAP2 expression. The results showed that the expression of CAP2 mRNA and protein was higher in breast cancer than that noted in the adjacent normal tissues in 10 paired samples. The expression level of CAP2 protein in breast cancer cell lines was higher than that in normal breast epithelial cells. In paraffin‑embedded tissue samples, the expression of CAP2 was higher in breast cancer than that found in the adjacent non‑cancerous tissues and normal breast tissues. Compared with the adjacent non‑cancerous tissues, overexpression of CAP2 was detected in 29.4% (37/126) of the patients. Overexpression of CAP2 was significantly associated with progesterone receptor (PR) expression (p
