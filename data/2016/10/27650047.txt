Dysregulation of microRNAs has been demonstrated to contribute to malignant progression of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MiR-24-3p was previously reported to be significantly upregulated in HCC. However, the potential role and mechanism of action of miR-24-3p in the initiation and progression of HCC remain largely unknown. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that miR-24-3p was significantly upregulated in HCC tumor tissues compared with nontumor tissues. The cell viability, colony formation assay, and tumorigenicity assays in nude mice showed that miR-24-3p could enhance HCC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Metallothionein 1M was verified as an miR-24-3p target gene by using dual-luciferase reporter assays, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting, which was involved in miR-24-3p regulated HCC cell growth. These results indicated that miR-24-3p plays an important role in the initiation and progression of HCC by targeting metallothionein 1M, and the miR-24-3p/metallothionein 1M pathway may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for HCC in the future.
