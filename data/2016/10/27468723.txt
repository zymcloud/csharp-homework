Dishevelled-Axin domain containing 1 (DIXDC1) is a DIX (Dishevelled-Axin) domain possessing protein that acts as a positive regulator of the Wnt pathway. Although DIXDC1 has been investigated in several cancers, it has not yet been studied in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of the current study was to investigate the expression pattern of DIXDC1 and assess the clinical significance of DIXDC1 expression in HCC patients. Data containing three independent investigations from Oncomine database demonstrated that DIXDC1 mRNA was downregulated in HCC compared with matched non-cancerous tissues. Similar results were also obtained in 25 paired HCC tissues and corresponding non-cancerous tissues by qPCR and Western blot analysis. Additionally, another independent set of 140 pairs of HCC specimens was evaluated for DIXDC1 expression by IHC and demonstrated that reduced expression of DIXDC1 in 50.7 % (71/140) of HCC tissues was significantly correlated with tumor size (p = 0.024), tumor differentiation (p
