Introduction:The long-term survival after hepatectomy for HCC remains unsatisfactory because of the high incidence of recurrence. The cumulative 5-year recurrence rate ranged from 60-100% in previous studies and majority of them remains intrahepatic recurrence. The therapeutic modalities commonly used for primary tumors, including surgical resection, liver transplantation, TACE, local ablative therapy and radiotherapy have been used to treat recurrent tumors in the liver remnant and the outcomes with the heterogeneous therapeutic options are reviewed. It is important to note that the level of evidence for most therapeutic options is limited to cohort investigations with few RCTs and most were limited due to enrollment of various tumor stages and did not compare treatment modalities for specific tumor stages.Areas covered:A literature search for recurrent HCC was performed using Medline and PubMed up to May 2016. Expert commentary: The long term survival results after re-resection for recurrent HCC were favourable and aggressive management of postoperative intrahepatic recurrence remains the most important strategy in prolonging the survival of patients after resection of HCC.
