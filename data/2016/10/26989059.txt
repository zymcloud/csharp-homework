Background:Morbidly obese patients are at risk for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and vitamin D deficiency (VDD). Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the progressive variant of NAFLD and can advance to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. We aimed to examine prevalence of liver fibrosis and its non-invasive predictors in bariatric patients with VDD (<75 nmol/l).Methods:Baseline liver biopsy of a randomized controlled trial was performed in 46 patients with omega loop gastric bypass. Clinical, laboratory, and histological data were examined and tested with univariate and multivariable analysis.Results:In total, 80 % were females, aged 42 (SD 13) years with BMI 44 (4) kg/m(2). Twenty-six percent had diabetes mellitus (DM) and 44 % metabolic syndrome (MeS). Seventy-two percent had NASH, 11 % simple steatosis, and 17 % normal liver. In total, 30 % demonstrated significant fibrosis (F â‰¥ 2) with 9 % of advanced (F3) and 4 % cirrhosis (F4). Increased stages of fibrosis were primarily associated with higher levels of HOMA2-insulin resistance (IR), procollagen type I propeptide (P1NP), lower osteocalcin, albumin-corrected calcium, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, male sex, and higher age. Other independent risk factors for advanced fibrosis were MeS (OR = 9.3 [0.99-87.5], p = 0.052) and DM (OR = 12.8 [1.2-137.4], p = 0.035). The fibrosis FIB-4 index <10.62 and NAFLD fibrosis score <-26.93 had a negative predictive value of 100 and 96 %, respectively.Conclusions:Liver fibrosis is frequent in morbidly obese patients with concurrent DM and/or MeS. Increased serum levels of IR, P1NP, lower osteocalcin, and VDD are clinically relevant predictors of fibrosis. Consequently, we suggest that patients with preoperative presence of these markers are at increased risk for liver fibrosis and should be monitored closely.
