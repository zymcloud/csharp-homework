With the increasing prevalence of living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT), the possible increased recurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in LDLT recipients in comparison with deceased-donor liver transplantation (DDLT) recipients has become a matter of debate. The aim of this review is to encompass current opinions and clinical reports regarding differences in the outcome, especially the recurrence of HCC, between LDLT and DDLT. In reviewing literatures, some studies reported increased recurrence rates among LDLT recipients, a majority of authors, including large database studies, reported comparable recurrence-free survival and recurrence rates between LDLT and DDLT. The postulated reasons for the increased recurrence in LDLT were the effect of graft regeneration on tumor progression, fast-tracking of patients into liver transplantation, and the more aggressive tumor characteristics in LDLT, however, many Asian LDLT centers have reported the comparable outcomes with those of DDLT in Western countries, even with the expanded criteria for HCC. In the absence of a prospective study regarding the use of LDLT versus DDLT for HCC patients, there is no evidence to support the higher HCC recurrence after LDLT than DDLT, and LDLT remains a reasonable treatment option for HCC patients with cirrhosis, especially in Asian countries where the number of deceased donor is scarce.
