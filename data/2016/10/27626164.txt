Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the most life-threatening human cancers in China. However, the pathogenesis of HCC development is still unclear. Here, we systemically analyzed liver tissues from different stages of HCC patients through 8-plex Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) approach. A total of 4,620 proteins were identified and 3,781 proteins were quantified. When T1, T2 and T3 tumor tissues were compared with T1 non-tumor cells, 330, 365 and 387 differentially expressed proteins were identified respectively. IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) analysis revealed that these differentially expressed proteins were involved in endothelial cancer, cell spreading, cell adhesion and cell movement of tumor cell lines pathway and so on. Further study showed that the filamin C (FLNC) protein was significantly overexpressed with the development of HCC, which might play an important role in HCC invasion and metastasis. These results were also confirmed with western blot (WB). The mRNA levels were significantly increased in 50 pairs of tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from TCGA database. The higher expression of FLNC in HCC might be a common phenomenon, thereby shedding new light on molecular mechanism and biomarker for the diagnosis purpose of HCC development.
