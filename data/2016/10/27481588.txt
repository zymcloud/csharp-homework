Background:There is no consensus on the leading causes of death among inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients.Aim:We present the results of an extended follow-up of the population-based Florence IBD cohort, including 689 ulcerative colitis and 231 Crohn's disease patients.Methods:The causes of death of cohort members were determined through linkage with the local mortality registry. We calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) by applying gender-, age- and calendar time-death rates to person-years at risk.Results:Ulcerative colitis patients had overall mortality comparable to the general population (SMR 0.99, 95%CI 0.85-1.14), though being at increased risk of dying from Hodgkin's disease (SMR 11.74, 95%CI 2.94-46.94), rectal cancer (SMR 3.69, 95%CI 1.66-8.22) and Alzheimer's disease (2.40, 95%CI 1.00-5.76). Crohn's disease patients had an increased overall mortality (SMR 1.79, 95%CI 1.39-2.27) and were at higher risk of dying from cancer (SMR 2.57, 95%CI 1.28-5.13) and non-cancer diseases of the respiratory system (SMR 2.51, 95%CI 1.05-6.04), brain cancer (SMR 6.26, 95%CI 1.57-25.02) and non-cancer diseases of the genitourinary system (SMR 4.38, 95%CI 1.10-17.52).Conclusions:IBD patients should be offered counselling on risk reduction strategies, as much of their mortality excess is potentially avoidable.
