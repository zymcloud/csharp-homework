Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and most patients who are diagnosed with HCC are ineligible for curative local therapy. The targeted agent sorafenib provides modest survival benefits in the setting of advanced disease. Novel systemic treatment options for HCC are sorely needed. In this review, we identify and categorize the drugs and targets that are in various phases of testing for use against HCC. We also focus on the potential for combining these agents with radiotherapy. This would help identify directions for future study that are likely to yield positive findings and improve outcomes for patients with HCC.
