Objectives:To investigate the survival benefit of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus Iodine125 seed implantation (TACE-Iodine125) in hepatitis B-related HCC patients with portal vein tumour thrombus (PVTT) and the underlying prognostic factors.Methods:A retrospective matched cohort study was performed on consecutive HCC patients with PVTT from January 2011 to June 2014. Seventy patients (TACE-Iodine125 group) who underwent TACE-Iodine125 were compared with a historical case-matched control group of 140 patients (TACE group) who received TACE alone. The survival of patients and the underlying prognostic factors were analysed.Results:The median survival times of the TACE-Iodine125 and TACE groups were 11.0 and 7.5 months, respectively (p Conclusions:TACE combined with Iodine125 seed implantation may be a good choice for selected HB-HCC patients with PVTT.Key points:• TACE-Iodine125 was more effective than TACE for patients with HCC-PVTT. • The TACE-Iodine125 procedure was safe. • TACE-Iodine125 was conditional for patients with HCC-PVTT. • TACE-Iodine125 resulted in a better PVTT response compared to TACE alone. • A good PVTT response is a favourable prognostic factor.
