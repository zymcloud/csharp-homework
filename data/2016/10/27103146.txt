Purpose:To evaluate the safety and efficacy of microwave (MW) ablation combined with transarterial chemoembolization in a single stage for the treatment of large (≥ 5 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:From March 2013 to January 2015, 66 patients (54 men and 12 women; mean age, 54 y; range, 29-83 y) with 72 large HCC lesions were included in this study. Eighteen (27.3%) had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer class B disease, and 48 (72.7%) had class C disease. Seventy-nine percent of patients (n = 52) had hepatitis B virus infection. The average tumor size was 9.0 cm ± 3.9, ranging from 5 to 19 cm. MW ablation was performed under ultrasound guidance, immediately followed by chemoembolization. Local tumor response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed.Results:The technique was successfully performed in all patients. Complete response (CR) was achieved in 28 cases (42.4%), and partial response (PR) was achieved in 34 cases (51.5%) at 1 month after the procedure. The objective response rate (ie, CR plus PR) was 93.9%. Median PFS and OS times were 9 months and 21 months, respectively. The 6-, 12-, and 18-month OS rates were 93.9%, 85.3%, and 66.6%, respectively. Hemorrhage was detected in three patients and arteriovenous fistula in two patients after MW ablation; all were promptly treated with embolization. There were no liver abscesses, bile-duct injuries, or other major procedure-related complications.Conclusions:MW ablation immediately followed by chemoembolization is safe and effective in the treatment of large HCC lesions.
