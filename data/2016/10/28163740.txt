Background:Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play important roles in hepatocarcinogenesis. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is involved in the repair of ROS. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is the "golden marker" for diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and one major shortcoming of its use is that it is insensitive for the early detection of HCC. Therefore, we evaluated serum SOD levels and their association with AFP in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC.Materials and methods:A total of 279 subjects were divided into three groups: 99 HBV patients with HCC, 73 HBV patients without HCC, and 107 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Serum levels of SOD were assayed using colorimetry, while AFP levels were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay.Results:A highly significant elevation was found in AFP in HBV-with HCC patients compared to HBV-without HCC patients and control subjects (P < 0.001). Alternatively, serum SOD levels were significantly decreased in patients with HCC compared to HBV patients without HCC and healthy controls (P < 0.001). Furthermore, serum SOD was negatively correlated with AFP (r = -0.505, P < 0.001) in HBV-with HCC patients.Conclusion:SOD and AFP might be simultaneously evaluated to improve the HCC detection rate.
