Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant cancers. To elucidate new regulatory mechanisms for heptocarcinogenesis, we investigated the regulation of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor encoded by CDKN1A, in HCC. The expression level of p21 is decreased with the progression of HCC. Luciferase assays with a luciferase-p21-3' UTR reporter and its serial deletions identified a 15-bp repressor element at the 3'-UTR of CDKN1A, which contains a binding site for miR-95-3p. Mutation of the binding site eliminated the regulatory effect of miR-95-3p on p21 expression. Posttranscriptional regulation of p21 expression by miR-95-3p is mainly on the protein level (suppression of translation). Overexpression of miR-95-3p in two different HCC cell lines, HepG2 and SMMC7721, significantly promoted cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and cell migration, whereas a miR-95-3p specific inhibitor decreased cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and cell migration. The effects of miR-95-3p on cellular functions were rescued by overexpression of p21. Overexpression of miR-95-3p promoted cell proliferation and tumor growth in HCC xenograft mouse models. Expression of miR-95-3p was significantly higher in HCC samples than in adjacent non-cancerous samples. These results demonstrate that miR-95-3p is a potential new marker for HCC and regulates hepatocarcinogenesis by directly targeting CDKN1A/p21 expression.
