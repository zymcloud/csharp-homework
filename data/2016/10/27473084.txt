Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of death in cancer patients worldwide. Understanding the molecular pathogenesis of HCC recurrence and chemoresistance is key to improving patients' prognosis. In this study, we report that downregulation of ASPP2, a member of the ankyrin-repeat-containing, SH3-domain-containing, and proline-rich-region-containing protein (ASPP) family, bestowed HCC cells with stem-like properties and resistance to chemotherapy, including the expansion of side population fractions, formation of hepatospheroids, expression of stem cell-associated genes, loss of chemosensitivity, and increased tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice. An expression profiling assay revealed that ASPP2 specifically repressed focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/Src/extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. ASPP2 does this by physically interacting with C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) and stimulating its kinase activity, which eventually leads to activator protein 1 (AP1)-mediated downregulation of Snail expression. In addition, pharmacologic inhibition of Src attenuated the effects of ASPP2 deficiency. Our findings present functional and mechanistic insight into the critical role of ASPP2 in the inhibition of HCC stemness and drug resistance and may provide a new strategy for therapeutic combinations to treat HCC.
