In the current era of therapy with direct-acting antiviral (DAAs) drugs, achievement of a sustained virological response (SVR) is achievable in â©¾90% of hepatitis C-infected patients. SVR benefits are well-recognized with reductions in rates of liver complications, hepatocellular carcinoma and mortality. Additional benefits include reduced morbidity related to extrahepatic and systemic manifestations of hepatitis C such as renal, dermatologic, and metabolic complications. However, not all patients will derive all of these benefits and monitoring for progression is necessary, especially in those with more advanced fibrosis. To maximize the health benefits of SVR, counseling patients on best means to maintain good liver health and prevent reinfection are also important.
