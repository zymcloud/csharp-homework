Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major human pathogen. In this study, we found that miR-204 and miR-1236 were down-regulated in HBV-producing cells, and each could suppress HBV replication. Using a bioinformatic approach and a reporter assay, we identified miR-1236, which can reduce HBV replication and protein production by directly targeting at HBV specific mRNA. In contrast, miR-204 was identified by a microarray approach, and had no effect on HBV RNA and protein production. Surprisingly, miR-204 could inhibit HBV pregenomic RNA encapsidation and capsid assembly. We further demonstrated that HBV suppressed miR-204 expression via activating a host transcription factor STAT3. We established a positive feed-forward loop between HBV, miR-204 and STAT3. Interestingly, miR-204 has been considered as a tumor suppressor in some literature. Since the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is significantly increased in chronic HBV patients, it is possible that chronic suppression of miR-204 by HBV contributes to HCC incidence. Both miR-204 and miR-1236 might be useful for developing new therapeutics against HBV.
