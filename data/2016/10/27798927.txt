Background:Inflammation-besed prognostic score including neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) have prognostic value in various malignancies.Patients and methods:We retrospectively investigated their prognostic value in 213 patients with living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Disease-free survival (DFS) following LDLT was calculated; NLR, PLR, PNI and mGPS values in patients with and without recurrence were compared. Risk factors for HCC recurrence were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:Both NLR and PLR were significantly increased in patients with recurrence. Multivariate analysis showed that des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) ≥300 mAU/ml, NLR ≥2.66, Conclusion:Preoperative NLR was an independent, inflammation-based prognostic marker of DFS and was predictive of recurrence following LDLT.
