Synchronous appearance of the primary gastrointestinal malignancies is rare. Coexistence of primary pancreatic and hepatocellular carcinoma as synchronous malignancy is even rarer. We report a case of such combination in a 50 year old female who presented with bleeding per rectum and while evaluating we found simultaneous appearance of primary malignancies of pancreas, liver and solitary colonic metastasis from the pancreas in the background of chronic calcific pancreatitis. To the best of our knowledge this combination of synchronous pancreatic and hepatocellular carcinoma and colonic metastasis from the pancreas is unique.
