Des-γ-carboxyprothrombin (DCP), an abnormal prothrombin produced in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), plays crucial roles in the progression of HCC. DCP binding to cellular mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-Met) is an initial event and consequently stimulates HCC through the increase of c-Met-Janus kinase 1- signal transducers and activators of transcription pathways. DCP stimulates HCC invasion through activation of matrix metalloproteinase via upregulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. DCP stimulates HCC angiogenesis through activation of the DCP-kinase insert domain receptor-phospholipaseC-γ-MAPK pathway. Identification of these pathways is important for designing the therapeutic strategy for HCC.
