Although miR-132 has been studied in various human tumors, few studies have investigated the role of miR-132 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study aimed to evaluate the associations between miR-132 and clinicopathological parameters, including recurrence, in patients with HCC. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect the expression levels of miR-132 in 95 cases of HCC and their corresponding non-cancerous liver tissues. Th e associations between miR-132 expression levels and clinicopathological characteristics, including recurrence, were investigated in patients with HCC. miR-132 expression levels were significantly reduced in HCC tissues, as compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues (1.9245±0.7564 vs. 2.7326±1.1475; Pr=-0.351; P<0.001), NM23 (r=-0.220; P=0.032), Ki-67 LI (r=-0.264; P=0.010) and tumor capsule (r=-0.207; P=0.044). Kaplan-Meier analysis with the log-rank test indicated an approximate difference of 8 months, although miR-132 may exhibit inferior values for the prediction of recurrence in HCC patients (50.95 vs. 58.68 months; P=0.512). Therefore, the findings of the present study indicated that miR-132 is downregulated in HCC and may serve as a tumor suppressor in its progression.
