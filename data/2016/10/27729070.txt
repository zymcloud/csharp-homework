Background:Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after liver and kidney transplantation has high mortality and causes diagnostic challenges. This study aims to describe the cytokine and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) profile in the GVHD after liver and kidney transplantation.Methods:A high-throughput detection kit was applied and altogether 18 different cytokines were tested simultaneously. GVHD patients included 23 post-liver transplantation patients; 22 post-renal transplantation patients; The control patients include 22 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients without transplantation and 20 healthy controls. Their HLA characters were compared.Results:The full spectrum of cytokines was present. The inflammatory markers were activated significantly in liver transplantation. The level of inflammatory markers in liver transplantation was higher than that in renal transplantation, HCC or healthy controls. GVHD was associated with the HLA characters; HLA characters are involved in liver GVHD occurrence and act as risk factors.Conclusion:Our findings confirmed that the inflammatory cytokines play a pathogenic role in GVHD and can be used as early diagnostic markers. The HLA mismatch acts as a risk factor in liver transplantation to predict GVHD occurrence.
