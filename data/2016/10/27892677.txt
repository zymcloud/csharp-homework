The CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) delta 32 allele results in a nonfunctional form of the chemokine receptor and has been implicated in a variety of immune-mediated diseases. CCR5Δ32 may also predispose one to chronic liver disease or be linked with resistance to HBV infection.This study was undertaken to investigate any association between CCR5 polymorphism with resistance to hepatitis B or susceptibility to HBV infection. A total of 812 Iranian individuals were enrolled into two groups: HBV infected cases (n=357), who were HBsAg-positive, and healthy controls (n=455). We assessed polymorphisms in the CCR5 gene using specific CCR5 oligonucleotide primers surrounding the breakpoint deletion. Genotype distributions of the HBV infected cases and healthy controls were determined and compared. The CCR5/CCR5 (WW) and CCR5/ CCR5Δ32 (W/D) genotypes were found in (98%) and (2%) of HBV infected cases, respectively. The CCR5 Δ32/ Δ32genotype was not found in HBV infected cases. Genotype distributions of CCR5 in healthy controls were W/W genotype in (87.3%), W/D genotype in (11.2%) and D/D genotype in (1.5%). Heterozygosity for CCR5/ CCR5Δ32 (W/D) in healthy controls was greater than in HBV infected cases (11.2% vs 2%, p
