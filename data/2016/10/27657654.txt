The emergence of fluorescent nanomaterials with excellent performances has triggered the development of fluorescence analysis technique, which possesses several advantages in the research and clinical applications. However, current strategies for fluorescence immunoassay usually involve the routine fluorophore-labeled antibody and/or awkward signal generation procedure that may not be available in conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) systems. Herein, we circumvent this problem by imparting an exquisite signal generation mechanism to commercially available alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-based ELISA platform and putting forward a conceptual fluorescent ELISA system based on an original ALP-enabled in situ synthesis of fluorescent nanomaterials. After adding target antigen, the presence of ALP labeled on antibody catalyzes the transformation of the substrate ascorbic acid 2-phosphate into ascorbic acid. Then the resultant ascorbic acid (i.e., ascorbate) interacts with amine-containing silane molecules (no fluorescence) to produce intense cyan fluorescent silicon nanoparticles. For the proof-of-concept, alpha-fetoprotein and human immunoglobulin G are chosen as the model antigen targets, and our proposed immunoassay (designated as the nanoparticles generation-based fluorescent ELISA) enables the detection with either fluorescence spectroscopy or naked-eye readout under the ultraviolet lamp. The convincing recognition mechanism and assay performance ensure fluorescent ELISA to quantitatively evaluate the alpha-fetoprotein level in serologic test and potentially apply in the clinic diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.
