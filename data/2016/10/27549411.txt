Background:Anti-viral therapy in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is associated with a reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) primary described in patients with cirrhosis.Aim:To examine the effects of treatment on HCC incidence in CHB with and without cirrhosis, after adjustment for background risks.Methods:A total of 2255 CHB patients from a US cohort (973 received anti-viral therapy) and 3653 patients from the community-based Taiwanese REVEAL-HBV study, none of whom received treatment. We used Cox proportional hazard models to calculate the risk of developing HCC after adjustment with the previously validated REACH-B risk score.Results:We found 273 incident cases of HCC. After adjustment, therapy lowered the risk of HCC development in the US treated cohort when compared to the US untreated cohort (HR 0.31; 95% CI: 0.15-0.66; P = 0.002). HCC risk reduction was also confirmed when compared to the REVEAL cohort (HR 0.22; 95% CI: 0.12-0.40; P 2000 IU/mL) and of even greater benefit to those with levels >200 000 IU/mL.Conclusion:After adjustment for background risk, anti-viral therapy was associated with a significant reduction in HCC incidence in both community and real-life clinical cohorts, including in those patients previously thought to be at low risk.
