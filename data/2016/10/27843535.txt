The current review explores the role of emerging molecular contributing factors in liver carcinogenesis on top of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Here we will try to discuss the role genetic and epigenetic factors in pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Understanding the role of these factors will help in discovering the mystery of liver carcinogenesis on top of chronic HCV infection. Moreover, use of the studied molecular factors will provide the hepatologists with tailored diagnostic promising biomarkers and flatten the way for establishment of emerging molecular treatment based on exploring the molecular subscription of this aggressive liver cancer.
