Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the common malignant tumors. HCC gene regulatory network (HCC GRN), whose nodes consist of genes, miRNAs or TFs and whose edges consist of interaction relationships of nodes, is one of the important ways to study molecular mechanism of HCC. Based on various experimental data, types of HCC GRNs could be conducted such as TF-miRNA regulatory network. Integrating the studies of HCC GRN, TF-miRNA transcriptional regulatory network performs better in identifying core genes which play important roles in network disturbances. It is a trend that gene variations and transcriptional regulatory networks should be combined, however the corresponding research is almost blank. This review summarizes the source of HCC data sources, the classification, character, and research program of HCC GRN. Finally, according to present analysis and discussion of progress and research status of HCC GRN, we provide a useful reference for researchers.
