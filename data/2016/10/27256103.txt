Purpose:The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of cryoablation in the treatment of subcapsular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) adjacent to various organs.Materials and methods:Twenty-eight patients with subcapsular HCC were treated with cryoablation in our institution. The degree of peri-procedural pain was measured using the visual analog scale (VAS). Technical success, local tumor progression, and overall disease progression rates were calculated. Procedure-related complications were identified by reviewing electronic medical records. Biochemical data, including serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and total bilirubin levels before and after the procedure were collected.Results:Subcapsular HCC tumors were located near the gallbladder, colon, stomach, kidney, diaphragm, or abdominal wall. The technical success rate of cryoablation was 96.4 % (27/28). Local recurrence- and progression-free survival rates were 96 and 84 % at 6 months, and 82 and 43 % at 1 year, respectively. All patients survived during the follow-up period. The VAS pain score ranged from 0 to 3 (mean, 1.57). A major complication occurred in one patient (3.6 %) and minor complications occurred at a rate of 17.9 %. Transient elevations of serum AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels were observed.Conclusion:Cryoablation is a safe and an effective procedure for the treatment of subcapsular HCC adjacent to various major organs.
