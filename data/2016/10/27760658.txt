Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with cryoablation in patients with unresectable large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: A total of 122 patients with unresectable large HCC admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University between November 2011 and July 2015 were retrospectively involved.The patients were divided into study group (58 patients who underwent TACE combined with cryoablation) and control group (64 patients who underwent TACE alone). Short-term effect of the initial treatment, long-term effect, prognostic factors for survival and adverse reactions were statistically analyzed. Result: There was no statistical difference in general information between two groups. The effective rates of the study and control group were 29.3% and 10.9% (P=0.011), and the control rates were 79.3% and 62.5% (P=0.042). The median survival time was 11.0 months (95% CI 7.4-14.6) for the study group and 5.0 months (95% CI 4.0-6.0) for the control group, the 6-, 12-, and 18-month overall survival rates for the study and control group were 84.5%, 49.5%, 26.8% and 48.1%, 17.8%, 11.1%, respectively (all P<0.01). On multivariate analysis, negative distant metastasis, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer B-stage, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ≤5, alpha fetoprotein<400 μg/L, combined treatment and effective initial treatment were independent protective factors for survival of patients with large HCC. Conclusions: The prognosis of patients with unresectable large HCC is affected by multiple factors. In comparison with TACE alone, TACE combined with cryoablation has advantage in both short-term and long-term effect with low incidence of serious adverse reactions, it is an effective and safe treatment option for patients with unresectable large HCC.
