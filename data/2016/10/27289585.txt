Background:Evidence-based guidelines and quality indicators for cirrhosis care have been established. Whether there are variations in adherence to these cirrhosis standards at different specialty settings has not been investigated.Aims:To evaluate the quality of cirrhosis care delivered at diverse hepatology care sites.Methods:We conducted a retrospective study comparing the quality of care at three hepatology specialty clinics: a Faculty Practice, safety-net hospital, and Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center. Consecutive patients with cirrhosis (85 Faculty Practice, 81 safety-net, and 76 VA) between 2010 and 2011 were included. Median follow-up was 2.3 years. Outcome measures were the adherence to six cirrhosis-specific quality-of-care indicators.Results:Adherence to hepatitis A and B vaccinations was highest at the safety-net hospital, 81 and 74 %, compared to 46 and 30 % at the Faculty Practice (P Conclusions:Disparities in cirrhosis quality measures existed by site. Strategies to overcome these disparities need to be developed to improve the delivery of quality cirrhosis care as we face a rise in cirrhosis-related complications over the next two decades.
