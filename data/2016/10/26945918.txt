Background and aim:This study developed liver outcome scores in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) that directly predict liver-related death, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver decompensation.Methods:Six hundred seventeen CHC patients were followed up for a mean of 6 years and randomized into a training set (n = 411) and a validation set (n = 206). Clinical outcomes were determined using a population-based data linkage system.Results:In the training set, albumin, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, hyaluronic acid, age, and sex were in the final model to predict 5-year liver-related death (area under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 0.95). Two cut points (4.0 and 5.5) defined three risk groups with an incidence rate for liver-related death of 0.1%, 2%, and 13.2%, respectively (P Conclusions:All three liver outcome scores had excellent predictive accuracy and were able to stratify risk into clinical meaningful categories for CHC patients.
