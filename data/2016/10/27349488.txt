Background & aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a serious complication of HCV-related cirrhosis. New direct-acting antivirals (DAA) cure HCV infection in over 90% of patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the early occurrence and recurrence of HCC in cirrhotic patients treated with DAA.Methods:We analysed 344 consecutive cirrhotic patients, without HCC, who were treated with DAA, and followed for 24weeks. Fifty-nine patients had previous HCC.Results:DAA therapy induced sustained virological response in 91% of patients. During 24-week follow-up, HCC was detected in 26 patients (7.6%, 95% CI: 4.99-10.84): 17 of 59 patients (28.81%, 95% CI: 17.76-42.07) with previous HCC and 9 of 285 patients (3.16%, 95% CI: 1.45-5.90) without previous HCC. Child-Pugh Class B, more severe liver fibrosis, lower platelet count, and previous HCC were significantly associated with HCC development, at univariate analysis. At multivariate analysis, Child-Pugh class (p=0.03, OR: 4.18, 95% CI: 1.17-14.8) and history of HCC (pConclusions:In patients with HCV-related cirrhosis, DAA-induced resolution of HCV infection does not seem to reduce occurrence of HCC, and patients previously treated for HCC have still a high risk of tumour recurrence, in the short term. For these reasons, all cirrhotic patients should be closely monitored and followed during and after antiviral therapy.Lay summary:New direct-acting antivirals are able to eradicate HCV infection in over 90% of patients with advanced liver disease. Unfortunately, the occurrence of liver cancer is not reduced in effectively treated cirrhotic patients. In addition, patients previously treated for HCC have still a high risk of tumour recurrence in the short term, despite DAA treatment.
