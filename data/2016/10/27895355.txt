Flow cytometric analysis of asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) levels on the surface of hepatocytes, which were obtained from the liver specimens of patients that received hepatectomy, were used as predictors of liver dysfunction after major hepatectomy for primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Chinese patients, based on our previous study which confirmed the value of ASGPR levels on the surface of hepatocytes in evaluating the liver reserve function. The current study was planned to establish a conversion formula for the value of ASGPR with correlated liver function parameters. It was conducted from January 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015, at Beijing DiTan Hospital, Beijing, China, and comprised 55 patients having undergone major hepatectomy. The outcomes of hepatectomy were compared with ASGPR levels and preoperative liver function parameters. A multiple linear regression model was used to identify the converted ASGPR value. The calculated ASGPR level was derived as: 80.695 + 0.002 × cholinesterases (CHE) (IU/L) - 0.620 × indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (ICGR15)(%) - 0.655 × total bilirubin (TB) (umol/L). Receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis showed that the sensitivity and specificity of the ASGPR value
