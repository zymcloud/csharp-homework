A case of multiple hepatocellular carcinomas with a severe intrahepatic arterioportal shunt that was successfully embolized with n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate with coaxial double-balloon occlusion prior to transcatheter arterial chemoembolization is presented. A proximal balloon positioned at the proper hepatic artery was used for flow control, and a coaxial microballoon, positioned in the closest of three arterial feeding branches to the arterioportal shunt, was used to control the delivery of n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. This coaxial double-balloon technique can prevent proximal embolization and distal migration of n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate and enable precise control of the distribution of n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. It could also be applicable to n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate embolization for other than intrahepatic arterioportal shunt.
