Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCV-induced hepatocarcinogenesis is a multistep process resulting from a combination of pathway alterations that are either caused directly by viral factors or immune mediated as a consequence of a chronic state of inflammation. Host genetic variation is now emerging as an additional element that contribute to increase the risk of developing HCC. The advent of direct-acting antiviral agents foresees a rapid decline of HCC rate in HCV patients. However, a full understanding of the HCV-mediated tumourigenic process is required to elucidate if pro-oncogenic signatures may persist after virus clearance, and to identify novel tools for HCC prevention and therapy. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms responsible for HCV-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.
