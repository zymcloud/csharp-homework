AFP-producing adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction are rare tumor diseases. These tumors show an aggressive behavior characterized by early occurrence of liver metastases and mimic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A general recommendation for palliative therapy is not established for these special tumors.Here we report about a 61-year-old man with multiple liver metastases and high serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level. First, HCC was suspected, but further evaluation showed an AFP-producing adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction with unusual findings on further immunohistochemical analysis. Palliative chemotherapy with FLOT (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel) regime showed a 9 month duration of partial response.
