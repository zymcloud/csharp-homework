The anticancer effects of human amniotic membrane (hAM) have been studied over the last decade. However, the action mechanisms responsible for these effects are not fully understood until now. Previously results reported by our team proved that hAM is able to induce cytotoxicity and cell death in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a worldwide high incident and mortal cancer. Therefore, this experimental study aimed to investigate the cellular targets of hAM protein extracts (hAMPE) in HCC through in vitro studies. Our results showed that hAMPE is able to modify oxidative stress environment in all HCC cell lines, as well as its cell cycle. hAMPE differently targets deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), P21, P53, Î²-catenin and multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins in HCC cell lines. In conclusion, hAMPE has several targets in HCC, being clear that the success of this treatment depends of a personalized therapy based on the biological and genetic characteristics of the tumor.
