Background and objectives:Hepatic resection is established as the treatment for HCC. However, patients sometimes experience early recurrence of HCC (ER HCC) after curative resection.Methods:A retrospective analysis was conducted for 193 patients with single HCC who underwent curative liver resection in our medical center between April 2000 and March 2013. We divided the cohort into two groups; early recurrence group (ER G) which experienced recurrence within 6 months after resection, and non-early recurrence group (NER G). Risk factors for ER HCC were analyzed.Results:Thirty-nine out of 193 (20.2 %) patients had ER HCC. Univariate analysis showed Glasgow prognostic score (GPS, p = 0.036), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR, p = 0.001), level of PIVKA-II (p = 0.0001), level of AFP (p = 0.0001), amounts of blood loss (p = 0.001), operating time (p = 0.002), tumor size (p = 0.0001), stage III and IV (p = 0.0001), and microvascular invasions (portal vein: p = 0.0001 and hepatic vein: p = 0.001) to be associated with ER HCC. By multivariate analysis, there were significant differences in high NLR (p = 0.029) and high AFP (p = 0.0001) in patients with ER HCC.Conclusions:Preoperative high AFP (more than 250 ng/ml) and high NLR (more than 1.829) were independent risk factors for ER HCC.
