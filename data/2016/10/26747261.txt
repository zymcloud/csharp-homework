Objectives:To validate and reappraise the Assessment for Retreatment with Transarterial chemoembolization (ART) score comprising three parameters (>25 % increase in aspartate aminotransferase [AST], increase in Child-Pugh score and tumour response), determined prior to subsequent transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:Enrolled patients were diagnosed with unresectable non-metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma and underwent multiple TACEs between June 2006 and December 2007 (N = 153). Subgroupings were classified according to the established cut-off (≤1.5 vs. ≥2.5). Survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier curve was performed.Results:The original ART score dichotomized patients according to their overall survival (P = 0.004). We found several patients who actually survived longer than others were assigned to a poor prognostic group due to the AST component. Parameter estimates for AST obtained from our analysis were much lower than the original version (0.5 vs. 2.1). We adjusted the component according to the value of our parameter estimates, and patients with >25 % AST increase received 1.0 point. After this modification, patients assigned to the favourable prognostic group were more likely to have a better survival outcome (median 23.9 vs. 12.2 months, P Conclusions:In hepatitis B virus-endemic regions, the ART score is valid and can better predict post-TACE survival after the AST component is modified.Key points:• The ART score was validated in a HBV-endemic region. • The modified ART score improved prognostic performance by reappraising the AST component. • The modified ART score helps physicians make decisions for further TACE.
