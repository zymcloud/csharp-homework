Background:HFE-related hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder with clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic disease to possible life-threatening complications. Cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, diabetes mellitus or osteoporosis can develop in HH patients not treated or monitored optimally. The purpose of this study was to develop key-interventions (KI's) to measure and improve the quality of care delivered to patients diagnosed with HH.Methods:A RAND-Modified Delphi method was used to develop KI's. In the first round of a scoring form to prioritize the recommendations extracted from evidence-based guidelines was circulated between experts. The results of this survey were discussed in a consensus meeting, followed by a final appraisal of the selected recommendations. This resulted in a list of measurable KI's.Results:Initially, 41 key recommendations on screening, diagnosis and treatment/management were extracted from three existing guidelines on HH (European Association for the Study of the Liver, American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and Dutch guideline on HH). Finally, a core set of 24 recommendations resulted in 15 KI's.Conclusions:This manuscript presents the results of the process to develop KI's to measure and improve the quality of care for patients with HH.
