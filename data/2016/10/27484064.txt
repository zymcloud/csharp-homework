Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with gastric metastasis is extremely rare. There have been few reports on curative surgical resection for gastric metastasis of HCC. We herein report such a case successfully treated by simultaneous surgical resection. A 73-year-old male was admitted for evaluation and treatment of a liver tumor. Computed tomography showed an exophytic tumor of 170 mm in diameter located in the left lobe of the liver with poor delineation to the gastric wall. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor with ulceration in the antrum of the stomach. With a diagnosis of HCC with invasion to the gastric wall, an en bloc resection was planned, and the patient underwent laparotomy. The patients underwent left hemihepatectomy with partial resection of the stomach for adhesion and distal gastrectomy for the tumor. Pathological examination of the liver tumor revealed poorly differentiated HCC, and pathological diagnosis of the tumor in the submucosal and muscular layer of the stomach was compatible with metastasis from HCC, which was separate from the liver tumor. Therefore, we diagnosed the tumor as HCC with hematogenous gastric metastasis. The patient remains well with no evidence of tumor recurrence as of 13 months after resection.
