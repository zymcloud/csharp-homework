Musculoskeletal problems in patients with liver disease are common; however, they are not so well described in the literature. Therefore, there is a need to collate information on these disorders, as their incidence is on a constant rise and some of these pathologies can severely debilitate the patient's quality of life. These disorders are parietal wall varices with or without bleeding, spontaneous intramuscular haematoma (e.g. rectus sheath), abdominal wall hernia, anasarca, hepatic osteodystrophy, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, necrotizing fasciitis, osseous metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma etc. While portal hypertension plays a key role in disorders, in others, dysregulation of the coagulation system or a compromised immune system are responsible. Imaging plays an essential role in the assessment of these complications and awareness of these musculoskeletal manifestations is vital for establishing a timely diagnosis and planning of appropriate therapy, as these disorders can significantly impact the morbidity and mortality and also influence candidacy for liver transplantation. We herein comprehensively appraise various musculoskeletal complications associated with chronic liver disease/liver cirrhosis especially from an imaging perspective which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been collectively described in English literature.
