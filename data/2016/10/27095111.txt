Background:The transcriptional regulator in embryonic development, KAP1, has been proved could promote cell proliferation and metastatic progression in a variety of human cancers. However, the role of KAP1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship of KAP1 expression with the progression and prognosis of HCC.Methods:We measured the expression level of KAP1 in both human hepatoma cell lines and HCC tissues obtained from HCC patients by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot. Furthermore, the effect of KAP1 expression on hepatoma cell proliferation was investigated through KAP1 knock-down strategy. Besides that, the correlation between KAP1 expression and HCC progression was analyzed.Results:KAP1 overexpression was proved broadly existed in the human hepatoma cell lines. Furthermore, down-regulate the expression of KAP1 by specific siRNA could inhibit cell proliferation which was partly originated from the activation of p53 mediated signal pathway. Moreover, comparisons between the cancer tissues and noncancerous tissues proved the expression level of KAP1 was significant higher in tumor tissues obtained from HCC patients. In addition, KAP1 overexpression was significantly correlated with tumor size and tumor stage and also a predictor for poor prognosis of HCC patients.Conclusion:Our results presented here demonstrate that KAP1 plays an important role in HCC and could be regarded as a valuable biomarker for tumor diagnosis and prognosis prediction, as well as a potential target for the treatment of HCC.
