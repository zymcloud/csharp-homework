Immediate and late results of the combined gastrectomy (CG) performance in 719 patients, suffering locally—spread gastric cancer (LSGC), were analyzed. Additional resection of adjacent оrgans was performed in 165 observations. In early postoperative period complications in 116 (16.1%) patients have had occurred, including surgical complications — in 77.7%, and nonsurgical — in 22.3%. Lethality in 30 postoperative days have constituted 11.1%. Тhe patients' postoperative life time was at average (22.9 ± 1.67) mo, mediana— 9.3 mo; indices of 3—year and 5—year survival — (18.9 ± 1.72) and (12.9 ± 1.51)%,accordingly. Essential difference in favor of subtotal distal gastric resection was established, basing on comparison data between this procedure and CG. The data obtained witnessed the expediency of combined operative interventions, what have had widened possibilities of the patients' radical treatment for LSGC.
