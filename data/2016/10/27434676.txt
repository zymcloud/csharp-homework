The once-daily prolonged-release formulation of tacrolimus has been recently related with significant graft and patient mid-term survival advantages; however, practical information on the de novo administration after liver transplantation and longterm outcomes is currently lacking. This study is a 5-year retrospective analysis of a single-center cohort of liver transplant recipients treated de novo with once-daily tacrolimus (April 2008/August 2011). The study cohort consisted of 160 patients, including 23 with pretransplant renal dysfunction, with a median follow-up of 57.6 months (interquartile range, 46.6-69.0). Tacrolimus target trough levels were 5-10 ng/mL during the first 3 months after transplant, reducing progressively to 25 points was not significantly different. In conclusion, our study suggests that immunosuppression based on de novo once-daily tacrolimus is feasible in routine clinical practice, showing favorable outcomes and outstanding longterm survival even in patients with high MELD scores.
