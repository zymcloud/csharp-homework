Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major type of primary liver cancer and the sixth most prevalent human malignancies worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatocarcinogenesis remain unclear. For HCC patients, there is not only a lack of effective therapeutic targets but also a lack of predictive or prognostic biomarkers. In this article, we reported that TRIM32 was obviously upregulated in HCC tumor tissues and HCC cell lines. Its expression patterns were positively correlated with histological grade, tumor sizes, and HBsAg of HCC patients. TRIM32 expression was a significant predictor for the overall survival time of HCC patients. Moreover, the overexpression of TRIM32 in cells accelerated the G1-S phase transition, promoted cell proliferation rates, and induced the resistance of HCC patients to oxaliplatin. All these findings suggest that TRIM32 might play important roles in the hepatocarcinogenesis. TRIM32 could be a novel direction to explore the mechanism underlying HCC pathogenesis.
