Background & aims:In low-endemic countries it is debated whether first-generation migrants should be screened for chronic hepatitis B infection. We describe the clinical impact of five large-scale Dutch screening projects for hepatitis B in first-generation Chinese migrants.Methods:Between 2009 and 2013 five independent outreach screening projects for hepatitis B targeting first-generation Chinese migrants were conducted in five main Dutch regions. To explore the relevance of our screening we defined clinical impact as the presence of an indication for: (i) antiviral therapy, (ii) strict follow-up because of high hepatitis B DNA levels and/or (iii) surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma.Results:In total, 4423 persons participated in the projects of whom 6.0% (n = 264) were HBsAg positive. One hundred and twenty-nine newly diagnosed HBsAg-positive patients were analysed in specialist care. Among these patients prevalence of cirrhosis was 6.9% and antiviral therapy for hepatitis B was started in 32 patients (25%). In patients without a treatment indication, strict follow-up because of high hepatitis B DNA levels and/or surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma was considered indicated in 64 patients (50%).Conclusions:In our screening project in first-generation Chinese migrants, antiviral treatment, strict follow-up because of high hepatitis B DNA levels and/or surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma were considered indicated in three of four analysed HBsAg-positive patients. These data show that detection of hepatitis B in Chinese migrants can have considerable impact on patient care.
