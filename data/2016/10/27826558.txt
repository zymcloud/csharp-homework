Liver transplantation is the optimal radical therapy for patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The Milan criteria are widely applied for deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) in the western countries. Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), however, prevails in Asian countries due to the extreme shortage of deceased donor organs. In contrast to DDLT, the feasibility of LDLT is not restricted by the national allocation system, and therefore the indications for LDLT in patients with HCC depend on institutional policies that consider both the operative risk to the donor and the survival benefit for the recipient. The results of a nationwide survey as well as the experiences of individual centers demonstrate similar outcomes for patients whose tumors fall within the Milan criteria and those whose tumors extend beyond the Milan criteria.
