Aim:The survival outcome of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) who received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with radiotherapy (RT) remains unclear.Methods:A total of 112 and 735 HCC patients with PVTT undergoing TACE combined with RT and TACE alone, respectively, were evaluated. One hundred and eight pairs of matched patients were selected from each treatment arm by using a propensity score matching (PSM) analysis.Results:Of the whole study population, TACE combined with RT showed significant survival benefits compared with TACE in all patients (median survival, 11.0 vs 4.8 months; P Conclusion:TACE combined with RT provides a significantly better survival outcome than TACE for unresectable HCC patients with PVTT, especially for patients with PVTT involving the right/left portal vein or main trunk.
