Objective:To investigate the long-term outcomes of pure laparoscopic hepatectomy versus open hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with background cirrhosis.Background:Laparoscopic hepatectomy has been gaining popularity, but has not been widely accepted, because published data were gathered from small numbers of patients.Methods:Data of patients diagnosed with HCC and cirrhosis treated by hepatectomy were reviewed. The outcomes of pure laparoscopic hepatectomy were compared with those of open hepatectomy. Propensity score matching of patients in a ratio of 1:3 was conducted.Results:There were 110 patients and 330 patients in the laparoscopic group and the open group, respectively. The laparoscopic group had less blood loss (150 vs 400 mL; P Conclusions:Pure laparoscopic hepatectomy for HCC can be carried out safely with favorable short-term and long-term outcomes even in cirrhotic patients at high-volume liver cancer centers.
