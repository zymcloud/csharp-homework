Introduction:The increasing knowledge of the genomic landscape of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the development of molecular targeted therapies are a promising background for increasing the number of effective drugs for HCC patients. In recent years, many new drugs have been tested as an alternative to sorafenib or after sorafenib failure.Areas covered:In this review, our aim is to describe the randomized trials recently conducted in HCC patients, in order to understand the main reasons potentially related to the failures of many drugs. In addition, we briefly describe the main ongoing trials, that could potentially change the scenario of HCC treatment in the next years. Expert commentary: Heterogeneity of study populations, lack of understanding of critical drivers of tumor progression, risk of liver toxicity associated with experimental agents, ï¬‚aws in trial design and marginal antitumoral potency can be considered the main reasons for failure of phase III clinical trials in HCC. Most ongoing trials are conducted without any molecular selection criteria, although many drugs could be probably better tested in a molecularly selected population. The knowledge of potential predictive factors for drug efficacy in patients with advanced HCC could improve the chance of obtaining positive results in clinical trials.
