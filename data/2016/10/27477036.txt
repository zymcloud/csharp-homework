A multi-functional gelator precursor with high photosensitivity is rationally designed, which can not only selectively target hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, but also form intracellular self-assembly triggered by light and subsequently inducing cell death. The study develops a methodology to design biological targets of supramolecular self-assembly under external stimuli for cancer research.
