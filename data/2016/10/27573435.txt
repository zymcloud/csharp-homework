We evaluated the efficacy of pre-cryosurgery and post-cryosurgery circulating tumour cells (CTCs) as biomarkers for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Real‑time qPCR was used to detect potential biomarker genes in CTCs, and magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and fluorescence‑activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed on 47 patients with hepatocellular cancer who underwent cryosurgery. CTCs in the 47 patients were assessed 1 day before cryosurgery, and 7 and 30 days after cryosurgery. The number of CTCs was 17.70±5.725, 14.64±6.761 and 10.28±5.598, respectively, and this decreased significantly over time (P
