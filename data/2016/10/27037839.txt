Background:Hepatic resection is standard treatment for liver metastases from colorectal and neuroendocrine cancers as well as primary biliary and hepatic carcinomas. The role of hepatic resection in patients with non-colorectal non-endocrine liver metastases (NCNELM) is less defined. Overall survival in this group of patients is poor with few patients surviving beyond two years, even with modern chemotherapy.Methods:A prospective database of all liver resections performed by a single surgeon (KSH) from January 2007 to December 2014 was maintained. Patient demographics, surgical and pathological data were collected prospectively; survival data were updated retrospectively. Patients were grouped according to pathology and analysis was performed using SPSS (version 21).Results:A total of 48 patients underwent hepatic resection for NCNELM, of which 18 were major resections. Pathologies encountered included sarcoma in 8/48, both breast and ovarian in 6/48 each and renal cell carcinoma and melanoma, each representing 5/48. A result of 38/48 patients undertook chemotherapy prior to surgery. R0 margin was achieved in 96%. Seven patients suffered complications from surgery and one peri-operative mortality. Overall survival at 1, 3 and 5 years was 93%, 83% and 61%, respectively. Forty-four percent of patients developed disease recurrence, 29% at distant sites.Conclusion:Hepatic resection can be achieved safely for NCNELM. Patient selection is key, along with a standardized surgical and anaesthetic technique. Patients should be rigorously investigated to exclude disseminated disease and multidisciplinary discussion must take place prior to surgery. Patients with NCNELM should not routinely be excluded from liver resection and selected patients may benefit from resection.
