Background/aim:The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the impact of intraoperative blood loss (IOBL) on outcome in liver transplant (LT) patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:A total of 108 LT patients with HCC were retrospectively analyzed. They were all clinically staged according to the Milan criteria and to 18F-fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) uptake on positron-emission tomography (PET).Results:Recurrence-free survival rates at 3 and 5 years post-LT were 91.9% and 91.9% among patients with low (â‰¤1,500 ml) IOBL, and 43.9% and 37.1% in those with high (>1,500 ml) IOBL (log-rank pConclusion:Intraoperative bleeding is associated with increased likelihood of tumor recurrence following LT for HCC. Limiting IOBL should be considered for improving post-LT outcome, particularly in patients with HCC beyond standard criteria.
