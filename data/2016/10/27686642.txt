Objective: To evaluate the clinical effect and safety of oxycodone hydrochloride in the anesthesia for percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) in hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: Between March and December 2015, 60 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing percutaneous radiofrequency ablation surgery in Peking University Cancer Hospital were randomly divided into three groups: oxycodone group (group Q), fentanyl group (group F) and dezocine group (group D), 20 cases in each group. Respectively intravenously injection oxycodone 0.1 mg/kg, fentanyl 0.001 mg/kg, dezocine 0.1 mg/kg before surgery. After the surgeon completed puncture administer propofol to maintain anesthesia. Recorded mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation (SpO2) changes in each group at entrance, beginning of radiofrequency ablation (T1), radiofrequency ablation began after 10 minutes (T2), the end of the surgical and awake. Observe the analgesia effect, respiratory depression, nausea, vomit and other complications. Postoperative pain scores were recorded.Using ANOVA, repeated measure variance analysis, SNK test, χ2 test and other tests to evaluate the anesthetic effect indexes. Results: The observation completed in all patients. Patients of three groups had no significant differences in general information. No significant difference between MAP, HR and SpO2 at each time points among the three groups. At the T1 time point (group Q: (11.7±1.6)/min, group D: (12.1±1.7)/min, group F: (10.3±2.3)/min, F=5.068, P=0.009) and T2 time point (group Q: (11.9±1.3)/min, group D: (12.2±1.4)/min, group F: (10.7±1.3)/min, F=7.024, P=0.002), RR in group F were lower than in group Q and group D. Pain visual analogue scores after waking (group Q: 0.2±0.7, group D: 0.3±0.7, group F: 1.7±1.5, F=12.981, P=0.000) and postoperative pain score of 1 hour (group Q: 2.0±0.9, group D: 1.8±0.8, group F: 4.3±0.9, F=42.362, P=0.000) in the group Q and group D were significantly lower than in group F. The body movements in group Q and group D were significantly less than in group F (3 cases, 3 cases, 9 cases, χ2=6.400, P=0.041 ). Intraoperative respiratory depression in group Q and group D were lower than group F (3 cases, 2 cases, 9 cases, χ2=8.012, P=0.018). Conclusions: Oxycodone hydrochloride can be used safely and effectively for radiofrequency ablation. It has favorable hemodynamic stability, lower incidence of respiratory depression, and advantage in terms of postoperative pain.
