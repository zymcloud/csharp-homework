Background and aim:Aim of the study was to assess the impact of ERAS approach ("fluid restrictive and drainless") on open liver resections for HCC comparing their outcome with open resections in pre-ERAS period and with laparoscopic surgery.Study design:207 patients undergoing minor liver resection for HCC were divided into three groups: Group A, open minor resections in pre-ERAS period (95 patients); Group B, laparoscopic ERAS resections (55 patients); Group C, open ERAS resections (57 patients).Results:Blood loss was lower in group C and B compared with group A. Postoperative morbidity was 26.5% in group A, 16.3% in group B and 12.1% in group C (pConclusions:Laparoscopic approach confirms to be associated with reduced blood loss and postoperative morbidity. In patients who cannot be candidates to minimally-invasive approach, ERAS management seems to allow blood loss and postoperative morbidity reduction: indeed, results achieved in this group of patients are more similar to those of laparoscopy than to pre-ERAS open surgery.
