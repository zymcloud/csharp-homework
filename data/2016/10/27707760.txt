A 70-year-old man with a history of prostate cancer, previously submitted to surgical castration and trans-urethral resection of the prostate, was admitted to Accident and Emergency department. He had been suffering from osteoarticular and abdominal pain, and recent weight loss. An abdominal and a pelvic CT showed multiple hepatic metastases and a pelvic mass, but his prostate-specific antigen values were low (0.26 n/mL). A biopsy of a hepatic metastasis and of the pelvic mass revealed a small-cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer, a rare and aggressive androgen-independent form of prostate cancer with a poor prognosis. Our purpose was to report a clinical case of a rare and aggressive variant of a common disease. A high index of suspicion is required to make an early diagnosis and to ensure a proper therapeutic approach.
