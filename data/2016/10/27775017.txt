Specific delivery of chemotherapy drugs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent into tumor cells is one of the issues to highly efficient tumor targeting therapy and magnetic resonance imaging. Here, A54 peptide-functionalized poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-grafted dextran (A54-Dex-PLGA) was synthesized. The synthesized A54-Dex-PLGA could self-assemble to form micelles with a low critical micelle concentration of 22.51 Î¼g. mL-1 and diameter of about 50 nm. The synthetic A54-Dex-PLGA micelles can encapsulate doxorubicin (DOX) as a model anti-tumor drug and superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) as a contrast agent for MRI. The drug-encapsulation efficiency was about 80% and the in vitro DOX release was prolonged to 72 hours. The DOX/SPIO-loaded micelles could specifically target BEL-7402 cell line. In vitro MRI results also proved the specific binding ability of A54-Dex-PLGA/DOX/SPIO micelles to hepatoma cell BEL-7402. The in vivo MR imaging experiments using a BEL-7402 orthotopic implantation model further validated the targeting effect of DOX/SPIO-loaded micelles. In vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activities results showed that A54-Dex-PLGA/DOX/SPIO micelles revealed better therapeutic effects compared with Dex-PLGA/DOX/SPIO micelles and reduced toxicity compared with commercial adriamycin injection.
