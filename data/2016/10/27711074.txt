Aberrant autophagic processes have been found to have fundamental roles in the pathogenesis of different kinds of tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), a histone acetyltransferase (HAT), performs its function by acetylating both histone and non-histone proteins. Our previous studies showed that PCAF was downregulated in HCC tissues and its high expression was significantly associated with patient survival after surgery, serving as a prognostic marker. In this study we found that overexpression of PCAF induced autophagy of HCC cells and its knockdown depressed autophagy. As type II programmed cell death, autophagy induced by PCAF-elicited cell death in HCC cells. In vivo experiments confirmed that PCAF-induced autophagy inhibited tumor growth. Subsequent in vitro experiments showed that PCAF promoted autophagy by inhibiting Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Our findings show that PCAF is a novel modulator of autophagy in HCC, and can serve as an attractive therapeutic strategy of HCC treatment.
