Hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) tumors are common in China. However, these tumors are often diagnosed at intermediate/ advanced stages because of the lack of a systemic surveillance program in China. This situation creates many technical challenges for surgeons and increases the incidence of postoperative complications. Therefore, Dr. Xiao-Ping Chen has made many important technical improvements, such as Chen's hepatic portal occlusion method, the anterior approach for liver resection of large HCC tumors, the modified technique of Belghiti's liver-hanging maneuver, inserting biliary-enteric anastomosis technique, and invaginated pancreaticojujunostomy with transpancreatic U-sutures. These techniques are simple, practical, and easy to learn. Owing to these advantages, complicated surgical procedures can be simplified, and the curative effects are greatly improved. These improved techniques have been widely applied in China and will benefit many additional patients. In this review, we introduce our experience of surgically treating intermediate/advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HC), and pancreatic carcinoma, mainly focusing on technical innovations established by Dr. Chen in HPB surgery.
