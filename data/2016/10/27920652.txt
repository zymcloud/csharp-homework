Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer and its treatment options are determined by shape, liver function, loci, and stages of cancer. Diffuse type of infiltrative HCC accompanied by portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) has the poorest prognosis among other HCCs and there are no other prominent treatment options than systemic chemotherapy. In this study, we report a case of a 56-year-old man with diffuse infiltrative HCC accompanied by PVTT who achieved complete remission for 8 years after receiving conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization using adriamycin and gelfoam.
