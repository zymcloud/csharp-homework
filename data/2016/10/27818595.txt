Aim:To determine whether cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E1 receptor (EP1) contribute to disease and whether they help predict prognosis.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the records of 116 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent surgery between 2008 and 2011 at our hospital. Expression of COX-2 and EP1 receptor was examined by immunohistochemistry of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues using polyclonal antibodies. Possible associations between immunohistochemical scores and survival were determined.Results:Factors associated with poor overall survival (OS) were alpha-fetoprotein > 400 ng/mL, tumor size â‰¥ 5 cm, and high EP1 receptor expression, but not high COX-2 expression. Disease-free survival was not significantly different between patients with low or high levels of COX-2 or EP1. COX-2 immunoreactivity was significantly higher in well-differentiated HCC tissues (Edmondson grade I-II) than in poorly differentiated tissues (Edmondson grade III-IV) (P = 0.003). EP1 receptor immunoreactivity was significantly higher in poorly differentiated tissue than in well-differentiated tissue (P = 0.001).Conclusion:COX-2 expression appears to be linked to early HCC events (initiation), while EP1 receptor expression may participate in tumor progression and predict survival.
