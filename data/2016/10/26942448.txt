Background:Targeted hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy was carried out to improve the efficacy of liver cancers. The aim of this study was to develop transferrin (Tf) modified, self-assembled polymeric nanoparticles for co-delivery doxorubicin (DOX) and cisplatin (DDP), to achieve combination tumor therapy.Methods:Tf modified polyethylene glycol (PEG) containing DOX prodrug (Tf-PEG-DOX) was synthesized. DDP containing poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) materials (PLGA-DDP) were prepared. Tf modified DOX and DDP loaded PLGA nanoparticles (Tf-DOX/DDP NPs) were prepared by using nanoprecipitation method. The particles sizes, zeta potentials, drug loading effects were characterized. The cytotoxicity of the NPs was evaluated in human hepatoma carcinoma cell lines (HepG2 cells), and in vivo anti-tumor was observed in mice bearing human HepG2 cells model.Results:Tf-DOX/DDP NPs displayed higher cytotoxicity and enhanced antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo over their non-modified and single drug loaded counterparts.Conclusion:Tf-DOX/DDP NPs can achieve outstanding anti-tumor activity due to the combination effect of two drugs and the active targeting ability of Tf ligands. The self-assembled polymeric nanomedicine could act as an efficient therapy method for HCC treatment.
