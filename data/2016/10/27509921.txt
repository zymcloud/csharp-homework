NIMA-related expressed kinase 2 (NEK2) participates in the carcinogenesis and progression of certain types of cancer, however, its expression and roles in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. Here, we found that NEK2 expression was significantly upregulated in both human HCC tissues and cell lines, and increased NEK2 expression in HCC was significantly correlated with clinical progression of HCC in patients. Knockdown of NEK2 in HCC cells inhibited HCC progression, as determined by the suppressed cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, knockdown of NEK2 inhibited drug resistance of HCC cells, as shown by the promoted suppression of cell viability in 5-fluorouracil (5‑FU)‑treated HCC cells. Mechanistically, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)/Akt and Wnt signaling activation are significantly inhibited by NEK2 knockdown, which is responsible for the HCC progression and involved in NEK2‑induced cancer cell abnormal biological behavior. Thus, enhanced NEK2 expression in HCC promotes HCC progression and drug resistance by promoting PP1/Akt and Wnt pathway activation, which may represent a new therapeutic target for HCC.
