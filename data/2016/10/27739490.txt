This study was designed to evaluate the prognostic value of platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A comprehensive literature search for relevant studies was performed in Web of science, Embase and Pubmed. A total of nine studies with 2017 patients were included in this meta-analysis, and combined hazard ratio (HR) or odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were served as effect measures. Pooled results showed that elevated PLR was associated with poor overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.63, 95%CI: 1.42-1.88, p = 0.000; I2 = 0.0%, Ph = 0.637) and poor disease-free survival (DFS)/recurrence-free survival (RFS) (HR=1.32, 95%CI: 1.15-1.52, p = 0.000; I2 = 19.3%, Ph = 0.287) in HCC patients. In addition, high PLR was not significantly correlated with the presence of vascular invasion, tumor multifocality, poor tumor grade or high level of serum AFP (>400 ng/ml). In conclusion, elevated PLR indicated a poor prognosis for patients with HCC. PLR may be a reliable, easily-obtained, and low cost biomarker with prognostic potential for HCC.
