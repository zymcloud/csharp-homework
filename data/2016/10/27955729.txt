This article aims to give an overview of pediatric liver tumors; in particular of the two most frequently occurring groups of hepatoblastomas and hepatocellular carcinomas. Focus lays on achievements gained through worldwide collaboration. We present recent advances in insight, treatment results, and future questions to be asked. Increasing international collaboration between the four major Pediatric Liver Tumor Study Groups (SIOPEL/GPOH, COG, and JPLT) may serve as a paradigm to approach rare tumors. This international effort has been catalyzed by the Children's Hepatic tumor International Collaboration (CHIC) formation of a large collaborative database. Interrogation of this database has led to a new universal risk stratification system for hepatoblastoma using PRETEXT/POSTTEXT staging as a backbone. Pathologists in this international collaboration have established a new histopathological consensus classification for pediatric liver tumors. Concomitantly there have been advances in chemotherapy options, an increased role of liver transplantation for unresectable tumors, and a web portal system developed at www.siopel.org for international education, consultation, and collaboration. These achievements will be further tested and validated in the upcoming Paediatric Hepatic International Tumour Trial (PHITT).
