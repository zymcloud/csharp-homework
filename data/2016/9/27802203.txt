Background:Vitronectin (VN) might be involved in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Objective:This study was designed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of serum vitronectin among HCC patients.Methods:A total of 105 patients with HCC, 91 with liver cirrhosis, 102 with chronic hepatitis, and 100 healthy subjects were recruited. Serum VN and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were measured.Results:Serum VN levels were significantly higher in HCC patients than in the other groups. Based on area under receiver operating characteristic curve, serum VN had similar diagnostic value, compared with serum AFP, in distinguishing HCC from the groups, and also improved the diagnostic value of AFP alone. Serum VN levels were associated with the degree of histological differentiation, multiple foci, vascular tumor thrombosis and tumor node metastasis stage. Serum VN was an independent predictor for early recurrence and disease-free survival. Moreover, serum VN possessed similar prognostic predictive performance as compared to serum AFP and also significantly enhanced the prognostic value of AFP alone.Conclusions:Elevated serum VN levels represented high diagnostic value and had close relation to clinicopathological factors and early recurrence, suggesting that serum VN might be a useful diagnostic and prognostic marker for HCC.
