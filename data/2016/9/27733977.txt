Background:There is no global consensus for the optimal management of HCC. Most of patients at the time of diagnosis are not candidate for potentially curative therapy. The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of low dose capecitabine combined with sorafenib in subset of Egyptian HCV patients presented with advanced HCC unfit for surgical or locoregional therapies.Methods:15 patients with advanced HCC, unfit for surgical or locoregional intervention, with PS Results:After 10 months of therapy, 6 patients showed complete response (40 %) with complete recanalization of portal vein (n = 2) and treatment was stopped and the others (n = 4) showed partial portal vein recanalization so, treatment is continued till now. 1 patient (6.7 %) showed recurrence of the disease and died after 1 month, 8 patients showed partial response (53.3 %) and still on treatment. The control groups showed a highly significant reduction in survival when compared to patients who received capecitabine and sorafenib (12.9 ± 2.1, 7.9 ± 0.9, 4.5 ± 1.3 months, p = 0.000).Conclusions:Combined low dose capecitabine and sorafenib proved to be safe with low toxicity profile and deserves further attention as a convenient, outpatient-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced HCC.
