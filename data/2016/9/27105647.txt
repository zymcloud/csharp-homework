Unlike systemic chemotherapy for hematological malignancies with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has only recently been reported to cause HBV reactivation and subsequent hepatitis. Most patients with HBV-related HCC have an underlying disease with liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, and TACE may potentially induce HBV reactivation and liver decompensation. Currently, there are no clinical guidelines for managing TACE-caused HBV reactivation. In this review, we summarize the changes of HBV status and liver function after TACE and the effect of antiviral treatment before, during, or after TACE.
