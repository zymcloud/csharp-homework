Background:The effect of awarding MELD exception points for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) is unknown. We evaluated the physical and mental health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and symptoms of anxiety and depression in liver transplant recipients with HCC compared to patients without HCC.Methods:The single-center sample measured PROs before and after transplant, which included 1521 multisurvey measurement points among 502 adults (67% male, 28% HCC, follow-up time: Results:Longitudinal PRO values did not differ between persons who received HCC exception points and those who did not have HCC. Patients with HCC who did not receive exception points had reduced physical HRQOL (P=.016), a late decline in mental HRQOL, and delayed reduction in anxiety (time-by-outcome interaction PConclusion:Transplant recipients who received HCC exception points had PROs that were comparable to those of patients without HCC, and reported better physical HRQOL and reduced symptoms of anxiety compared to patients with HCC who did not receive exception points. These analyses demonstrate the impact of HCC exception points on PROs, and may help inform policy regarding HCC exception point allocation.
