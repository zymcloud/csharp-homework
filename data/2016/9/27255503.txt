Purpose:To report the results of the first Italian survey investigating the role of liver-directed radiotherapy in the multidisciplinary approach of primary and metastatic liver cancer.Materials and methods:A 21-item, two-section questionnaire was sent to all Italian radiotherapy centers on June 2014. The two sections aimed at: (1) evaluating the presence of a multidisciplinary liver tumor board and describing the role of radiation oncologists within the latter, (2) analyzing Radiotherapy treatment details and differences between centers.Results:A total of 37 centers completed the survey. A multidisciplinary liver tumor board was available in most centers (73 %), with a radiation oncologist routinely attending the latter in the majority of cases (85 %). Most of the respondents considered liver-directed Radiotherapy as the third line choice when other therapies were not indicated or technically suitable. 18 centers reported the use of liver-directed radiotherapy. The majority of centers started liver irradiation after 2010. The most adopted motion management strategy was abdominal compression. The most adopted GTV-CTV expansion was 0 and 5 mm for metastases and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. Stereotactic body radiotherapy was the technique of choice; several treatment schedules were registered, being 45 Gy in three fractions the most reported fractionation scheme. Dose was prescribed at the PTV margin in most cases.Conclusion:Liver-directed radiotherapy represents a new field of interest which is currently adopted by 10 % of all Italian Centers. The technical equipment seems adequate. The variations observed in the treatment regimens reflect the lack of a well-established standard schedule.
