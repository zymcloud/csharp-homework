Conventional transarterial chemoembolization with ethiodized oil and gelatin sponge (GS) particles is a standard technique for hepatocellular carcinoma. Ethiodized oil can temporarily block tumor sinusoids, portal venules, hepatic sinusoids, and arterial microcommunications. By adding GS embolization, strong ischemic effects not only on the tumor but also on the surrounding liver parenchyma can be achieved. Superselective conventional transarterial chemoembolization is mainly indicated for patients with Child-Pugh scores of 5-8, tumors ≤ 7 cm, and ≤ 5 lesions. According to a Japanese nationwide survey, the 5-year survival rate of patients with Child-Pugh class A and a single tumor was 52%.
