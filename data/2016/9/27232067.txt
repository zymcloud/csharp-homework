Introduction:All anticancer drugs can cause idiosyncratic liver injury. Therefore, hepatoprotective agents assume particular importance to preserve liver function. Hepatic injury represents 10% of cases of acute hepatitis in adults; drug-related damage is still misjudged because of relative clinical underestimation and difficult differential diagnosis. Chemotherapeutic agents can produce liver toxicity through different pathways, resulting in different categories of liver injuries, but these drugs are not homogeneously hepatotoxic. Frequently, anticancer-induced hepatotoxicity is idiosyncratic and influenced by multiple factors.Areas covered:The aim of this paper is to perform a review of the literature regarding anticancer-induced liver toxicity. We described hepatotoxicity mechanisms of principal anticancer agents and respective dose reductions. Furthermore, we reviewed studies on hepatoprotectors and their optimal use. Tiopronin, magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate and S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) demonstrated, in some small studies, a potential hepatoprotective activity.Expert opinion:Actually, in the literature only small experiences are reported. Even though hepatoprotective agents seem to be useful in the oncologic setting, the lack of well-designed prospective Phase III randomized controlled trials is a major limit in the introduction of hepatoprotectors in cancer patients and these kind of studies are warranted to support their use and to give further recommendations for the clinical practice.
