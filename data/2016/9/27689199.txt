Background and aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a growing incidence and studies regarding the risk factors or pathogenesis for this type of carcinoma benefit special interest. This study evaluates the correlations between p53 protein expression and clinical and laboratory factors in patients with HCC.Methods:The study group included 76 patients diagnosed with HCC, either by biopsy or after surgical resection (with curative intent). Immunohistochemistry for p53 protein assessment was performed in all patients. Correlations between the protein 53 expression and age, tumour size, viral infection, liver cirrhosis were performed using the chi-square test (Pearson's chi-square) together with the contingency coefficient Kendall's coefficient in the tau-b form.Results:In the study group, 51 patients were male (67%) and 25 female (33%). Cirrhosis due to hepatitis virus B or C infection (in a proportion of 63% of the study group) was not significantly associated with the presence of HCC. Altered expression of p53 protein was observed in 69 patients (91%). The relationship between p53 protein expression and patient sex (p=0.067), age (p=0.531), tumour size (p=0.270), presence of hepatitis B and C viral infections (p=0.7), and of liver cirrhosis (p=0.511) was not statistically significant.Conclusion:The p53 protein expression was not significantly associated with the demographic characteristics of the patients, tumour size, presence of viral B and C infections or liver cirrhosis.
