Background/aim:Multivisceral resection for advanced tumors can result in prolonged survival but may also increase the risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether extensive resections increase the severity of postoperative complications.Materials and methods:A retrospective study was conducted between 2009 and 2014 at the Linköping University Hospital surgical department. All patients with a confirmed or presumed malignant disease who underwent a non-standardized surgical procedure requiring a multivisceral resection were included. The primary endpoint was 90-day complications according to the Clavien-Dindo score.Results:Forty-eight patients were included, with an age range of 17-77 years. A median of three organs was resected. The most common diagnoses were neuroendocrine tumor (n = 8), gastric cancer (n = 7), and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (n = 6). One patient died during surgery. Complications ⩾ grade 3b according to Clavien-Dindo score occurred in 10 patients. R0 resection was achieved in 32 patients. No correlation was observed between the number of anastomoses, perioperative blood loss, operative time, and complications. Only postoperative blood transfusion was correlated with severe complications (p = 0.046); however, a tendency toward more complications with an increasing number of resected organs was observed (p = 0.06).Conclusion:Multivisceral resection can result in R0, potentially curing patients with advanced tumors. Here, no correlation between extensive resections and complications was observed. Only postoperative blood transfusion was correlated with severe complications.
