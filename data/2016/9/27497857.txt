Objective:To study racial disparities in therapeutic interventions and hospitalization outcomes for hepatocellular cancer (HCC) in the United States.Patients and methods:Using the 2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (comprising hospitalizations between January 1 and December 31, 2011), we identified patients with HCC-related admissions using previously validated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Among these, we also identified those that were procedure-related (associated with liver transplantation, hepatic resection, radiofrequency ablation, or transarterial chemoembolization). Multivariate regression was performed to identify the contribution of race to therapeutic interventions and outcomes.Results:A total of 22,933 HCC-related hospitalizations were included, of which 10,285 were procedure related (45%). Blacks had a smaller proportion (35%) of procedure-related HCC hospitalizations than did whites (46%) (odds ratio [OR], 0.65; 95% CI, 0.49-0.86). Specifically, blacks had lower odds of liver transplantation (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.26-0.71), hepatic resection (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.33-0.98), and ablation (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29-0.74) (P=.002) than did whites. Overall, 10.9% of HCC-related admissions resulted in death in blacks as compared with 6.4% in whites (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.12-2.24).Conclusion:Among patients admitted for HCC-related hospitalizations, blacks were less likely to receive liver transplantation, hepatic resection, and ablation than whites and had higher inhospital mortality. Identifying racial disparities in health care is a necessary first step to appropriately address and eliminate them.
