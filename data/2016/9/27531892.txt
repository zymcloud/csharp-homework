Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks the fourth common cancer and the third common cause of cancer mortality among Chinese population. The development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were confirmed to be involved in complex interactions between environmental and genetic factors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to play an important role in tumorigenesis and metastasis. Emerging evidence suggested that upregulation of miR-155, one of the best characterized miRNAs, could serve as a promising marker for the diagnosis and prognosis of many cancers, except for HCC. In current we tested the hypothesis that functional variant rs767649 located in the flanking region of miR-155 gene contributes to the development and survival of HCC. We identified that functional variant rs767649 in miR-155 regulation region was associated with risk and survival of HCC. The minor allele of rs767649 was significantly associated with an increased risk of HCC (OR=1.23, 95% CI=1.11-1.36, P = 7.97x10-5). The genotype TT of rs767649 was significantly associated with a 1.94 fold poor survival of HCC (HR=1.94, 95% CI=1.01-3.79), while 1.15 fold for genotype AT (HR=1.15, 95% CI=1.06-1.25). Results showed that miR-155 was highly overexpressed in HCC tissues, compared with the adjacent normal tissues (P
