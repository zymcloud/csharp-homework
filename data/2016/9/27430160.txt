Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) is key in the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor microenvironment and metastatic niche formation. However, its effect on proliferation and clinical parameters in HCC require further elucidation. The present study aimed to investigate LOXL2 expression in HCC from in vitro and clinical aspects. The present study constructed LOXL2‑small interfering RNA with a lentiviral vector, investigated the effect of LOXL2 on proliferation using HCC cell lines via a series of assays, including reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, cell counting, colony formation, assessment of cell cycle and apoptosis using flow cytometry, MTT and BrdU. Furthermore, 80 tissue samples from HCC patients at The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University (Dalian, China) from 2007 to 2010. Immunohistochemical staining was used to clinically verify LOXL2 expression. The results of the present study demonstrate that LOXL2 silencing decreased cell numbers, proliferation, colony formations and cell growth, induced cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis. Clinically, expression levels of LOXL2 was markedly increased in matched adjacent non‑tumor tissue (ANT) samples compared with levels in tumor tissue (TT) samples, and this gradually increased with higher histological grade and more advanced TNM classification in the matched ANT and TT samples. LOXL2 was determined to promote proliferation of HCC and demonstrated to be highly expressed in HCC ANT samples compared with TT samples.
