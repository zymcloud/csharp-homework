Pro-inflammatory cytokines play a vital role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic steatohepatitis. The present study was to determine the role of alcohol-induced oxidative stress in modulating cytokine production. A rat model of alcohol consumption was used to determine alcohol-induced hepatic cytokine expression. Chronic alcohol exposure caused lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and inflammation in the livers of Wistar rats. The role of oxidative stress in regulating cell type-specific cytokine production was further dissected in vitro. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) dose-dependently upregulated TNF-α, MIP-1α, MCP-1, and CINC-1 in Kupffer cells-SV40, whereas TNF-α dose-dependently induced CINC-1, IP-10, and MIP-2 expression in H4IIEC3 hepatoma cells. An additive effect on cytokine production was observed in both Kupffer cells-SV40 and hepatocytes when combined hydrogen peroxide with LPS or TNF-α, respectively, which was associated with NF-κB activation and histone H3 hyper-acetylation. Unexpectedly, an inhibitory effect of 4-hydroxynonenal on cytokine production was revealed in LPS-treated Kupffer cells-SV40. Mechanistic study showed that 4-hydroxynonenal significantly enhanced mRNA degradation of TNF-α, MCP-1, and MIP-1α, and decreased the protein levels of MCP-1 in LPS-stimulated Kupffer cells-SV40 through reducing the phosphorylation of mRNA binding proteins. This study suggests that Kupffer cells and hepatocytes express distinct pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in response to alcohol intoxication, and oxidative products (4-hydroxynonenal) differentially modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production via NF-κB signaling, histone acetylation, and mRNA stability.
