Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a representative inflammation-associated cancer and known to be the most frequent tumors. HCC may also induce important pro- and anti-tumor immune reactions. However, the underlying mechanisms are unsatisfactorily identified. We investigated the protective effect of boiled and freeze-dried mature silkworm larval powder (BMSP) on diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatotoxicity in mice.Methods:Mice were fed with diet containing BMSP (0.1, 1, and 10 g/kg) for two weeks and DEN (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was injected 18 hours before the end of this experiment. Liver toxicity was determined in serum and histopathological examination was assessed in the liver tissues. Infiltration of immune cells and expressions of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were also examined.Results:Pretreatment with BMSP reduced necrotic and histopathological changes induced by DEN in the liver. Measurement of serum biochemical indicators, the levels of alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase, showed that pretreatment with BMSP also decreased DEN-induced hepatotoxicity. In addition, BMSP inhibited the macrophage and CD31 infiltration in a dose-dependent manner. The expressions of interleukin-1β, IFN-γ and chemokines for T cell activation were decreased in BMSP pretreatment groups.Conclusions:BMSP may have a protective effect against acute liver injury by inhibiting necrosis and inflammatory response in DEN-treated mice.
