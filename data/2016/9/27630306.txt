Background/aim:Post-resection recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tends to derive from multicentric origins, which indicates that the background liver microenvironment affects carcinogenesis.Materials and methods:We obtained control liver samples [super normal (SN)] from 11 patients with secondary metastatic liver malignancies and used expression and methylation arrays to compare them with non-cancerous liver tissue from a patient with typical HCC with chronic hepatitis C (corresponding normal (CN)].Results:The expression array showed that gene expression of tubulin polymerization-promoting protein (TPPP) was lower in CN compared with SN. The methylation array showed a greater TPPP methylation index for CN than for SN. Transcripts of TPPP differed significantly among SN (n=11), CN (n=179), and tumor tissue of HCC (n=179) (median of 116, 4.60, and 2.63, respectively, pConclusion:Significantly lower TPPP expression was found in HCC and CN tissue compared to SN and indicated poor prognosis.
