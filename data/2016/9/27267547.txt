Background:Local recurrence is a specific problem after radiofrequency ablation of small hepatocellular carcinoma, and additional treatment is an important issue. We aimed to investigate the outcome of salvage hepatectomy in patients who develop local, recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma after treatment with radiofrequency ablation.Methods:From 2001-2013, we reviewed 58 patients from 6 university hospitals with local, recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent salvage hepatectomy after their initial radiofrequency ablation treatment. Pathologic characteristics and prognostic factors influencing overall survival were analyzed.Results:Noncurative resection, des-gamma carboxy prothrombin levels >40 mAU/mL, and multiple preceding treatments before salvage hepatectomy were negative prognostic factors for overall survival. The 5-year survivals for the prognostic factors were 0%, 24%, and 30%, respectively, after salvage hepatectomy, and 0%, 54%, and 54% after initial radiofrequency ablation treatment, respectively. As for the pathologic finding of local, recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma after radiofrequency ablation, vascular invasion was observed frequently in patients with increases in des-gamma carboxy prothrombin levels and with multiple preceding treatments before salvage hepatectomy with a frequency of 59% and 53%, respectively (P Conclusion:Noncurative resection, increases in serum des-gamma carboxy prothrombin, and multiple preceding treatments were prognostic factors for subsequent salvage hepatectomy; nevertheless, survival outcomes were still acceptable when a curative salvage hepatectomy was performed. Increases in serum des-gamma carboxy prothrombin and multiple preceding treatments were positive predictors for pathologic vascular invasion. These factors should be taken into consideration when selecting treatment modalities for locally recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma following radiofrequency ablation. Repetition of unsuccessful, loco-regional treatment would appear to decrease the potential survival.
