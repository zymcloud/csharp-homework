Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common subtype of liver malignancy, and it is characterized by poor prognosis because of cancer stem cell (CSC)-mediated high postsurgical recurrence rates. Thus, targeting CSCs, or HCC cells with CSC-like properties, is an effective strategy for HCC therapy. Here, using long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) microarray analysis, we identified a novel lncRNA termed lncCAMTA1 that is increased in both liver CSCs and HCC. High lncCAMTA1 expression in HCC indicates poor clinical outcome. In vitro and in vivo functional experiments showed that overexpression of lncCAMTA1 promotes HCC cell proliferation, CSC-like properties, and tumorigenesis. Conversely, depletion of lncCAMTA1 inhibits HCC cell proliferation, CSC-like properties, and tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that lncCAMTA1 physically associates with the calmodulin binding transcription activator 1 (CAMTA1) promoter, induces a repressive chromatin structure, and inhibits CAMTA1 transcription. Furthermore, CAMTA1 is required for the effects of lncCAMTA1 on HCC cell proliferation and CSC-like properties, and the expression of lncCAMTA1 and CAMTA1 is significantly negatively correlated in HCC tissues. Collectively, our study revealed the important roles and underlying molecular mechanisms of lncCAMTA1 on HCC, and suggested that lncCAMTA1 could be an effective prognostic factor and a potential therapeutic target for HCC.
