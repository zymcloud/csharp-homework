Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide with high prevalence and lethality. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are the major risk factors for HCC. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in diverse biological processes, and aberrant lncRNA expression is relevant to many human diseases including HCC. Although many researches on HCC have been reported and lncRNAs roles in carcinogenesis have been highlighted recently, reports on roles of lncRNAs in HBV/HCV-induced HCC are limited. In this review, we concentrate on recent progress regarding the functional roles of lncRNAs in HCC and HBV/HCV-related HCC.
