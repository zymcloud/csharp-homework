Several recent genome-wide studies showed that the genetic polymorphisms in the HLA-DQ region (rs9275572 and rs2856718) were related to chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We analyzed the two single-nucleotide polymorphisms for major HBV outcomes in Han Chinese. A total of 1291 samples were involved and peripheral blood samples were collected in this study. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry were used to genotype the single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the HLA-DQ region. Our study indicated the clear relationship between the HLA-DQ rs9275572 and HBV-related HCC after control for the effects of sex, drinking, and smoking. Health subjects with the HLA-DQ rs9275572 GA genotype would have a 0.641 (95 % CI 0.416, 0.985; P = 0.043) times lower odds of having HCC, and those with the AA genotype would have a 0.256 (95 % CI 0.106, 0.618; P = 0.002) times lower odds of having HCC, whereas the values of the other covariates were fixed. Whereas there was no significant difference found for the HLA-DQ rs2856718 AG and GG genotype. Our study suggested that HLA-DQ loci (rs9275572) were associated with HBV-related HCC as a protective factor in Han Chinese.
