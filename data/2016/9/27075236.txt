Aim:To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination therapy of fluorouracil, leucovorin and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) and aflibercept in Asian patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), who had progressed after oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.Methods:This is a retrospective analysis of 19 mCRC patients who received FOLFIRI and aflibercept (4 mg/kg intravenously) every 2 weeks via a Named Patient Program (supported by Sanofi Aventis) in Singapore. Treatment was administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Efficacy and toxicities were summarized using descriptive statistics. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA 12.0 software.Results:The majority (84%) of the patients were of chinese ethnicity. The median age was 59 years, with 63.2% of the patients having an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status of 1. Four patients (21.1%) achieved partial response and 8 patients (42.1%) achieved stable disease. After a median follow-up of 9.6 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.2-13.1 months], the median OS was 11.6 months (95% CI, 6.1 to not-estimable), and median PFS was 4.1 months (95% CI, 2.2-5.9). Majority of the toxicities were grade 1-2, and include leucopenia (84.2%), anemia (73.7%), liver enzyme elevation (68.4%) and fatigue (68.4%). The most frequently reported grade 3 toxicities were neutropenia and neutropenic complications (both 15.8%). All adverse events resolved with supportive management.Conclusion:The clinical benefit and safety profile of the combination of FOLFIRI/aflibercept in Asian patients with mCRC are consistent with that of Western population. FOLFIRI/aflibercept may be an appropriate therapeutic option in Asian patients with mCRC previously treated with an oxaliplatin-based regimen.
