Objective:To investigate the effects of co-transfection of miR-520c-3p and miR-132 on proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma Huh7.Methods:Hepatocellular carcinoma Huh7 was cultured in vitro and lipidosome was used to transfect miR-520c-3p and miR-132, respectively or together. The effects of transfection of miR-520c-3p and miR-132 on proliferation and apoptosis of Huh7 were detected by CCK8 and Annexin V staining and flow cytometry, and the expression level of the targeted gene of over-expressed miR-520c-3p and miR-132 was determined by Western blot and realtime PCR.Results:Compared with the control group, the proliferation ability of Huh7 of the single transfected and co-transfected miR-520c-3p and miR-132 decreased significantly, and the apoptosis ratio increased distinctly (P Conclusions:The co-transfection of miR-520c-3p and miR-132 can target-regulate the expression of GPC3 and YAP, enhance the exhibition effect on proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma Huh7 and induce cell apoptosis synergistically.
