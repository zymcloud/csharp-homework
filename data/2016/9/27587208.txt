Objective:To explore the application of the technique of terminal branches portal vein embolization(TBPVE)for planed hepatectomy.Methods:From February 2016 to June 2016, 4 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma underwent TBPVE and liver resection in Yuebei People's Hospital (n=3) and Jiangxi Ji'an Central People's Hospital (n=1). All of them were male and were 50, 64, 39 and 47 years old respectively. All the tumors located in the right lobe. All patients had the liver function of Child-Pugh A classification and liver cirrhosis level of G2S4. The standard liver volume (SLV) were 1 291, 1 109, 1 177 and 1 242 ml and estimated future liver remnant(FLR) were 315, 347, 306 and 323 ml respectively. The puncture site of TBPVE was determined by the three-dimensional reconstruction of portal vein. Three patients were punctured in the segment Ⅵ and the other one punctured in the segment Ⅲ. CT scan was repeated 2 weeks after TBPVE and FLR and FLR/SLV were calculated. All patients underwent right hepatectomy 2 weeks after TBPVE.Results:On the 14(th) day after TBPVE, the FLR of 4 patients were 529, 462, 469 and 498 ml which increased 67.9%, 33.1%, 53.3% and 54.2% compared with that before TBPVE, and FLR/SLV were 41.0%, 41.7%, 39.8% and 40.1% respectively. No severe complication occurred. Right hepatectomy were performed 2 weeks after TBPVE. No inflow blood control applied during the liver resection. The mean blood loss was 950 ml and the mean operating time was 3.3 hours (ranging from 3 to 4 hours). One patient had respiratory infection and two had slight jaundice and ascites for a short period. No other complication occurred.Conclusion:The TBPVE could induce a rapid and large FLR volume that give chances to patients with small FLR to have liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma.
