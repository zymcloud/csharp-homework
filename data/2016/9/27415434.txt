Background:The association of hepatitis B virus (HBV) preS1 and preS2 deletions with progressive liver diseases are not fully understood.Objective:The study aimed to investigate characteristics of HBV preS deletion in HBV-infected patients with different illness categories.Study design:Total of 539 HBV-infected patients were enrolled in the study, including 146 with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 111 with HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC), 146 with HBV-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), and 136 with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PreS deletion was determined by sequencing. Replicons containing representative preS1 and preS2 deletion mutants and wild-type were respectively constructed and transfected into HepG2 cells for phenotypic analysis.Results:The detection rates of overall preS deletion were 15.8%, 26.1%, 24.0%, and 34.6% in CHB, LC, ACLF, and HCC patients, respectively. PreS1 deletion was most frequently detected in LC patients while preS2 deletion was most frequently detected in HCC patients, both frequencies were significantly higher than that in CHB patients (17.1% vs. 4.8%, PConclusions:HBV preS deletion was associated with advancement of liver diseases not only presented in preS deletion incidence, but also in the deletion pattern. Patients with preS2 deletion might have a higher risk to develop HCC.
