Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with tumor thrombi invading the portal vein and extending into the right atrium (RA) through the hepatic vein is regarded as a terminal-stage condition. Intracardiac tumor thrombus and treatment via liver resection has been reported in the current literature, but results from this therapeutic approach remain unsatisfactory. The present study describes a rare case of HCC with metastatic portal vein, middle hepatic vein, inferior vena cava (IVC) and RA tumor thrombi, and pulmonary metastases. A 29-year-old woman was admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Traditional Chinese Medical University (Nanning, China) subsequent to experiencing right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Following diagnosis, based on computed tomography analysis and laboratory data, the patient underwent an initial transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment using fluorouracil (5-FU), pirarubicin, mitomycin C, Lipiodol and sodium alginate microball (KMG). At 1 month post-treatment, serum α-fetoprotein levels remained at >1,000 ng/ml. Subsequently, the patient underwent a second TACE treatment. At 1 month after the second treatment, the abdominal pain had been alleviated and the serum α-fetoprotein levels were reduced to
hepatic artery chemoembolization; hepatocellular carcinoma; pirarubicin; pulmonary metastases; right atrium; sodium alginate microball; tumor thrombus.
