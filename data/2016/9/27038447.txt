Spontaneous regression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a rare event. Here we present a case of spontaneous regression of metastatic HCC. A 53-year-old man with hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis was found to have a large liver mass consistent with HCC based on its radiographic features. Imaging also revealed left portal and hepatic vein thrombosis, as well as multiple lung nodules concerning for metastases. Approximately 2 months after the initial diagnosis, both the primary liver lesion and the lung metastases decreased in size and eventually resolved without any intervention. Thereafter, the left hepatic vein thrombus progressed into the inferior vena cava and the right atrium, and the patient died due to right heart failure. In this case report and literature review, we discuss the potential mechanisms for and review the literature on spontaneous regression of metastatic HCC.
