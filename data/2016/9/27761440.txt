This review article was requested by editor-in-chief of this journal as 'pediatric CHB treatment' for the upcoming special issue. The main objective of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treatment is diminishing the risk of complications related to chronic liver disease. In Asia, there are already some reports about hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected children. The key points of treatment in children with CHB infections are selection of which patients to treat and conformation of the optimal therapy time that would reduce viral resistance. The choice of therapy is determined by the district (Western/Eastern), HBV genotype, medical accessibility, and economic state of the country. Newly developed nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) are potent in children with CHB. However, to improve therapeutic efficacy, physicians are recommended to follow treatment guidelines and determine the specific genotype in the CHB patient. In this article, the treatment of pediatric CHB is reviewed according to differences in genotype.
