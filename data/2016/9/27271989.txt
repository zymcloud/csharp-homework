The identification of new high-sensitivity and high-specificity markers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is essential. We aimed at identifying serum microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential biomarkers for early detection of HCC on top hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We investigated serum expression of 13 miRNAs in 384 patients with HCV-related chronic liver disease (192 with HCC, 96 with liver cirrhosis (LC), and 96 with chronic hepatitis C (CHC)) in addition to 96 healthy participants enrolled as a control group. The miRNA expression was performed using real-time quantitative PCR-based SYBR Green custom miRNA arrays. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of miRNA panels for early detection of HCC. Using miRNA panel of miR-122, miR-885-5p, and miR-29b with alpha fetoprotein (AFP) provided high diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 1) for early detection of HCC in normal population while using miRNA panel of miR-122, miR-885-5p, miR-221, and miR-22 with AFP provided high diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.982) for early detection of HCC in LC patients. However, using miRNA panel of miR-22 and miR-199a-3p with AFP provided high diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.988) for early detection of HCC in CHC patients. We identified serum miRNA panels that could have a considerable clinical use in early detection of HCC in both normal population and high-risk patients.
