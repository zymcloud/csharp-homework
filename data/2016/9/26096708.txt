Background:This study aims to evaluate the immediate outcomes of robotic and open gastrectomy for patients with locally advanced gastric adenocarcinomas.Methods:A retrospective analysis was performed on patients undergoing curative intent gastrectomies between 2004 and 2013 in our department. Operative and postoperative outcomes as well as long-term survival data were analysed.Results:Two groups of patients were analysed: the robotic group (n = 18) and the open surgery group (n = 29). Operating time in the robotic group (320.833 ± 85.186 min) was significantly longer (p = 0.0004) as compared with the open group (243.366 ± 57.973 min). The number of retrieved lymph nodes was not statistically different between the two groups (p = 0.108) and neither was the rate of postoperative complications (p = 0.294).Conclusions:Robotic gastrectomy is a safe procedure, with satisfactory short- and long-term outcomes in locally advanced gastric cancer. Studies on a larger number of patients are necessary in order to confirm whether an immediate benefit in survival exists due to robotic surgery. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
