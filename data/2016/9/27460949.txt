Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Src is involved in multiple processes of cancer metastasis; however, its significance in HCC is not well defined. In the present study, overexpression of Src phosphorylation (Y416) was observed in the highly metastatic MHCC97H cell line; additionally, through inhibition of Src kinase activation, HCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and colony formation were significantly reduced in vitro. Tumour growth was not affected in the orthotopic xenograft HCC model, but the metastasic potential was inhibited as revealed by reduced lung metastasic foci after administration of saracatinib. Phosphorylation level of Src pathway signalling molecules, such as Src, FAK and Stat3, were also reduced in vitro and in vivo, as a result of the anti-metastasic effects caused by saracatinib treatment. In conclusion, we demonstrated the pro-metastasic role of Src in HCC, and further experiments suggest the use of the Src inhibitor in combination with cytotoxic agents and other anticancer treatments to improve HCC prognosis.
