Purpose:This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with intra-IVC implantation of an irradiation stent for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) complicated by inferior vena cava tumor thrombosis (IVCTT).Methods:Sixty-one consecutive patients with HCC complicated by IVCTT treated by TACE combined with IVC stenting were retrospectively analysed. IVC stenting was performed using a stent loaded with (125)I seeds strands (the irradiation stent) in 33 patients (Group A) and 28 patients with a bare stent (Group B). Propensity score matching eliminated the baseline differences. Overall survival, oedema related to IVC obstruction remission rate and procedure-related adverse events were compared between the two groups.Results:The adverse effect rate was similar for both Group A and Group B patients, and complications were adequately handled by medical treatment. TACE combined with implantation of an irradiation stent showed a significant median survival benefit over TACE combined with a bare stent, with a median survival time of 203.0 ± 28.135 days versus 93.0 ± 24.341 days (p = 0.006). The propensity score-matched (24 pairs) cohort analyses (200 ± 31.231 days vs. 66 ± 23.270 days, p = 0.019). The oedema remission rate was 97.0 % in group A patients and 96.4 % in group B, respectively. TACE-irradiation stent and object tumor response were the independent prognostic factors of favorable survival.Conclusions:TACE combined with irradiation stent implantation is a safe and effective treatment modality for patients with HCC complicated by IVCTT and may extend their survival time.
