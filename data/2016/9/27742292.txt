Background:In October 2008, the Brazilian Ministry of Health authorized listing of downstaged hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for liver transplantation, according to a standardized protocol. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of patients submitted to liver transplantation after downstaging of HCC with the results other standard indications in Brazil.Methods:We conducted a retrospective analysis of 2,667 adult 1st elective deceased-donor liver transplantations registered at the database of the Transplant Notification Center of the SÃ£o Paulo State Health Secretariat. These cases are classified into 3 groups: "cirrhosis," including 1,709 patients transplanted because of end-stage liver disease; "Milan-HCC," including 873 HCC patients initially meeting the Milan criteria; and "downstaging" group, including 85 HCC patients submitted to tumor downstaging to the Milan criteria before liver transplantation.Results:One-, 3-, 5-, and 6-year patients survivals were, respectively, 82.7%, 72.0%, 66.1%, and 66.1%, in the "downstaging" group and 76.7%, 68.4%, 63.9%, and 63.5% in the "Milan-HCC" group (P = .483). At the same time intervals, patient survivals were 67.8%, 62.9%, 60.9%, and 60.2% in the "cirrhosis" group. These probabilities were significantly lower than those of both "downstaging" (P = .047) and "Milan-HCC" (P = .001) groups.Conclusions:Patients submitted to liver transplantation after downstaging of HCC, according to a Brazilian selection protocol, present long-term outcomes similar to HCC patients initially within the Milan criteria and better survival than recipients with end-stage liver disease.
