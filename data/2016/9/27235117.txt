ST6GalNAc I is the major Sialyl-Tn antigen (STn) synthase that is highly correlated with tumor invasion and metastasis. However, the roles and molecular mechanisms by which ST6GalNAc I mediates the malignant phenotypes of hepatocarcinoma cells still remain poorly unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of STn and ST6GalNAc I in mouse hepatocarcinoma cell lines Hca-F, Hca-P, and Hepa1-6, which have different metastatic potential, as compared with normal mouse liver cell line IAR-20. The results showed that the expression of ST6GalNAc I and STn in Hca-F and Hca-P cells was much higher than that in Hepa1-6 and IAR20 cells. Knockdown of ST6GalNAc I by shRNA in Hca-F cells significantly decreased the expression of STn and inhibited the growth of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. This reduction of ST6GalNAc I expression also led to the decreased migration and invasion of Hca-F cells. Furthermore, we found that ST6GalNAc I knockdown inhibited the expression levels of PI3k, p-Akt473, p-Akt308, NF-ÎºB, and their downstream molecules. Together, our results suggest a role of ST6GalNAc I in promoting the growth and invasion of hepatocarcinoma cells through regulating PI3K/AKT signaling, and ST6GalNAc I might be a promising marker for the prognosis and therapy of hepatocarcinoma.
