Risky alcohol use has significant individual health and social impacts, and is related to short- and long-term harm, including injuries, accidents, liver diseases, some cancers, cardiovascular diseases and alcohol dependence. The Get Healthy Information & Coaching Service (GHS) is a free telephone coaching service supporting adults 16 years or older to reduce weight, improve nutrition and increase physical activity. Tailored programs are available for Aboriginal people, pregnant women and people at risk of type 2 diabetes. The GHS provides an opportunity to implement a specific program for participants wishing to reduce or cease their alcohol consumption. This paper describes the processes used to develop an Alcohol Program for the GHS. It outlines the contributions from clinical and program experts, the evidence base for the program's development, clinical screening tools, training for health coaches and referral processes for participants. The Alcohol Program has the potential to provide effective coaching to adults to voluntarily reduce short- and long-term risky alcohol consumption.
