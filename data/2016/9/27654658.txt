Background:This study aims to evaluate immediate changes in perfusion parameters in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in C-arm computed tomography (CT) and volume perfusion CT (VPCT) and prediction of midterm tumor response.Methods:Twenty-five patients (median age 66, range 61 to 75 years) with 62 HCC lesions undergoing TACE received immediate pre- and post-interventional assessment by C-arm CT and VPCT. Cross-sectional imaging was analyzed at baseline and approximately 12 weeks after TACE according to modified RECIST criteria. Outcome was defined as objective response (OR, > 30 % reduction of viable tumor) or non-OR. Perfusion parameters were evaluated in C-arm CT [parenchymal blood volume (PBV)] and VPCT [blood volume (BV) and blood flow (BF)]. Ratios of perfusion parameters before and after TACE within the tumor and the non-affected liver parenchyma were calculated.Results:Correlation between tumor PBV and BV revealed a moderate correlation (rho = 0.45, p = 0.005). In non-affected liver parenchyma, a significant decrease in PBV was seen, compared to a significant increase in BF and BV. Perfusion ratios in HCC lesions were significantly (p Conclusions:Perfusion parameters acquired by C-arm CT and VPCT cannot simply be substituted by each other, but show similar capability in prediction of midterm tumor response.
