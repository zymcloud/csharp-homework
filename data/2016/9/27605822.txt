Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. It was reported to account for about 4.7 % of chronic liver disease in Egyptian patients. The present study aimed at studying the different factors that may be implicated in the relationship of schistosomiasis mansoni with HCC in Egypt. A total of 75 Egyptian patients with primary liver tumours (HCC) were enrolled in this study. They were subjected to full history taking and indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis. According to the results, the patients were categorized into two groups: Group I: 29 patients with negative IHA for schistosomiasis and hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive with no history or laboratory evidence of previous or current Schistosoma mansoni infection. Group II: 46 patients with positive IHA for schistosomiasis and HCV positive. The significant higher proportion of HCC patients in the present study had concomitant HCV and schistosomiasis (61.3 %) compared to HCC patients with HCV alone (38.7 %) suggesting that the co-infection had increased the incidence of HCC among these patients. Analysis of the age distribution among HCC patients revealed that patients in Group II were younger in age at time of diagnosis of HCC with mean age 57.1 years, as compared to patients in Group I with mean age 64.3 years with a highly significant statistical difference between the 2 groups. HCC in Group II was more common in rural residents while it was more common in urban areas in Group I with a significant statistical difference between the 2 groups. Analysis of the sex distribution among the studied groups showed that HCC was more common in males than females in both groups. As regards the aggression of HCC, it was more commonly multifocal and larger in size in patients with concomitant infection than in patients with HCV alone.
