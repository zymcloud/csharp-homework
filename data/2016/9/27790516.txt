Anal canal malignancy is one of the dreadful conditions. Most of the anal canal malignancies are squamous cell carcinomas for which the treatment is well established and the prognosis is usually favourable. Small cell carcinoma of anal canal is a very rare condition and poorly understood, which can present as haemorrhoids in its early stages and has an aggressive course. We present a case of small cell carcinoma of anal canal who underwent Abdomino Perineal Resection (APR) and chemotherapy. He developed liver metastasis during the course of chemotherapy and succumbed to the condition 4 months later.
