Objectives:Percutaneous ethanol ablation (PEA) is an effective method for treating small liver cancer. Microbubble-enhanced ultrasound (MEUS) can potentially promote PEA by disrupting the tumour's circulation. In this study, treatment combining MEUS and PEA was performed to find any synergistic effects in tumour ablation.Methods:Ten rats bearing subcutaneous Walker-256 tumours were treated by MEUS combined with PEA. The other 18 tumour-bearing rats that were treated by MEUS or PEA served as the controls. MEUS was conducted by therapeutic ultrasound (TUS) and microbubble injection. TUS was operated at a frequency of 831 KHz with a pressure amplitude of 4.3 MPa. Tumour blood perfusion was assessed by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), and the tumour necrosis rate was determined by histological examination.Results:CEUS showed that the tumour blood perfusion almost vanished in all of the MEUS-treated tumours. The contrast peak intensity dropped 84.8 % in the MEUS + PEA-treated tumours when compared to 46.3 % (p < 0.05) in the PEA-treated tumours 24 h after treatment. The tumour necrosis rate of the combination therapy was 97.50 %, which is much higher than that of the MEUS- (66.2 %) and PEA-treated (81.0 %) tumours.Conclusion:PEA combined with MEUS can induce a much more complete tumour necrosis.Key points:• This experiment demonstrated a novel method for enhancing percutaneous ethanol ablation. • Microbubble-enhanced therapeutic ultrasound is capable of disrupting tumour circulation. • Combined therapy of MEUS and PEA can induce more complete necrosis of tumours.
