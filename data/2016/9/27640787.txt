Objective:To investigate the effects of LCL161, a Smac mimetic, on the proliferation and apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and the underlying mechanisms.Methods:The effect of LCL161 on the cell viability of HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells was measured by MTT assay. The effect of LCL161 at lower concentrations on the proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells was detected by colony formation assay. Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry with PI staining. The mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by JC-1 staining. The expression of PARP, p-Akt, cIAP1 and XIAP protein was analyzed by Western blot.Results:LCL161 displayed notable antiproliferative activity on HCC cells at the concentrations of 1-16 Î¼mol/L (PConclusion:LCL161 possesses significant anti-proliferative activity and pro-apoptotic action in HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells, which might be correlated with reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, down-regulation of p-Akt and degradation of cIAP1.
