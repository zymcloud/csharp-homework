Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive human Mac-2-binding protein (WFA(+)-M2BP) was developed recently as a predictive marker of progression to liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients seropositive for hepatitis C virus (HCV). We retrospectively analyzed 16 HCV-seropositive patients who received systemic chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies to evaluate the usefulness of WFA(+)-M2BP for predicting HCV-related complications. These were defined as the onset of significant liver damage (LD) with increased HCV RNA levels, leading to interrupted or discontinued chemotherapy or the occurrence of HCC after chemotherapy. Baseline WFA(+)-M2BP levels were determined using preserved serum samples. The median level of WFA(+)-M2BP was 1.59 [cutoff index (C.O.I.) value range 0.38-6.66]. With a median follow-up of 623 days (range 120-2404), LD and HCC were observed in three and two patients, respectively. Detectable HCV RNA and WFA(+)-M2BP â‰¥2.0 C.O.I. at baseline were identified as risk factors for these HCV-related complications (P = 0.034 and P = 0.005, respectively). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the WFA(+)-M2BP level (cutoff point: 2.0 C.O.I.) for the occurrence of HCV-related complications were 100.0, 81.8, 71.4, and 100.0 %, respectively. WFA(+)-M2BP may be a useful marker for the prediction of HCV-related complications in HCV-seropositive patients following systemic chemotherapy.
