We have investigated the co-addition of hexadecylphosphocholine (HePC) and a Tat derived peptide (Tat), coupled to Maleimide-PEG2000-DSPE pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in many respects, including drug and liposome cellular delivery, drug release, biodistribution, in vivo cell delivery and antitumor activity. The liposomes were HePC-free and -containing liposomes, from which liposomes with 25, 50, 100 and 200 numbers of Tat/liposome were prepared. Similarly, DiI-C18 (3)-model liposomes (DiI-L and DiI-HePC-L) were prepared. HePC and Tat increased cellular delivery of Dox and cytotoxicity in B16F0 melanoma and C26 colon carcinoma cells. Tat enhanced liposome-cell interaction and caused Dox burst release. HePC and Tat reduced the serum retention time of liposomal Dox, slightly and dramatically, respectively. In comparison, Tat-liposomes enhanced Dox delivery to liver and spleen cells 3h post-injection. Likewise, Dox content of these tissues and tumor was lower at 24h. The naÃ¯ve liposomes retarded tumor growth more effectively and their related median survival time of the treated C26 bearing BALB/c mice was longer than those of Tat-liposomes (MST>45days versus MST<38days). Overall liposomes exhibiting sustained drug release and negligible cell interaction were more suitable delivery systems in targeting cancerous tumors and suppressing their growth.
