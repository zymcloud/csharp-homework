Purpose:To evaluate the usefulness of magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) in detecting the clinical progression of cirrhosis from Child-Pugh class A to B in patients with hepatitis C.Materials and methods:We reviewed the data of 101 consecutive patients with type C viral hepatitis and clinically suspected cirrhosis who fulfilled the all following criteria: available MRE at 1.5 Tesla (T) or 3.0T and laboratory tests within a month, Child-Pugh class A, platelet count less than 155 × 10(3) /μL, no clinical history of hepatocellular carcinoma, and ≥6 months of follow-up after MRE. We longitudinally analyzed the incidence of cirrhosis progression as defined by the clinical progression from Child-Pugh class A to B at two subsequent follow-up points. Risk of cirrhosis progression was assessed by Cox analyses and Kaplan-Meyer methods.Results:Cirrhosis progression was noted in 25 patients during the follow-up period. Liver stiffness (hazard ratio [HR] by 1 kPa increase = 1.397; P = 0.0074), Child-Pugh score of 6 versus score 5 (HR of 3.085; P = 0.0276), and treatment responses to anti-viral therapy versus nonresponse (HR of Conclusion:MRE is useful to stratify the risk of cirrhosis progression in patients with hepatitis C.
