Background:Hypovascular nodules often occur together with hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it remains controversial whether hypovascular nodules associated with hypervascular HCC have any prognostic value. This study evaluated the prognostic impact of hypovascular nodules co-existing with hypervascular HCC as diagnosed by computed tomography during arterial portography (CTAP) and computed tomography during hepatic arteriography (CTHA), which can sensitively capture the dynamic changes in blood flow through the portal vein and hepatic artery in patients with early stage HCC.Methods:A total of 152 patients with hypervascular HCC (≤ 30 mm, ≤ 3 nodules), who underwent initial local ablation, were analyzed retrospectively. All patients received CTAP and CTHA prior to treatment. Overall survival (OS) was compared among group A (hypervascular HCC only, 107 patients) and group B (hypovascular nodules and hypervascular HCC, 45 patients).Results:Among all hypovascular nodules, 81% (46 of 57) developed hypervascularization within the follow-up period. The 1- and 2-year hypervascularization rates were 17% and 51%, respectively. OS was significantly longer for group A than for group B (P Conclusion:The prognosis of hypervascular HCC patients with hypovascular nodules detected during CTAP and CTHA is poor. Clinical HCC categories seem to be dissimilar between patients with and without hypovascular nodules.
