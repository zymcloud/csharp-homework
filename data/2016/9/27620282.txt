The patients of liver cirrhosis associated with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) can be effectively treated by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPS). Although the corresponding TIPS procedures have already performed on the patients to different types of PVT, the procedures are not specific and the relationship between different types of PVT and technical success rate of TIPS is unclear. What's more, we aimed to explore the relationship between survival and vascular patency immediately after TIPS. 191 subjects underwent retrospective assessment. Appropriate TIPS procedures were performed based on our more specific classification. The overall success rate of TIPS was 95.8% (183/191). Success rate was significantly different between Grade II and Grade IV thrombosis (χ(2) = 5.294, P = 0.021). The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-and 5-year survival rates were 95.6%, 89.1%, 83.1%, 76.5% and 67.8%, respectively. The overall survival time of completely patent PV and incomplete patent PV immediately after TIPS was 57.05 ± 0.75 vs. 39.12 ± 2.64 months, respectively (P < 0.0001). We conclude that appropriate TIPS procedures and lower grade of PVT are essential for better technical success rate of TIPS. The patency of target vessels is important for survival.
