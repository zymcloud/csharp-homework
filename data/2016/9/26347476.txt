Background:Effective surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in diabetes mellitus (DM) has not been established. We elucidated the risk factors for HCC in DM patients.Methods:From 2000 to 2014, 80 patients diagnosed with HCC for the first time who had concomittant DM but no other etiology of liver disease were enrolled as the DM-HCC group. From 2005 October to 2014, after introduction of the abdominal ultrasonography (US) report database, 2083 DM patients with no viral hepatitis, no known autoimmune hepatic diseases, and/or no evidence of alcohol abuse (>60 g/day) were enrolled as the DM-US group. Findings from the first US screening were evaluated. "Elderly" patients were defined as those aged >65 years. Clinical features of DM-HCC patients were evaluated and compared with those of DM-US patients.Results:In the DM-HCC group (54 men, 26 women), the mean (± SD age was 74.1 ± 8.5 years, and mean HbA1c and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index were 7.3 ± 1.3% and 4.50 ± 3.42, respectively. Mean tumor diameter was 5.7 ± 3.5 cm, there were 63/13/2/2 patients classified as Child-Pugh A/B/C/unknown, and 56/24 were single/multiple lesions. In the DM-US group, HCC was detected in three patients (0.14%; 0.3% of those classified as elderly). The mean age and FIB-4 index of these three patients (one man, two women) were 75.6 years (range 67-92 years) and 4.84 (range 2.87-6.98), respectively. Mean tumor diamter was 7.6 cm and there were one and two single and multiple lesions, respectively. In elderly DM-US patients with a high FIB-4 index (≥4), the rate of HCC detection was 5.0%.Conclusions:Being elderly and having a high FIB-4 index are characteristic features of DM-HCC. Similar characteristics were noted for patients with HCC in the DM-US group. HCC surveillance with US is recommended for DM patients, especially those who are elderly (≥65 years) and have a high FIB-4 index.
