Evidence indicates that hepatic fibrosis is the initial lesion of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma in diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). To induce NASH, we fed rats a choline-deficient and iron-supplemented L-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet. Histopathological examination revealed that fibrosis appeared from week 4 and progressed to bridging fibrosis from week 12. Using qRT-PCR assays, we detected increased expression of miR-21, Mmp-9, and Timp-1 in liver that peaked during week 4, when fibrosis was first detected. The expression pattern of miR-21 in plasma paralleled that in liver. Fibrosis tended to be resolved within 12 weeks of a recovery period after 12 weeks of feeding, and the expression of miR-21, Timp-1, and Mmp-9 decreased in liver. Comprehensive analyses of miRNA and mRNA expression in the liver using samples acquired at week 4 detected 16 miRNAs and 11 mRNAs that are mutually-interacting fibrosis-related factors. We therefore conclude that miR-21 was closely associated with fibrosis in a rat model of NASH and has potential as a plasma biomarker for hepatic fibrosis.
