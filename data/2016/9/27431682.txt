Thyroid hormone receptor β1 (TRβ1) is a ligand‑dependent transcription factor that belongs to the superfamily of nuclear receptors. TRβ1 has been found to act as a tumor suppressor in many solid tumors including breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, but its role in the progression of human colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. In this study, microarray data analysis revealed that TRβ1 mRNA was downregulated in CRC tumors compared with that in the normal counterparts in both The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Using a CRC tissue microarray (TMA), we confirmed that the expression of TRβ1 was decreased in human CRC tumor tissues in contrast to normal colorectal mucosal tissues. Notably, the TRβ1 expression was strongly correlated with tumor size (p=0.045). Furthermore, we found that CRC cell proliferation and migration were significantly inhibited by TRβ1 overexpression in vitro. Mechanistic studies indicated that activated phosphorylated Akt was clearly suppressed by TRβ1 in the CRC tissues and cells. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that TRβ1 plays a critical role in the progression of CRC via the PI3K/Akt pathway, and the TRβ1 gene may represent a novel target for CRC therapeutics.
