Aim:To develop a prognostic scoring system for overall survival (OS) of patients undergoing liver resection (LR) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Consecutive patients who underwent curative LR for HCC between 2000 and 2013 were identified. The series was randomly divided into a training and a validation set. A multivariable Cox model for OS was fitted to the training set. The beta coefficients derived from the Cox model were used to define a prognostic scoring system for OS. The survival stratification was then tested, and the prognostic scoring system was compared with the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)/American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) surgical criteria by means of Harrell's C statistics.Results:A total of 917 patients were considered. Five variables independently correlated with post-LR survival: Model for End-stage Liver Disease score, hepatitis C virus infection, number of nodules, largest diameter and vascular invasion. Three risk classes were identified, and OS for the three risk classes was significantly different both in the training (P Conclusion:This study established a new prognostic scoring system that may stratify HCC patients suitable for surgery, expanding surgical eligibility with respect to EASL/AASLD criteria with no harm on survival.
