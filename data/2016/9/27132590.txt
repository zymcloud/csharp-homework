Purpose:The goal of this study was to prospectively compare the sensitivity of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with that of multiphase multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) in the preoperative detection of hepatic metastases.Materials and method:Forty-eight patients, with a mean age of 62years old (range: 43-85years) were prospectively included. All patients underwent CEUS following intravenous administration of 2.4mL of an ultrasound contrast agent (Sonovue(Â®), Bracco, Milan, Italy) and multiphase MDCT. Intraoperative ultrasound examination (IOUS) was used as the standard of reference.Results:A total of 158 liver metastases were identified by IOUS, 127 by preoperative MDCT (sensitivity; 80.4%) and 102 by CEUS (sensitivity, 64.5%). The 15.9% difference in sensitivity between CEUS and MDCT was statistically significant (P=0.002). There was a disagreement between IOUS and CEUS in 23 patients (47%) and in 13 patients (27%) between IOUS and MDCT. MDCT identified one or more additional metastases in 10 patients (20%) resulting in a change in the surgical strategy.Conclusion:Based on an unselected patient cohort and using multiphase MDCT, CEUS is significantly inferior to MDCT for the preoperative detection of hepatic metastases of colorectal cancer.
