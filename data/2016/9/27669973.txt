Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a more severe form of NAFLD and causes subsequent pathological changes including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Inflammation is the key pathological change in NASH and involves a series of cytokines and chemokines. The C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10), which is known as a pro-inflammation chemokine, was recently proven to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of NASH. Hepatic CXCL10 is mainly secreted by hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelium. By binding to its specific receptor CXCR3, CXCL10 recruits activated CXCR3+ T lymphocytes and macrophages to parenchyma and promotes inflammation, apoptosis and fibrosis. The circulating CXCL10 level correlates with the severity of lobular inflammation and is an independent risk factor for NASH patients. Thus, CXCL10 may be both a potential prognostic tool and a therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with NASH. The aim of this review is to highlight the growing advances in basic knowledge and clinical interest of CXCL10 in NASH to propagate new insights into novel pharmacotherapeutic avenues.
