Purpose:To develop a modified assessment for retreatment with transarterial chemoembolization (mART) score that may be more suitable for Chinese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Chinese patients with HCC who were treated with transarterial chemoembolization in four hospitals were included. A univariate analysis and a multivariate forward Cox regression analysis were used to identify significant prognostic factors of overall survival (OS). A point scoring model was subsequently developed from the training cohort, and the validation process was performed in the validation cohort.Results:The study included 259 patients (124 patients in the training cohort and 135 patients in the validation cohort). Increase in Child-Pugh scores relative to the baseline (P Conclusions:In Chinese patients with HCC, mART score of > 2.5 before second transarterial chemoembolization was associated with poor prognosis. The mART score was probably better validated compared with the ART score.
