The aim of this study was to examine the possibilities of measuring ADC/DWI values with the ROI method for precise differentiation of focal liver lesions from normal liver parenchyma. The study included 100 liver lesions sized â‰¥1 cm, previously detected in patients by ultrasound and computed tomography. It is done by measuring the diffusion coefficient ADC folder (MRI 3T), setting the ROI on the periphery of hepatic lesions, on the liver parenchyma around the focal hepatic lesions and on liver parenchyma that is distant to hepatic lesions. In our study, difference between the average ADC value of focal liver lesions (1.24 x10(-3) mm(2)/s) and normal liver parenchyma around focal liver lesions (1.001x10(-3) mm(2)/s) was statistically confirmed. There was statistically proven difference in the average ADC values between normal liver parenchyma around focal lesions and liver parenchyma located distant from focal lesions of (1.003x10-3 mm2/s). Wilcoxon rank test yielded differences in the average (median) ADC values between total lesions in patients and liver parenchyma directly around focal lesions (p
