We report the case of 55-year-old female with biopsy-proven clear cell renal cell carcinoma with a suspicious lesion found in the liver who presented for right radical nephrectomy and partial hepatectomy. Histologic evaluation of the hepatic specimen demonstrated metastatic renal cell carcinoma within a hepatic hemangioma. Herein we provide a review of the literature for this uncommon scenario.
hepatic hemangioma; renal cell carcinoma; tumor-to-tumor metastasis; vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
