Human hepatoma cells (HepG2) were exposed to purified cylindrospermopsin (CYN), a potent toxicant for eukaryotic cells produced by several cyanobacteria. Exposure to 10 μg l-1 of CYN for 24 h resulted in alteration of expression of 48 proteins, from which 26 were identified through mass spectrometry. Exposure to 100 μg l-1 of CYN for 24 h affected nuclear area and actin filaments intensity, which can be associated with cell proliferation and toxicity. The proteins are implicated in different biological processes: protein folding, xenobiotic efflux, antioxidant defense, energy metabolism and cell anabolism, cell signaling, tumorigenic potential, and cytoskeleton structure. Protein profile indicates that CYN exposure may lead to alteration of glucose metabolism that can be associated with the supply of useful energy to cells respond to chemical stress and proliferate. Increase of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels observed in HepG2 cells can associate with cell proliferation and resistance. Increase of MRP3 and glutathione peroxidase can protect cells against some chemicals and ROS. CYN exposure also led to alteration of the expression of cytoskeleton proteins, which may be associated with cell proliferation and toxicity.
