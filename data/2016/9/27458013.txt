Innate immune responses are important for pathogen elimination and adaptive immune response activation. However, excess inflammation may contribute to immunopathology and disease progression (e.g. inflammation-associated hepatocellular carcinoma). Immune modulation resulting from pattern recognition receptor-induced responses is a potential strategy for controlling immunopathology and related diseases. This study demonstrates that the mycotoxin patulin suppresses Toll-like receptor- and RIG-I/MAVS-dependent cytokine production through GSH depletion, mitochondrial dysfunction, the activation of p62-associated mitophagy, and p62-TRAF6 interaction. Blockade of autophagy restored the immunosuppressive activity of patulin, and pharmacological activation of p62-dependent mitophagy directly reduced RIG-I-like receptor-dependent inflammatory cytokine production. These results demonstrated that p62-dependent mitophagy has an immunosuppressive role to innate immune response and might serve as a potential immunomodulatory target for inflammation-associated diseases.
