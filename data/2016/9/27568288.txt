Karyopherinβ1 (KPNB1), one of the cytosolic factors involved in the selective protein transport across nucleus, docked at nuclear pore complex and transported through nuclear envelope in an ATP-dependent style, assisting proteins to be recognized as import substrates. It has been reported to be bound up with the origination and progress of lung cancer, cervical cancer, head and neck cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. In current study, we demonstrated for the first time that the role of KPNB1 in human glioma. KPNB1 was over-expressed as the well-known trend of Ki-67(p
