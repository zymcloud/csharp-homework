Background:Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections remain one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Healthcare initiatives for chronic viral hepatitis to facilitate early diagnosis and linkage to care in an effort to reduce inpatient resource utilization associated with late diagnosis and end-stage liver disease have been partially successful.Aims:Our objective was to determine the impact of liver-related complications from chronic HBV and HCV infections on inpatient cost of care, length of stay, and mortality.Methods:Using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, National Inpatient Sample (HCUP-NIS), we studied the impact of chronic HBV and HCV infections on inpatient healthcare system following hospitalizations from 2003 to 2012.Results:Of the 79,185,729 million hospitalizations among adult patients in the USA from 2003 to 2012, 143,896 (0.18 %) hospitalizations were HBV related and 1,073,269 (1.36 %) hospitalizations HCV related. HBV hospitalizations had a higher inpatient mortality (OR 1.34; 95 % CI 1.30, 1.38), median cost of care per hospitalization (+$2100.33; 95 % CI 1982.53, 2217.53), and increased length of hospitalization stay (+0.64 days; 95 % CI 0.60, 0.68; p Conclusions:Despite higher per case resource utilization following hospitalization, HBV-infected patients demonstrate a lower inpatient survival in comparison with chronic HCV infection. These disparate observations underscore the need for early diagnosis of chronic HBV infection in at-risk population and prompt linkage to care.
