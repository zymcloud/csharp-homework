Background:Over 2 billion people are infected with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and about 240 million are chronic carriers of the virus. Chronic HBV infection is an important cause of liver cancer. The infectivity of HBV is hundred times higher than the HIV virus yet it receives comparatively little attention in public health. The study assessed knowledge and awareness of HBV among pregnant women in the Kintampo Municipality of Ghana.Methods:A cross-sectional survey was conducted among pregnant women attending antenatal clinic in two facilities between September 2010 and November 2010. We performed analysis to determine factors associated with hepatitis B awareness.Results:Forty-one percent of the 504 women were aware of hepatitis B viral infection, 33.5% of the women were able to correctly mention the transmission routes of Hepatitis B. The radio was the most (42%) mentioned source of information on HBV and the least source of information were places of worship (2.7%).After adjusting for other factors, level of education; SSS/SHS and above OR=4.2, P<00.1, 95% CI (2.5, 7.0) and occupation (Civil servant/Student); OR= 3.8, P00.1, 95% CI (1.7, 8.5) were the important predictors of Hepatitis B awareness.Conclusion:There is a low level of knowledge and awareness of HBV among pregnant women in this municipality. This could potentially hamper effective HBV prevention and control in Ghana. Education on hepatitis B need to be included in health promotion activities.Funding:The study was funded by KHRC Director's small grant Initiative.
