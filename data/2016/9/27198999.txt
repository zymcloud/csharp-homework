Background:A distal pancreatectomy with en bloc celiac axis resection (DP-CAR) is indicated for left-sided locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. However, ischemic complication resulting from the sacrifice of the common hepatic artery and left gastric artery (LGA) remain problematic. The aim of this study was to analyze the feasibility of DP-CAR with preservation or reconstruction of the left gastric artery.Method:Between April 2011 and December 2014, we treated 17 cases using DP-CAR with preservation or reconstruction of the LGA. If the tumor had involved the LGA, the LGA was dissected and reconstructed using the middle colic artery. We retrospectively analyzed the feasibility of this procedure.Results:Among 17 consecutive patients who underwent DP-CAR, the LGA was preserved in 13 patients and reconstructed in four patients. Major postoperative complications were observed in seven cases (41 %). A pancreatic fistula (grade B/C) or delayed gastric emptying (grade B/C) occurred in 7 (41 %) and 2 (12 %) cases, respectively. The overall R0 resection rate was 94 % (16/17). Eleven cases developed recurrences (liver, n = 4; lymph nodes, n = 2; peritoneal dissemination, n = 2; lung, n = 2; local recurrence, n = 1). The overall 1- and 3-year postoperative survival rates were 74 and 45 %, respectively.Conclusions:Our preliminary data showed that DP-CAR with preservation or reconstruction of the LGA is a safe and feasible approach, and that this procedure may reduce the risk of ischemic complications.
