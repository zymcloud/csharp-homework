Purpose To establish the prognostic value of biopsy of the central and marginal ablation zones for time to local tumor progression (LTP) after radiofrequency (RF) ablation of colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CLM). Materials and Methods A total of 47 patients with 67 CLMs were enrolled in this prospective institutional review board-approved and HIPAA-compliant study between November 2009 and August 2012. Mean tumor size was 2.1 cm (range, 0.6-4.3 cm). Biopsy of the center and margin of the ablation zone was performed immediately after RF ablation (mean number of biopsy samples per ablation zone, 1.9) and was evaluated for the presence of viable tumor cells. Samples containing tumor cells at morphologic evaluation were further interrogated with immunohistochemistry and were classified as either positive, viable tumor (V) or negative, necrotic (N). Minimal ablation margin size was evaluated in the first postablation CT study performed 4-8 weeks after ablation. Variables were evaluated as predictors of time to LTP with the competing-risks model (uni- and multivariate analyses). Results Technical effectiveness was evident in 66 of 67 (98%) ablated lesions on the first contrast material-enhanced CT images at 4-8-week follow-up. The cumulative incidence of LTP at 12-month follow-up was 22% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12, 32). Samples from 16 (24%) of 67 ablation zones were classified as viable tumor. At univariate analysis, tumor size, minimal margin size, and biopsy results were significant in predicting LTP. When these variables were subsequently entered in a multivariate model, margin size of less than 5 mm (P < .001; hazard ratio [HR], 6.7) and positive biopsy results (P = .008; HR, 3.4) were significant. LTP within 12 months after RF ablation was noted in 3% (95% CI: 0, 9) of necrotic CLMs with margins of at least 5 mm. Conclusion Biopsy proof of complete tumor ablation and minimal ablation margins of at least 5 mm are independent predictors of LTP and yield the best oncologic outcomes. (Â©) RSNA, 2016.
