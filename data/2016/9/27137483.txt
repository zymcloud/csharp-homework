Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TPIAT) is being used increasingly as a definitive treatment for chronic pancreatitis. Patients with chronic pancreatitis have an elevated risk of pancreatic cancer, which can also masquerade as acute or chronic pancreatitis, making the diagnosis challenging. We describe here the first case of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma developing in the liver of a patient after TPIAT for presumed benign chronic pancreatitis. Retrospective analysis of the patient's preoperative serum revealed normal carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen levels but elevated levels of microRNAs -10b, -30c, and -106b compared with controls. Screening guidelines are important to reduce the risk of transplantation of malignant tissue. More sensitive screening tools, including the potential use of microRNAs, are needed to detect early preclinical disease, given the highly malignant nature of pancreatic cancer.
