Introduction:The role of preoperative serum-based markers in predicting survival outcomes of patients has been reported for several cancer types; however, their association with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) prognosis is unclear. We evaluated the role of systemic serum-based markers in predicting adverse pathological features and survival outcomes in patients surgically treated for high-grade (HG) UTUC.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing surgery for HG UTUC between June 2006 and July 2013 at our institution. Comprehensive clinicopathologic data and preoperative serum-based markers including hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count, serum albumin, calcium, and liver function tests were recorded. Associations of serum markers with pathologic features and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were determined by logistic and Cox regression analyses, respectively. The concordance index for the oncologic outcomes model was determined.Results:In total, 101 patients were identified with a median follow-up of 18.5 months (range: 1-74mo). In all, 60% of patients had pT2 or less and 11% had nodal metastases. Preoperative elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (≥116IU/l) was associated with multiple adverse pathologic features including advanced T stage, lymphovascular invasion, and histologic necrosis. On univariate analysis, serum markers independently associated with RFS included hemoglobin≤12.9 (hazards ratio [HR] = 2.51; 95% CI: 1.17-5.36, P = 0.018), albumin≤4g/dl (HR = 4.4; 95% CI: 2.04-9.30; P<0.0001), ALP≥116U/l (HR = 13.3; 95% CI: 5.3-33.52, P<0.0001), alanine transaminase≥27 (HR = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.11-6.21, P = 0.028), serum aspartate transaminase≥20 (HR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.04-4.69, P = 0.038), and corrected calcium≥9.3 (HR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.01-5.93, P = 0.047). The 2 strongest predictors, albumin and ALP, were combined to form an AA score (range: 0-2), which improved the baseline preoperative clinical model concordance index for prediction of RFS from 0.626 to 0.799.Conclusion:In HG UTUC, elevated preoperative ALP was associated with adverse pathologic features. Additionally, elevated ALP and low albumin were independently associated with worse RFS and overall survival. These serum-based markers are often measured in the preoperative workup of UTUC, and thus they can be included in future prognostic models to risk stratify patients.
