Hereditary haemochromatosis is a multisystem disorder of iron metabolism. Hepatic manifestations include hepatomegaly, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma is almost always preceded by cirrhosis. We present a case of an 83-year-old man without history of liver disease or iron overload who presented with abdominal pain. Workup revealed mildly elevated transaminases, ferritin of 3996 and a solitary liver tumour. Biopsy was consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma in a background of haemosiderosis without cirrhosis. He was diagnosed with hereditary haemochromatosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. He underwent a partial hepatectomy and was started on routine phlebotomy and surveillance imaging. He has improved and has not had signs of recurrence or new complications of haemochromatosis. We suggest a possible reason for his unique and late presentation.
