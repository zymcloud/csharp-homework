Background:Both iodine-125 implantation and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) are feasible options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the research is to investigate whether iodine-125 implantation combined with TACE could improve the overall survival of patients with HCC of 3-5cm.Methods:144 patients with HCC of 3-5cm who underwent iodine-125 implantation plus TACE and TACE alone were retrospectively enrolled in this study. To reduce the selection bias, 55 matched pairs of patients were generated by propensity score matching (PSM). Their overall survival was compared by the Kaplan-Meier method. Independent prognostic factors were identified by Cox proportional hazards regression model.Results:patients receiving iodine-125 implantation plus TACE have significantly better overall survival than patients receiving TACE alone (PConclusion:for HCC patients of 3-5cm for whom surgical intervention is not an option, iodine-125 implantation combined with TACE might be an effective and viable alternative to provide better overall survival.
