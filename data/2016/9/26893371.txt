Background/aims:Although LIN28A is known to potentially play a role in the oncogenesis of various cancers, whether LIN28A expression is a predictor of poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer has not been fully explored. We sought to evaluate clinicopathological characteristics according to the expression of LIN28A in numerous gastric cancer tissue samples.Methods:LIN28A expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of a tissue microarray comprising 288 gastric cancer tissues and 288 adjacent normal tissues. Clinicopathological characteristics, including overall survival, were compared according to LIN28A expression.Results:The IHC staining score was lower for the cancer tissues than the normal tissues (p<0.001). However, no significant differences were observed in the clinicopathological characteristics between the low and high LIN28A expression groups. In addition, the 5-year overall survival rate did not differ between the two groups: 75.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69.3% to 81.7%) versus 71.6% (95% CI, 63.3% to 80.9%) for low versus high expression, respectively.Conclusions:The expression of LIN28A did not appear to play a distinct role in predicting the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with gastric cancer. In addition, LIN28A expression was not an independently associated factor for overall survival in patients with gastric cancer.
