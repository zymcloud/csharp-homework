Objectives:Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that infects over 50% of the human population worldwide. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that H. pylori may cause liver diseases, and the underlying relationship between H. pylori infection and chronic hepatitis B has attracted much attention. This study aimed to examine the association between H. pylori infection and the progression of chronic hepatitis B in the Chinese population.Methods:A search was performed of the PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases, as well as the Chinese databases, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang Data, for studies published between January 1, 1994 and November 1, 2015.Results:In total, 2977 patients were included in the chronic hepatitis B group, while 1668 participants were included in the healthy control group. The prevalence of H. pylori among patients with chronic hepatitis B was significantly higher than that among those without chronic hepatitis B. The pooled odds ratio was 3.17. In the subgroup analysis, the odds ratio was 4.28 for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis and 6.02 for hepatocellular carcinoma.Conclusion:These results indicate a strong relationship between H. pylori and chronic hepatitis B, particularly during HBV progression.
