To explore the potential of theanine against cancer, we have studied the anticancer activities of theanine from tea and its semisynthesized derivative, (R)-2-(6,8-dibromo-2-oxo-2H-chromene-3-carboxamido)-5-(ethylamino)-5-oxopentanoic ethyl ester (DTBrC), in in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HHC). Theanine and DTBrC displayed inhibitory effects on the growth and migration of HHC cells in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Theanine and DTBrC significantly enhanced the repression of HHC cell growth in combination with anticancer drug pirarubicin. Theanine and DTBrC completely suppressed HGF- and EGF+HGF-induced migration with a reduction of p53 tumor suppressor level and enhanced the p53 protein expression in HHC cells. The Akt and NF-κB knockdown greatly reduced cancer cell migration with a decrease in CD44 expression. DTBrC and theanine significantly repressed the protein expressions in the Met/EGFR/VEGFR-Akt/NF-κB pathways, which might be the mechanism for their biologic effects.
