Aim:To evaluate the virological and clinical characteristics of occult HBV infection (OBI) in 68 consecutive HBsAg-negative patients with biopsy-proven cirrhosis and HCC.Methods:HBV DNA was sought and sequenced in plasma, HCC tissue and non-HCC liver tissue by PCRs using primers for HBV core, surface and x regions. OBI was identified by the presence of HBV DNA in at least two different PCRs.Results:OBI was detected in HCC tissue of 13 (20%) patients and in non-HCC liver tissue of 3 of these 13. OBI was detected in HCC tissue of 54.5% of 11 anti-HBs- negative/anti-HBc-positive patients, in 29.4% of 17 anti-HBs/anti-HBc-positive and in 5% of 40 anti-HBs/anti-HBc-negative (p Conclusions:The study showed a significant correlation between OBI and the severity of liver damage, several patterns of mutations in the S, pre-S1 and pre-S2 regions in HCC tissue, some at their first description.
HBsAg mutants; anti-HBc positivity; hepatocellular carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; occult HBV infection.
