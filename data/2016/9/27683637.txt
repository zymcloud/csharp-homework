Aim:To describe the thromboelastography (TEG) "reference" values within a population of liver transplant (LT) candidates that underline the differences from healthy patients.Methods:Between 2000 and 2013, 261 liver transplant patients with a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score between 15 and 40 were studied. In particular the adult patients (aged 18-70 years) underwent to a first LT with a MELD score between 15 and 40 were included, while all patients with acute liver failure, congenital bleeding disorders, and anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet drug use were excluded. In this population of cirrhotic patients, preoperative haematological and coagulation laboratory tests were collected, and the pretransplant thromboelastographic parameters were studied and compared with the parameters measured in a previously studied population of 40 healthy subjects. The basal TEG parameters analysed in the cirrhotic population of liver candidates were as follows: Reaction time (r), coagulation time (k), Angle-Rate of polymerization of clot (α Angle), Maximum strenght of clot (MA), Amplitudes of the TEG tracing at 30 min and 60 min after MA is measured (A30 and A60), and Fibrinolysis at 30 and 60 min after MA (Ly30 and Ly60). The possible correlation between the distribution of the reference range and the gender, age, MELD score (higher or lower than 20) and indications for transplantation (liver pathology) were also investigated. In particular, a MELD cut-off value of 20 was chosen to verify the possible correlation between the thromboelastographic reference range and MELD score.Results:Most of the TEG reference values from patients with end-stage liver disease were significantly different from those measured in the healthy population and were outside the suggested normal ranges in up to 79.3% of subjects. Wide differences were found among all TEG variables, including r (41.5% of the values), k (48.6%), α (43.7%), MA (79.3%), A30 (74.4%) and A60 (80.9%), indicating a prevailing trend to hypocoagulability. The differences between the mean TEG values obtained from healthy subjects and the cirrhotic population were statistically significant for r (P = 0.039), k (P Conclusion:The range and distribution of TEG values in cirrhotic patients differ from those of healthy subjects, suggesting that a specific thromboelastographic reference range is required for liver transplant candidates.
