Background & aims:We investigated potential aetiologies, clinical characteristics and prognosis of non-B non-C (NBNC) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in hepatitis B virus (HBV) endemic area, according to potential causes such as previous HBV exposure, chronic alcohol intake and metabolic syndrome.Patients and methods:Among 4690 HCC patients treated at Asan Medical Center between 2007 and 2009, 523 were newly diagnosed with NBNC HCC, and their medical records and survival data were analyzed retrospectively.Results:Among 321 NBNC HCC patients whose hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) test results were available, 81.0%, 37.1% and 15.5% had anti-HBc positivity, chronic alcohol intake and metabolic syndrome respectively. One-hundred and fifty-two patients (47.4%) had previous exposure to HBV without chronic alcohol intake or metabolic syndrome. Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) was positive in 48.0% of the 523 NBNC HCC patients, which was much lower than that in general Korean population, and 52.3% of anti-HBc-positive NBNC HCC patients were negative for anti-HBs. Anti-HBc-negative alcoholic patients presented with more advanced cirrhosis with Child-Pugh class B/C liver function than anti-HBc-positive patients (P = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, baseline liver function, alpha-foetoprotein levels and tumour stage were significant prognostic factors and aetiology did not affect patient survival.Conclusions:Prior HBV infection could be a potential aetiology in over 40% of NBNC HCC patients in HBV endemic area. Positivity for anti-HBc and negativity for anti-HBs may be a serologic surrogate marker for occult HBV infection in these area. The prognosis of NBNC HCC was determined by tumour stage and underlying liver function.
