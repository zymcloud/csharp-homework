Interleukin-6 (IL-6), one of the most important inflammatory cytokines, plays a pivotal role in metastasis and stemness of solid tumors. However, the underlying mechanisms of IL-6 in HCC metastasis remain unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that stemness and metastatic potential of HCC cells were significantly enhanced after IL-6 stimulation. IL-6 could induce expression of osteopontin (OPN), along with other stemness-related genes, including HIF1Î±, BMI1, and HEY1. Block of OPN induction could significantly abrogate the effect of IL-6 on stemness and metastasis of HCC cells. Furthermore, IL-6 level was positively correlated with OPN in HCC. Patients with high plasma IL-6 or OPN level had poorer prognosis. In multivariate analysis, IL-6 and OPN were demonstrated to be independent prognostic indicators for HCC patients, and their combination had a better prognostic performance than IL-6 or OPN alone. Collectively, our findings indicate that IL-6 could enhance stemness and promote metastasis of HCC via up-regulating OPN expression, which can be a potential therapeutic target for combating HCC metastasis, and the combination of IL-6 and OPN serves as a promising prognostic predictor for HCC.
