MicroRNA-7 (miR-7)has been characterized as an anti-oncogenic microRNA (miRNA) in several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanism for the regulation of miR-7 production in tumors remains unclear. Here, we identified nuclear factor 90 (NF90) and NF45 complex (NF90-NF45) as negative regulators of miR-7 processing in HCC. Expression of NF90 and NF45 was significantly elevated in primary HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. To examine which miRNAs are controlled by NF90-NF45, we performed an miRNA microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analyses of HCC cell lines. Depletion of NF90 resulted in elevated levels of mature miR-7, whereas the expression of primary miR-7-1 (pri-miR-7-1) was decreased in cells following knockdown of NF90. Conversely, the levels of mature miR-7 were reduced in cells overexpressing NF90 and NF45, although pri-miR-7-1 was accumulated in the same cells. Furthermore, NF90-NF45 was found to bind pri-miR-7-1 in vitro These results suggest that NF90-NF45 inhibits the pri-miR-7-1 processing step through the binding of NF90-NF45 to pri-miR-7-1. We also found that levels of the EGF receptor, an oncogenic factor that is a direct target of miR-7, and phosphorylation of AKT were significantly decreased in HCC cell lines depleted of NF90 or NF45. Of note, knockdown of NF90 or NF45 caused a reduction in the proliferation rate of HCC cells. Taken together, NF90-NF45 stimulates an elevation of EGF receptor levels via the suppression of miR-7 biogenesis, resulting in the promotion of cell proliferation in HCC.
