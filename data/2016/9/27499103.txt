Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly prevalent cancer with a high mortality rate and HCC is always accompanied with a hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, unlike many other types of cancers. Over the past few years, cancer-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and virus-related lncRNAs have attracted the attention of many researchers, and a number of previous studies have examined the relationship between lncRNAs and various cancers and viruses. The current study used The Cancer Genome Atlas database to screen for lncRNAs up-regulated in HCC in order to identify cancer biomarkers. Results revealed five lncRNAs that were the most up-regulated. This result was then verified in 10 HCC cell lines and two normal liver cell lines. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the five lncRNAs were substantially up-regulated in HCC cell lines. Several of the five lncRNAs were expressed at higher levels in a few HCC cell lines that were infected with HBV or that were positive for its protein or DNA than in HCC cell lines that were not infected with HBV or that were negative for its protein or DNA. These findings suggest that the five lncRNAs might play a role in the progression of HCC and/or HBV infection, and these findings need to be studied in further detail.
