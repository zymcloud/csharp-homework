Purpose:To retrospectively evaluate the clinical utility of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) following transarterial injection of miriplatin-iodized oil suspension (MPT-RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.Materials and methods:We evaluated clinical outcomes of MPT-RFA for three or fewer hepatocellular carcinomas. Twenty-one patients with 30 tumors (maximum diameter: mean 1.4 ± 0.4 cm, range 0.7-2.2 cm) received MPT-RFA.Results:Nineteen patients (90.5 %, 19/21) achieved complete ablation at the first RFA session. Two patients (9.5 %, 2/21) required a second RFA session but achieved complete ablation. Primary and secondary technical success rates were 90.5 and 100 %. There were no deaths related to the procedures performed. Grade 3 or 4 increases in the serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and bilirubin levels were found in six patients (38.1 %, 8/21). There were no liver infarctions. During the median follow-up period of 24.1 months (mean ± SD 24.7 ± 6.9 months, range 13.8-38.9 months), the local tumor progression rate and overall survival rate at 2 years was 5.0 % (95 % confidence interval 0.3-20.6 %) and 86.7 % (95 % confidence interval 56.3-96.5 %), respectively. The mean hospital stay was 8.4 ± 3.1 days (range 5-18 days).Conclusion:MPT-RFA is a safe therapeutic option that initially provides therapeutic results.
