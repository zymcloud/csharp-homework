Aims:We retrospectively analyzed the clinical outcome and prognostic parameters in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and bone metastases who had received treatment with zoledronic acid (ZOL).Methods:Ninety-nine HCC patients with bone metastases who had been treated with ZOL were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. We analyzed the prognostic factors, including serum N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX) levels, as bone metabolism markers.Results:The median overall survival (OS) time was 11.5 months. Child-Pugh grade A (P = 0.004) and intrahepatic tumor stage (IHTS) T0-3 (P = 0.010) correlated significantly with favorable OS. In 46 patients with grade A and T0-3, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis defined 16 nmol BCE/L serum NTX as the cut-off level for median OS. Multivariate analysis identified baseline serum NTX Conclusion:Low baseline serum NTX level correlated with favorable outcome in bone metastatic HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A and IHTS T0-3 treated with ZOL.
