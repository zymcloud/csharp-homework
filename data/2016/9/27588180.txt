Gastric cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer worldwide and is associated with high mortality rates. The incidence of gastric cancer varies widely in different geographical regions. For example, in Iran, the most northern and northwestern regions are considered to be high-risk areas for gastric cancer. The aim of the present study was to determine the distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes among patients with gastric carcinoma in Mazandaran province, Northern Iran, which is a high-risk area. A total of 100 paraffin-embedded tissue samples were obtained from 70 males and 30 females with gastric carcinoma, diagnosed between 2006 and 2013, in the Imam Khomeini Hospital (Sari, Iran). GP5+/GP6+ general primers were applied for detection of HPV DNA in the specimens. Positive samples were then selected and high-risk HPV genotyping was performed. The samples were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and five (5%) samples were identified to be positive for HPV DNA [four male (5.7%) and one female (3.3%)]. Three (60%) samples were positive for HPV-16, one (20%) sample was positive for HPV-18 and one (20%) sample was positive for HPV-45. Following pathological diagnosis, 88 samples were identified as gastric adenocarcinoma, nine samples were gastric lymphoma, and three samples were gastric and esophagus adenocarcinoma. According to the findings of the present study and the rate of HPV infection in patients with gastric carcinoma, an association between HPV infection and gastric carcinoma in subjects from Northern Iran was not identified.
