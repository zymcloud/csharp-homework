Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with inflammation, and roughly 30 % of the global population shows serological evidence of current or past infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus. Resident hepatic macrophages, known as Kupffer cells (KCs), are considered as the specific tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) of HCC, and can produce various cytokines-most importantly interleukin (IL)-6-to promote tumorigenesis of HCC. However, the roles of KCs and IL-6 in carcinogenesis in the liver are still unclear.Methods:We analyzed leukocyte-related peripheral blood data of 192 patients and constructed a mouse model in which the bone marrow was cleared out by irradiation and reconstructed using bone marrow donated from IL-6-deficient mice to further elucidate the hepatic pathological changes in response to toxic challenge and oncogenic gene mutation.Results:Peripheral monocyte counts and serum IL-6 levels were significantly higher in patients with HCC than in those without HCC. In addition, there was a significant difference in the levels of IL-6 among individuals with different histopathological grades. In mice with selective IL-6 ablation in monocytes/KCs, we observed decreased toxic liver injury, inflammatory infiltration, and systemic inflammation. In Mdr2-deficient mice, which spontaneously developed HCC, the loss of IL-6 in monocytes/KCs resulted in inhibition of IL-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling, decreased serum IL-6 levels, and delayed tumorigenesis.Conclusions:Our findings demonstrate that increased TAM-derived IL-6 had an amplifying effect on the inflammation response, thereby promoting the occurrence and development of HCC.
