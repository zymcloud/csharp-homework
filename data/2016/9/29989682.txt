To assess the outcome of stable disease (SD) patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by tumor markers after the first course of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC). The study subjects were 156 HCC patients treated with HAIC and classified as Child Pugh A, with no extrahepatic metastasis, and no history of sorafenib treatment. In the study and validation cohorts, the AFP and DCP ratios of patients who were considered SD to the first course of HAIC were analyzed by AUROC for a prediction of response to the second course of HAIC. The imaging response to the first course of HAIC was classified as partial response (PR), SD and progressive disease (PD) in 29 (18.8%), 80 (51.9%), and 44 (28.6%) patients respectively. For SD patients, the a-fetoprotein (AFP) and des-y-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) ratios of patients who were considered SD to the first course of HAIC were analyzed by the receiver operating characteristic curve for prediction of response to the second course of HAIC in the study cohorts. The area under the curve of AFP ratio was 0.743. The area under the curve of DCP ratio was 0.695. The cut-off values of AFP and DCP ratios were 1.3 and 1.0, respectively. In the validation cohort, the accuracy of the prediction of response in this validation cohort (71.4%) showed no significant difference compared to that in the study cohort (72.4%) (p = 1.0). The results suggested that patients with a high tumor marker ratio could be switched to alternative therapeutic regimens despite the SD response to HAIC.
