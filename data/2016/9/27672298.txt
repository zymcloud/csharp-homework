Aim:To investigate the associations of different types of pre-S deletions with hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes.Methods:The sequences of the pre-S region, basal core promoter (BCP) mutation, and precore (PC) mutation were examined through direct DNA sequencing or clonal analysis and sequencing in 273 HBV carriers, namely 55 asymptomatic carriers, 55 carriers with chronic hepatitis (CH), 55 with liver cirrhosis (LC), 53 with liver cirrhotic hepatocellular carcinoma (LC-HCC), and 55 with noncirrhotic HCC. A total of 126 HBV carriers (46.2%) harbored pre-S deletions. The DNA sequences of pre-S deletion mutants from 43 age-matched genotype B (HBV/B)-infected carriers and 43 age-matched genotype C (HBV/C)-infected carriers were further examined, aligned, and compared.Results:No significant difference was observed in the mean age distribution (P = 0.464), male sex (P = 0.805), viral load (P = 0.635), or BCP mutation (P = 0.117) between the HBV/B and HBV/C groups. However, the rate of PC mutation was signiÔ¨Åcantly higher in the HBV/B-infected carriers than in the HBV/C-infected carriers (P = 0.003). Both genotypes exhibited a high rate of deletion in the C-terminal half of the pre-S1 region and N-terminus of the pre-S2 region (86.0% and 79.1% in the HBV/B group; 69.8% and 72.1% in the HBV/C group, respectively). Epitope mapping showed that deletion in several epitope sites was frequent in both genotypes, particularly pS1-BT and pS2-B2. Conversely, the rate of pS2-B1 deletion was significantly higher in the HBV/B group (72.1% vs 37.2%, P = 0.002), and the rate of pS2-T deletion was significantly higher in the HBV/C group (48.8% vs 25.6%, P = 0.044). Functional mapping showed that the rate of deletion in three functional sites (the nucleocapsid binding site, start codon of M, and site for viral secretion) located in the N-terminus of the pre-S2 region was significantly higher in the HBV/B group (P Conclusion:HBV/B- and HBV/C-infected carriers exhibit different patterns of pre-S deletion, which may be associated with the progression of liver diseases.
