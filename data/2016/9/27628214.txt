Serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase 1 (STYK1) is known to be involved in tumor progression. However, its molecular role and mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. We evaluated the effect of STYK1 expression in HCC tissues and investigated the underlying mechanisms associated with progression. HCC tissues expressed greater levels of STYK1 than paired non-tumor tissues. Patients with HCC expressing low levels of STYK1 showed both, greater disease-free (p
