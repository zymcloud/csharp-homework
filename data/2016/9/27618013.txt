A new series of 1,4-bis(1-(5-(aryldiazenyl)thiazol-2-yl)-5-(thiophen-2-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)benzenes 3a-i were synthesized via reaction of 5,5'-(1,4-phenylene)bis(3-(thiophen-2-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-carbothioamide) (1) with hydrazonoyl halides 2a-i. In addition, reaction of 1 with ethyl chloroacetate afforded bis-thiazolone derivative 8 as the end product. Reaction of compound 8 with methyl glyoxalate gave bis-thiazolone derivative 10. The structures of the newly synthesized compounds were established on the basis of spectroscopic evidences and their alternative syntheses. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their anti-tumor activities against hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines, and the results revealed promising activities of compounds 3g, 5e, 3e, 10, 5f, 3i, and 3f with IC50 equal 1.37 ± 0.15, 1.41 ± 0.17, 1.62 ± 0.20, 1.86 ± 0.20, 1.93 ± 0.08, 2.03 ± 0.25, and 2.09 ± 0.19 μM, respectively.
anticancer agents; bis-chalcones; bis-heterocycles; hydrazonoyl halides.
