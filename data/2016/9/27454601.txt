Hepatic ectopic pregnancy is an uncommon form of extrauterine pregnancy. A 31-year-old woman had acute abdominal pain and distention. Laboratory examination showed significantly increased serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin level. Both ultrasound and MRI identified a lesion located at the right lobe of the liver. FDG PET/CT was performed to determine whether the other causes of elevated β-human chorionic gonadotropin level, which showed an oval mass with mid peripherally increased FDG activity. After surgery, pathological results confirmed a diagnosis of hepatic ectopic pregnancy.
