Chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 7 (CXCR7) and its ligand, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12), were established to be involved in biological behaviors and associated with prognosis in many cancers. However, effects, underlying mechanisms of CXCL12-CXCR7 axis in invasive phenotype of pancreatic cancer (PC) and its clinicopathologic significances have not been comprehensively explored. In the present study, it was first found by tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry that CXCL12 and CXCR7 staining scores were significantly associated with vessel invasion and overall survival in two independent cohorts of PC. Besides, co-expression of these proteins was an independent prognosticator in multivariate analysis in both cohorts. Then, migration and invasion, but not proliferation, were decreased in CXCR7-stably silenced PC cells, whereas opposite changes were observed in CXCR7-stably overexpressed cells, accompanied by alterations of mTOR and Rho/ROCK pathways. CXCL12 stimulated migration, invasion, CXCR7 expression and phosphorylation of key mTOR proteins. AMD3100 did not influence effects of CXCL12. Two mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin and Torin1, reversed enhanced invasive phenotypes and mTOR phosphorylation in CXCR7-overexpressed cells. Moreover, CXCR7 directly interacts with mTOR. Finally, liver metastasis, but not growth, was affected by CXCR7 status in orthotopically-implanted PC models in nude mice. Collectively, CXCL12-CXCR7 axis accelerates migration and invasion of PC cells through mTOR and Rho/ROCK pathways, and predicts poor prognosis of PC.
