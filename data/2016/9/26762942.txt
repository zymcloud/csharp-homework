Objectives:To compare the ability of single- vs. multi-lesion assessment on baseline MRI using 1D- and 3D-based measurements to predict overall survival (OS) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) before transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:This retrospective analysis included 122 patients. A quantitative 3D analysis was performed on baseline MRI to calculate enhancing tumour volume (ETV [cm(3)]) and enhancing tumour burden (ETB [%]) (ratio between ETV [cm(3)] and liver volume). Furthermore, enhancing and overall tumour diameters were measured. Patients were stratified into two groups using thresholds derived from the BCLC staging system. Statistical analysis included Kaplan-Meier plots, uni- and multivariate cox proportional hazard ratios (HR) and concordances.Results:All methods achieved good separation of the survival curves (p Conclusion:3D quantitative assessment is a stronger predictor of survival as compared to diameter-based measurements. Assessing multiple lesions provides no substantial improvement in predicting OS than evaluating the dominant lesion alone.Key points:• 3D quantitative tumour assessment on baseline MRI predicts survival in HCC patients. • 3D quantitative tumour assessment predicts survival better than any current radiological method. • Multiple lesion assessment provides no improvement than evaluating the dominant lesion alone. • Measuring enhancing tumour volume in proportion to liver volume reflects tumour burden.
