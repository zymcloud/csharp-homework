Altered expression of TIP30, a tumor suppressor, has been observed in many cancers. In this study, we have evaluated the expression of TIP30 in the tissues of 209 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and their adjacent tissues by using a high-density tissue microarray, and analyzed its correlation with the clinical pathological parameters of the patients. The results revealed negative or weak expression of TIP30 in 43.5% (91/209) of the HCC tissues, and in only 27% (56/209) of the adjacent tissues. The expression level of TIP30 in HCC was inversely correlated with serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, HBV infection, and tumor differentiation. Multivariate analysis for survival indicated that serum HBV infection was the most significant predictor of poor prognosis in HCC (P = 0.0023), and TIP30 expression and tumor differentiation were also independent indicators in this respect (P = 0.0364 and P = 0.0397, respectively). Patients with medium or high expression levels of TIP30 (TIP30(++/+++) ) had a better 5-year overall survival rate than those with low/negative (TIP30(+/-) ) expression (P
