STAT3 and hexokinase II (HK-II) are involved in viral infection and carcinogenesis of various cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The roles of STAT3 and HK-II in hepatitis B virus (HBV)- and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related HCC remain largely unclear. This study examined STAT3 and HK-II expression in HBV- and HCV-related HCC, HBV-related liver fibrosis, and normal control liver by using tissue microarray and immunohistochemical method. Results showed that STAT3 expression in HBV-related HCC, HCV-related HCC, and HBV-related liver fibrosis was significantly higher than in control liver (P
