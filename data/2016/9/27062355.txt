Purpose:To determine the efficacy of single- versus triple-drug chemoembolization for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, as measured by toxicity, tumor response, time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS).Materials and methods:A single-center retrospective review was performed on 337 patients who underwent chemoembolization over a 14-year period; 172 patients underwent triple-drug conventional transarterial chemoembolization, and 165 patients underwent single-agent doxorubicin chemoembolization. Imaging characteristics and clinical follow-up after conventional transarterial chemoembolization were evaluated to determine TTP. Imaging response was determined per World Health Organization and European Association for the Study of Liver criteria. OS from time of first chemoembolization was calculated.Results:Median TTP was similar between groups: 7.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.1-9.4) and 6.8 months (95% CI, 4.6-8.6) for triple- and single-drug regimens, respectively (P > .05). For single-agent conventional transarterial chemoembolization, median OS varied significantly by Barcelona Clinic for Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage: A, 40.8 months; B, 36.4 months; C, 10.9 months (P Conclusions:Single-agent chemoembolization with doxorubicin and ethiodized oil demonstrates acceptable efficacy as measured by TTP and OS. Results compare favorably with traditional triple-drug therapy.
