Background:Laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy (LLS) is now considered as a standard practice. However, the safety of laparoscopic LLS in cirrhotic patients is unclear. This is the retrospective study of comparing the outcomes of laparoscopic LLS between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients.Methods:We reviewed the clinical data for 107 patients who underwent laparoscopic LLS between July 2003 and July 2013. The patients were divided into cirrhotic group (n = 31) and non-cirrhotic group (n = 76) with histologically confirmed F4 or F3 fibrosis.Results:There were no differences between the two groups in terms of the operation time (P = 0.807), blood loss (P = 0.115), transfusion rate (P = 0.716), postoperative complication rate (P = 0.601) and duration of hospital stay (P = 0.261). Open conversion occurred in one non-cirrhotic patient (P = 1.000). The postoperative peak total bilirubin level was higher in cirrhotic patients than in non-cirrhotic patients (P Conclusions:Laparoscopic LLS is safe and reproducible, even in cirrhotic patients.
