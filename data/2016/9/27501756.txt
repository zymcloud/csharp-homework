Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as critical regulators in numerous types of cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). X inactivate-specific transcript (XIST) has been found to be up-regulated and acts as an oncogene in gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, but little is known about its expression pattern, biological function and underlying mechanism in NSCLC. Here, we identified XIST as an oncogenic lncRNA by driving tumorigenesis in NSCLC. We found that XIST is over-expressed in NSCLC, and its increased level is associated with shorter survival and poorer prognosis. Knockdown of XIST impaired NSCLC cells proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro, and repressed the tumorigenicity of NSCLC cells in vivo. Mechanistically, RNA immune-precipitation (RIP) and RNA pull-down experiment demonstrated that XIST could simultaneously interact with EZH2 to suppress transcription of its potential target KLF2. Additionally, rescue experiments revealed that XIST's oncogenic functions were partly depending on silencing KLF2 expression. Collectively, our findings expound how XIST over-expression endows an oncogenic function in NSCLC.
