Aberrant tumor microenvironment is involved closely in tumor initiation and progression, in which cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a pivotal role. Both IL-6/STAT3 signaling and TIMP-1 have been found to modulate the crosstalk between tumor cells and CAFs in tumor microenvironment, however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we showed that IL-6/STAT3 signaling was activated aberrantly in HCC tissues and correlated with poor post-surgical outcome. The in vitro experiments confirmed that activation of IL-6/STAT3 pathway enhanced TIMP-1 expression directly via phosphorylated STATs (p-STAT3)-binding with TIMP-1 promoter in Huh7 cells. Furthermore, activation of IL-6/STAT3 pathway in HCC cells was shown to induce the transformation from normal liver fibroblasts (LFs) to CAFs via up-regulating TIMP-1 expression. Co-culture with CAFs promoted the growth of Huh7 cells both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, by co-Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting assessments, PCAF, a well-known acetyltransferase, was revealed to acetylate cytoplasmic STAT3 protein directly and regulate TIMP-1 expression negatively in Huh7 cells. In summary, this investigation indicated that there was a positive IL-6/TIMP-1 feedback loop controlling the crosstalk between HCC cells and its neighbouring fibroblasts. The data here also identified that PCAF repressed TIMP-1 expression via acetylation of STAT3. In conclusion, this investigation demonstrated that CAFs promoted HCC growth via IL-6/STAT3/AKT pathway and TIMP-1 over-expression driven by IL-6/STAT3 pathway in HCC cells brought in more CAFs through activating LFs. Finally, PCAF could block this positive feedback by acetylating STAT3 in HCC cells.
