Background:The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with metabolic risk factors, such as diabetes and obesity, has been increasing. However, the underlying mechanism that links these diseases remains unclear.Methods:We performed genome-wide expression analysis of human liver tissues of non-viral HCC patients with or without metabolic risk factors. The upregulated genes that associated with diabetes and obesity were investigated by in vitro and in vivo experiments, and immunohistochemistry of human liver tissues was performed.Results:Among the upregulated genes, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression was induced to a greater extent by combined glucose and insulin administration to human hepatoma cells. Genome-wide expression analysis revealed upregulation of a chemokine network in CTGF-overexpressing hepatoma cells, which displayed an increased ability to induce in vitro activation of macrophages, and in vivo infiltration of liver macrophages. Immunohistochemistry of human liver tissues validated the correlations between CTGF expression and diabetes or obesity as well as activation of liver macrophages in patients with non-viral HCC. Recurrence-free survival was significantly poorer in the CTGF-positive patients compared with the CTGF-negative patients (p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis determined that CTGF expression (HR 2.361; 95 % CI 1.195-4.665; p = 0.013) and vascular invasion (HR 2.367; 95 % CI 1.270-4.410; p = 0.007) were independent prognostic factors for recurrence of non-viral HCC.Conclusions:Our data suggest that CTGF could be involved in oncogenic pathways promoting non-viral HCC associated with metabolic risk factors via induction of liver inflammation and is expected to be a novel HCC risk biomarker and potential therapeutic target.
