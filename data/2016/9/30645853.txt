Objective To observe the mechanism of Xiaoai Jiedu Recipe (XJR) for fighting a- gainst hepatoma by detecting tumor miRNAs expression profiles in H₂₂tumor-bearing mice. Methods To- tally 50 H₂₂tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into the model group, the low dose XJR group, the medium dose XJR group, the high dose XJR group, the Cisplatin group, 10 in each group. Different expressions of tumor tissues in H₂₂ tumor-bearing mice under light microscope were detected using histopathological technique. Differentially expressed miRNAs of tumor tissue in H₂₂tumor-bearing mice were detected by using miRNA chip technique. Differentially expressed miRNAs associated with antitumor mechanism of XJR were found out by statistical analysis. Results Histopathological results showed that reduced pathologic mitosis, smaller cancer cells, and obviously enhanced anti-cancer effect along with increased XJP dose. Results of miRNA chip analyses indicated XJP could significantly up-regulate the ex- pressions of miRNAs, such as miR-1298-5p, miR-874-3p, miR-721, miR-298-5p, miR-551b-5p, miR-346- 5p, miR-105, and so on. It could also down-regulate the expressions of miR-24-3p, miR-3963, miR-127- 3p, miR-434-5p, miR-1187, miR-468-3p, miR-221-5p, and miR-6695-5p. Conclusion XJP could fight a- gainst tumor possibly by regulating expressions of multiple miRNAs.
