Objective:The purpose of this study is to describe the imaging characteristics of hepatic angiomyolipoma (AML) on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI and to identify imaging features that are helpful for differentiating it from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a noncirrhotic liver.Materials and methods:We retrospectively identified 18 patients with pathologically proven hepatic AMLs who had undergone gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI between 2008 and 2012. We randomly chose 36 patients with noncirrhotic liver who had a single HCC diagnosed radiologically during the same period. None of the HCCs was of the fibrolamellar variant. Two readers reviewed images in consensus to assess the lesion size, the presence of fat, signal intensity characteristics, enhancement profile, early draining veins, intratumoral vessels, and tumor capsules. The tumor-to-liver contrast ratios were measured. These features and the measurements were compared between the two groups.Results:AMLs are more commonly found in women (83.3%), whereas HCCs are more common in men (75%) (p Conclusion:On gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI of noncirrhotic liver, AML is often indistinguishable from HCC on the basis of the enhancement profiles. Female sex and some imaging features including DWI could facilitate the differentiation.
