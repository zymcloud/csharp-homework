Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive liver tumor containing cancer stem cells (CSCs), which participate in tumor invasion, therapeutic resistance, and tumor relapse leading to poor outcome and limited therapeutic options. Histone deacetylatase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) has been shown to be up-regulated in human cancers; however, its role in liver CSCs is unknown. In this study, we explored the biological functions of SIRT1 in liver CSCs. Our data show that SIRT1 is highly expressed in liver CSCs and decreases during differentiation. In addition, high levels of SIRT1 predict a decreased probability of survival in patients with HCC. SIRT1 is responsible for the maintenance of self-renewal and tumorigenicity of liver CSCs, and overexpression of exogenous SIRT1 can restore self-renewal of non-CSCs. We demonstrated that SOX2 is a main downstream regulator of SIRT1-mediated self-renewal and tumorigenicity potential of liver CSCs. Mechanistically, SIRT1 regulates transcription of the SOX2 gene by way of chromatin-based epigenetic changes, which are dependent on DNA methylation. This effect is achieved by alternation of histone modification and interaction with DNA methyltransferase 3A, resulting in hypermethylation of SOX2 promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrated that insulin growth factor signaling plays an important role in maintaining SIRT1 expression through increased SIRT1 protein stability.Conclusions:These findings highlight the importance of SIRT1 in the biology of liver CSCs and suggest that SIRT1 may serve as a molecular target for HCC therapy.
