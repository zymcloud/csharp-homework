Selective cell adhesion and migration, which mimics the natural biological events in vivo, is very important for the right repair of damaged tissues. In this study, glycosylated hyperbranched polymers (LA-HPMA) were synthesized, and were grafted on glass slide through dopamine deposition with different densities adjusted by co-grafting of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). The LA-HPMA and PEG molecular brushes were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-d) and ellipsometry. The adhesion of human hepatoma (HepG2) cells was promoted on the surface of a higher LA-HPMA density, and the migration rate was accelerated from 6.4μm/h on PEG surface to 12.7μm/h on 75% LA-HPMA surface. By contrast, the density and spreading area of mouse embryonic fibroblast (NIH3T3) cells were not significantly influenced by the LA-HPMA density, and the migration rate did not change significantly on all types of surfaces either. Therefore, the specific interactions of carbohydrate-protein can be used to modulate cell behaviors in vitro, for example the selective adhesion and migration of HepG2 cells.
