The frequency of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has continously increased over the last few decades in parallel with the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome. With the increasing frequency of obesity and type 2 diabetes an increase in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is also to be expected. The NASH-associated liver cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are indications for liver transplantation (LTX), which is gaining importance in Germany. In contrast, liver cirrhosis as a result of alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) is already the leading cause for LTX in Germany. A significant number of patients with ASH cirrhosis develop HCC. Less common causes of hepatic steatosis are secondary and include chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis (CASH). In this article the causes, diagnostics and novel therapeutic approaches for the various forms of steatosis are discussed.
