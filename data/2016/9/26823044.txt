Objective:The study aimed to identify clinico-pathologic factors that predict survival in early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis undergoing liver resection.Methods:A population-based cohort was investigated to identify cirrhotic patients with confirmed early HCC (tumor sizeâ‰¤5cm and absence of nodal involvement, metastases, or major vascular invasion) after hepatic resection at the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital (Shanghai, China) from April 2005 and November 2010 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. These patients were studied retrospectively in terms of their clinical characteristics and prognostic factors. Predictors for survival were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards models. Besides, a simple prognostic scoring system was proposed to stratify these patients.Results:Of 537 (2.6% of all HCC patients in this period) cirrhotic patients with early HCC identified who had underwent liver resection, 87% were male. Median tumor size was 2.9cm, and 67% of patients had tumors>2cm. Following hepatic resection, overall median and 5-year survival were 75 months and 58%, respectively. Tumor size>2cm (hazard ratio [HR]=1.56), multifocality (HR=1.34), non-anatomic resection (HR=1.44) and vascular invasion (HR=2.03) were associated with worse prognosis (PConclusion:Tumor size>2cm, multifocality, non-anatomic resection and vascular invasion may be used to stratify HBV-related cirrhotic patients with early HCC after resection. Besides, these data also indicate that pathologic staging is important even in small HCC.
