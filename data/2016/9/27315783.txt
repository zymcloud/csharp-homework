There is no established treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis. The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) according to Child-Pugh score (CPS) and to evaluate the correlation of a patient's response to HAIC with hepatic reserve and outcome. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 377 patients treated with HAIC between March 2003 and February 2015. Subjects included 179 with Child-Pugh class B. Median overall survival was 12.1 months for patients with CPS = 7 (n = 75) and 11.9 months for patients with CPS = 8 (n = 58), which were significantly longer compared with those of patients with CPS = 9 (n = 46, 6.3 months). The objective response rates of patients with CPS = 7, 8 and 9 were 26.7%, 27.6% and 6.5%, respectively. The CPS of responders improved significantly after HAIC, whereas those of nonresponders did not. A multivariate analysis demonstrated that improved CPS, responses to HAIC and absence of extrahepatic lesions were independent favorable prognostic factors. Patients with CPS = 7 or 8 tolerated HAIC, but nine (19.6%) of patients with CPS = 9 were unable to complete one course. HAIC is effective and safe for patients with a CPS = 7 or 8 and improved hepatic reserve of responders significantly.
