Polysaccharide-based injectable hydrogels have several advantages in the context of biomedical use. However, the main obstruction associated with the utilization of these hydrogels in clinical application is their poor mechanical properties. Herein, we describe in situ gelling of nanocomposite hydrogels based on quaternized cellulose (QC) and rigid rod-like cationic cellulose nanocrystals (CCNCs), which can overcome this challenge. In all cases, gelation immediately occurred with an increase of temperature, and the CCNCs were evenly distributed throughout the hydrogels. The nanocomposite hydrogels exhibited increasing orders-of-magnitude in the mechanical strength, high extension in degradation and the sustained release time, because of the strong interaction between CCNCs and QC chains mediated by the cross-linking agent (β-glycerophosphate, β-GP). The results of the in vitro toxicity and in vivo biocompatibility tests revealed that the hydrogels did not show obvious cytotoxicity and inflammatory reaction to cells and tissue. Moreover, DOX-encapsulated hydrogels were injected beside the tumors of mice bearing liver cancer xenografts to assess the potential utility as localized and sustained drug delivery depot systems for anticancer therapy. The results suggested that the QC/CCNC/β-GP nanocomposite hydrogels had great potential for application in subcutaneous and sustained delivery of anticancer drug to increase therapeutic efficacy and improve patient compliance.
