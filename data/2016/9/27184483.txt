Prostate adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are common cancer types. Both may present with bone metastases, and both are known to be CK7/CK20 negative. Thus, diagnosis of less well-differentiated tumors at metastatic sites essentially relies on immunohistochemical confirmation. However, insufficient data exist on the expression status of the main 2 hepatocyte markers hepatocyte paraffin 1 (HepPar-1) and arginase-1 (Arg-1) in prostatic adenocarcinoma. We screened 557 prostate carcinoma cases for expression of these 2 markers using tissue microarrays. Sixty-four of 557 (11.5%) cases showed highly variable expression of HepPar-1 in 1% to 75% of tumor cells with a characteristically strong granular "mitochondrial" pattern. Only 13 cases (2.3%) expressed HepPar-1 in greater than 10% of the tumor cells. No correlation was seen with Gleason grade. On the other hand, 19 (3.4%) of 557 cases showed variable nonspecific cytoplasmic expression of Arg-1 distinct from the specific combined nucleocytoplasmic staining seen in normal liver and in HCC. Specifically, this Arg-1 pattern was seen only using one antibody lot and not another suggesting cross-reactivity. Only a single case showed specific nucleocytoplasmic expression of Arg-1 in the tumor cells. In conclusion, specific granular cytoplasmic staining for HepPar-1 is frequent in prostatic adenocarcinomas (11.5%) but usually focal and limited to less than 5% of tumor cells. This should not be misinterpreted as evidence of HCC, particularly in solid-pattern neoplasms. On the other hand, specific Arg-1 expression is very rare (0.18%), highlighting the value of Arg-1 in distinguishing HepPar-1-positive prostatic carcinoma from HCC at metastatic sites or in cases of liver metastasis from prostate carcinoma.
