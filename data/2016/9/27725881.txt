Presently, there have been a lot of documents confirmed that aflatoxin B1 could promote the incident rate of hepato-cellular carcinoma, but the specific mechanism is not completely clear. Some evidences showed that it might relate to oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction. So the rat hepato-cellular carcinoma model was applied in this study for being discussed. Aflatoxin B1 was applied for inducing the rats to produce hepato-cellular carcinoma model to evaluate the expression of histopathology and glutathione transferase. At the same time, we also detected the expression of antioxidase, pro-inflammatory cytokine, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and etc in rat hepato-cellular carcinoma tissues. The histo-pathological results showed that the necrosis of liver cells could be observed after being induced by Aflatoxin B1 for 4 weeks. We could observe obvious hepato-cellular carcinoma in 10th week. The level of reactive oxygen species in liver cancer rose obviously, and the activity of antioxidant enzymes reduced. At the same time, the expression level of pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNFα, IL-1α, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and etc all increased significantly. In conclusion, the histological characteristics of hepato-cellular carcinoma could be induced by aflatoxin B1, and the progression of hepato-cellular carcinoma related closely to inflammatory reaction.
