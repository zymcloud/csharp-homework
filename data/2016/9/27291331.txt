Background:The last Italian prevalence survey on chronic liver diseases (CLD) was performed in 2001. The present study evaluated the changes occurring over thirteen years.Methods:We enrolled 2,557 CLD consecutive patients in 16 Italian liver units in 2014.Results:HBV etiology accounted for 513 (20.2%) cases, alone in 439 and associated with HCV and/or alcohol abuse in 74. Of these 513, 11.9% were anti-HDV-positive and 7.2% HBeAg-positive. HCV alone was responsible for 50.3% of CLD and with alcohol abuse for 5.9%. HCV RNA was detected in 64.0% of the anti-HCV-positive patients tested. HCV genotyping, performed for 899 patients, showed genotype-1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively in 16.5%, 45.5%, 15.4%, 8.2%, 15.1% and 0.2%. Alcohol abuse alone was responsible for 6.4% of cases and NAFLD/NASH for 6.3%. Liver cirrhosis (pConclusion:The changes in HCV, HBV and alcohol etiologies may help apply more appropriate healthcare strategies.
