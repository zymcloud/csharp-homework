A glycyrrhetinic acid-modified chitosan-cystamine-poly(ε-caprolactone) copolymer (PCL-SS-CTS-GA) micelle was developed for the co-delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) and curcumin (CCM) to hepatoma cells. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) was used as a targeting unit to ensure specific delivery. Co-encapsulation of DOX and CCM was facilitated by the incorporation of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) groups. The highest drug loading content was 19.8% and 8.9% (w/w) for DOX and CCM, respectively. The PCL-SS-CTS-GA micelle presented a spherical or ellipsoidal geometry with a mean diameter of approximately 110nm. The surface charge of the micelle changed from negative to positive, when the pH value of the solution decreased from 7.4 to 6.8. Meanwhile, it also exhibited a character of redox-responsive drug release and GA/pH-mediated endocytosis in vitro. In simulated body fluid with 10mM glutathione, the release rate in 12h was 80.6% and 67.2% for DOX and CCM, respectively. The cell uptake of micelles was significantly higher at pH 6.8 than pH 7.4. The combined administration of DOX and CCM was facilitated by PCL-SS-CTS-GA micelle. Results showed that there was strong synergic effect between the two drugs. The PCL-SS-CTS-GA micelle might turn into a promising and effective carrier for improved combination chemotherapy.
