Purpose:To determine value of transarterial radioembolization (TARE) for palliative treatment of unresectable liver-dominant breast metastases (LdBM) and to determine prognostic parameters.Materials and methods:Records of patients undergoing TARE for progressing LdBM between June 2006 and March 2015 were retrospectively reviewed; 44 female patients (mean age 56.1 y; range, 34.9-85.3 y) underwent 69 TAREs (56 resin-based, 13 glass-based). Of 44 patients, 42 had bilobar disease. Mean administered activity was 1.35 GBq ± 0.71. Median clinical and imaging follow-up times were 121 days (range, 26-870 d; n = 42 patients) and 93 days (range, 26-2,037 d; n = 38 patients). Clinical and biochemical toxicities, imaging response (according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors), time to progression, and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. Data were analyzed with stratification according to clinical and procedural parameters.Results:Toxicities included 1 cholecystitis (grade 2) and 1 duodenal ulceration (grade 3); no grade ≥ 4 clinical toxicities were noted. Objective response rate (complete + partial response) was 28.9% (11/38); disease control rate (response + stable disease) was 71.1% (27/38). Median time to progression of treated liver lobe was 101 days (range, 30-2,037 d). During follow-up, 34/42 patients died (median OS after first TARE: 184 d [range 29-2,331 d]). On multivariate analysis, baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status of 0 (P < .0001, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.146) and low baseline γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels (P = .0146, HR = 0.999) were predictors of longer OS.Conclusions:TARE can successfully delay progression of therapy-refractory LdBM with low complication rate. Nonelevated baseline ECOG status and low GGT levels were identified as prognostic factors.
