Anti-angiogenesis-related therapies have become the standard care for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as HCC is a highly vascularized solid tumor. Unfortunately, only modest and limited efficacies are observed. Emerging evidence have attributed to the limited efficacy to the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in the tumor. CSCs predominantly drives angiogenesis via releasing proangiogenic factors and exosomes. They have the ability to resistant intratumoral hypoxia via autophagy or by directly forming the tubular structure to obtain blood. On the other hand, the vascular niche in tumor microenvironment also releases growth factors via juxtacrine and paracrine mechanisms to support the growth of CSCs and maintain its stemness features. This positive feedback loop between angiogenesis and CSCs exists in liver tumor microenvironment that is responsible for the development and poor prognosis of HCC. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the crosstalks between angiogenesis and CSCs, and their interactions in liver tumor microenvironment and their purpose that an effective anti-angiogenic therapy should also target CSCs for HCC treatment.
