Purpose:The purpose of the study was to prospectively evaluate the safety and the efficacy of percutaneous radio-frequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract.Materials and methods:From April 2012 to November 2015, 141 hepatocellular carcinoma nodules that underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous radio-frequency ablation were included. A total of 52 lesions were located less than 5 mm from the gastrointestinal tract in the study group, and 89 lesions were located more than 5 mm from hepatic surface in the control group. Ethanol (2.5-9.6 mL) was injected into marginal tissue of tumour in five lesions of the study group. During the ablation, the temperature of marginal ablation tissue proximal to the gastrointestinal tract was monitored and controlled at 45-56 Â°C for more than 10 min in the study group. We compared the results of ablation between the two groups.Results:In total 48 of 52 tumours (92.3%) in the study group and 84 of 89 tumours (94.4%) in the control group achieved complete ablation (P = 0.63). Local tumour progression was found in eight tumours (15.4%) in the study group and 11 tumours (12.4%) in the control group during follow-up (P = 0.61). There were neither immediate nor peri-procedural major complications in both groups, grade I (Clavien-Dindo classification). One case developed biloma at 5-month follow-up in the study group, Clavien-Dindo gradeIII.Conclusions:Percutaneous radio-frequency ablation is safe and achieves a high complete ablation rate for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract.
