Survivin is an anti-apoptotic protein belonging to the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family. It is involved in the regulation of important physiological and pathological processes in cells and functions to inhibit cell apoptosis and promote cell proliferation. Normally and terminally differentiated tissues are nearly negative for survivin. In contrast, survivin is highly expressed in most human tumor tissues, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The abnormal overexpression of survivin is closely related to the malignant biological behaviors of tumors. During the development and progression of HCC, the high level of survivin expression promotes cancer cell proliferation, inhibits cancer cell apoptosis, induces tumor stromal angiogenesis, reduces the sensitivity of cancer cells to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and ultimately affects the prognosis of patients with HCC. Survivin expression is regulated by a large number of factors. The latest discovery indicated that the transcription factor octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) enhances the expression of survivin though cyclin D1 (CCND1), which, in part, accounts for tumor cell proliferation, recurrence and metastasis. Survivin plays key roles in HCC, which renders it an ideal target for the treatment of HCC. The present article reviews the research progress on the relationship between survivin and HCC and on the HCC treatment strategies targeting survivin.
