Ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1), a metabolic enzyme critically involved in the polyamine biosynthesis, is commonly upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Despite its altered expression in human HCC tissues, the molecular mechanism by which ODC1 alters the course of HCC progression and functions in HCC cell survival is unknown. Here we identified that silencing of ODC1 expression with small interfering (si) RNA causes inhibition of HCC cell growth through blockade of cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis. Next, to obtain insights into the molecular changes in response to ODC1 knockdown, global changes in gene expression were examined using RNA sequencing. It revealed that 119 genes show same directional regulation (76 up- and 43 down-regulated) in both Huh1 and Huh7 cells and were considered as a common ODC1 knockdown signature. Particularly, we found through a network analysis that KLF2, which is known to inhibit PPARγ expression and adipogenesis, was commonly up-regulated. Subsequent Western blotting affirmed that the downregulation of ODC1 was accompanied by a decrease in the levels of PPARγ as well as of PARP-1, cyclin E1 and pro-caspase 9 delaying cell cycle progression and accelerating apoptotic signaling. Following the down-regulation of PPARγ expression, ODC1 silencing resulted in a strong inhibition in the expression of important regulators of glucose transport and lipid biogenesis, and caused a marked decrease in lipid droplet accumulation. In addition, ODC1 silencing significantly inhibited the growth of human HCC xenografts in nude mice. These findings indicate that the function of ODC1 is correlated with HCC lipogenesis and suggest that targeting ODC1 could be an attractive option for molecular therapy of HCC.
