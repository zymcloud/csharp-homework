This article demonstrates a case of a lung adenocarcinoma patient in stage IV harboring an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 19 exon deletion mutation treated with 500 mg/m2 pemetrexed and 75 mg/m2 cisplatin on day 1, sequenced with 250 mg gefitinib on prescription on days 4-28 for six cycles as first-line, then by gefitinib combined with pemetrexed as maintenance therapy. The patient achieved a partial response. Performance status increased from grade 2 to 1. The progression-free survival period was 17 months. Overall survival is now over three years. Side effects of grade two liver dysfunction and dermal toxicity were tolerable. Combined gefitinib with platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment probably benefits non-small cell cancer patients in stage IV harboring sensitive EGFR gene mutations with a better local control rate, longer survival, and tolerable side effects.
