Purpose:The systemic inflammation biomarker, Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), has been reported as one of the adverse prognostic factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether NLR could predict the risk of recurrence and death for the HCC patient, according to Milan criteria after hepatectomy.Materials and methods:Retrospective analysis was performed on a database of HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy between March 2001 and December 2011. The cutoff value of NLR was decided by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify predictive factors of recurrence and death.Results:A total of 213 patients were included in the present study. The median follow-up period was 48 months. One hundred and seven patients were experienced tumor recurrence; forty of them recurred within 12 months (early recurrence). NLR ≥1.505, albumin ≤3.75 g/dL, microvascular invasion and high grade of cirrhosis were found to be independent factors for adverse recurrence-free survival in multivariate regression analysis. And NLR ≥1.945 was also found as a prognosis factor for early recurrence by univariate regression analysis.Conclusion:Elevated preoperative NLR can be easily obtained and reliable biomarker for assessing the tumor recurrence and early recurrence of Milan criteria HCC after the initial hepatectomy.
