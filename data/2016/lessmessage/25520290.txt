Alcohol consumption has long been associated with a majority of liver diseases and has been found to influence both fetal and adult liver functions. In spite of being one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the world, currently, there are no effective strategies that can prevent or treat alcoholic liver disease (ALD), due to a lack of human-relevant research models. Recent success in generation of functionally active mature hepatocyte-like cells from human-induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) enables us to better understand the effects of alcohol on liver functions. Here, we describe the method and effect of alcohol exposure on multistage hepatic cell types derived from human iPSCs, in an attempt to recapitulate the early stages of liver tissue injury associated with ALD. We exposed different stages of iPSC-induced hepatic cells to ethanol at a pathophysiological concentration. In addition to stage-specific molecular markers, we measured several key cellular parameters of hepatocyte injury, including apoptosis, proliferation, and lipid accumulation.
