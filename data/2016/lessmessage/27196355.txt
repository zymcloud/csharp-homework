The International Conference on Viral Hepatitis 2016 brought exciting news on the treatment of viral hepatitis. The conference was mainly focused on the most recent estimates of burden for HBV and HCV; the current gaps and prospects for regional and global HCV eradication; the use of HCV treatment as prevention; and the management of difficult-to-cure hepatitis C patients, including individuals who fail on direct-acting antivirals, people who inject drugs, and those with decompensated cirrhosis or renal insufficiency. Special patient populations, such as children, pregnant women, HIV-coinfected and persons with acute hepatitis C, were addressed separately. Data from both clinical trials and real-world experience were discussed. Further debates focused on hepatic conditions that may alter the management and outcome of viral hepatitis, such as fatty liver disease, liver transplantation, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
