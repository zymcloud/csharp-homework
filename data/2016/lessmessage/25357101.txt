Natural killer (NK)-lysin, a broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide, has antitumor and antibactericidal activities against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. In this study the recombinant porcine NK-lysin was expressed and purified in the Pichia pastoris system, and then 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide was used to assess its anticancer activity in vitro. The results showed that the recombinant porcine NK-lysin possesses potent antitumor activity against the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line SMMC-7721 in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but has negligible hemolysis activity against human erythrocytes. Scanning electronic microscopy was used to directly observe the ultrastructure of SMMC-7721 cells treated with NK-lysin; untreated cells showed lamellipodia and filopodia scattered with the cell surface, with good cell-cell contacts among neighboring cells. In contrast, treated tumor cells exhibited marked alterations in cell morphology, and cell-cell contacts disappeared among neighboring cells. Compared with the untreated tumor cells, the tumor cells treated with NK-lysin for 12 and 24 hr were suppressed for the expression of fascin 1. Thus, the recombinant porcine NK-lysin potentially could be developed as a therapeutic agent for inhibiting tumor growth.
