Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a dreadful complication of end stage liver disease with high morbidity and mortality.Aim:The aim was to assess the role of serum talin-1 and non-invasive brosis in patients with HCC.Materials and methods:A total of eighty seven subjects were enrolled, with 22 two healthy individuals as a control group (n=22), 22 patients in the cirrhosis group and finally 43 in the group with HCC diagnosed with positive triphasic CT abdomen criteria. Serum talin-1 and noninvasive fibrosis parameters were assessed in all subjects.Results:Compared to the cirrhosis group, patients with HCC had higher serum talin-1 (32.9±12.6 vs. 11.1±2.79 ng/ml), FIB4 (9.96±15.3 vs. 2.90±1.87) and bro-α (10.9±18.1 vs. 1.55±0.28) but not fibrosis index scores (4.47±0.95 vs. 4.98±0.96; p=0.046). Patients with large focal lesions (≥5cm) had different ALBI scores (-1.02±0.63 vs. -1.72±0.59; p=0.001) serum talin-1 (9.72±13.81 vs. 28.6±38.89 ng/ml; p=0.007) and brosis index scores (0.85 ± 0.99 vs. 4.20±4.85; p=0.026). No statistical differences were noted between patients with and without portal vein thrombosis. For detection of HCC, serum talin-1 had 97.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity with a 17.2 ng/ml cutoff. AFP at a 13.7 ng/ml cutoff had 72.1% sensitivity and 6.3.6% specificity. The cutoff for the bro-α score was 1.61 with 81.4% sensitivity and 77.3% specificity. Serum talin-1 (odds=1.08; C.I=1.016-1.150; p=0.014), brosis index score (odds=2.35; C.I=1.055-5.217; p=0.037) and the ALBI score (odds=6.9; C.I=1.924-24.708; p=0.003) were predictors of large focal lesions.Conclusions:Serum talin-1, AST/ALT ratio, bro-α score are useful for the assessment of HCC patients.
