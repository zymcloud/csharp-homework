Cullin7 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The Cullin7 protein family functions as a molecular scaffold to coordinate substrate ubiquitination in Skp, Cullin, and F-box-containing complex (SCF complex). Cullin7s control normal development and primary cellular processes and are characterized by a unique genomic network organization. Less is known about the involvement of Cullin7 with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we found that Cullin7 showed a high expression in HCC tumor tissues, especially in metastatic HCC tumor tissues. Also, there was a negative correlation between Cullin7 expression and long survival. Silencing of Cullin7 in liver cancer cells can significantly reduce the migration, invasion, and metastatic abilities. Also, detection of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker expression showed that Cullin7 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transformation of cancer cells. The results of this study helped to elucidate the oncogene functions of Cullin7 in liver cancers.
