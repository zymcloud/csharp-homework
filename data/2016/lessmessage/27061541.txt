Purpose:This study compared the longterm survival outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent laparoscopic hepatectomy with those who were subjected to open hepatectomy.Methods:This was a retrospective, case-control study; patients in the 2 groups were matched according to age, sex, body mass index (BMI), liver function, underlying liver disease, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, tumor location and type of resection. A total of 118 patients (laparoscopy, N = 59; open, N = 59) were assessed.Results:Patient characteristics did not differ between the groups. Postoperative 30-day complication rates did not differ between the groups. Pathological data did not differ between the two groups. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were not different between the laparoscopy and open groups. The laparoscopic approach was not an independent risk factor for tumor recurrence or mortality compared with the open approach.Conclusion:We found no differences in the oncologic outcomes between laparoscopic and open hepatectomy groups, suggesting that laparoscopic hepatectomy for HCC is a safe and effective option that does not increase the risk of serious complications.
