Objective:The utility of risk scores to predict the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients treated with nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) remains to be elucidated.Methods:CU-HCC (The Chinese University of Hong Kong-HCC) and GAG-HCC (Guide with Age, Gender, HBV DNA, Core promoter mutations and Cirrhosis) scores of 225 Japanese patients treated with NAs for at least 2 years were calculated before and 2 years after the NA treatment. According to the cutoff values, the patients were categorized into high-score or low-score groups.Results:Sixteen of 225 patients developed HCC. Patients with a high score before the NA treatment showed a significantly higher HCC incidence than those with a low score using both score models (p Conclusions:The predictive performance of the CU-HCC and GAG-HCC scores in the CHB patients treated with NAs is comparable to that in the NA-naive patients. The patients with sustained high scores after the NA treatment showed a higher incidence of HCC development.
