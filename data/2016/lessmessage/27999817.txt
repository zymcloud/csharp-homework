Diphenyl difluoroketone (EF24), a curcumin analog, is a promising anticancer compound that exerts its effects by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. However, the efficacy of EF24 against cancer metastasis, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), remains elusive. In this study, the effect of EF24 on HCCLM-3 and HepG2 cell migration and invasion was detected by wound healing and transwell assay, respectively. The results revealed that EF24 suppressed the migration and invasion of both HCCLM-3 and HepG2 cells. Furthermore, EF24 treatment decreased the formation of filopodia on the cell surface and inhibited the phosphorylation of Src in both cell lines, which may help contribute towards understanding the mechanism underlying the suppressive effect of EF24 on HCC migration and invasion. Additionally, the expression of total- and phosphorylated-Src in primary HCC tissues and their paired lymph node metastatic tissues was detected, and phosphorylated-Src was found to be associated with HCC lymph node metastasis. The results of this study suggest that Src is a novel and promising therapeutic target in HCC and provide evidence to support the hypothesis that EF24 may be a useful therapeutic agent for the treatment of HCC.
