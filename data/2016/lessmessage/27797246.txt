The objective of the present study was to evaluate the anticancer and radio-sensitizing efficacy of a Withania somnifera extract/Gadolinium III oxide nanocomposite (WSGNC) in mice. WSGNC was injected to solid Ehrlich carcinoma-bearing mice via i.p. (227 mg/kg body weight) 3 times/week during 3 weeks. Irradiation was performed by whole body fractionated exposure to 6Gy, applied in 3 doses of 2 Gy/week over 3 weeks. Biochemical analyses as well as DNA fragmentation were performed. Treatment of solid Ehrlich carcinoma bearing mice with WSGNC combined with γ-radiation led to a significant decrease in the tumor size and weight associated with a significant decrease in mitochondrial enzyme activities, GSH content and SOD activity as well as a significant increase in caspase-3 activity, MDA concentration and DNA fragmentation in cancer tissues. Combined treatment of WSGNC and low dose of γ-radiation showed great amelioration in lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status (GSH content and SOD activity) in liver tissues in animals bearing tumors. It is concluded that WSGNC can be considered as a radio-sensitizer and anticancer modulator, suggesting a possible role in reducing the radiation exposure dose during radiotherapy.
