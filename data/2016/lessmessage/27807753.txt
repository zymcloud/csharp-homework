Complex diseases are caused by disorders of both internal and external factors, and they account for a large proportion of human diseases. They are multigenetic and rarely a consequence of the dysfunction of single molecules. Systems biology views the living organism as an organic network. Compared with reductionism-based viewpoints, systems biology pays more attention to the interactions among molecules located at different omics levels. Based on this theory, the concepts of network biomarkers and network medicine have been proposed sequentially, which integrate clinical data with knowledge of network sciences, thereby promoting the investigation of disease pathogenesis in the era of biomedical informatics. The former aims to identify precise signals for disease diagnosis and prognosis, whereas the latter focuses on developing effective therapeutic strategies for specific patient cohorts. In this chapter, the basic concepts of systems biology and network theory are presented, and clinical applications of biomolecular networks, network biomarkers, and network medicine are then discussed.
