Goblet cell carcinoid (GCC) of the appendix is extremely rare, representing approximately 5% of all primary appendiceal neoplasms. Histologically there are three groups of GCC: group A (typical GCC), adenocarcinoma ex GCC signet ring cell type (group B), and adenocarcinoma ex GCC poorly differentiated carcinoma type (group C), which is the most aggressive. GCC metastasizes in 15-60% of cases, mainly to the ovaries, pelvis, abdominal cavity, ribs, vertebrae, and lymph nodes. Hematogenous metastasis to the liver or other parenchymal organs can occur, but this is very rare. The different organs metastases havent been described yet. The primary mode of treatment is radical surgical resection or debulking, followed by chemotherapy; however, patients with unresectable or recurrent GCC are candidates for systemic therapy. Here, we report a case of very aggressive GCC of the appendix, which had metastazed to the liver at the time of diagnosis and subsequently metastasized to the orbit.
