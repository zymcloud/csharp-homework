Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is on the rise and has become a major etiology for chronic liver disease. It is frequently associated with obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia and is considered the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. In this review, we present a summary of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of NAFLD, and discuss the clinical evaluation and stratification of NAFLD patients into low, intermediate, and high risk with respect to liver-related outcomes. While diet and exercise are the cornerstone of treatment in all patients, the low rate of adherence and inadequacy of these recommendations necessitate pharmacologic intervention, especially in intermediate- and high-risk patients. We discuss vitamin E and pioglitazone which are often used as first-line therapy by many practitioners, with pentoxifylline and liraglutide as backup agents. Several drugs are in advanced-phase clinical trials and will likely change the landscape for management of NAFLD in the very near future.
