Objective:The resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to chemotherapy may be mediated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. We wished to verify the involvement of this pathway in resistance of HCC cells to cisplatin.Materials and methods:We used HepG2 cell line and cisplatin-resistant clone (HepG2/DDP). Expressions of drug resistance and apoptosis-related genes were analyzed by qPCR. Protein expressions were assessed by Western blot. The JNK pathway was assessed as total JNK1/2 and JNK1/2 phosphorylation. Cell growth kinetics was quantified by the CCK-8 assay, and cell apoptosis (Annexin V / propidium iodide) by flow cytometry.Results:HepG2/DDP cells were more resistant and less apoptotic on cisplatin. Expression of drug-resistance genes MDR1, MRP1 and MPR2 was significantly up-regulated in HepG2/DDP cells (p Conclusions:Inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway enhances the sensitivity of HCC cells to cisplatin by down-regulating the expression of P-gp.
