Background and aims:A sustained virological response (SVR) decreases the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with hepatitis C. We investigated the long-term outcomes of patients who developed HCC after achieving SVR with interferon therapy.Patients:Of 75 patients who developed HCC after SVR, 40 patients underwent radical therapies (SVR group). From 436 patients undergoing surgical resection for hepatitis C virus-positive HCC, 80 patients were randomly chosen as a control cohort, after adjusting for age, gender, and extent of hepatic fibrosis (non-SVR group). Patients were observed for a median of 5.08 years.Results:HCC recurrence was found in 16 SVR patients and in 66 non-SVR patients. The respective HCC recurrence rates of SVR and non-SVR patients were 23 and 56% at 3 years, 42 and 77% at 5 years, and 53 and 90% at 10 years (p = 0.001). The respective overall survival rates in the SVR and non-SVR groups were 93 and 68% at 5 years, 88 and 34% at 10 years, and 53 and 21% at 15 years (p = 0.001).Conclusion:Although SVR patients had a significantly lower HCC recurrence rate than the non-SVR patients, the cumulative recurrence rate of SVR patients increased to 86% at 15 years.
