Introduction:Inflammatory pseudotumor (IPT) of the liver is a rare and benign disease that has a good prognosis. It is often difficult to distinguish IPT from hepatic malignancies, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), because specific clinical symptoms are absent and the diseases' radiological findings can be similar. IPT is particularly difficult to distinguish from HCC in livers with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis. We report a case of IPT of the liver that mimicked HCV-related HCC recurrence.Presentation of case:A 78-year-old asymptomatic Japanese man who had undergone hepatectomy for HCV-related HCCs (moderately differentiated type) in segments 7 and 5 four and a half years previously was referred to our hospital for treatment of a 30-mm enhanced tumor in segment 5 (a typical HCC pattern). The tumor was identified via abdominal dynamic computed tomography (CT) and CT with hepatic arteriography and arterial portography. Thereafter, liver segmentectomy 5 was performed, and the histopathological diagnosis was a 10-mm IPT of the liver. After 1.5 years, magnetic resonance imaging revealed two new enhanced lesions in segment 8, which showed the typical pattern of HCC. Because these lesions grew in size for 3 months, liver segmentectomy 8 was performed for HCC recurrence. Histopathological examination showed that both lesions were HCCs.Conclusion:HCV-related HCC has a high rate of multicentric recurrence. Our experience suggests that, when a hepatic lesion is suspected to be HCC, surgical resection should be considered for curative treatment and to rule out malignancy, even if the lesion may be an IPT.
