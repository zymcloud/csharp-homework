The SASH1 (SAM- and SH3-domain containing 1) gene, a member of the SLY (SH3 domain containing expressed in lymphocytes) family of signal adapter proteins, has been implicated in tumorigenesis of many types of cancers. However, the role and mechanism of SASH1 in the invasion and metastasis of hepatocarcinoma are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role and mechanism of SASH1 in the invasion and metastasis of hepatocarcinoma. Our results showed that SASH1 was lowly expressed in hepatocarcinoma cell lines. The in vitro experiments showed that overexpression of SASH1 inhibited the proliferation and migration/invasion of hepatocarcinoma cells, as well as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress. Furthermore, overexpression of SASH1 suppressed the expression of Shh as well as Smo, Ptc, and Gli-1 in hepatocarcinoma cells. Taken together, these results suggest that overexpression of SASH1 inhibited the proliferation and invasion of hepatocarcinoma cells through the inactivation of Shh signaling pathway. Therefore, these findings reveal that SASH1 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of hepatocarcinoma.
