Background:The standard treatment option that is available for patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). However, the condition of the patients with BCLC stage B disease is heterogeneous showing different tumor statuses and Child-Pugh scores; treatment strategies other than TACE are frequently employed for the patients in this stage. Based on the subclassification system proposed by Bolondi et al. [Semin Liver Dis 2012;32:348-359], we developed the Kinki criteria focusing on a substaging for BCLC stage B disease, which is simpler and should be more suitable in actual clinical setting in Japan. In this study, we evaluated the performance of Kinki criteria.Summary:This study included 1,633 HCC patients who received first-line treatment at the Kindai University Hospital. Patients were classified into subgroups based on the Kinki criteria and the survival time was estimated for each group. There were 156 (33.3%) patients in subclass B1, 278 (59.3%) in B2, and 35 (7.4%) in B3. The median overall survival times and 95% CI for BCLC B subclasses B1, B2, and B3 were 4.3 years (3.7-4.9), 2.9 years (2.2-3.4), and 1.1 years (0.5-1.8), respectively (p
