Objective:We have reported about real-time tissue elastography (RTE), which displays relative strain by measuring the relative distortion of the tissue, and found this information to be useful for diagnosing liver fibrosis. However, its use in predicting hepatocellular carcinoma has not been reported as yet. Here, we investigated RTE to predict liver carcinogenesis in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.Methods:We enrolled 160 patients with chronic HCV, who were followed up for 39.9 ± 22.9 weeks (median). They underwent RTE and then ultrasounds every 3-6 months.Results:Respective cumulative liver cancer incidences for years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were, for the entire cohort: 2.0, 5.6, 8.8, 13.1, and 23.9%; for those whose liver fibrosis index (LFI) was ≤2.0: 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, and 0.0%; for those whose LFI was 2-2.8: 0.0, 7.4, 7.4, 13.2 and 19.9%; and for those whose LFI was >2.8: 12.9, 12.9, 21.7, 31.4, and 31.4% (p = 0.011; log-rank test).Conclusions:Measurements of LFI by strain imaging can effectively predict liver cancer risk in patients with chronic HCV infection.
