Purpose:To assess the value of dynamic contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for the detection of residual tumor tissue day 1 after microwave ablation (MWA) of large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to MRI.Material and methods:30 consecutive patients (5 females, 25 males, mean age 64 years, age range 54-73 years) with an untreated HCC lesion larger than or equal to 3 cm underwent percutaneous MWA between 03/2014 and 04/2016. 1 patient was excluded because of an artificial pacemaker. All remaining 29 patients underwent 3-T MRI with liver-specific contrast agent and CEUS 1 day after ablation to detect residual tumor tissue. The 6-week follow-up including CEUS and MRI was defined as the reference standard.Results:Complete ablation was achieved in 23 of 29 treated lesions (79%). The sensitivities and specificities for the detection of residual tumor tissue on day 1 were 100% and 83% for CEUS and 87% and 67% for MRI resp. without the differences being statistically significant.Conclusion:CEUS allows a reliable assessment of therapeutic success of percutaneous ablation of large HCC lesions one day after the ablation. Its ability to visualize reactive periablation perfusion changes in real-time might be of advantage in the depiction of residual tumor tissue when compared to MRI imaging alone.
