Background and aims:Predictive factors for hepatocarcinogenesis following eradication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA by antiviral therapy with direct-acting antivirals are unknown. Especially the impact of treatment with or without interferon on hepatocarcinogenesis is not clear.Methods:A total of 958 patients with HCV genotype 1-related chronic liver disease and a sustained virological response defined as negative HCV RNA 24 weeks after cessation of antiviral therapy with direct-acting antivirals (triple therapy of NS3/4A protease inhibitor/peginterferon/ribavirin or all-oral combination therapy with NS3/4A protease inhibitor plus NS5A inhibitor) were included in a retrospective study. None of the patients had hepatocellular carcinoma before and during antiviral therapy.Results:In all, 14 patients developed hepatocellular carcinoma during follow-up, and the development rate per 1,000 person-years was 7.35. The cumulative hepatocarcinogenesis rates were 4.2 and 4.2% at the end of 5 and 7 years, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified fibrosis 4 (FIB4) index (≥2.7) and body mass index (≥23.0) as determinants of hepatocarcinogenesis, but they did not identify the treatment regimen. In patients with a FIB4 index ≥2.7, the hepatocarcinogenesis rates with the interferon regimen were not different from those for the regimen without interferon, regardless of gender.Conclusion:Liver fibrosis and body mass index, but not treatment regimen, are important predictors of hepatocarcinogenesis following eradication of HCV RNA by direct-acting antivirals.
