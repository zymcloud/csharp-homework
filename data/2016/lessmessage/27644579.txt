Absence of portal vein bifurcation is a rare anomaly. We report a patient with this anomaly who underwent right hemihepatectomy for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Although the procedure was carefully performed with a preoperative three-dimensional simulation and intraoperative cholangiography, postoperative portal vein thrombosis occurred. J. Med.
