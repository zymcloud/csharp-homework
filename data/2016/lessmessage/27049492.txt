Background and aims:Cytokeratin19 positive (CK19+) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is thought to derive from liver progenitor cells (LPC). However, whether peritumoralductular reaction (DR) differs between CK19+ and CK19 negative (CK19-) HCC patients remains unclear.Material and methods:One hundred and twenty HBV-related HCC patients were enrolled in this study. Clinicopathological variables were collected, and immunohistochemistry staining for CK19, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and β-catenin were performed in tumor and peritumor liver tissues.Results:CK19+ HCC patients had higher grade of peritumoral DR and proportion of proliferative DR than the CK19- group. The mean number or the proportion of cytoplasmic β-catenin+ DR was higher in the CK19+ group than in the CK19- group. Furthermore, there were more patients with nuclear β-catenin+ peritumoral DR in the CK19+ group as compared to the CK19- group.Conclusion:Peritumoral DR was more abundant and proliferative in CK19+ HCC patients, with higher level of nuclear translocation of β-catenin. However, it is unclear whether peritumoral DR is the cause or result of poor prognosis in these patients.
