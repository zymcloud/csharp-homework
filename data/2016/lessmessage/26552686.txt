Accumulating evidence implicates phosphoinositide 4-phosphate as a regulatory molecule in its own right recruiting specific effector proteins to cellular membranes. Here, we describe biochemical and immunocytochemical methods to evaluate tetraspanin-associated phosphoinositide-4 kinases activity in primary human hepatic stellate cells (hHSC) and neoplastic hepatoblastoma cells.
