Objective In recent years, an increase has been observed in the incidence of bone metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In 2007, our institution established a team approach, which includes the provision of palliative care. In the present study we evaluate the effects of palliative care on the prognosis of HCC patients with bone metastases. Methods The subjects included 44 patients with bone metastases who were treated with radiotherapy between 2000 and 2014. The subjects were divided into groups that received radiotherapy from 2000 to 2006 and after 2007. The overall survival rates after radiotherapy were analyzed. Results The median survival time of the patients who received care between 2007 and 2014 was 6 months, which was significantly longer than that in the patients who received care between 2000 and 2006. Conclusion The present team approach in our hospital, which includes the provision of palliative care, started in 2007. This approach may have improved prognosis of patients with metastatic HCC.
