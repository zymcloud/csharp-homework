Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent type of malignant liver tumor and a high impact health problem worldwide. The prevalence of HCC is particularly high in many Asian and African countries. Some HCC patients have no symptoms prior to diagnosis and many of them therefore present at late stage and have a grave prognosis. The well-established causes of HCC are chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection or alcoholic cirrhosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Staging System remains the most widely used for HCC management guidelines. To date, the treatments for HCC are still very challenging for physicians due to limited resources in many parts of the world, but many options of management have been proposed, including hepatic resection, liver transplantation, ablative therapy, chemoembolization, sora nib and best supportive care. This review article describes the current evidence-based management of HCC with focus on early to advance stages that impact on patient overall survival.
