Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the deadliest types of cancer. Despite improvements in treatment over the past few decades, patient survival remains poor and there is an urgent need for development of targeted therapies. MicroRNAs represent a class of small RNAs, frequently deregulated in human malignancies. We are reviewing the role of microRNA in the development of primary hepatocellular carcinoma and its use as a biomarker for early diagnosis and clinical treatment. First, we describe the current incidence and possible causes of the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, followed by the introduction of microRNA synthesis, maturation and function, and finally we explain the role of microRNA in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma and its clinical value as a biological marker in the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer. A comprehensive analysis of cellular microRNA is a benefit for early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and early clinical intervention, and microRNA is considered by some to be a key target of gene therapy to control the occurrence and development of hepatocellular carcinoma..
