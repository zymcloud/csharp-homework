In the mammalian liver, 60 % of the cellular components are hepatocytes while the remainder (35 %) includes biliary epithelium, Kupffer cells, endothelial cells, fat storing cells and connective tissue cells. Although neoplasms of hepatocytes are the most common, a significant number of both benign and malignant primary liver neoplasms arising from other cell types can develop, such as tumors of bile duct epithelium (Table 1). In addition, the liver is one of the most susceptible sites for metastatic tumors arising from other organs of the body. Not too long ago, liver tumors were left untreated because the liver was considered a complex and mysterious organ inaccessible to surgery. Advances in imaging procedures and surgical techniques over the past 40 years have revolutionized the approaches to the treatment of benign and malignant liver tumors. Subsegmentectomy, segmentectomy, lobectomy, and transplantation are routinely performed for the treatment of primary and metastatic liver tumors with minimal morbidity and mortality. Since accurate diagnosis remains the key to clinical and surgical management, the emphasis of this chapter is on classification, morphological features and differential diagnosis of malignant neoplasms of the liver.
