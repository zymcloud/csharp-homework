To date, there is only up to 2% of protein-coding genes that are stably transcribed, whereas the vast majority are non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). These ncRNAs, also known as non-messenger RNAs (nmRNAs) or functional RNAs (fRNAs), include transfer RNAs, ribosomal RNAs, microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). With the advance of high-resolution microarrays and massively parallel sequencing technology, lncRNAs have gained extended attentions nowadays and are found to play important roles in tumorigenesis and progression of human cancers. Long intergenic non-protein coding RNA, regulator of reprogramming (linc-ROR), was first discovered in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), where it was controlled by the key pluripotency factors Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. Linc-ROR has been shown to be dysregulated in many types of cancers, including breast cancer (BC), pancreatic cancer (PC), hepatocellular cancer (HCC), endometrial cancer (EC), and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Also, linc-ROR functions as regulatory molecule in a large amount of biological processes. However, the underlying mechanisms of its contribution to carcinogenesis remain to be elucidated. In this review, we will emphasize on the characteristics of linc-ROR and their roles in different types of human cancers.
