Background and aim:Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is the most common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. Des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) is elevated in many patients with HCC, but also in severe alcoholics without HCC. We aimed to clarify whether the DCP/NX-DCP ratio (NX-DCP-R) could have a high specificity in ALD patients without HCC.Methods:We performed a prospective cohort study on a total of 703 consecutive outpatients of liver diseases including severe alcoholics and healthy volunteers, who underwent blood biochemical examinations at Kobe University Hospital. Serum DCP was measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) using a monoclonal antibody, MU-3. A novel parameter, serum NX-DCP, which represents predominantly DCP caused by reduced vitamin K availability, was also measured by ECLIA using monoclonal antibodies P-16 and P-11. The diagnostic accuracy of DCP and NX-DCP-R in patients with and without excessive alcohol intake was statistically examined.Results:DCP was significantly higher in alcoholics than in non-alcoholics (p= 0.005), whereas the NX-DCP-R did not differ between alcoholics and non-alcoholics (p= 0.375). DCP was significantly increased in the serum of each patient with alcoholic hepatitis and alcoholic cirrhosis (p 0.05).Conclusions:NX-DCP-R, but not DCP, was not increased in alcoholics without HCC. As for negative screening for HCC, the specificity of the NX-DCP-R in alcoholics without HCC was better than that of DCP in alcoholics without HCC, and so could be a useful negative screening tool for HCC in millions of alcoholics worldwide.
