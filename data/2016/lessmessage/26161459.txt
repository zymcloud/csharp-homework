1. Imatinib is metabolized to N-desmethyl imatinib by CYPs 3A4 and 2C8. The effect of CYP2C8*3 genotype on N-desmethyl imatinib formation was unknown. 2. We examined imatinib N-demethylation in human liver microsomes (HLMs) genotyped for CYP2C8*3, in CYP2C8*3/*3 pooled HLMs and in recombinant CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 enzymes. Effects of CYP-selective inhibitors on N-demethylation were also determined. 3. A single-enzyme Michaelis-Menten model with autoinhibition best fitted CYP2C8*1/*1 HLM (n = 5) and recombinant CYP2C8 kinetic data (median ± SD Ki = 139 ± 61 µM and 149 µM, respectively). Recombinant CYP3A4 showed two-site enzyme kinetics with no autoinhibition. Three of four CYP2C8*1/*3 HLMs showed single-enzyme kinetics with no autoinhibition. Binding affinity was higher in CYP2C8*1/*3 than CYP2C8*1/*1 HLM (median ± SD Km = 6 ± 2 versus 11 ± 2 µM, P=0.04). CYP2C8*3/*3 (pooled HLM) also showed high binding affinity (Km = 4 µM) and single-enzyme weak autoinhibition (Ki = 449 µM) kinetics. CYP2C8 inhibitors reduced HLM N-demethylation by 47-75%, compared to 0-30% for CYP3A4 inhibitors. 4. In conclusion, CYP2C8*3 is a gain-of-function polymorphism for imatinib N-demethylation, which appears to be mainly mediated by CYP2C8 and not CYP3A4 in vitro in HLM.
