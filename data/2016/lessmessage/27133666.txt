Purpose:To compare MRI features of pathologically-proven hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between patients with hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) infection.Methods:Two radiologists assessed 51 confirmed HCCs on MRI in HBV (n=18) or HCV (n=33) patients; a third, more experienced, radiologist resolved discrepancies.Results:Arterial hyperenhancement occurred more frequently in HCV (90.9% vs. 66.7%; P=.032), DWI/T2WI hyperintensity more frequently in HBV [(DWI: 78.6% vs. 45.8%, T2WI: 77.8% vs. 48.5%; P=.073-0.088)]. Tumors were larger in HBV (Pâ‰¤.016). Washout, pseudocapsule, homogeneity, circumscribed margins, lipid, iron, and visually low ADC were not different.Conclusion:Larger studies are required to confirm these preliminary findings.
Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; Hepatocellular carcinoma; MRI.
