Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection results in not only chronic hepatitis and subsequent complications as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, but also in a significant number of other diseases, the so-called extrahepatic manifestations of chronic HCV infection. This is because of viral hepatotropicity and lymphotropicity. The most striking example of the course of chronic HCV infection, in which the infectious and inflammatory processes are concurrent with autoimmune disorders and carcinogenesis, is mixed cryoglobulinemia and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The pathogenesis of these diseases is based on the clonal expansion of B cells, which occurs under their prolonged stimulation with the virus or viral proteins. Part 1 of this review is devoted to the analysis of a correlation of chronic HCV infection with lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disorders, as well as its association with kidney injury.
