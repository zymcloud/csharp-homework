Introduction:Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (sirolimus and everolimus) are a class of immunosuppressive drugs approved for solid organ transplantation (SOT). By inhibiting the ubiquitous mTOR pathway, they present a peculiar safety profile. The increased incidence of serious adverse events in early studies halted the enthusiasm as a kidney sparing alternative to calcineurin inhibitors (CNI).Areas covered:Herein we review mTOR inhibitors safety profile for adult organ transplantation, ranging from acute side effects, such as lymphoceles, delayed wound healing, or cytopenias, to long-term ones which increase morbidity and mortality, such as cancer risk and metabolic profile. Infection, proteinuria, and cutaneous safety profiles are also addressed.Expert opinion:In the authors' opinion, mTOR inhibitors are a safe alternative to standard immunosuppression therapy with CNI and mycophenolate/azathioprine. Mild adverse events can be easily managed with an increased awareness and close monitoring of trough levels. Most serious side effects are dose- and organ-dependent. In kidney and heart transplantation mTOR inhibitors may be safely used as either low-dose de novo or through early-conversion. In the liver, conversion 4 weeks post-transplantation may reduce long-term chronic kidney disease secondary to calcineurin nephrotoxicity, without increasing hepatic artery/portal vein thrombosis.
