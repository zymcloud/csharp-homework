Macrophages have multiple functions in both inhibiting and promoting hepatocarcinogenesis, which are dependent on their phenotypes. Thus, we were interested in clarifying the 'training' proinflammatory effects exerted by barley β-glucan (BBG) on monocyte-derived macrophages from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC-Mfs). After isolation and differentiation HCC-Mfs were treated with different concentrations of BBG and functional assays were then conducted after 24 h, and 3 and 5 days of incubation. The release of reactive oxygen species, arginase concentration and cell morphology were analyzed. Under the influence of BBG neoplastic cells slightly elongated and dendric-like filopodia were observed. In HCC-Mfs, the significant generation of NO and O2- was seen on days 3 and 5 of culture, concomitantly with significant depletion (p<0.05) of arginase activity. In summary, we showed that HCC-Mfs, 'trained' in a BBG microenvironment keep a highly dynamic plasticity, together with their proinflammatory polarization, expressed by reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) augmentation.
