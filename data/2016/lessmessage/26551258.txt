Background/aims:Liver transplantation (LT) is promising method of treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, but is limited by donor organ shortages and tumor progression during long wait periods. This study investigated the efficacy of salvage living donor LT (LDLT) after initial liver resection (LR) in HCC patients.Methods:Sixty patients with HCC who underwent primary LDLT (n = 45) or salvage LDLT after initial LR (n = 15) were enrolled. Significant prognostic variables determined by univariate analysis were subjected to multivariate analysis using a Cox proportional hazard regression model. Cox proportional hazards models with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) based on propensity score were used to adjust for selection bias between groups.Results:The salvage group had significantly higher Child-Pugh class A (p = 0.003), â‰¥3 pretransplant treatments (p = 0.007), and reoperation rates for postoperative bleeding (p = 0.032) than the primary LDLT group, whereas overall and recurrence-free survival rates were comparable. After IPTW matching, the salvage LDLT group had significantly more reoperations for postoperative bleeding (hazard ratio 7.948, p = 0.017).Conclusions:First-line LR followed by salvage LDLT allows survival equal to that of primary LDLT. Salvage LDLT following primary LR could be an effective therapy.
