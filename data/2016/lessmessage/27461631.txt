Objective:Numerous studies have reported the role of microRNA-499 rs3746444 polymorphism with hepatocellular carcinoma. (HCC) risk in Asians, but the specific association is still controversial.Materials and methods:To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed. An electronic search of PubMed database was conducted to select relevant studies. Odds ratios. (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals. (CIs) were estimated to assess the relationship between microRNA-499 rs3746444 polymorphism and HCC risk in Asians.Results:Eight relevant studies including 2196 cases and 2701 controls were included in this meta-analysis. When all the eligible studies were pooled into this meta-analysis, no significant association of HCC risk with microRNA-499 rs3746444 polymorphism was found in Asians (TT vs. CC: OR = 1.00 95% CI = 0.54-1.83; TT vs. TC: OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.66-1.20; dominant model: OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.81-1.58; recessive model: OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.56-1.76).Conclusion:This meta-analysis suggests that the microRNA-499 rs3746444 polymorphism is not contributed to the risk of HCC in Asians. However, more studies should be performed in the future to confirm this association.
