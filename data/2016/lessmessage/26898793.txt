Palliative transarterial chemoembolization is indicated for patients with stage B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification (BCLC). As this is a very wide and heterogenous group of patients, the ART score was designed to better differentiate these patients and to guide the decision for a second transarterial chemoembolization cycle.The goal of the study is to prove that the ART score is appropriate to define subgroups within the stage BCLC-B HCC group with significantly better or worse overall survival (OS) after repeated transarterial chemoembolization. A combined retrospective and prospective study was performed of the OS of patients with stage BCLC-B HCC that were monitored and treated at the Internal Medicine Clinic of the First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague and the Central Military Hospital Prague. An analysis of the survival curve using the Kaplan-Meier method was performed using the R software package.The median OS of the entire patient group was 18 months (95% CI 12-33). The median OS of patients with a favorable ART score was 33 months (95% CI 12-33) compared to 12 months (95% CI 6-18) for patients with an unfavorable ART score. The difference in OS in the subgroups differentiated by ART score was statistically significant (p
