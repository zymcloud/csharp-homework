Background and rationale:The post-Liver Transplant Quality of Life (pLTQ) questionnaire, developed in the United States, is a disease-targeted instrument designed to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in liver transplant recipients. Our study sought to validate a version of the pLTQ for use in the Brazilian population. Translation and cross-cultural adaptation were carried out in accordance with international standard practices for questionnaire validation. Validity was measured by means of convergent validity (correlations between pLTQ domains and WHOQOL-Bref domains). Reliability was assessed by measurement of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient), reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient), sensitivity to change (effect size), and floor and ceiling effects.Results:The study sample comprised 160 liver transplant recipients, with a mean age of 56.9 ± 10.4 years, treated at a tertiary hospital in Southern Brazil. The sample was largely male (62.5%), and the predominant indication for liver transplant was hepatocellular carcinoma (49.4%). Only two questionnaire items were modified during the translation and cross-cultural validation stage. The mean total pLTQ score was 5.58 ± 0.9, with Conclusion:In conclusion, the Brazilian Portuguese versión of the pLTQ exhibited good psychometric performance, suggesting that it can be a useful tool in the Brazilian cultural context.
