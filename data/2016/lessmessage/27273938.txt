Purpose: The fifth most common cancer of the gastrointestinal system is liver cancer. It is also one of the most common cancers worldwide. The available treatment options include surgery, percutaneous ablation, and liver transplantation. Some of the latest modalities for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are radiofrequency ablation, trans-arterial chemoembolization, radioembolization and systemic targeted agents like sorafenib. The process of choice of a particular treatment modality in HCC depends on the tumor stage, patient performance status and liver function reserve. In the recent past with progress in research, the short-term survival of HCC has improved but recurrent disease remains a fundamental problem as the pathogenesis of HCC is a multistep and complex process. The present review is focused on recent advances in the management of HCC. This review will also provide an insight on the upcoming latest modalities including the emerging role of hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) overexpression in liver fibrosis and carcinogenesis.
