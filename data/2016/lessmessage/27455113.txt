Background:The mean survival is less than 6 months in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with extrahepatic metastasis. Gastrointestinal(GI) bleeding frequency due to HCC invasion is 0.05% to 2.0%, and may be fatal.Case presentation:We encountered a case of HCC with direct invasion to the gastrium that caused a life-threatening upper GI bleeding. Our patient was a 62 year old male who was a heavy smoker and drinker for almost 30 years. He had several upper GI bleeding episodes during the previous 6 months. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 13cm liver tumour directly invading the gastrium. Partial hepatic resection and subtotal gastrectomy were performed. Unfortunately, the patient died at the intensive care unit postoperatively due to hepatic failure.Discussion:Although the prognosis of HCC that has invaded the gastrium is very poor due to the advanced stage of the disease, surgical resection may be a favourable treatment option for patients with a massive upper GI bleeding.Conclusions:The incidence of patients with massive bleeding due to gastric invasion of HCC is low, and only a few cases have been reported in the literature. Our purpose while presenting this rare case is to increase the awareness about the issue.
