CD90 has been identified as a candidate marker of cancer stem cells (CSCs) for HCC, whereas it also has been considered as a marker for tumor-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). OCT4, as a key transcription factor required to maintain pluripotency of human embryonic stem cell and cancer cells, has been characterized to be involved in malignant transformation and tumorigenesis of various cancers. This study aimed to examine expression patterns of CD90 in HCC and investigate whether combination of both CD90 and OCT4 could provide a more powerful predictor for prognosis of HCC than either one alone.CD90 and OCT4 were examined by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between CD90/OCT4 expression and clinicopathologic characteristics was analyzed. The correlation between CD90/OCT4 expression and overall survival and disease-free survival was determined with Kaplan-Meier analysis.CD90 was found mainly expressed in tumor-associated CAFs and OCT4 was mainly expressed in tumor cells. The expression of CD90 and OCT4 in HCC was significantly higher than in adjacent non-tumor and normal liver tissues. CD90 expression was correlated with pathological grade, satellite lesion, PVTT and recurrence. OCT4 expression was correlated with pathological grade, tumor size and recurrence. Data demonstrated no correlation between CD90 and OCT4. High expression of CD90 or OCT4 predicts a poor prognosis. Furthermore, combination of both CD90 and OCT4 provides a more sensitive predictor for prognosis of HCC than either marker alone.CD90 and OCT4 are both independent and reliable biomarker for predicting prognosis of HCC patients after hepatic resection. Our results indicated the accuracy of prediction can be enhanced by their combination.
