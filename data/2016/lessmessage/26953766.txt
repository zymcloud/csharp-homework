Objective:The aim of this study was to describe the multiphase multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT) imaging findings of large (>5 cm) focal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Following review of the medical records of 321 patients with newly diagnosed HCC who underwent MDCT within the radiology database from January 2007 to November 2014, 27 patients (20 men and 7 women; mean age, 69 [SD, 10.1] years [range, 49-87 years]) with histologically confirmed HCC greater than 5 cm were included in this institutional review board-approved study. Multiphase, dedicated liver MDCT images of these cases were retrospectively reviewed by 2 radiologists in consensus to describe the enhancement characteristics of these lesions.Results:Mean tumor diameter was 8.4 (SD, 2.4) cm (range, 5.2-13.5 cm). Cirrhosis was present in 16 (59%) of 27 patients. Seventeen (85%) of 20 patients with available laboratory data presented with elevated alpha-fetoprotein (median, 97 ng/mL). Twenty-three (85%) of 27 demonstrated either heterogeneous enhancement with gradual fill-in (14/27 [52%]) or peripheral enhancement with centripetal fill-in (9/27 [33%]). Twenty-two (81%) of 27 lacked washout on delayed phase images, and 21 (78%) of 27 demonstrated a pseudocapsule. Twenty-seven of 27 lesions were well defined, 8 (30%) of 27 were exophytic, 15 (56%) of 27 were unifocal, 5 (25%) of 20 cases demonstrated vascular invasion, and 7 (26%) of 27 cases presented with extrahepatic metastases.Conclusions:Large (>5 cm) focal HCC may present as a dominant mass with a pseudocapsule and initial heterogeneous or peripheral enhancement with gradual or centripetal fill-in without washout on multiphase MDCT. Awareness of this variant is important to allow distinction from other benign (eg, hemangioma) and malignant (eg, cholangiocarcinoma) focal liver lesions.
