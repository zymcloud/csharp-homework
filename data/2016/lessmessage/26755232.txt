The efficacy and safety outcomes were compared between groups.Results:Elderly patients yielded significantly lower rapid virological response and sustained virological response (SVR) (31.3% and 35.4%, respectively, P Conclusions:Increasing age negatively affected the efficacy of peginterferon and ribavirin therapy in the treatment of patients with CHC.
