Objective:The aim of the current study was to identify the human cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) that are capable of sulfating clioquinol and iodoquinol, and to verify the presence of clioquinol/ iodoquinol-sulfating activity in human organ homogenates and cultured cells.Method:An established sulfotransferase assay was employed to analyze clioquinol/iodoquinolsulfating activity of thirteen known human SULTs, as well as cytosols of human kidney, liver, lung, and small intestine. Metabolic labeling with [35S]sulfate in the presence of different concentrations of clioquinol/iodoquinol was performed using cultured HepG2 human hepatoma cells and Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cells.Results:A systematic analysis revealed that six of the thirteen known human SULTs, SULT1A1 SULT1A2, SULTA3, SULT1B1, SULT1C4, and SULT1E1 showed considerable clioquinol/ iodoquinol-sulfating activity. Kinetic parameters of the sulfation of clioquinol and iodoquinol by three SULTs, SULT1A1, SULT1A3, and SULT1C4, that showed the strongest clioquinol/iodoquinolsulfating activity were determined. Moreover, clioquinol/iodoquinol-sulfating activity was detected in the cytosol fractions of human liver, lung, kidney, and small intestine. Cultured HepG2 and Caco-2 cells were shown to be capable of sulfating clioquinol/iodoquinol under metabolic conditions.Conclusion:Collectively, these results provided a molecular basis underling the metabolism of clioquinol and iodoquinol through sulfation.
