Introduction:Pancreatic metastases are uncommon and only found in a minority of patients with widespread metastatic disease at autopsy. The most common primary cancer site resulting in pancreatic metastases is the kidney, followed by colorectal cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, lung carcinoma and sarcoma.Presentation of case:Herein, we report a 63-year-old male patient who presented -3.5 years after radical nephrectomy performed for renal cell carcinoma (RCC)-with a well-defined lobular, round mass at the body of the pancreas demonstrated by abdominal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The patient underwent distal pancreatectomy combined with splenectomy and cholecystectomy. Histopathological examination revealed clusters of epithelial clear cells, immunohistochemically positive for RCC marker, and negative for CD10 and CA19-9. A final diagnosis of clear RCC metastasizing to pancreas was obtained in view of the past history of RCC, microscopy and the immunoprofile. This was the second metachronous disease recurrence after a previous metastatic involvement of the liver, developed 19 months from the initial diagnosis. The patient has remained well at a 6 month follow up post-resection.Discussion:Solitary pancreatic metastases may be misdiagnosed as primary pancreatic cancer. However, imaging including computed tomography (CT) and MRI, may discriminate between them. Surgical procedures could differentiate solitary metastasis from neuroendocrine neoplasms. The optimal resection strategy involves adequate resection margins and maximal tissue preservation of the pancreas.Conclusion:Recently, an increasing number of surgical resections have been performed in selected patients with limited metastatic disease to the pancreas. In addition, a rigid follow-up scheme, including endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and CT is essential give patients a chance for a prolonged life.
