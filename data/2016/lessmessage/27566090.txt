Background:Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated and angiogenesis-dependent disease. Activated keratinocytes in psoriatic lesions produce pro-angiogenic cytokines, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which binds to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and promotes cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) is a molecular multikinase inhibitor of RAF kinase, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), VEGFR-1, -2, -3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-Î² and c-Kit. This molecule inhibits tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis and it is currently approved for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Case report:We present the complete remission of resistant psoriasis in a hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected cirrhotic patient who was treated with sorafenib, for recurrent HCC.Conclusion:Several targeted therapies have demonstrated efficacy against psoriasis. More research and well-designed studies, both in novel drugs and those already marketed for other indications, are needed to determine their value as potential novel therapies for psoriasis.
