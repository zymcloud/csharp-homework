Objective:Treatment for chronic hepatitis C has recently developed in a very rapid manner. In Japan, in September 2014, IFN-free asunaprevir (ASV) and daclatasvir (DCV) became available for combination therapy. We report the treatment outcomes achieved at our hospital using this combination therapy.Methods:Sustained virological response (SVR) 24 could be evaluated in 120 of 125 patients with chronic liver disease type C who visited our hospital and were treated with ASV/DCV after September 2014, and these patients were analyzed.Results:SVR24 was achieved in 106 patients (88%). End-of-treatment response was not achieved in 10 patients (8.3%). Five of them carried multiple-resistant NS3/4A or NS5A region, and administration was discontinued early in 4 patients due to adverse effects. After ASV/DCV treatment, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) developed in 2 patients (1.7%) and recurred in 5 (4.2%).Conclusions:ASV/DCV treatment achieved favorable SVR in elderly and hepatic cirrhosis patients and patients in whom HCC was cured. However, an increase in the incidence of HCC development in patients who markedly respond to direct-acting antivirals treatment is expected and surveillance of HCC becomes more important.
