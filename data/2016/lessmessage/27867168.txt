We report on the methods and experiences of the dual-phase cone beam computed tomography during hepatic arteriography (CBCTHA) to apply the 3D-DSA. A total of 32 ml contrast medium (150 mgI/ml) was injected at the rate of 2.0 ml/s for 16 s. The early phase scan was initiated 10 s after the start of contrast media injection. The delayed phase scan was started 40 s after that (24 s after the end of CM injection). When using the dual phase CBCTHA, it was able to obtain the classical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) images same as computed tomography during hepatic arteriography (CTHA). In the early phase, the tumor can be highly enhanced against the liver parenchyma. In delayed phase, corona enhancement was clearly appeared at the liver parenchyma. Of 58 cases of acquisitions, we experienced six cases with miss breath holding and 14 cases with over the field of view (FOV) due to hepatomegaly. We evaluated the tumor contrast in 18 cases because the other 40 cases were not applied to our criteria. The pixel values of ROIs on the tumor, coronal enhancement, and liver parenchyma were measured, respectively. Then, we calculated tumor-parenchyma contrast (T-P contrast), corona-tumor contrast (C-T contrast), and corona-parenchyma contrast (C-P contrast). The T-P contrast was 358±112, the C-T contrast was 132±51, and the C-P contrast was 168±66. The contrast was clearly visualized among them. The dual-phase CBCTHA that applies the 3D-DSA is a simple and useful technique for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.
