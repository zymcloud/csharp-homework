Objective. To present our experience of using transperitoneal subcostal access, Palmer's point (3 cm below the left costal margin in the midclavicular line), and its right corresponding site, in urologic laparoscopy. Methods. We used Palmer's point and the right corresponding site for initial access in 302 urologic surgeries (62 cases with prior surgeries). The record of these cases was reviewed. Results. Success rate of initial access is 99.4%, and complication rate of puncturing is only 3.4% with no serious complication. In the cases with prior surgeries, there were only two cases with access complication on the right side (minor laceration of liver). For people with BMI more than 30 kg/m2 (12, 3.9%), the success rate was also 100 percent. Conclusions. Palmer's point and the corresponding right location are feasible, effective, and safe for initial access in urologic laparoscopic surgeries. This entry technique should be used routinely in urologic laparoscopic surgeries.
