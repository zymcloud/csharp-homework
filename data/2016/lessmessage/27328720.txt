Purpose:We aimed to assess the feasibility, efficacy and safety of a local application of sorafenib within a conventional transarterial chemoembolization in the VX-2 tumor-bearing rabbit model.Methods:VX-2 tumors were induced in the left liver lobe of 10 New Zealand White rabbits. After two weeks, growth was verified by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). Five rabbits were treated by transarterial chemoembolization using an emulsion of sorafenib and ethiodized oil (referred to as SORATACE; n=5). Rabbits receiving oral sorafenib for two weeks (n=2) and untreated rabbits (n=3) served as controls. After two weeks, contrast-enhanced CT was performed, followed by animal necropsy.Results:The change in tumor diameter between baseline and follow-up was significantly different in the SORATACE group compared with the other groups; tumor shrinkage was observed in the SORATACE group only (P = 0.016). In both control groups, preserved hypervascularity was seen in the follow-up CT in all but one tumor. All tumors in the SORATACE group were devascularized in the follow-up CT. Importantly, substantial parenchymal damage in nontargeted areas of the tumor-bearing liver lobe was seen in rabbits treated with SORATACE.Conclusion:SORATACE demonstrated high efficacy in the treatment of experimental VX-2 liver tumors but was also associated with substantial liver parenchymal toxicity.
