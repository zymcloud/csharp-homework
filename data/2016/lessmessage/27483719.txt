Aim:To establish the best protocol for pancreatic computer tomography and criteria for staging (mainly for vascular invasion).Material and methods:Our research included 49 consecutive patients with pancreatic cancer examined at the Iasi "Sf. Spiridon" Hospital between January and December 2014 with a Siemens 16 Emotion CT unit. CT protocol included no enhanced CT and pancreatic phase of the superior abdomen, portal venous phase of the abdomen and pelvis.Results and discussion:The study patients were stratified into 5 age groups and the most frequently affected by pancreatic cancer were the patients aged 60 to 79 years. For T staging the extension in the per pancreatic fat tissue, into surrounding organs (5 patients had extension in other organs) and vessels was evaluated. We determined the degree of contact between the tumor and the artery, thrombosis and deformity of the veins and we have found 8 resettable lesions, 28 tumors in stage T3 and 13 pancreatic cancers in stage T4. Thirty-three patients had lymphadenopathies and 31 of them had distant metastases.Conclusions:Our study proved that computed tomography is a good method of examination for pancreatic cancer when the right imaging protocol is used; during the pancreatic phase the arteries and the tumor are well depicted, liver metastases are best evaluated during the portal venous phase. The best criterion for arterial invasion is tumor contiguity with more than half of vessel circumference, and for vein invasion deformity or thrombosis. Comparison with surgical staging was o good backup for the radiologist and depicted several differences with imaging staging, more often understating than over staging.
