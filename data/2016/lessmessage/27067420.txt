Purpose:Liver metastasis represents the first site of dissemination in >80% of metastatic pancreatic cancer (PC) patients. Pulmonary metastasis as first site of dissemination in PC is a rare event and might define a biologically distinct subgroup in metastatic PC.Methods:Consecutive PC patients who were diagnosed or treated with isolated pulmonary metastases at our high-volume comprehensive cancer center were included in a prospectively maintained database between 2002 and 2015. Medical records and correlating computed tomography findings (CT) were retrospectively analyzed.Results:A total of 40 PC patients with isolated pulmonary metastases were identified. Pulmonary metastases represented disease recurrence after initial resection of PC in 22 patients and disease progression of locally advanced pancreatic cancer in 5 patients. 14 out of 27 PC patients (56%) had received chemoradiotherapy for localized disease prior to pulmonary metastasis. Data on 1st-line treatment for pulmonary metastases was available for 38 patients: most patients (71%) received a gemcitabine-based chemotherapy regimen, 5 patients (13%) received best supportive care. After a median follow-up of 37.3 months, median survival after diagnosis of pulmonary metastasis was estimated with 25.5 months (95% CI 19.1-31.8); a significantly improved survival after diagnosis of pulmonary metastasis was observed for patients with less than 10 lung metastases (31.3 vs 18.7 months, p = 0.003) and for an unilateral localization of lung involvement (31.3 vs 21.8 months, p = 0.03).Conclusions:Our results suggest a favorable outcome of PC patients with isolated pulmonary metastases. Further research is warranted to elucidate the specific molecular characteristics of this rare subgroup.
