Background:At least nine therapeutic options are recommended or approved for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (pNET). The primary endpoint of this study was to determine the number of therapeutic lines given before death. Secondary endpoints were to determine toxic events as a function of number of therapeutic lines and of time.Methods:Patients with pNET treated between 1998 and 2010 at our centre were characterised. All therapeutic lines were recorded as well as tumour- or toxic-related deaths. Persistent treatment-related toxicity (PTRT) was defined as: chronic kidney disease, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, severe liver failure, cardiac failure and recurrent sepsis, precluding at least one other therapeutic option or second cancers.Results:Ninety-two patients were analysed. The median follow-up was 7 years. The 1-, 2- and 5-year overall survival rates were 90, 81 and 51%, respectively. After 3 and 5 therapeutic lines, 23 and 50% of patients had died, respectively. After 3 and 5 lines, the frequency of toxic events was 8 and 24%, respectively. Overall, 17 toxic events were observed including 6 treatment-related deaths and 11 PTRT. After 1, 2 and 5 years of treatment, the frequency of toxic events was 6, 9 and 16%, respectively.Conclusion:Tumour- and toxic-related deaths as well as PTRT may preclude access to all therapeutic options in patients with pNET. Optimised risk benefit sequence should be investigated.
