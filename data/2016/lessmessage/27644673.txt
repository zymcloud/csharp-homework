Background:The population in northeast Thailand continues to present with hepatobiliary abnormalities, particularly periductal fibrosis (PDF) which is the result of chronic infection with liver fluke (Opisthorchis viverini; OV) and may lead to the development of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Although the prevalence of OV infection has been decreased due to a liver fluke control program over decades, the prevalence of PDF remains high. This study aimed to investigate demographic factors associated with PDF risk based on ultrasonography (US) screening.Materials and methods:This cross-sectional study is part of the Cholangiocarcinoma Screening and Care Program (CASCAP), a prospective cohort study. Multiple logistic regression was used for data analysis.Results:In 55,246 subjects, the overall prevalence of PDF was 33.0% (95%CI: 32.6 - 33.4). Males (33.9 %) were at higher risk for developing PDF than females (32.2 %) (ORcrude = 0.93; 95%CI: 0.89 - 0.96; p-value < 0.001). Factors associated with an increased PDF risk, in addition to OV infection, included old age (â‰¥ 70 years) (ORadj =1.28, 95% CI: 1.14 - 1.44, <0.001) and hepatitis B infection (ORadj = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.11 - 1.55, p = 0.001). In contrast, number of praziquantel treatments (> 2 times) (ORadj = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.47 - 0.63, <0.001) and diabetes mellitus (ORadj =0.57, 95% CI: 0.49 - 0.65, <0.001) were significantly associated with a decreased PDF risk.Conclusions:Future US screening should closely examine older people and hepatitis B subjects for the purpose of PDF surveillance among high risk groups for CCA. However, the results of inverse associations require further investigation in order to confirm our findings.
