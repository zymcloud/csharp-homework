Hepatic steatosis is a progressive liver disease, frequently met in chronic virus C hepatitis, playing an important role in its evolution towards fibrosis, necroinflammation and the final stage the hepatocellular carcinoma. The present paper studies the correlation between clinico-epidemiological parameters and the pathology test outcome in patients with hepatic biopsies carried out before they began the antiviral treatment. We used the classical histological staining and the immunolabeling. The presence of steatosis is not directly associated with clinico-epidemiological parameters and with the degree of fibrosis and inflammation.
