Liver transplantation is a potentially curative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma. However, patients with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma after liver transplantation have few treatment options and local treatment may not be feasible. Sorafenib, an orally active multikinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, significantly improves progression-free and overall survival. However, only a few studies have evaluated the efficacy of sorafenib in patients with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma following liver transplantation. Here, we report a case of a patient with recurrent advanced hepatocellular carcinoma after living donor liver transplantation who achieved complete remission in response to sorafenib treatment. The patient has survived for more than 4 years post-transplantation.
