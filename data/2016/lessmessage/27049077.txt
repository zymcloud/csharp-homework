This study discusses the changes of T helper cells (Th cells) of patients who received different anesthesia methods in liver cancer resection. We selected 122 patients who were diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma and underwent liver cancer resection and divided them into a general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia group (group A) and general anesthesia group (group B). Peripheral blood was collected to detect Th cells on the day of surgery, and on the second and seventh days after surgery. Th1 and Th2 cell frequency and mRNA expression of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) of all patients significantly rose on the second day but recovered to the previous level on the seventh day. Th1/Th2 increased remarkably on the seventh day compared to the second day. Compared to the day of surgery, Th17, regulatory T (Treg)cells as well as mRNA expression of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and FoxP3 had no obvious changes on the second day, but dramatically declined on the seventh day. Compared to group B, Th1 cell frequency and Th1/Th2 in group A had a slight increase on the second day, and a remarkable increase on the seventh day; but Th2, Th17 and Treg cell frequency in group A slightly decreased on the second day and remarkably decreased on the seventh day. mRNA of IFN-γ, cytokine levels and IFN-γ/IL-4 of group A were all higher than group B on the seventh day, while mRNA of IL-17, concentration of IL-17 as well as concentration of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in group A were much lower than group B. These findings suggest that improving antitumor activity of Th cells can benefit patients who receive liver cancer resection.
