Background:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is hyperendemic in southern Africa, with subgenotype A1 prevailing. The precore/core (preC/C) region of A1, encoding for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), has unique sequence characteristics, differentiating it from subgenotypes A2 and D3. Our aim was to follow the expression of HBeAg in vitro by the three subgenotypes.Methods:Huh7 cells were transfected with plasmids belonging to subgenotypes A1, A2, and D3. Using indirect immunofluorescence, the expression of HBeAg was followed, as was the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and subsequent activation of apoptosis.Results and conclusions:Following transfection with D3, HBeAg passed through the secretory pathway earlier than cells transfected with genotype A. Cells transfected with A1 showed a lower expression of the preC/C precursor in the secretory pathway and a higher co-localization in the nucleus. Cells transfected with A1 showed greater endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and an earlier, prolonged activation of the UPR seen by the higher activity of three ER-localized transmembrane transducers (double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER kinase, activating transcription factor 6, and inositol-requiring enzyme 1), on day 3 compared to day 5. Moreover, our study also found that cells transfected with A1 had increased apoptosis.
