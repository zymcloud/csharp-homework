Background. The protein encoded by PARK2 gene is a component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system that mediates targeting of proteins for the degradation pathway. Genetic variations at PARK2 gene were linked to various diseases including leprosy, typhoid and cancer. The present study investigated the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PARK2 gene with the development of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and its progression to severe liver diseases.Material and methods:A total of 800 subjects, including 400 normal healthy subjects and 400 HCV-infected patients, were analyzed in this study. The patients were classified as chronic HCV patients (group I), patients with cirrhosis (group II) and patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the context of cirrhosis (group III). DNA was extracted and was genotyped for the SNPs rs10945859, rs2803085, rs2276201 and rs1931223.Results:Among these SNPs, CT genotype of rs10945859 was found to have a significant association towards the clinical progression of chronic HCV infection to cirrhosis alone (OR = 1.850; 95% C. I. 1.115-3.069; p = 0.016) or cirrhosis and HCC (OR = 1.768; 95% C. I. 1.090-2.867; p value = 0.020).Conclusion:SNP rs10945859 in the PARK2 gene could prove useful in predicting the clinical outcome in HCV-infected patients.
