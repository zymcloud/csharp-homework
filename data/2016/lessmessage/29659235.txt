Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent type of liver malignancy. As a carcinogen, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) causes HCC by inducing deoxyribonucleic acid adducts that lead to genetic changes in liver cells and may be the cause of HCC in up to 30% of cases. The incidence of HCC has been on the rise and is an issue in the countries of the Western Balkans.Case outline:This paper presents a case of a 37-year-old woman who was diagnosed with HCC, without hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or liver cirrhosis. The patient consumed milk and dairy products in quantities of over two liters per day over the course of 20 years, which indicates the impact of aflatoxin in milk on HCC. A positive signal for the presence of AFB1 was detected by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) in-house using immunoperoxidase screening test.Conclusion:As carcinogenic difuranocoumarin derivative, aflatoxin B1 is the most likely cause of malignant transformation of hepatocytes, which resulted in hepatocellular carcinoma in this patient.
