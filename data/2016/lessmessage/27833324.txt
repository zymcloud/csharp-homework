99mTc macroaggregated albumin (MAA) scintigraphy is always performed before administration of 90Y--microspheres for the treatment of liver tumors for hepatopulmonary shunt calculation. Tumor thrombus visualization in the hepatic vasculature is an infrequent finding on the 99m Tc--MAA single photon emission computed tomography. We present a rare case of a hepatocellular carcinoma extending as a tumor thrombus through hepatic vein, inferior vena cava into the right atrium.
