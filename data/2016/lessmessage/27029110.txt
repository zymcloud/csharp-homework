Prevalence of viral hepatitis based on serological monitoring, virus RNA detection, risk factors, change in structure of circulating genotypes, hepatocellular carcinoma morbidity were studied.Results:Epidemiologic manifestations of viral hepatitis C in Mongolia, in contrast to Irkutsk Region, are characterized by, a wider prevalence of the disease, predominance of the fraction of seropositive individuals in age category of above 50 years and predominance of genotype 1 virus in circulation. In recent years an evolution of diversity of circulating' irus genotypes, ook place towards a reduction of the fraction of genotype in Mongolia and Russia due tor ni ncrease of the fraction of genotype-3. Expressed,differences in average-annual values of hepatocellular carcinoma morbidity were detected, that were more than 10 times higher among Mongoloids compared with Caucasians.Conclusion:Pronounced differences were detected in manifestations of epidemic process of viral hepatitis C in Mongolia and Asian part of Russia, represented by Eastern Siberia, that are associated with ethnic, social and, cultural living conditions of the indigenous population.
