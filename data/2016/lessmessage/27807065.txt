Follistatin (FST), as a single-chain glycosylated protein, has two major isoforms, FST288 and FST315. The FST315 isoform is the predominant form whilst the FST288 variant accounts for less than 5% of the encoded mRNA. FST is differentially expressed in human tissues and aberrant expression has been observed in a variety of solid tumours, including gonadal, gastric and lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma and melanoma. Based on the current evidence, FST is an antagonist of transforming growth factor beta family members, such as activin and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). FST plays a role in tumourigenesis, metastasis and angiogenesis of solid tumours through its interaction with activin and BMPs, thus resulting in pathophysiological function. In terms of diagnosis, prognosis and therapy, FST has shown strong promise. Through a better understanding of its biological functions, potential clinical applications may yet emerge.
