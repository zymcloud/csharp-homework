Objective:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in microRNA (miRNA) binding sites in the NOD2 and IL12B gene 3.-untranslated regions and colorectal cancer (CRC) susceptibility in an Iranian population.Methods:We genotyped NOD2 rs3135500 [3. untranslated region (UTR) A/G] and IL12B rs1368439 (3.UTR G /T) in a hospital-based study of 92 colorectal cancer cases and 105 healthy controls. All samples were genotyped by TaqMan assay via an ABI 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) with DNA from FFPE tissue and peripheral blood.Results:our results showed similar distribution of genotype and allelic frequencies of the NOD2 and IL12B polymorphisms between patients and controls. When the more common rs3135500 AA genotype was used as the reference, the rs3135500 AG and rs3135500 GG genotypes were not significantly associated with the risk of CRC (OR = 1.294, 95% CI: 0.524 -3.197; and OR = 2.230, 95% CI: 0.87 - 5.715, respectively), and The IL12B rs1368439 TG and IL12B rs1368439 GG genotypes were not significantly associated with the risk of CRC compared with the IL12B rs1368439 TT genotype (OR = 1.547 95% CI: 0.187- 12.771; and OR = 1.753, 95% CI: 0.217-14.157, respectively).Conclusion:NOD2 rs3135500 and IL12B rs1368439 SNPs were not genetic risk factors for colorectal cancer in the studied Iranian population.
