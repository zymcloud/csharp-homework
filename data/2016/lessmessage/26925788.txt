Promoter methylation of tumor suppressor gene SOX11 has been reported to contribute to the diagnosis and prognosis of various cancerous diseases, including gastric cancer, hematopoietic malignancies and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However, there is no data on the diagnostic potential of serum SOX11 promoter methylation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study was therefore aimed to investigate the potential role of serum SOX11 promoter methylation as a noninvasive biomarker in the diagnosis of patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) associated HCC. A total of 205 subjects were retrospectively included, which consisted of 111 HCC patients, 66 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 28 healthy controls (HCs). Methylation of SOX11 promoter was determined by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The methylation frequency of serum SOX11 promoter in HCC patients (69.4%, 77/111) was significantly higher than that in CHB patients (13.6%, 9/66; Ï‡2 = 51.467, P
