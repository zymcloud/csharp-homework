Background:Liver transplantation is the criterion standard treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma, but tumor recurrence remains a problem leading to a worse prognosis. We aimed to evaluate factors associated with recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma and survival after this procedure.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed data from 101 patients submitted to liver transplantation because of hepatocellular carcinoma from January 2005 to January 2012 at our single center. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify preoperative factors and histologic findings associated with lower survival rates and recurrence. The significance level was 5%.Results:There was recurrence in 10 cases (9.9%), with an average time of 25.28 Â± 26.92 months. Microvascular invasion (P = .005; hazard ratio [HR], 4.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.42-17.12) was an independent factor for recurrence. Microvascular invasion (P = .035; HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.04-3.25) and tumors outside the criteria of the University of San Francisco (P = .046; HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.01-3.25) were independent factors for the risk of death. Poorly differentiated tumors had a higher level of alphafetoprotein (P = .03), and values Conclusions:Microvascular invasion was associated with recurrence and lower survival. Tumors outside the criteria of the University of California, San Francisco had lower survival. Alpha-fetoprotein levels >100 ng/mL were associated with poorly differentiated tumors.
