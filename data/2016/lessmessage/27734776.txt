Objective:To estimate mortality due to chronic hepatitis B-virus (HBV) and hepatitis C-virus (HCV) infections in the Netherlands from 2002 to 2015.Design:A cross-sectional analysis based on cause-of-death statistics.Method:From Statistics Netherlands we obtained detailed data regarding the number of deaths per year in the following ICD-10 categories: chronic viral hepatitis; malignant neoplasm of the liver and intrahepatic bile ducts; fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver; and alcoholic liver disease. We determined the population-attributable fractions (PAF) of HBV and HCV infections in mortality due to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cirrhosis of the liver, and added these to the recorded mortality from viral hepatitis in order to calculate total mortality. We used Dutch research as a basis for allocation to HCC, and a range of PAFs from 3 studies for cirrhosis. Poisson regression was used to assess mortality trends over time and any differences in demographic characteristics.Results:Around 500 Dutch people died annually of chronic viral hepatitis from 2002 to 2015, according to our 'middle' estimate; the 'lowest' estimate yields 340 and the 'highest' 600 people per year. The total mortality due to a chronic HBV and HCV infection did not change over time. The mortality for HCC due to viral hepatitis increased slightly over time and the mortality for cirrhosis decreased slightly. HCC mortality due to viral hepatitis was higher in Dutch people of non-western origin.Conclusion:Mortality from chronic viral hepatitis is mostly the result of cirrhosis of the liver and HCC. About 500 persons died annually from 2002 to 2015 from causes linked to viral hepatitis.
