Background:hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third cause of mortality due to cancer throughout the world.Objective:The main goal of the current research was to evaluate the selective toxicity of apigenin (APG) on hepatocytes and mitochondria obtained from the liver of HCC rats).Method:In this research, HCC induced by a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (DEN); 200 mg/kg, i.p, and 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) (0.02%, through dietary) for 14 days. For confirmation of HCC, histopathological evaluations and determination of serum concentrations of liver toxicity enzymes and specific liver cancer marker; alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were performed. Then, cancerous and non- cancerous hepatocytes were isolated by using the collagen perfusion method. Eventually, mitochondria isolated from HCC and normal hepatocytes were tested for every eventual toxic effects of APG.Results:After confirmation of HCC, the results of this research showed that APG (10, 20 and 40 Î¼M) increased mitochondrial parameters such as, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, mitochondrial swelling and cytochrome c expulsion only in cancerous hepatocytes. Apoptotic effect of APG on HCC cells was confirmed by caspase-3 activation and Annexin V-FITC and PI double staining analysis.Conclusion:These results propose the eligibility of the flavonoid APG as a complementary therapeutic agent for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
