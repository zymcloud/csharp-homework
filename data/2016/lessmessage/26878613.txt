Hypercalcemia caused by tumor production of PTH-rp occurs most often in cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, aerodigestive tract cancer, gynecological cancer and lymphoma. We report an exceptional case of PTH-rp related to a hepatic hemangioendothelioma. A 70 years-old male admitted for deterioration of the general state. The laboratory investigations revealed hypercalcemia, related to tumor production of PTH-rp. Imaging revealed tumoral hepatic lesions. Histopathological study and immunohistochemistry showed diffuse response for CD31 marker, CK20 (+) with CK7 (-) and hepatocyt antigen (-). The diagnosis of PTH-rp related to hepatic hemangioendothelioma was make. The patient died with recurrence of fatal hypercalcemia. Management of patients presenting with humoral hypercalcemia includes a vigorous search for tumor lesions. Elevated PTH-rp can be a bad prognostic factor. In front of tumoral liver lesions, a hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma must be considered. Immunohistochemistry is necessary to make diagnosis.
