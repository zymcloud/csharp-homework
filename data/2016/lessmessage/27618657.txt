Background:Weight loss in pancreatic cancer is associated with maldigestion due to pancreatic duct obstruction. Pancreatic exocrine replacement therapy (PERT) may significantly improve fat and protein absorption.Objectives:This prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial assessed whether PERT could reduce or prevent weight loss in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.Methods:Sixty seven patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer were randomized to receive enteric coated PERT, consisting of 6-9 capsules of pancreatin (457.7 mg/capsule), or placebo. Patients took two capsules each three times daily during main meals and one capsule each up to three times daily when having between-meal snacks. The primary endpoint was the percentage change in body weight at eight weeks.Results:The mean percentage change in body weight (1.49% [1.12 kg] vs. 2.99% [1.63 kg], P = 0.381) and the mean percent change in Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) score (8.85% vs. 15.69%, p = 0.18) did not differ significantly between the PERT and placebo groups. There was no improvement in quality of life and overall survival did not differ significantly between the PERT and placebo groups (5.84 months vs 8.13 months, p = 0.744).Conclusions:PERT did not reduce weight loss in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Larger randomized trials are needed to identify those patients who may benefit from PERT.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov Number NCT01587534.
