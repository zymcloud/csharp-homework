Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The current work was designed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumorigenic effect of pomegranate hull extract (PHE) in livers of rats exposed to the hepatocarcinogen diethyl nitrosamine (DENA) with emphasis on oxidative stress, proliferation, and apoptosis. Male albino rats were divided into three groups: normal control, DENA group, and PHE group. PHE was given to rats orally 3 times weekly for 10 wk, 4 wk before and 6 wk after DENA (200 mg/kg, single i.p. dose). The results indicated a prophylactic effect of PHE against neoplastic changes in the liver, which was evidenced by the decrease of tumor size, liver index, and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2; and the increase of glutathione. PHE group also showed decreased expression of liver cyclin D1 and Î²-catenin genes compared with DENA group. It is proved that PHE has antitumorigenic effect and could be a candidate for anticancer drugs.
