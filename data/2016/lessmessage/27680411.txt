Objective:Use of gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced liver magnetic resonance (MR) for evaluation of hepatocellular carcinoma tumor response after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:Forty-five patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were imaged with multiphase gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MR examination at baseline and 1-month follow-up after TACE. Nodule size, enhancement, and apparent diffusion coefficient were measured for both examinations by 2 reviewers. Changes in tumor nodule size, enhancement, and apparent diffusion coefficient were evaluated using the Student t test.Results:Nineteen of 45 patients completed the study, and a total of 34 hepatocellular carcinoma nodules were analyzed. On the posttreatment follow up, there was no significant change in nodule size. Target lesions demonstrated significant decrease in tumor enhancement after TACE (P Conclusion:Gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced liver MR may help differentiate between viable and necrotic tumor after TACE.
