The Mini Parasep SF fecal parasite concentrator (MPSFC) is a new modification of the closed concentration system, which can easily be adopted in any routine clinical pathology laboratory. Here we describe our experience with the system in diagnosing Opisthorchis viverrini. A total of 199 fecal samples was submitted for routine examination in the clinical pathology laboratory of Suranaree University of Technology hospital, Nakhon Ratchasima province, Thailand, during August to October 2015. Out of all samples examined, 10 (5.03%) were positive with intestinal parasites including O. viverrini (2.01%), followed by Strongyloided stercoralis (1.51%), Hookworm (0.5%), Taenia spp. (0.5%), and Entamoeba coli (0.5%). Regarding the distribution of intestinal parasites in relation to the methods used, and found that 4 samples (2.01%) were positive using the direct wet smear method while 10 (5.03%) were positive with the Mini Parasep SF method; the difference was statistically significant (X2-test = 116.506, p-value =0.001). Mean time for processing using the Parasep system was 6.03 min/ sample, the conventional direct wet smear method at 0.3 min/sample. Cost per test, conventional direct wet smear method costing less than the Parasep method at USD 0.74/sample versus USD 1.47/sample. This first report of O. viverrini detection using MPSFC indicates that Parasep concentration test is useful in the routine laboratory, increasing the yield of parasites as compared to direct microscopy, but with greater processing time and cost. Further comparisons between the Parasep concentration test and common methods for O. viverrini detection are required, particularly concerning use in epidemiological surveys.
