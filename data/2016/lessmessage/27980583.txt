Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has infected 3% of the population worldwide and 20% of the population in Egypt. HCV infection can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma and death. The presently available treatment with interferon plus ribavirin, has limited benefits due to adverse side effects. Seaweeds have become a major source of new compounds to treat viral diseases. This work aimed to study the effect of four species of seaweeds as anti- HCV. The inhibition of lipid peroxidation was measured by evaluating the ability of seaweed extracts to scavenge the free radicals. The HepG2 cells were infected with the HCV and treated with each seaweed polysaccharide. Inhibition of viral replication was detected using the Real Time PCR (RT) qPCR. To explain the mode of the seaweed action on HCV, three modes of virus infections and seaweed polysaccharide treatments were applied. All treatments had the ability to inhibit the HCV with priority to Laurencia obtusa (82.36%), while the potentiality to scavenge the free radicals reached up to 81.5% with the Sargassumvulgare. Seaweed polysaccharide extracts may be helpful in exploring further gateways for antiviral therapy against HCV.
