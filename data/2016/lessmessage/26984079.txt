Sorafenib has been approved to increase the survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Acute pancreatitis is an uncommon complication of sorafenib treatment. Only a few cases of sorafenib-induced acute pancreatitis have been reported in the English literature. We herein present the case of a 56-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with sorafenib at 200 mg once daily. After six days of treatment, he suffered epigastric pain. Laboratory tests showed markedly elevated serum amylase and lipase levels. Imaging studies demonstrated negative findings. Sorafenib-induced acute pancreatitis was diagnosed after reviewing his history. The sorafenib treatment was discontinued, and his symptoms were resolved seven days later. To date, this case had the shortest duration and the lowest dosage of sorafenib to have induced acute pancreatitis.
