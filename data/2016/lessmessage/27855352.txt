Introduction:A hepatic schwannoma is extremely rare and difficult to diagnose preoperatively.Presentation of case:We report the case of a 47-year-old male patient who was referred to our hospital for the close investigation of a hepatic tumor which had not been detected two years earlier. An enhanced computed tomography revealed a well-circumscribed and encapsulated tumor with a size of 50mm which was adjacent to the inferior vena cava (IVC) and the right hepatic vein. The tumor was heterogeneously enhanced until the equilibrium phase. A magnetic resonance image showed a hypointense area on a T1-weighted image and a hyperintense area on a T2-weighted image. These findings differed from those of common malignant hepatic tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal liver metastases. The tumor was most likely a mucus-producing tumor or a liquefactive degenerated adenocarcinoma. Although we could not confirm an exact diagnosis of the tumor, we performed a surgical resection in view of the possibility of malignancy. The patient underwent a limited liver resection with resection of the IVC. Histologically, the tumor was diagnosed as a benign schwannoma comprised of Antoni A and B areas. The nuclear palisading formation of the tumor showed Verocay bodies.Discussion:15 cases of hepatic schwannoma are reviewed to clarify the typical radiological features. The radiological findings of the present case were consistent with those of the hepatic schwannoma when considering retrospectively.Conclusion:A precise preoperative diagnosis of hepatic schwannoma is difficult, and liver resection is recommended when a hepatic schwannoma is suspected.
