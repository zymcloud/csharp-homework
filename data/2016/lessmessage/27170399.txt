Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. HCC represents more than 90% of primary liver cancers. There is a growing incidence of HCC worldwide. In the Western world, HCC arises in a cirrhotic background in up to 90% of cases, and cirrhosis itself is a progressive disease that affects patient survival. Thus, outcome in patients with HCC and the chances for anti-tumor treatment and its results are dependent not only on tumor-associated factors but also on liver function.
