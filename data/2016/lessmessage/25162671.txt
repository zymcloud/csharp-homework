Aim:In the present paper, paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded stealth liposomes were prepared with thin film hydration technique in order to prolong the time of circulation.Method:The liposomes' characterization, in vitro release, pharmacokinetics, and biodistribution profile of the drug were investigated.Results:Microscope showed that the liposomes were spherical in shape with a smooth surface and the size was uniform and appropriate for administration via intravenous injection. The encapsulation efficiency was 91.1 ± 4.3%, and the mean diameter was 82.2 ± 7.6 nm from three batches. The results of in vivo studies indicated that PTX-loaded stealth liposomes show favorable pharmacokinetics and biodistribution compared to the free drug. In comparison with free PTX, the AUC0-t of PTX liposomes and stealth liposomes increased 1.91- and 3.39-fold, respectively. The stealth liposomes were long-circulating showing a half-life time of 34.2 h against 13.7 h for the conventional ones.Conclusions:These results suggest that stealth liposomes would serve as a potent PTX delivery vehicle for the future cancer chemotherapy and represent a suitable platform for the development of targeted liposomal PTX systems.
