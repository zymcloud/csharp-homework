A focal lesion in a healthy liver of a person not having cancer is almost always benign. Diagnosis is often achieved on the basis of anamnesis and imaging findings. A histologic specimen is required in the case of suspected malignant tumor or hepatocellular adenoma. Magnetic resonance imaging is the primary investigation for an unresolved focal lesion of a cancer patient, and the histologic specimen will, when necessary, be taken only after this. Early detection of metastases of colorectal cancer in particular is important, since metastases that have spread to the liver or lungs may be operable. A focal lesion in a cirrhotic liver is either a regenerative nodule or hepatocellular carcinoma.
