Purpose:This study investigated the effectiveness of a clamp method combined with bipolar coagulation for anatomical hepatectomy in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:In this prospective case-control study, three liver dissection methods were used: clamping combined with bipolar electric coagulation (group A), CUSA (Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator) (group B), and ultrasonic knife (group C). Intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative blood transfusion volume, operation time, postoperative complications, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, drainage volume and exhaust time, and length of postoperative hospital stay were compared among the three groups.Results:Patients in group A had shorter operation times than those in group B (p0.05).Conclusion:The clamps method combined with bipolar electric coagulation for liver dissection requires no special equipment and has effects similar to CUSA and ultrasonic knife dissection. Therefore, this technique is worth promoting as a common liver dissection method for anatomical hepatectomy in the treatment of primary HCC.
