Objectives:Analysis of a large local autopsy collective to gather epidemiological and histopathological data on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We examined a large dataset of 44,104 autopsies performed at the Institute of Pathology, Basel, Switzerland, including 2 autopsy collectives (1969-1983 and 1988-2012) to gather current data on HCC in the advanced stage. A total of 398 HCC were diagnosed, accounting for around 1% of all autopsies.Results:As expected, most patients developing HCC had advanced stages of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis (F3/F4). However, in the more recent autopsy collective (1988-2012), our data also show an increase of HCC arising in livers without or with only mild to moderate fibrosis (F0-F2). Extrahepatic metastasis was found in 156 of 398 HCC (39.1%), with lung metastasis (74.5%) being the most common, followed by the bones (24.8%) and adrenal glands (19.1%).Conclusions:Our data therefore seem to suggest that, in the last 2 decades, despite the introduction of new therapeutic modalities for HCC, no significant changes have been observed regarding the metastatic pattern of advanced HCC.
