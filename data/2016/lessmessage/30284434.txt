It is the data of literature on existing classifications and systems of assessment and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In some classifications takes into account only the characteristics of the tumor tissue, in others are used biochemical and clinical characteristics in addition. Some systems allow to predict the survival of patients regardless of the stage of the disease, while others are most effective for the individual stages. The international TNM classification is generally accepted for the development of treatment methods and determining the forecast mainly for resectable HCC forms. The Japanese staging system (JIS) is mainly recommended for operable patients. Italian scale (CLIP), on the contrary, is intended to analyze HCC, which is not subject to surgical treatment. The Barcelona classification of liver cancer (BCLC) is considered the most universal, because it takes into account the stage of disease, the condition of the liver parenchyma and does not depend on the method of treatment and the patientâ€™s place of residence. Therefore, the choice of staging system and assessment of disease prognosis should be based on the clinical and morphological features of the disease, taking into account features of application of various scales.
