Concomitant presence of hydatid cyst and hepatocellular carcinoma is a very rare clinical scenario especially in a previously non-diseased liver. Including our case here reported, there are 12 cases of synchronous HCC and hydatid cyst found in the scientific literature and 3 of them were found in a patient with non-diseased liver. We provide detailed review of all reported cases with additional highlights on etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes of both HCC and echinococcal disease. Although there is a small number of patients, possible relation between these 2 liver lesions should be investigated and standardized classification should be established. This will help us to understand the nature of HCC carcinogenesis, identify diagnostic features of liver lesions and choose the most appropriate type of treatment.
