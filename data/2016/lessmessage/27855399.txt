Background/aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a lethal disease with nearly equal morbidity and mortality. Thus, the discovery and application of more useful predictive biomarkers for improving therapeutic effects and prediction of clinical outcomes is of crucial significance.Methods:A total of 475 HBV-related HCC patients were enrolled. Ataxin 7 (ATXN7) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped by Sanger DNA sequencing after PCR amplification. The associations between ATXN7 SNPs and mRNA expression with the prognosis of HBV-related HCC were analyzed.Results:In all, rs3774729 was significantly associated with overall survival (OS) of HBV-related HCC (P = 0.013, HR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.48-0.94). And patients with the AA genotype and a high level of serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) had significantly worse OS when compared to patients with AG/GG genotypes and a low level of AFP (adjusted P = 0.007, adjusted HR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.18-2.82). Furthermore, low expression of ATXN7 was significantly associated with poor recurrence-free survival (RFS) and OS (P = 0.007, HR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.27-4.45 and P = 0.025, HR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.18-2.62).Conclusion:ATXN7 may be a potential predictor of post-operative prognosis of HBV-related HCC.
