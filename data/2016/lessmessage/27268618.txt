The liver is one of the most common sites of cancer in the world, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) predominating. HCC is the sixth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer related death overall. Hepatitis C is a major risk factor and HCV is a rapid spreading virus which has become a problem globally, including in Pakistan. Interferon alpha therapy is used against HCV disease to regulate cell reproduction and to boost the immune system. In minute amounts interferon alpha is produced naturally by the immune system in HCV patients in response to hepatitis C virus and binds to receptors in the target cells and starts transcription of 20-30 genes due to which it develops an antiviral influence. Interferon is also administered artificially to overcome HCV disease and remove the biological effect of the virus from the infected site. The use of interferon or Peg-IFN plus Ribavirin treatment is also associated with adverse effects on body. For the current study, a convenient sample of 156 HCV positive patients of both males and females were taken. To collect blood CP and ALT, a reduction of level data and other important information were collected from the patients at regular intervals. Findings were 11.4 % in the red blood cells (RBC), 9.64 % in the total leukocyte count (WBC), 8.4 % in the hemoglobin levels (HB), 30.3 % in the platelet (Plt) count in both sexes. There was significant reduction in ALT levels due to Pegylated interferon plus ribavirin therapy. Hence strict haemotological monitoring of blood CP and ALT levels is necessary at regular intervals to reduce severe side effects which may lead to morbidity and mortality.
