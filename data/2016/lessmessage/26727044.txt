The exact incidence and severity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation after the withdrawal of prophylactic antiviral therapy (delayed HBV reactivation) is unknown. We retrospectively analyzed 107 newly diagnosed diffuse large B cell lymphoma patients with HBV infection who received chemotherapy. The median time from the cessation of antitumor therapy to the withdrawal of prophylactic antiviral therapy was 6.1 months. The incidence of delayed HBV reactivation was 21.7% in HBsAg-positive group and 0 in HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc-positive group (P < 0.001). No HBV-related fulminant hepatitis or hepatitis-related death occurred. The multivariate analysis showed that female gender and lengthy cycles of chemotherapy (>8 cycles) were independent risk factors of HBV reactivation in HBsAg-positive patients. In conclusion, prophylactic antiviral therapy could be withdrawn 6 months after the cessation of chemotherapy in HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc-positive patients. However, a longer course of prophylactic antiviral drug administration may be an optimal option to prevent delayed HBV reactivation for HBsAg-positive patients.
