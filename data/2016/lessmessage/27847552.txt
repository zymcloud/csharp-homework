Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of liver lesions ranging from hepatic steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The high global prevalence of NAFLD has underlined the important public health implications of this disease. The pathogenesis of NAFLD involves the abnormal accumulation of free fatty acids, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and a proinflammatory state in the liver. Schisandrin B (Sch B), an active dibenzooctadiene lignan isolated from the fruit of Schisandra chinensis (a traditional Chinese herb), was found to possess antihyperlipidemic, antioxidant, anti-ER stress, and anti-inflammatory activities in cultured hepatocytes in vitro and in rodent livers in vivo. Whereas a long-term, low dose regimen of Sch B induces an antihyperlipidemic response in obese mice fed a high fat diet, a single bolus high dose of Sch B increases serum/hepatic lipid levels in mice. This differential action of Sch B is likely related to a dose/time-dependent biphasic response on lipid metabolism in mice. The hepatoprotection afforded by Sch B against oxidative stress, ER stress, and inflammation has been widely reported. The ensemble of results suggests that Sch B may offer potential as a therapeutic agent for NAFLD. The optimal dose and duration of Sch B treatment need to be established in order to ensure maximal efficacy and safety when used in humans.
