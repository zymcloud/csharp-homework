Background:Surgery (R0 resection) is the mainstay of treatment of gallbladder cancer (GBC) as GBC is relatively resistant to currently known chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens.Aim:to assess if wedge resection of the gallbladder bed achieves an adequate oncological clearance in GBC (namely T1 and T2) and some T3 GBC with minimal liver infiltration.Patients and methods:Patients with GBC who underwent radical cholecystectomy (en bloc cholecystectomy, wedge resection of the gallbladder fossa with a â‰¥2 cm rim of nonneoplastic liver tissue, and regional lymph node dissection) between October 2012 and June 2015 after obtaining informed consent.Results:Of thirty patients, mean age of 52 years, 5 had T1b, 13 T2, and 12 T3 GBC. R0 resection was achieved in all thirty GBC patients. Hepatic invasion was found in seven patients. The depth of hepatic invasion ranged from 0 to 9 mm. Follow-up ranged from a minimum of 12 to 43 months. Nineteen (63%) patients had N0 and 11 (37%) had N1 GBC. Total lymph node (TLND) count ranged from 1 to 12/patient with a median of 3. There was no local recurrence or systemic relapse of the disease.Conclusion:Wedge resection of the gallbladder bed achieves an adequate oncological clearance in early GBC. TLND counts remain poor even after a thorough standard lymph node dissection for resectable GBC.
