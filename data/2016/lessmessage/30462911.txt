The purpose of this study was a comparison of the X-ray density in certain organs and anatomical structures and the determination of the radiation exposure during venous-arterial MSCT scanning and classical two-phase CT of organs of the abdominal cavity. It has been established that the technique of venous-arterial MSCT scanning provided a significant reduction of radiation dose during CT of organs of the abdominal cavity and could be used as an alternative to two-phase examination in the process of dynamic monitoring of cancer patients.
