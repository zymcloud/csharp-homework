Background/aim:The aim of this study was to assess the role of serum pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in progression of liver cirrhosis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:Serum levels of PEDF and MMP-9 were tested in 212 patients with liver cirrhosis and in a control group of 30 healthy volunteers. HCC was diagnosed in 45 of the 212 patients studied (21%).Results:Serum PEDF and MMP-9 were higher in the study group than that in the control group (P Conclusion:Serum PEDF and MMP-9 could be auxiliary markers in diagnosis of HCC, especially in patients with low alpha-fetoprotein level. Alcohol consumption can affect serum PEDF.
