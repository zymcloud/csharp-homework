Background:De novo malignancy is not uncommon after liver transplantation (LT). Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignancies in both the Korean general population and LT recipients, and colorectal cancer prevalence is gradually increasing.Methods:Among 3690 adult recipients who underwent LT from January 1999 and December 2013, the screening patterns and prognosis of 26 cases of gastric cancer and 22 cases of colorectal cancer were analyzed.Results:For gastric cancer, the mean patient age was 54.6 ± 6.2 years at LT and 59.5 ± 6.7 years at cancer diagnosis, with a post-transplant interval of 60.2 ± 29.8 months. Patients were divided into regular (n = 18) and non-regular (n = 8) screening groups, with early cancer found in 14 and 0 patients; their 2-year survival rates after cancer diagnosis were 93.1% and 33.3% (P = .006), respectively. Endoscopic resection was successfully performed in 8 patients, all in the regular screening group. For colorectal cancer, the mean patient age was 53.3 ± 6.1 years at LT and 58.1 ± 6.7 years at cancer diagnosis, with a post-transplant interval of 54.3 ± 38.0 months. Patients were divided into regular (n = 19) and non-regular (n = 3) screening groups, with early cancer found in 12 and 0 patients; their 2-year survival rates after cancer diagnosis of 92.3% and 33.3% (P = .003), respectively. Endoscopic resection was successfully performed in 6 patients, all in the regular screening group.Conclusions:LT recipients are strongly advised to undergo regular screening studies for various de novo malignancies, especially cancers common in the general population. Regular endoscopic screening contributes to the timely detection of gastric and colorectal cancers, improving post-treatment survival outcomes.
