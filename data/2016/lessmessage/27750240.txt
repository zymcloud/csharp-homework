Purpose:Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is one of the most effective therapeutic options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and it is important to protect residual liver function after treatment as well as the effect. To reduce the liver function deterioration, we evaluated the automatic software to predict the embolization area of TACE in 3 dimensions.Materials and methods:Automatic prediction software of embolization area was used in chemoembolization of 7 HCCs. Embolization area of chemoembolization was evaluated within 1 week CT findings after TACE and compared simulated area using automatic prediction software.Results:The maximal diameter of these tumors is in the range 12-42 mm (24.6 Â± 9.5 mm). The average time for detecting tumor-feeding branches was 242 s. The total time to detect tumor-feeding branches and simulate the embolization area was 384 s. All cases could detect all tumor-feeding branches of HCC, and the expected embolization area of simulation with automatic prediction software was almost the same as the actual areas, as shown by CT after TACE.Conclusion:This new technology has possibilities to reduce the amount of contrast medium used, protect kidney function, decrease radiation exposure, and improve the therapeutic effect of TACE.
