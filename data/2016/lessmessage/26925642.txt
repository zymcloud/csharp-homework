Background:Liver cytology is indicated and requested for evaluating hepatic masses in symptomatic or serendipitous cryptic discovered lesions.Objective:To determine the cytomorphological patterns of hepatic lesions identified among a group of Sudanese patients.Materials and methods:This is an analytical descriptive hospital-based study included 165 patients undergoing ultrasound-guided fine needle is an aspiration cytology (FNAC)for hepatic lesions, at Al-Amal Military Hospital and Khartoum Teaching Hospital in Khartoum, Sudan. Clinical data were reviewed. Air dried Diff Quick stained smears were grouped into unsatisfactory samples, benign lesions, and malignant neoplasms.Results:Our population were consisted of 35 (21.2%) females and 130 (78.8%) males, with a male to female ratio 3.7:1 and an age ranged between 47 to 80, and a mean age 57Â±7. Of 165 cases, 57 (34.5%) were benign, no atypia were noticed, 101 (61.2%) were malignant. Most investigated patients were found to have metastatic lesions.Conclusion:FNAC is a useful tool for investigating hepatic lesions.
