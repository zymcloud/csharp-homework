Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma generally arises in a cirrhotic liver. The aim of screening is to improve survival. The aims of our study are to determine the characteristics and evolution of hepatocellular carcinoma and the effect of screening on survival, in clinical practice in Navarre.Methods:Prospective and retrospective study of 111 patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in public hospitals in Navarre between January 2009 and January 2015. Epidemiological, clinical, analytical, radiological characteristics, tumour staging, treatment and evolution were analyzed. Survival was compared between patients subjected to screening and those not.Results:Mean age was 67 years. The patients (84.7%) were mainly male and 85.6% had cirrhosis. The most frequent aetiology was alcohol consumption (40.7%). 62.2% were diagnosed in early stages, 15.3% in intermediate and 22.5 % in advanced or terminal stages. 4.5% received transplants, 21.6% received surgical resection, 23.4% were treated with abla-tion techniques, 10.8 % with chemoembolization, 5.4% with radiembolization, 2.7% with embolization, 13.5 % with sorafenib and 18% symptomatically. Only 32 patients (28.8%) were subjected to screening. No statistical differences were found in survival depending on surveillance (32 month versus 34; p = 0.971).Conclusions:In Navarre, hepatocellular carcinoma generally appears against a background of cirrhosis, and alcohol is the most frequent aetiology. Hepatocellular carcinoma is diagnosed most frequently in early stages and out of screening practi-ces. Screening was not associated to better survival.
