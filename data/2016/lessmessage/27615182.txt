Hepatitis B virus is a worldwide leading cause of acute and chronic liver disease including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Effective vaccines have been available since the early '80s. Vaccination against hepatitis B virus infection has proved highly successful in reducing the disease burden, the development of the carrier state and the hepatitis B-related morbidity and mortality in the countries where vaccination has been implemented. Despite success and efficacy of preventive vaccines, a huge number of chronically infected patients still remain. Therapeutic vaccination may prove to be useful coupled with current antivirals and other immunomodulatory approaches to treat these patients. This review summarizes current unresolved issues and future perspectives on vaccination required for global cure of hepatitis B virus infection.
