The relation between interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) levels and the severity of liver diseases through fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been fully clarified. Thus, we aimed to characterize IFN-γ levels in liver-diseased patients. IFN-γ levels were determined by Western-blot and ELISA in sera from 30 healthy individuals, 53 patients with non-significant fibrosis (F0-F1), 47 with moderate/severe fibrosis (F2-F3), 44 cirrhotic patients (F4), and 50 with HCC. Enhanced levels of IFN-γ were associated with the progression of liver disease. The differences were statistically significant (P
