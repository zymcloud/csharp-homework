Objective:To compare the efficacy and safety of combined radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with RFA alone for hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC).Materials and methods:Randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies that compared the clinical or oncologic outcomes of combination therapy of TACE and RFA versus RFA for the treatment of HCC were identified through literature searches of electronic databases (Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China Biology Medicine disc, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Google Scholar). Hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were combined as the effective value to assess the summary effects. The strength of evidence was rated by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system.Results:Six RCTs with 534 patients were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that the combination of TACE and RFA is associated with a significantly longer overall survival (HR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.49-0.78, p Conclusion:In patients with HCC, the combination of TACE and RFA is associated with significantly higher overall survival and recurrence-free survival, as compared with RFA monotherapy, without significant difference in major complications.
