Korea has been one of the endemic areas of hepatitis B virus (HBV; exclusively genotype C) infection since ancient times. The epidemiology of HBV in Korea is easily expected to have changed over the last two decades owing to the high coverage rate of universal HBV vaccination. The main mode of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may have been effectively blocked since 1992 when compulsory blood screening for anti-HCV was implemented, and consequently, the prevalence of anti-HCV is also expected to have markedly decreased during the last two decades. This review will briefly describe what really happened during the last couple of decades in the epidemiology of HBV and HCV and in the incidence and mortality rates of liver cirrhosis (hepatic failure) and hepatocellular carcinoma in Korea.How to cite this article:Lee H-S.
