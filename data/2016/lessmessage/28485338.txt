Purposes/objectives:By observing and analyzing the clinical features of the colon cancer and the influence factors of liver metastasis, we try to find out independent risk factors with significant influence on colon cancer liver metastasis as well as to provide reference for clinical treatment.Materials and methods:A total of 306 cases of colon cancer patients' clinical data, including gender, age, primary focal size, primary focal intestinal segment, degree of differentiation, infiltration depth, level of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) before surgery, lymph node metastasis, liver basic diseases were collected and recorded. Single-factor Chi-square analysis and multifactor logistic regression analysis (SPSS 16.0 software) were used to retrospectively study the possible influence factors of colon liver metastases and to preliminary discuss the potential risk factors of liver metastasis in colon cancer patients.Results:The Chi-square analysis showed that patients' primary focal segment, degree of differentiation, infiltration depth, level of serum CEA before surgery, and states of hepatitis B does 2 half-and-half had significant effect on the incidence of liver metastasis. However, in the further logistic regression analysis, it showed that only the infiltration depth and the states of hepatitis B does 2 half-and-half were the independent risk factors that influence the hepatic metastases. What was more, the both subgroups of positive hepatitis B with infection and vaccine showed significant statistical differences when comparing with hepatitis B all negative in the event of the probability of liver metastases (P = 0.011 and 0.004).Conclusions:The infiltration depth and the states of hepatitis B does 2 half-and-half were the independent risk factors on colon cancer patients' hepatic metastases. Those with the infiltration depth of T4 had a higher rate of hepatic metastases. Patients with does 2 half-and-half-positive hepatitis B (whether subgroup of hepatitis B virus infection or subgroup hepatitis B vaccine related) had a lower incidence rate of liver metastasis than those with hepatitis B all negative.
