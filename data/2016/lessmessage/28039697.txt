Purpose:To assess the efficacy and safety of S-1 plus sorafenib for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched using the terms "Hepatocellular Carcinoma" or "HCC" or "Hepatoma" or "Liver cancer" and "S-1" and "Sorafenib" or "Nexavar". Outcomes of main interest included overall survival (OS) and toxicities.Results:We identified 2 studies of S"1 plus sorafenib from 77 references that included a total of 65 patients. The percentage of male patients ranged from 70.0 to 89.5%. Median age was 59.2 years and ranged from 48.0 to 65.5 years. The percentage of hepatitis B virus ranged from 23.1 to 90.0%. The recommended dose of S-1 and sorafenib was 80 or 64 mg/m2/day and 800 mg/day, respectively and treatment was administered orally on days 1-14 and days 1-21, respectively. Median OS were 10.4 and 10.5 months, respectively. The incidence of all-grade toxicities of more than 30% were hand"foot syndrome (HFS) and rash. The incidence of grade 3/4 toxicities more than 5% were thrombocytopenia, elevated AST/ALT and hyperbilirubinemia.Conclusion:This systematic review suggests that S-1 plus sorafenib showed modest clinical efficacy and tolerable toxicity profile in patients with advanced HCC. The recommended dose of S-1 and sorafenib was 80 or 64 mg/m2/day and 800 mg/day, respectively.
