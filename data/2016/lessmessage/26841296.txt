Introduction:Similar to pediatric regimens, multiple doses of L-asparaginase (PEG-Asp) are being increasingly used in adults with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with promising results. One of the most common side effects of the drug in adults is high-grade hyperbilirubinemia and transaminitis. Despite being almost always reversible and may not recur, clinicians may still be reluctant to continue with PEG-Asp in patients with liver toxicity, losing the benefit from multiple doses of the drug.Case report:We describe a case of adult ALL who developed PEG-Asp-related high grade liver toxicity. The rising hyperbilirubinemia and transaminitis rapidly and permanently reversed using the amino-acid derivative L-carnitine. This case goes in line with similar observations in animal models and humans.Conclusion:L-Carnitine may show therapeutic benefit in PEG-Asp-related hepatotoxicity and should be considered in clinical trials of the drug.
