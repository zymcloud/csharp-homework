Objectives:This study aimed to compare quantitative assessments for predicting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) histological grades using magnetic resonance imaging.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed magnetic resonance imaging data from 49 patients with 54 surgically resected HCCs (11 well differentiated, 29 moderately differentiated, and 14 poorly differentiated). We measured the lesion-to-liver relative contrast ratio (RCR) on diffusion-weighted (DW), T2-weighted (T2W), and ethoxybenzyl-hepatobiliary images. We also evaluated contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) on DW images, and the apparent diffusion coefficient. We compared the feasibility of these parameters in predicting HCC histological grade.Results:Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of both the DW RCR (97%) and DW CNR (97%) were significantly greater compared with those of the apparent diffusion coefficient (79%), T2W RCR (81%), and ethoxybenzyl-hepatobiliary RCR (80%) (P Conclusions:The DW RCR and DW CNR might represent accurate predictors of HCC histological grade.
