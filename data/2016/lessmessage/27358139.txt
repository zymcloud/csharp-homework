The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical effect of embolic microspheres in the treatment of primary hepatic carcinoma. Fifty-eight patients who were confirmed with primary hepatic carcinoma by imaging were retrospectively analyzed. They were firstly perfused with 50 mg of oxaliplatin and 40 mg of epirubicin. Embolic microspheres were then injected into the distal end of targeted blood vessels. After this procedure, dynamic observation was carried out until tumor stain disappeared. Liver function and blood indexes were reexamined on days 5, 6, 7 and 28 after treatment, and moreover, the liver was examined with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). Compared to traditional lipiodol embolization, embolic microspheres did not aggregate the damage on liver function and the imaging examination suggested necrosis of some tumor tissues. Embolic microspheres proved to be effective in treating primary hepatic carcinoma. It produces no damage on liver function and can lead to significant shrinkage of hepatic carcinoma and necrosis of some tumor tissues. Embolic microspheres, which merely block distal branches of tumor-feeding artery, can avoid collateral circulation induced by permanent blocking, thus achieve a good treatment effect.
