The Cholangiocarcinoma is a. The risk of development of cholangiocarcinoma, generally a rare type of a liver tumor, increases during infection of Opisthorchiasis. For this reason the timely detection of Opisthorchiasis is important for Cholangiocarcinoma prevention. There are many studies which concern the detection of pathogenesis of Opisthorchis viverrini infection but a little known about Opisthorchis felineus. In this study we investigate a correlation of the eggs which are found in a faeces and are comparable with a serum Ig G and Ig M antibody level that were detected with ELISA test in a large group of patients. The result is showing positive correlation between evidence of the Opisthorchis felineus eggs that were found in a faeces and antibody Ig G and Ig M level in a serum. Moreover the combination of two methods can improve the Opisthorchiasis diagnostic: the serum antibody and faeces investigation of eggs.
