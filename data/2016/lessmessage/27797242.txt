Purpose:To evaluate whether combined transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have superior efficacy to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) alone a retrospective review was conducted.Methods:During January 2009 to March 2013, 108 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma underwent TACE or combined therapies (TACE+RFA or TACE+PEI). The long-term survival rates were evaluated in those patients by various statistical analyses.Results:The cumulative survival rates in the combined TACE+RFA/PEI group were significantly superior to those in the TACE alone group. When the comparison among the groups was restricted to patients with two or three tumors fulfilling the Milan criteria, significantly greater prolongation of survival was observed in the combined TACE+ RFA/PEI group than in the RFA/PEI alone group.Conclusions:In terms of the effect on the survival period, combined TACE+ RFA/PEI therapy was more effective than TACE monotherapy, and also more effective than PEI or RFA monotherapy in cases with multiple tumors.
