Background:It has been shown that circular RNA (circRNA) is associated with human cancers, however, few studies have been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Objective:To estimate clinical values of a circular RNA, Hsa_circ_0001649, in HCC.Methods:Expression level of hsa_circ_0001649 was detected in HCC and paired adjacent liver tissues by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCRs). Differences in expression level of hsa_circ_0001649 were analyzed using the paired t-test. Tests were performed between clinical information and hsa_circ_0001649 expression level by analysis of variance (ANOVA) or welch t-test and a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was established to estimate the value of hsa_circ_0001649 expression as a biomarker in HCC.Results:hsa_circ_0001649 expression was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues (p = 0.0014) based on an analysis of 89 paired samples of HCC and adjacent liver tissues and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.63. Furthermore, hsa_circ_0001649 expression was correlated with tumor size (p = 0.045) and the occurrence of tumor embolus (p = 0.017) in HCC.Conclusions:We first found hsa_circ_0001649 was significantly downregulated in HCC. Our findings indicate hsa_circ_0001649 might serve as a novel potential biomarker for HCC and may function in tumorigenesis and metastasis of HCC.
