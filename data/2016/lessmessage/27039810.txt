Opisthorchis viverrini (OV) liver flukes are common parasites found in central and southern Laos and constitute a major public health problem in the country. Laos people continue to have the habit of extensively consuming raw or half-cooked fish which are intermediate hosts. This study aimed to study the prevalence and factors associated with OV infection in the population of Thakek district, Khammouane Province. This cross-sectional analytic study covered 237 subjects who filled out structured questionnaires. Fecal examination for OV infection was performed by Kato's thick smear method. Data analysis was carried out using STATA Version 10.0. Multiple logistic regression was applied. The results showed that the infection rate of OV was 54.8 %. Factors associated with OV infections were gender, a habit of defecation in fields and raw fish (goi bplaa dip) consumption. Opisthorchiasis and associated cholangiocarcinoma development thus appear to remain as important concerns in Laos.
