Background:Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease that accounts for less than 1% of all cancers in men and less than 1% of all diagnosed breast cancers. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the clinicopathological features, treatment options and overall survival in Kurdish MBC cases.Materials and methods:Seventeen MBC were referred to Department of Radiation Oncology in Imam Reza Hospital, Kermanshah, Iran, between 2010 and 2016. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed for ER, PR and Her2 biomarkers and FISH for those with Her2 2+. Median follow-up period was 30 months (2-65 months). We excluded from the study patients who did not have follow-up after initial diagnosis. Treatment methods were chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, target therapy and palliative care. Survival was estimated by the Kaplan Meier method (Prism 5).Results:The mean age at diagnosis was 49.2 Â± 17 years (range, 24-85 years). Grade II was the most grade in MBC (65%). Fourteen patients (82%) had invasive ductal carcinoma, one (6%) had ductal carcinoma in situ and 2 (12%) had invasive papillary. ER, PR and Her2 were significantly positive in 14/17, 8/17 and 2/17 cases, respectively. The treatment included modified radical mastectomy for most patients. Chemotherapy with TAC and CEF regimens was delivered to 15/17 cases. Tamoxifen therapy was delivered to 14/17 cases. Three stage IV patients received Avestin and two with Her2 3+ were given Trastuzumab (Herceptin). Patients received adjuvant radiotherapy following surgery and chemotherapy. The site of metastasis was the bone in 2 cases, lung in 1 case and liver in 1 case. Zoledronic acid (Zometa) was prescribed for patients with bone metastasis. Five-year overall survival rate was 64%.Conclusions:MBC is rare. Thus, we need larger studies are in collaboration with several research centers in the field of breast cancer. ER positive, grade II of invasive ductal carcinoma, stage II and right side happened more with MBC. Overall survival is similar to other studies.
