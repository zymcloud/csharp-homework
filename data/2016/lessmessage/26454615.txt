A 42-year-old male presented with intraperitoneal hemorrhage 5days following percutaneous liver biopsy for suspected hepatocellular carcinoma. Diagnostic angiogram localized the bleeding to segment VI hepatic artery branches. Two consecutive arterial embolizations with microspheres and platinum coils failed to control the bleeding. The patient was a poor surgical candidate, so ultrasound-guided ethanol ablation of the bleeding source and surrounding liver segment was employed as salvage therapy. The patient stabilized clinically and was discharged home to begin palliative therapy.
