Two new macrolides, iriomoteolides-10a (1) and -12a (2), have been isolated from a marine dinoflagellate Amphidinium sp. (KCA09053 strain), and their structures were elucidated on the basis of a detailed two dimensional (2D)-NMR analysis. Compound 1 is a novel 21-membered Amphidinium macrolide, which contains one tetrahydrofuran ring, two ketone carbonyls, two hydroxyl groups, and six one-carbon branches. Compound 2 is a new 12-membered macrolide related to amphidinolide Q. Compound 1 exhibited cytotoxic activity against human cervix adenocarcinoma HeLa and murine hepatocellular carcinoma MH134 cells.
