Norcantharidin (NCTD) is currently used in the treatment of several cancers such as leukemia, melanoma and hepatoma. The mechanism of action of NCTD is suggested to involve induction of apoptosis of cancer cells via production of reactive oxygen species. In this study, the genotoxic effect of different concentrations of NCTD (1, 10 and 20 μm) in human lymphocytes was investigated using sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and chromosomal aberrations (CAs) assays. The results revealed that NCTD significantly increased the rate of SCEs (p < 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, NCTD significantly increased the number of high-frequency cells (SCEs ≥ 8, p < 0.05). However, NCTD did not have any significant effect on the rate of CAs (p > 0.05). In addition, no significant differences were detected in the mitotic index or proliferative index at examined doses (up to 20 μm). In conclusion, NCTD is genotoxic to human cultured lymphocytes as measured by SCE assay.
