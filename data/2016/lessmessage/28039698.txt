Purpose:To study the clinical value of intrahepatic injections of Highly Agglutinative Staphylococcin (HAS) in the interventional treatment of liver carcinomas.Methods:Under ultrasonic guidance, intrahepatic injections of HAS were administered in 22 cases of pathologically diagnosed liver carcinomas, 3 days, 7 days, 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after microwave coagulation therapy. The dose of each injection was 2000U.Results:Immunohistochemical staining of the sample from the tumor site after HAS administrations demonstrated a significant increase in the number of antitumor immune cells compared with that before the injections (pConclusions:As a new route of administration, intrahepatic injections of HAS are a safe and effective procedure and deserves further clinical research and discussion.
