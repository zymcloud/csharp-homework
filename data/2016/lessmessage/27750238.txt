Objective:Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) induces gas bubbles in ablation zones, and the ablative margin cannot be evaluated accurately on ultrasound (US) during and immediately after RFA. This study assessed the usefulness of US-US fusion imaging to visualize the ablative margin of RFA for liver metastasis.Methods:RFA guided by US-US fusion imaging was performed on 12 targeted tumors in 10 patients. Secondary hepatic malignancies included patients with colorectal cancer (n = 4), breast cancer (n = 2), lung cancer (n = 1), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (n = 1), pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (n = 1), and adrenocortical carcinoma (n = 1). The maximal diameter of the tumors ranged from 0.8 to 4.0 cm (mean ± SD 1.6 ± 0.9 cm).Results:The mean number of electrode insertions was 1.6 per session (range 1-3). Technically, effective ablation was achieved in a single session in all patients, and safety ablative margins were confirmed on contrast-enhanced CT for early assessment of tumor response. There were no serious adverse events or procedure-related complications. During the follow-up period (median 220 days, range 31-417 days), none of the patients showed local tumor progression.Conclusion:US-US fusion imaging could show the tumor images before ablation and the ablative area on US in real time. The image overlay of US-US fusion imaging made it possible to evaluate the ablative margin three dimensionally according to the US probe action. Therefore, US-US fusion imaging can contribute to RFA therapy with a safety margin, that is, the so-called precise RFA.
