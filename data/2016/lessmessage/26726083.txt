A 69-year-old man was admitted to hospital with abdominal pain. In the four years prior to his presentation, he had undergone repeated transarterial chemoembolizations and injections for hepatocellular carcinoma. He underwent his 8th transcatheter arterial therapy one month prior to admission. Abdominal X-rays and contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed large amounts of small intestinal gas and venous thrombosis from the portal vein to the superior mesenteric vein, respectively. The thrombosis was reduced after anticoagulation therapy (heparin, antithrombin III, danaparoid sodium and warfarin). This is the first case report of paralytic ileus due to superior mesenteric venous thrombosis after transcatheter arterial therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma with an arterioportal shunt.
