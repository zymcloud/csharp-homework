Spontaneous rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a potentially fatal presentation of the disease. Although many options for treatment exist, Yttrium-90 transcatheter arterial radioembolization has not previously been reported. We report a case of a 92-year-old woman found to have a ruptured HCC treated with radioembolization that showed no viable tumor and no extrahepatic disease at 2 years. While further studies are warranted, this patient's clinical course may suggest that radioembolization may be an additional palliative treatment option in these patients.
