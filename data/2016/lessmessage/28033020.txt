Introduction:Tumors of appendix vermiformis are quite rare; they represent only about 0.4% of gastrointestinal tract tumors. They can be both benign and malignant (primary or secondary). Carcinoid is the most common tumor of the appendix. The symptoms can include nothing but non-specific abdominal pain, or on the contrary they can imitate inflammatory acute abdomen. Liver metastases are associated with an advanced stage of malignancy; their surgical treatment is presented rarely in the literature. The aim of this publication is to present two cases with different results of surgical treatment of liver metastases with the primary tumor located in the appendix.Cases:The first patient is a 50 years old female who underwent right hepatectomy for liver metastases of Goblet-cell carcinoid of the appendix in 2013 and died six months later due to tumor progression. The second patient is a 58 years old male, still alive, undergoing repeated liver and lung resections and RFA from 2009 due to metastases from appendix carcinoma.Conclusion:Examples of dissemination of malignant appendix tumors to the liver need to be evaluated individually. In indicated cases, surgical treatment of liver metastases is justifiable.Key words: tumors of appendix liver metastases surgical treatment.
