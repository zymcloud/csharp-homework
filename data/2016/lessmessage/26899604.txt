Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) leads to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). With a cohort of 1,206 CHB patients who visited Okayama University Hospital and related hospitals in 2011 and 2012, we compared the incidence rates of HCC among the patients grouped by age, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), and treatment. HCCs were observed in 115 patients with the median observation period of 1,687 days. Among the HCC patients aged > 35 years, HBV DNA > 4 log copies/mL and positive HBeAg at diagnosis (n＝184), the HCC incidence rate was 8.4% at 5 years in the entecavir (ETV)-treated patients, 21.8% in the lamivudine (LVD)-treated patients, and 26.4% among the patients not treated with drugs. The cumulative HCC incidence was significantly reduced in the ETV-treated patients compared to those treated with LVD or not treated (p＝0.013). Among the patients aged >35 years with HBV DNA > 4 log copies/mL and negative HBeAg (n＝237), the cumulative HCC incidence was 14.6% in 5 years in ETV group and 13.9% among those not treated with a drug (p＞0.05). Only small numbers of HCCs occurred in other patients. In CHB patients aged > 35 years with HBV DNA > 4 log copies/mL and positive HBeAg, ETV treatment is recommended for the suppression of HCC development.
