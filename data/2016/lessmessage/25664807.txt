Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of worldwide cancer-related mortality, and even with established treatment paradigms, its global burden demands greater research into therapeutic options. In the following case report, a patient suffering from HCC with lung metastasis demonstrated regression of metastatic disease while consuming guyabano fruit extract in the absence of conventional chemotherapy. While the antineoplastic effects of the guyabano fruit is well documented, there is sparse clinical documentation of HCC regression associated with it, and a better understanding of guyabano and its antineoplastic activity may trigger discovery of novel therapeutic options for this deadly disease.
