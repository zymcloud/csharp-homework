Liver fibrosis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and represent a difficult clinical challenge of global importance. The liver fibrosis progression needs to be controlled because persisted liver fibrosis can lead to liver cirrhosis or even hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite significant advances in the understanding of the liver fibrosis development, the therapeutic effect of drugs used in liver fibrosis treatment is not sufficient. Today, nanotechnology has been considered as a potential tool for developing novel drug delivery systems for the improved imaging and various diseases, including liver fibrosis. In this article, we discussed the use of nanotechnology for the treatment and imaging of liver fibrosis.
