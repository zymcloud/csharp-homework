Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has the worst prognosis among all major cancers, largely due to the lack of sensitive diagnostic markers. We aimed to compare three HCC tumor markers, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), p53, and AFP-L3%, to evaluate whether measuring serum p53 levels and AFP-L3% has an additive diagnostic value for detection of HCC.Methods:A total of 86 patients with chronic liver diseases were included. HCC was detected in 68 (79.1%) patients. Twenty healthy age-matched volunteers served as healthy controls. Serum concentrations of AFP, AFP-L3, and p53 protein were measured. The correlations between the three markers with status of viral hepatitis, liver function tests, and Child-Pugh scores were determined.Results:HCC patients showed significantly higher percentages of cirrhosis and Child-Pugh grade C (p Conclusions:No significant correlation was found between AFP, AFP-L3%, and p53; however, the simultaneous determination of the three tumor markers yielded a better diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity in the detection of HCCs than each biomarker alone.
