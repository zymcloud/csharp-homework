Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) represents one of the most recent evolutions in the field of surgical oncology. While offering to the patients all the short-term advantages of the laparoscopic approach, the ongoing experience underlines that the long-term outcomes are not negatively influenced through this minimally invasive method. We explored the surgical results in a case series of 5 high-risk patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists' (ASA) Class 3 or more, who underwent LLR in our department. Three bisegmentectomies, one segmentectomy and one wedge resection were performed. All patients could be discharged within the first postoperative week. LLR was safe and efficient in this high-risk patient group. Careful patient selection and individualized preparation for surgery remain the keys for the success of LLR in high ASA class patients.
