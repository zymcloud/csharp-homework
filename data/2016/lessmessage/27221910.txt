Background:Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major global public health problem, with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Human cytosolic glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) include several classes such as alpha (A), mu (M), pi (P), sigma (S), zeta (Z), omega (O) and theta (T). The present study aimed to investigate the role of GST omega genes (GSTO1 and GSTO2) in different groups of patients infected with HBV.Materials and methods:HBV groups were classified according to clinical history, serological tests and histological analysis into normal carriers (N), acute (A), chronic (CH), cirrhosis (CI) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases. The study focused on determination of the genotypes of GST omega genes (GSTO1 and GSTO2) and GST activity and liver function tests.Results:The results showed that GSTO1 (A/A) was decreased in N, A, CH, CI and HCC groups compared to the C-group, while, GSTO1 (C/A) and GSTO1(C/C) genotypes were increased significantly in N, A, CH, CI and HCC groups. GSTO2 (A/A) was decreased in all studied groups as compared to the C-group but GSTO2(A/G) and GSTO2(G/G) genotypes were increased significantly. In addition, GST activities, albumin and TP levels were decreased in all studied groups compared to the C-group, while the activities of transaminases were increased to differing degrees.Conclusions:The results indicate that GSTO genetic polymorphisms may be considered as biomarkers for determining and predicting the progression of HBV infection.
