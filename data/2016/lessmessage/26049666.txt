Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common liver disease in developed countries, covering a spectrum of pathological conditions ranging from single steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Its pathogenesis has been often interpreted by the "double-hit" hypothesis, where the lipid accumulation in the liver is followed by proinflammatory mediators inducing inflammation, hepatocellular injury and fibrosis. Nowadays, a more complex model suggests that free fatty acids and their metabolites could be the true lipotoxic agents that contribute to the development of NAFLD and hepatic insulin resistance, suggesting a central role for metabolic lipases in that process.
