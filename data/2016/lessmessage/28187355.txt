Tumors arising from or secondarily involving the vena cava (VC) are broad-spectrum diseases, ranging from benign to malignant. The benign tumors include myxoma, leiomyomatosis and leiomyoma. The primary malignant tumors of the VC are rare, and of these rare entities, leiomyosarcoma is the most frequently encountered. The direct extension of a tumor arising from an adjacent organ such as hepatocellular carcinoma or renal cell carcinoma is more common than primary malignant tumor in the inferior VC. In this article, the authors review the spectrum of VC pathologic processes and the relevant findings from magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, and computed tomography.
