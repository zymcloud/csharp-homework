Purpose:The aim of this study was to investigate the role of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in evaluation of blood flow changes related to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) procedures in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions.Methods:Fifty-four patients, with biopsy-proven HCC, who underwent TACE or RFA, were evaluated, 1 month after treatment, with upper abdominal MRI examination. Multiplanar T2-weighted, T1-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences were acquired. Dedicated perfusion software (T1 Perfusion Package, Viewforum; Philips Medical Systems, The Netherlands) was used to generate color permeability maps. After placing regions of interest in normal hepatic parenchyma, in successfully treated lesions, and in area of recurrence, the following perfusion parameters were calculated and statistically analyzed: relative arterial, venous, and late enhancement; maximum enhancement; maximum relative enhancement, and time to peak.Results:Twenty-one of 54 patients had residual disease, and perfusion parameters values measured within tumor tissue were: relative arterial enhancement median, 42%; relative venous enhancement median, 69%; relative late enhancement median, 57.7%; maximum enhancement median, 749.6%; maximum relative enhancement median, 69%; time to peak median, 81.1 seconds. As for all the evaluated parameters, a significant difference (P Conclusions:Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI represents a complementary noninvasive tool that may offer quantitative and qualitative information about HCC lesions treated with TACE and RFA.
