Background:The reversion-inducing-cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK) gene is a novel transformation suppressor gene that was linked to several malignancies.Objective:To analyze any association between RECK gene rs10814325 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and HCC susceptibility along with it is association wiht various clinico-pathological and laboratory data.Materials and methods:RECK gene rs10814325 SNP was estimated, using real-time PCR technique, in 30 HCC patients on top of chronic HCV infection, 30 HCV related cirrhotic patients and 30 healthy controls.Results:No special pattern of association could be detected on comparing the RECK gene rs10814325 genotypes(P=0.5), or alleles(P=0.49) among the studied groups. HCC patients with TT genotype had younger age (mean of 54.1±6.0 years vs 60.6±10.2 years for TC/CC genotypes, P=0.035). Abdominal distension was significantly greater in TT genotype patients (75% vs 30% of TC/CC genotypes, P=0.045). TT genotype was present in 75% of patients with lymph node metastasis. Serum GGT levels were higher in TT genotype patients [80 of (48.5-134.8) vs 40 IU/l (33-87.5) for TC/CCgenotypes], and lower limb edema was observed in 60% of TT vs 20% of TC/CCgenotypes, however, both just failed to reach significance (P=0.05 and P=0.06, respectively).Conclusions:RECK gene rs10814325 T>C could not be considered a risk factor for HCC development on top of HCV, but may be related to the disease progression and metastasis.
