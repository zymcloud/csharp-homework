Objective:This meta-analysis aimed to analyze the efficacy of sorafenib in combination with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Electronic data bases were searched for studies (1) enrolled HCC patients undergoing TACE; (2) with sorafenib therapy and control arm of no sorafenib therapy were included for meta-analysis and meta-regression; (3) studies without control arm were included for data review and (4) had time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) or relative outcome of HCC as the endpoint. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed according to Cochrane guidelines.Results:Five studies (3 randomized trials, 1 cohort study and 1 prospective non- randomized controlled trial, totally 899 patients) were eligible for meta-analysis. The hazard ratio (HR) for TTP was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.48-1.03, p = 0.003) with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 82.7%) and for OS was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.47-1.05, p = 0.147) with slight heterogeneity (I2 = 47.9%). However, no covariate was found as independent predictor for better treatment efficacy. Hand-foot skin reaction, alopecia, rash/desquamation, diarrhea, hypertension, fatigue, anorexia, nausea and vomiting were common adverse events.Conclusions:TACE combined with sorafenib has potential efficacy for HCC.
