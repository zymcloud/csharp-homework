A 73-year-old man with a hepatocellular carcinoma was admitted to our hospital. He suffered from recurrent severe hypoglycemia. An autopsy was performed after his death. Anti-insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) monoclonal antibody immunostaining of the hepatocellular carcinoma was positive. Western immunoblot analysis of the serum revealed highly elevated IGF-II. Therefore, we diagnosed this case as a non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia caused by a big IGF-II-producing hepatocellular carcinoma.
