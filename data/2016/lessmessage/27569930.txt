Background:The aim of this study was to identify predictors of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and recurrence in a cohort of 151 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cirrhosis who were treated by liver transplantation (LT).Patients and methods:A retrospective database of patients undergoing LT for radiologically diagnosed HCC at "12 de Octubre" Hospital, Madrid during 1986-2006 was analyzed.Results:The median follow-up was 67.44 months (SD = 55.7 months). Overall 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival was 87.5%, 73.7%, 64.1% and 43.4%, respectively. The 5-year OS of patients beyond the Milan criteria was 47.14%, whereas that of patients within the Milan criteria was 70.13% (P = .011). The 5-year OS of patients beyond the Milan criteria and with microvascular invasion (MVI) was 27.27%, whereas that of patients beyond the Milan criteria and without MVI criteria was 57.89% (P = .003). Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors revealed MVI and G3 to be independent and statistically significant factors affecting OS (P 200 ng/mL to be an independent positive and statistically significant predictor of MVI (P = .0004).Conclusion:MVI and G3 are independent negative factors affecting OS, DFS, and recurrence. The presence of MVI or AFP levels >200 ng/mL represent a contraindication for LT, as long as the patient is beyond the Milan criteria.
