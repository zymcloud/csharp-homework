Objectives:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the main type of primary liver cancer (PLC) worldwide, but cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) may be predominant in some specific regions of Southeast Asia. The aim of the present study was to delineate a pattern of Cambodian PLC patients attending the Calmette Hospital in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh.Materials and methods:A total of 553 medical charts diagnosing PLCs from January 2003 to May 2015 were obtained from both the Oncology and Hepato-Gastroenterology Departments of the Calmette Hospital.Results:HCC was the predominant type of PLC recorded, with 511 cases (92.4%), whereas CCA represented merely 7.6% (42 cases) of the overall series. Hepatitis B virus (HBV; 44.3%) and hepatitis C virus (HCV; 43%) infection rates were similar among the HCC patients, while small subsets of CCA patients were infected with HBV (15.4%) or HCV (11.5%). Most HCC (84%) and CCA (73.8%) patients received palliative treatment only.Conclusion:The present study indicates that HCC is the main form of primary hepatic neoplasm among PLC patients attending a hospital in Cambodia. HBV and HCV infections represented equivalent burdens and major contributing factors to HCC. Therefore, the implementation of prevention programs for these infectious agents should become a priority for health policy makers in the country.
