Transforming growth factor-B1 (TGF-β1 )and its coreceptor endoglin (ENG) have been shown to contribute to hepatocellular tumor development and malignant progression. Our aim was to evaluate the serum expression levels of ENG/ TGF-β1 mRNAs and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic Egyptian patients. Our study included 77 subjects. Real time polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the expression level of ENG and TGF-β1mRNAs. The relative expression ratio of ENG mRNA was 0.82 (0.1 -3.2), 0.66 (0.15-5.3), 0.38(0.007-2.8) and 0.12 (0.00-0.22) and the relative expression ratio of TGF-β1mRNA was 1.4 (0.19 -6.2), 1.2 (0.22-4.3), 1.0 (0.15-4.4) and 0.6 (0.00-2.2) for cirrhotic HCC cirrhotic, HCC only and healthy control groups respectively. Increased ENG and TGF-β1 mRNA gene expression was correlated with TNM clinical stage. The expression ratio in TNM stage III-IV 1.1 (0.07-3.2), 1.55 (0.15-6.2) was statistically significantly higher than that in stage I-II 0.47 (0.007-2.8), 1.0 (0.31-4.4) (
