Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has emerged as one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of human cancer; yet, the mechanisms underlying HCC progression remain unclear. Unlike other cancers, systematic chemotherapy is not effective for HCC patients, while surgical resection and liver transplantation are the most viable treatment options. Thus, identifying factors or pathways that suppress HCC progression would be crucial for advancing treatment strategies for HCC. The murine double minute 2 (MDM2)-p53 pathway is impaired in most of the cancer types, including HCC, and MDM2 is overexpressed in approximately 30% of HCC. Overexpression of MDM2 is reported to be well correlated with metastasis, drug resistance, and poor prognosis of multiple cancer types, including HCC. Importantly, these correlations are observed even when p53 is mutated. Indeed, p53-independent functions of overexpressed MDM2 in cancer progression have been suitably demonstrated. In this review article, we summarize potential effectors of MDM2 that promote or suppress cancer metastasis and discuss the p53-independent roles of MDM2 in liver cancer metastasis from clinical as well as biological perspectives.
