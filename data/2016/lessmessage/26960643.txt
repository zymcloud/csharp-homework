Angiosarcomas are rare soft tissue neoplasms accounting for <2% of all sarcomas. Rare cases have been reported in other sites like breast, spleen, liver, bone and bladder. This is a case report of an angiosarcoma of the bladder in a 65 year old lady who came with complaints of haematuria. Ultrasonography and computerized tomography revealed a bladder tumour with calcification, which on cystoscopy also showed a calcified mass. The patient had a past history of carcinoma cervix for which she had undergone surgery and radiotherapy, 22 years ago. Biopsy of the bladder mass showed features of a high grade epithelioid sarcoma with extensive osseous metaplasia. On immune stains,the tumour was positive for CD31 and vimentin and negative for cytokeratin, desmin and CD34. Until now, only sixteen cases of angiosarcoma of the bladder have been reported in english literature, of which 6 occurred secondary to radiation. Our case is the first to occur after 22 years of radiotherapy and have extensive osseous metaplasia.
