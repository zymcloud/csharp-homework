p53 is the most commonly mutated gene in malignant human cancers. To detect p53 mutations in circulating DNA (cirDNA) of transplanted hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients could be an interesting approach to know of any tumor recurrence. In this study, our objective was to determine the utility of this method in the diagnosis and the prognosis of HCC tumor recurrence.Twenty four liver transplanted HCC patients were included in the study together with a group of healthy controls. Detection of the specific p53 mutation in cirDNA was performed by high-resolution melting PCR (HRM-PCR) and COLD-PCR immediately before the transplantation. Serum anti-p53 was also determined using a p53-autoantibody ELISA kit.The results of the HRM-PCR and COLD-PCR showed two well-differentiated groups of transplanted patients after normalization by healthy controls. These data allow us to distinguish between patients with p53 mutated cirDNA and those with wild type cirDNA. Moreover, we have found that most of p53 mutated patients also presented elevated anti-p53 antibodies. The present results indicate that it is possible to detect mutated p53 genes with the cirDNA and that this could be used as a biomarker of tumor recurrence during the clinical evolution of the transplanted patients.
