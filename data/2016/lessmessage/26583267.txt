Goals:To evaluate race/ethnicity-specific disparities in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stage at diagnosis and how this impacts receiving curative therapies.Background:HCC is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The highest incidence of HCC is seen among ethnic minorities in the United States.Study:Using the 2003-2011 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database and United Network of Organ Sharing, population-based registries for cancer and liver transplantation (LT) in the United States, race/ethnicity-specific cancer stage at diagnosis and treatment received among adults with HCC were evaluated.Results:Compared with non-Hispanic whites, blacks had significantly more advanced HCC at diagnosis [odds ratio (OR), 1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10-1.30; PConclusions:Among US adults with HCC, blacks consistently had more advanced stage at diagnosis and lower rates of receiving treatment. After correcting for cancer stage and evaluating the subset of patients eligible for curative therapies, blacks and Hispanics had significantly lower rates of curative HCC treatment.
