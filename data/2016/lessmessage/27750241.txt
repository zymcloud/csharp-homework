Background:Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is considered to play a critical role in cancer progression and metastasis. However, the impact of EMT on the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still elusive. In this study, we examined the relationship between the expression of EMT markers and recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in HCC patients after hepatic resection.Summary:The mRNA expression of 15 genes related to EMT was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in cancerous tissues from 72 patients who underwent hepatic resection of HCC between January 2005 and December 2010 at our hospital. The upregulation of TWIST and the downregulation of tight junction protein ZO-1 (TJP1) were significantly associated with shorter RFS as well as OS. Increased levels of TWIST and decreased levels of TJP1 should be predictive markers for poor prognosis in patients with HCC after hepatectomy; those could serve as potential biomarkers for the treatment of HCC. Key Messages: A low level of TJP1 and high level of TWIST expression were prognostic factors predicting HCC after hepatic resection.
