Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a tumor that is typical of late metastases detected within 3 years after radical nephrectomy in 85% of cases. RCC most commonly metastasizes to the lung, bone, liver, and brain; the pancreas is involved in no more than 0.25-3% of cases. The paper describes a unique clinical case of multiple late pancreatic metastases from clear cell RCC in a 77-year-old woman 27 years after removal of the primary tumor.
