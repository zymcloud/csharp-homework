Background:Chemotherapy-related hepatic dysfunction affected the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, predictive factors of chemotherapy-related hepatic dysfunction remained undefined.Objective:To identify the predictive factors for hepatic dysfunction during cytotoxic chemotherapy in Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with advanced NSCLC who received cytotoxic chemotherapy at Division of Respiratory Medicine, the affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University, from July 2012 to January 2015. We investigated the incidence of hepatic dysfunction during chemotherapy and evaluated several clinical factors that are associated with hepatic dysfunction, including body mass index (BMI) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).Results:A total of 116 patients were enrolled in study, 54 patients (46.57%) experienced hepatic dysfunction after receiving chemotherapy. Multivariate analysis for hepatic dysfunction in patients with advanced NSCLC showed that hepatic dysfunction was associated with higher BMI (odds ratio = 4.742, P = 0.001) and lower HDL-C (odds ratio = 3.018, P = 0.019). Pearson's rank correlation analysis revealed that HDL-C and BMI presented a negative correlation in patients with hepatic dysfunction (r = -0.487, P < 0.001).Conclusions:Higher BMI and lower HDL-C levels seem to be good independent predictive factors for chemotherapy-related hepatic dysfunction in advanced NSCLC. In addition, a negative correlation was presented between BMI and HDL-C.
