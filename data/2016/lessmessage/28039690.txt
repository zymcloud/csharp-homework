It is not inconceivable to envision surgeons, offering extended liver resection in patients beyond the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system criteria with intermediate/advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), to be found negligent since extensive liver resection is correlated with increased morbidity compared to conservative or palliative treatment. Given that no other classification system than BCLC has been adopted widely for HCC staging and treatment, a revision of the BCLC algorithm and clinical guidelines should be tailored using new molecular and clinical treatment algorithms, as well as including patient's preferences.
