Aims:Cost-effectiveness analysis of sofosbuvir combined with peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin (SOF/Peg-IFN/RBV) in early versus advanced fibrosis in previously untreated patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 (CHC-GT1), from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System (NHS).Methods:A Markov model was developed to compare lifetime costs and outcomes (life years gained [LYGs] and quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) of 2 treatment strategies: SOF/Peg-IFN/RBV administered during early fibrosis (mild-moderate fibrosis; F2-F3) or advanced fibrosis (cirrhosis; F4). Efficacy (sustained virologic response), annual transition probabilities, disease management costs and utilities were obtained from the literature. Costs and outcomes were discounted annually at 3%. Direct costs were considered, expressed in Euros (€, 2014). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was also performed.Results:SOF/Peg-IFN/RBV therapy at F2-F3 was more effective (19.12 LYGs and 14.14 QALYs) compared to F4. In a cohort of 1,000 patients, SOF/Peg-IFN/RBV prevented 66 cases of decompensated cirrhosis, 60 hepatocellular carcinomas and 4 liver transplantations compared with therapy in advanced fibrosis. The total lifetime cost of early therapy (€43,263) was less than the cost of treatment in the advanced stage (€49,018). Early therapy was a dominant strategy, more effective and less costly in all simulations. In the PSA analysis, administration of SOF/PEG-IFN/RBV at F2-F3 was dominant in all simulations.Conclusions:Starting SOF/Peg-IFN/RBV therapy at F2-F3, compared with therapy at F4, reduced the incidence of liver disease complications and was associated with cost savings for the Spanish NHS in CHC-GT1 patients.
