Background:hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an RNA virus that induces hepatocarcinogenesis by mechanisms other than integration in the host cell genome. Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) expression has been studied mostly in hepatitis B virus induced HCC but not properly investigated in HCV induced HCC.Aim:Aim: we aimed to assess serum DKK1 in HCV induced HCC, HCV induced liver cirrhosis and viral infection-free controls. Moreover, we assessed serum DKK1 level after curative resection of HCC..Methods:Serum DKK1 was measured by ELISA in 20 HCV induced HCC patients; both pre-resection and post-resection, 20 HCV induced liver cirrhosis patients and 20 viral infection-free controls.Results:DKK1 levels were significantly higher in HCC than cirrhosis patients (P = 0.000). DKK1 did not differ significantly between cirrhotic patients and controls (P = 0.11). DKK1 levels significantly reduced 5 days post-resection compared to their pre-resection levels (P = 0.000).Conclusions:We documented serum DKK1 as a marker for detection of early HCC in HCV infected patients. Significant reduction of DKK1 5 days after curative resection might indicated it as a follow up marker for recurrence in surgically resected HCV induced HCC patients. Larger scale studies to follow up its level at various intervals postoperatively and evaluate its pre-resection level as a prognostic marker in HCV induced HCC patients will be needed.
