Objectives:The aim of this study was to generate three-dimensional (3D) images of the ablative zone in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with multipolar radiofrequency ablation (RFA) using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and 3DUS and to investigate the shape of the ablative zone among several patterns after insertion of two or three electrodes.Methods:This study included 16 patients and 20 HCCs treated with a multipolar RFA system. All patients underwent CEUS within 14 days after multipolar RFA therapy. The 3D scanning functionality of the LOGIQ E9 US imaging system (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis., USA), which acquires volume data using a manually controlled sweep on perfusion defects of CEUS, was used in this study to acquire CEUS/3DUS data. The ablative-area shapes resulting from three insertion patterns were investigated, using two electrodes (T20-T20 and T30-T30) or three electrodes (T30-T30-T30).Results:The resulting shapes using two electrodes were globule-like (T20-T20) or elliptical (T30-T30). The shape using three electrodes (T30-T30-T30) was almost ellipse-like but slightly irregular.Conclusions:Generating 3D images using CEUS/3DUS techniques is simple and useful for evaluating the shape of the ablative area, and these images provide informational or educational tools for patients and medical staff associated with multipolar RFA procedures.
