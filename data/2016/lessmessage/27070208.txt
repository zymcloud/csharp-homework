Objective:Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has recently been used for the evaluation of various lesions arising in the porta hepatis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic yield of this increasingly utilized approach to porta hepatis lesions.Study design:A retrospective study of 72 consecutive samples of porta hepatis lesions obtained via EUS-FNA between 2004 and 2015 was conducted. Clinical histories and endoscopic findings were available prior to the diagnostic interpretation. The diagnosis of each lesion was based on its cytologic features on smears, its histologic features on cell block, a comparison with any relevant prior specimens, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometric studies when applicable.Results:A total of 72 lesions (59 lymph nodes, 2 cysts and 11 masses) were biopsied in 70 patients. Adequate specimens were obtained in 65/72 cases (90%). Most of the lymph nodes were benign (n = 40, 67%) and most of the masses were malignant or suspicious (n = 8, 73%). A variety of diagnoses, primary and metastatic, were made, including hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma and lymphoma. In addition, we have noted a significant increase in the number of EUS-FNAs in recent years.Conclusion:EUS-FNA is an effective and increasingly utilized diagnostic approach for the evaluation of multiple types of lesions in the porta hepatis.
