Our aim in this study was to develop a prognostic scoring system with which to identify patients most likely to benefit from adjuvant chemolipiodolization (ACL) after liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Data from 1150 HCC patients who underwent liver resection between 2002 and 2008 at the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital were used to develop the scoring system. Patients were stratified into prognostic subgroups using the new scoring system, and the outcomes of patients who received ACL and those who did not were compared in each subgroup. Using data from 379 patients operated on between 2008 and 2010 for validation, the scoring system had a concordance index (C-index) of 0.75 for predicting post-resectional overall survival (OS). It optimally stratified patients into three prognostic subgroups with scores of 0-5, 6-9 and ≥ 10, having better, medium and worse survival outcomes, respectively. A difference in OS between ACL and non-ACL patients was only detected in the subgroup with scores ≥ 10 (1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates: 63.9%, 22.6%, and 9.0% vs. 33.8%, 5.6%, and 2.8%, p = 0.001). Our proposed scoring system provides an effective tool for selecting the patients most likely to benefit from ACL.
