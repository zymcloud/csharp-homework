Background:Resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) offers a chance of cure, but recurrence is common and survival is often limited. The clinical and pathological characteristics of long-term survivors have not been well studied.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed 212 patients who underwent partial hepatectomy for HCC with curative intent from 1992 to 2006. Fifty patients who survived beyond 10 years were compared with 109 patients who died of recurrence within 10 years.Results:Multivariate analysis showed that tumors 1000 ng/mL, unfavorable serum inflammatory indices, tumor size >10 cm, microvascular invasion, poor tumor differentiation, cirrhosis, and metabolic syndrome. None of the 10-year survivors had an R1 resection. While 77% of the short-term survivors developed recurrence within 2 years, 42% of the 10-year survivors developed recurrence during their decade of follow-up, although most of the recurrences among 10-year survivors were intrahepatic and amenable to further treatment. Among patients who survived beyond 10 years, 42% remained alive without recurrence.Conclusions:In this largest Western series of actual 10-year survivors after HCC resection, almost one in four patients survived over a decade, even though nearly half of this subset had developed recurrence. While many well-known variables were associated with a poor outcome, only a positive microscopic margin precluded long-term survival.
