The recognition of functional roles for transcribed long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has provided a new dimension to our understanding of cellular physiology and disease pathogenesis. LncRNAs are a large group of structurally complex RNA genes that can interact with DNA, RNA, or protein molecules to modulate gene expression and to exert cellular effects through diverse mechanisms. The emerging knowledge regarding their functional roles and their aberrant expression in disease states emphasizes the potential for lncRNA to serve as targets for therapeutic intervention. In this concise review, we outline the mechanisms of action of lncRNAs, their functional cellular roles, and their involvement in disease. Using liver cancer as an example, we provide an overview of the emerging opportunities and potential approaches to target lncRNA-dependent mechanisms for therapeutic purposes.
