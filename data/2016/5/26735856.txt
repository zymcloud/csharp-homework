The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinicopathologic characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma with reactive ductule-like components (HCC-RD), corresponding to combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (CHC) with stem cell features, typical subtype. Retrospective clinicopathologic analysis was performed on HCCs surgically treated at the University of Tokyo Hospital between 1995 and 2013. RD components were defined as neoplastic ductular structures composed of small "stem/progenitor-like" cells. There were 46 HCC-RDs, comprising about 3% of all HCCs. Thirty-eight cases of CHC, classical type (classical CHC), were identified during the study period. When compared with conventional HCC, HCC-RD was characterized by younger patient age (P=0.016), higher frequency of female patients (P
