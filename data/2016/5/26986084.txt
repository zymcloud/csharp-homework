The present study was designed to investigate the effect of cantharidin on cell proliferation, ability of selfrenewal, cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma stem cells (HCSCs). It was observed that cantharidin treatment exhibited dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect on the viability of HCSCs. The inhibition of cell viability by cantharidin in HepG2 CD133+ and parental cells was significant at the concentration 5 and 15 µM, respectively after 48 h. Cantharidin treatment inhibited the self-renewal ability of the HCSCs and the expression of β-catenin and cyclin D1. Flow cytometry revealed that cantharidin treatment at 5 µM concentration significantly increased the cell population in G2/M phase and decreased the population in the G1 phase. Cantharidin treatment in the HCSCs for 48 h increased expression of histone H2AX, Myt1, cyclin A2, cyclin B1, p53 and cdc2 (Tyr15) phosphorylation significantly compared to the parental cells. Exposure of the HCSCs to cantharidin for 48 h at a concentration of 5 µM caused a significant increase in the proportion of apoptotic cells. Therefore, cantharidin is a promising agent for the hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.
