Kidney transplant recipients (KTR) are subjected to immunosuppressive therapy that can enhance hepatitis B and C virus replication, leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and outcome of HCC in KTR. Case-control study. Patients with chronic HBV and/or HCV infection who underwent kidney transplantation between 1976 and 2011 and subsequently developed HCC were compared to a control group of patients with chronic HBV and/or HCV infection, matched for gender and age at HCC diagnosis, who did not receive kidney transplantation. Among 2944 KTR, 330 had hepatitis B and/or C. Fourteen developed HCC, a period prevalence of 4.2%. Age at HCC diagnosis was 52.6 ± 6.5 years (53.5 ± 5.7 in controls, P=.76). Time between transplantation and HCC diagnosis was 16.7 ± 2.7 years. Six HCCs were related to HBV, six to HCV and two to co-infection with HBV and HCV. Immunosuppressive therapy was comparable in HBV, HCV and HBV+HCV patients. At diagnosis, 71% of patients met Milan criteria (65% in the control group, P=.4). Alpha-fetoprotein levels, tumour characteristics and treatment modalities were comparable between both groups. Patient survival 2 years after HCC diagnosis was 28% in KTR, compared to 68% in controls (P=.024). Survival after HCC diagnosis is significantly worse in KTR compared to nontransplanted patients with HBV and/or HCV. Prevention is crucial and should be based on viral eradication/suppression before or after transplantation.
