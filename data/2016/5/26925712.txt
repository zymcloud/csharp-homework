Undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of the liver (UESL) is a rare and aggressive pediatric malignancy. The purpose of this study was to review the clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features and outcome of children with UESL at our institution, in the United Network of Organ Sharing database and to review the existing literature to define the state of the art for children with UESL. Six children were diagnosed with UESL at the Texas Children's Cancer Center between 1993 and 2014, 12 children underwent liver transplantation registered in the United Network of Organ Sharing database, and 198 children with UESL were described in 23 case series during 1978 to 2014. Patients were treated with multimodal treatment approaches including primary surgical resection, neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy, and liver transplantation resulting in overall survival reported between 20% and 100% with significant improvement over the recent years. We show that complete tumor removal remains the key element of treatment and our single-institutional experience and data in the published literature suggest that combination chemotherapy with ifosfamide and doxorubicin to facilitate complete surgical resection is an effective approach to cure children with UESL.
