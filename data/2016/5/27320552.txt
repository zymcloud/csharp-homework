Background:The majority of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is diagnosed in late stages and therefore becomes ineligible for potentially curative treatment such as resection or liver transplantation. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with drug-eluting beads (DC beads, Biocompatibles, Farnham, United Kingdom) has been proven with less side effects and better efficacy than conventional TACE, especially among patients with poor liver function.Purpose:The aim of this study is to evaluate outcomes of HCC patients who received TACE with DC beads, which resulted to eligibility for liver transplantation.Methods and materials:From January 2012 to June 2015, 60 patients with HCC received pre-liver transplantation evaluation whose cases were managed with TACE using DC beads at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital were included in the study. DC beads loaded with doxorubicin were used.Results:Forty percent of the patients had complete tumor response. Thirty-three percent of the patients had partial tumor response, of which 15% showed stable disease, 11.7% exhibited disease progression including 3 with portal vein thrombosis, 1 with both hepatic vein and portal vein thrombosis, and 3 with increase in tumor size. Twenty-three patients were beyond University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) criteria initially. The successful downstage rate was 73.9% (17 of 23). Thirty-seven patients fit the USCF criteria initially. The 3-, 6- and 12-month drop rates of these patients were 0%, 3.9%, and 16.8%, respectively. Twenty-four (40%) patients successfully underwent liver transplantation. Three patients (12.5%) demonstrated recurrent HCC after liver transplantation.Conclusion:TACE with DC bead can effectively induce tumor necrosis and appears to be a successful approach as bridge therapy for patients with advanced HCC and poor liver function.
