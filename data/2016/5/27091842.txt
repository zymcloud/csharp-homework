Oxidative stress status has a key role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and progression. Normally, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels are tightly controlled by an inducible antioxidant program that responds to cellular stressors. How HCC cells respond to excessive oxidative stress remains elusive. Here, we identified a feedback loop between gankyrin, an oncoprotein overexpressed in human HCC, and Nrf2 maintaining the homeostasis in HCC cells. Mechanistically, gankyrin was found to interact with the Kelch domain of Keap1 and effectively competed with Nrf2 for Keap1 binding. Increased expression of gankyrin in HCC cells blocked the binding between Nrf2 and Keap1, inhibiting the degradation of Nrf2 by proteasome. Interestingly, accumulation and translocation of Nrf2 increased the transcription of gankyrin through binding to the ARE elements in the promoter of gankyrin. The positive feedback regulation involving gankyrin and Nrf2 modulates a series of antioxidant enzymes, thereby lowering intracellular ROS and conferring a steadier intracellular environment, which prevents mitochondrial damage and cell death induced by excessive oxidative stress. Our results indicate that gankyrin is a regulator of cellular redox homeostasis and provide a link between oxidative stress and the development of HCC.
