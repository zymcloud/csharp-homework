To retrospectively compare the outcome of chemolipiodolization with or without embolization in transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within the Milan criteria. From August 2002 to December 2014, 112 patients (median age, 56.7 years; age range, 22-80 years; 97 men, 15 women) underwent TACE with gelatin sponge particle embolization, and 125 patients (median age, 56.6 years; age range, 23-82 years; 109 men, 16 women) underwent TACE without embolization. RFA was performed within 2 weeks after the TACE. Cumulative overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were compared before and after propensity score matching. Before matching, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rate were 96%, 80%, and 62% for embolization group and 94%, 76%, and 59% for non-embolization group . The 1-, 3-, and 5-year DFS rate were 77%, 38%, and 30% for embolization group and 75%, 35%, and 26% for non-embolization group. After matching, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rate were 97%, 82%, and 62% for embolization group and 92%, 74%, and 56% for non-embolization group. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year DFS rate were 79%, 36%, and 30% for embolization group and 74%, 33%, and 26% for non-embolization group. There were no significant difference in OS and DFS rates between the two groups before matching (P =0.999 and P =0.654) and after matching (P =0.951 and P =0.670). In conclusion, embolization in TACE combined with RFA could not improve the survival for patients with HCC within the Milan criteria.
