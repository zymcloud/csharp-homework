Bronchobiliary fistula (BBF) is a rare complication of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinoma. The rupture of a biloma following RFA may result in the development of BBF, with their early detection and timely management important in the prevention of BBF. The current study presents a case of BBF, which developed at 17 months after radiofrequency ablation (RFA), due to biloma rupture in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite the percutaneous drainage of the biloma following BBF, the persistent fever did not resolve due to biliary infection. Finally, an extensive surgical intervention was performed. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that had been performed following RFA were reviewed, and it was found that the biloma and increased bile leakage had presented prior to biloma rupture. For that reason, it is advised that patients who present with biloma following RFA should receive regular follow-up MRI scans. Biloma enlargement could be a predictor for the development of BBF; therefore, timely drainage of an enlarging biloma may be able to prevent this complication.
