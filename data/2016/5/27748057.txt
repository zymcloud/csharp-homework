Port-site metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is extremely rare, and only one case has been reported in the English-language literature. Contamination with malignant cells along the needle tract during percutaneous biopsy or radiofrequency ablation is a well-recognized cause of HCC recurrence. Here, we describe a case of port-site metastasis after laparoscopic liver resection of HCC. The patient, who had undergone laparoscopic partial resection of the left lateral segment of the liver 18 months earlier, was diagnosed with HCC. CT showed a nodule in the abdominal wall where the laparoscopic port had been inserted during resection. Local excision was performed, and histological examination revealed HCC consistent with recurrence after laparoscopic resection. The experience described in this report highlights the risk of port-site metastasis of HCC. Imaging for oncologic surveillance after laparoscopic resection must include all port sites.
