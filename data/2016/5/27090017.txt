MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that function as critical gene regulators by targeting mRNAs for translational repression or degradation. In this study, we showed that the expression level of miR-133b was decreased, while Sirt1 mRNA expression levels were increased in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cell lines, and we identified Sirt1 as a novel direct target of miR-133b. The over-expression of miR-133b suppressed Sirt1 expression. In addition, miR-133b over-expression resulted in attenuating HCC cell proliferation and invasion together with apoptosis increase in vitro. HepG2 cell transplantation revealed that up-regulation of miR-133b could inhibit HCC tumor genesis in vivo. Forced expression of Sirt1 partly rescued the effect of miR-133b in vitro. Furthermore, our study showed that miR-133b over-expression or Sirt1 down-regulation elevated E-cadherin expression, and repressed glypican-3 (GPC3) and the anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) expression. The inhibition of GPC3 expression repressed Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 expression, and elevated E-cadherin expression. Moreover, the Sirt1 up-regulation resulted in increases in HCC cell proliferation and invasion together with decreases apoptosis, and increases in the cytosolic accumulation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor β-catenin in vitro. But the effect of Sirt1 up-regulation was partly reversed by GPC3 down-regulation in vitro. Taken together, these findings provide insight into the role and mechanism of miR-133b in regulating HCC cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis via the miR-133b/Sirt1/GPC3/Wnt β-catenin axis, and miR-133b may serve as a potential therapeutic target in HCC in the future.
