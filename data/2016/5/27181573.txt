Peripheral platelet counts decrease after partial hepatectomy; however, the implications of this phenomenon are unclear. We assessed if the observed decrease in platelet counts was associated with postoperative liver function and morbidity (complications grade ≤ II according to the Clavien-Dindo classification). We enrolled 216 consecutive patients who underwent partial hepatectomy for primary liver cancers, metastatic liver cancers, benign tumors, and donor hepatectomy. We classified patients as either low or high platelet percentage (postoperative platelet count/preoperative platelet count) using the optimal cutoff value calculated by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and analyzed risk factors for delayed liver functional recovery and morbidity after hepatectomy. Delayed liver function recovery and morbidity were significantly correlated with the lowest value of platelet percentage based on ROC analysis. Using a cutoff value of 60% acquired by ROC analysis, univariate and multivariate analysis determined that postoperative lowest platelet percentage ≤ 60% was identified as an independent risk factor of delayed liver function recovery (odds ratio (OR) 6.85; P < 0.01) and morbidity (OR, 4.90; P < 0.01). Furthermore, patients with the lowest platelet percentage ≤ 60% had decreased postoperative prothrombin time ratio and serum albumin level and increased serum bilirubin level when compared with patients with platelet percentage ≥ 61%. A greater than 40% decrease in platelet count after partial hepatectomy was an independent risk factor for delayed liver function recovery and postoperative morbidity. In conclusion, the decrease in platelet counts is an early marker to predict the liver function recovery and complications after hepatectomy.
