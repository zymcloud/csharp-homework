Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a significant health problem in developing countries causing sporadic and epidemic forms of acute viral hepatitis. Hepatitis E is a self-limiting disease; however, chronic HEV infections are being reported in immunocompromised individuals. The disease severity is more during pregnancy with high mortality (20-25%), especially in third trimester. Early cellular responses after HEV infection are not completely understood. We analyzed innate immune responses associated with genotype-I HEV replication in human hepatoma cell lines (Huh7, Huh7.5 and HepG2/C3A) using HEV replicon system. These cells supported HEV replication with different efficiencies due to the cell type specific innate immune responses. HepG2/C3A cells were less supportive to HEV replication as compared to Huh7.5 and S10-3 cells. Reconstitution of the defective RIG-I and TLR3 signaling in Huh7.5 cells enabled them to induce higher level antiviral responses and restrict HEV replication, suggesting the involvement of both RIG-I and TLR3 in sensing HEV RNA and downstream activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to generate antiviral responses. Inhibition of IRF3 mediated downstream responses in HepG2/C3A cells by pharmacological inhibitor BX795 significantly improved HEV replication efficiency implying the importance of this study in establishing a better cell culture system for future HEV studies.
