The Pretreatment Extent of Disease System (PRETEXT) was designed for childhood liver tumors. The aim of this study was to confirm the prognostic value of the PRETEXT staging system compared with the currently and commonly used staging systems of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after applying PRETEXT system in patients with HCC who underwent curative partial hepatectomy.Clinical data of consecutive patients who underwent curative partial hepatectomy were collected between February 1st, 2005 to December 30th, 2012 as the primary and internal validation cohort. Similar patients from a western hospital formed an external validation cohort. The predictive accuracy of the PRETEXT system compared with the currently used staging systems was measured by the area under the curve (AUC) on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Of the 507 patients in the primary cohort, the overall median survival was 52.3 months, and the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year overall survival rates were 83.0%, 56.8%, and 40.2%, respectively. The multivariate analysis of Cox proportional hazard regression identified INR (p=0.001), microvascular invasion (p=0.042), maximum tumor size (p=0.002) and PRETEXT staging system were independently predictors of overall survival. In the primary cohort, the AUC of the PRETEXT system was 0.702 (95% CI, 0.656 to 0.747), which was higher than the other conventional staging systems for predicting OS of HCC (P
