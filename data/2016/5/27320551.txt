Objective:Liver transplantation for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is notorious for rapid recurrence with poor survival rate postoperatively and has therefore been discontinued in most centers. The purpose of this study is to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from cholangiocarcinoma in pretransplantation imaging evaluation by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI).Materials and methods:From January 2014 to September 2015, 19 patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 62.8 years. All subjects underwent pretransplantation DCE-MRI and surgical excision or core biopsy. The DCE-MRI parameters were measured using the Tofts model 1999. Statistical analysis included nonparametric tests and area under the curve for the receiver operating characteristic.Results:Fourteen HCCs and 5 cholangiocarcinomas were diagnosed by surgical pathology. The mean size of tumor was 6.4 cm (range, 1.5 cm to 13.7 cm). All DCE-MRI parameters were calculated as the ratio between the tumor and normal liver parenchyma and K(trans) (1/min) was used as a distinguishing parameter between the two tumors. K(trans) was higher in the cholangiocarcinoma group (1.89 ± 1.13) than in the HCC group (0.46 ± 0.35). Univariate analysis revealed that K(trans) has a high significant difference (P = .001). The optimal K(trans) value cutoffs were 1 or more (area under the curve = 0.971) for detection of HCCs or cholangiocarcinomas.Conclusion:The analysis of DCE-MRI with the kinetic model (Tofts, 1999) presents a new and practical approach indiscrimination of HCC from cholangiocarcinoma for pretransplantation imaging evaluation.
