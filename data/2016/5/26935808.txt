Corilagin is a natural plant polyphenol tannic acid with antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative properties. However, the mechanisms of its actions are largely unknown. Our group reported that corilagin could induce cell inhibition in human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and human liver hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines HepG2. We report here that corilagin inhibits cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) development through regulating Notch signaling pathway. We found that, in vitro, corilagin inhibited CCA cell proliferation, migration and invasion, promoted CCA cell apoptosis, and inhibited Notch1 and Notch signaling pathway protein expression. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to establish Notch intracellular domain (NICD) interaction with MAML1 and P300 in CCA. Importantly, corilagin reduced Hes1 mRNA level through inhibiting Hes1 promoter activity. In nude mice, corilagin inhibited CCA growth and repressed the expression of Notch1 and mTOR. These results indicate that corilagin may control CCA cell growth by downregulating the expression of Notch1. Therefore, our findings suggest that corilagin may have the potential to become a new therapeutic drug for human CCA.
