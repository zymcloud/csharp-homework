Biodegradable self-assembled polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) composed of poly(6-O-methacryloyl-D-galactopyranose)-b-poly(L-lactide)-b-poly(6-O-methacryloyl-D-galactopyranose) (PMAGP-b-PLA-b-PMAGP) are prepared as carriers for the hydrophobic anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX), to achieve target delivery to hepatoma cells. PTX can be encapsulated by the NPs with various molar ratios of L-lactide (LA) and 6-O-methacryloyl-D-galactopyranose (MAGP) during the process of self-assembly, and the resulting NPs exhibit high drug loading efficacy and substantial stability in aqueous solution. The size, size distribution, and morphology of the NPs are characterized using a Zetasizer Nano ZS and transmission electron microscopy. The hemolysis assay and cell cytotoxicity assay indicate that the polymeric NPs are biocompatible and non-toxic. The cellular uptake assay demonstrates that the galactose-containing NPs can be selectively recognized and subsequently accumulate in HepG2 cells. All of these results demonstrate that galactose-containing polymeric NPs are potential carriers for hepatoma-targeted drug delivery and liver cancer therapy in clinical medicine.
