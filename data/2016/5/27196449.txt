Liver stiffness (LS), assessed using transient elastography (TE), and (FIB-4) can both estimate the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We compared prognostic performances of LS and FIB-4 to predict HCC development in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Data from 1308 patients with CHB, who underwent TE, were retrospectively analyzed. FIB-4 was calculated for all patients. The cumulative rate of HCC development was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves. The predictive performances of LS and FIB-4 were evaluated using time-dependent receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves.The mean age (883 men) was 50 years. During follow-up (median 6.1 years), 119 patients developed HCC. The areas under the ROC curves (AUROCs) predicting HCC risk at 3, 5, and 7 years were consistently greater for LS than for FIB-4 (0.791-0.807 vs 0.691-0.725; all P 0.05).LS showed significantly better performance than FIB-4 in assessing the risk of HCC development, and the combined use of LS and FIB-4 did not provide additional benefit compared with the use of LS alone. Hence, LS assessed using TE might be helpful for optimizing HCC surveillance strategies.
