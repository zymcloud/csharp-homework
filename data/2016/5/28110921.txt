Background and aims:Diabetes associated with diseases of the exocrine pancreas (DP) is a recognized clinical condition but data on its prevalence are limited to a few single centre studies. Relative contribution of the three major diseases of the exocrine pancreas (acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer) to prevalence of DP as well as the effect of age and sex is largely unknown. The study aimed to determine age- and sex-specific prevalence of DP overall and after acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer alone at the population level.Methods:Nationwide population database covering nearly 3 million residents in New Zealand over a 10-year study period was used. DP was identified based on International Classification of Diseases-10 codes. Data were reported as prevalence per 1000 population and corresponding 95% confidence intervals.Results:The crude prevalence of DP was 1.13 [1.12, 1.14] per 1000, with 70-79 years age group having the highest prevalence at 3.94 [3.92, 3.97] per 1000. Men had an overall prevalence of 1.32 [1.31, 1.33] per 1000 and women-0.93 [0.92, 0.94] (p<0.05). Acute pancreatitis contributed 61% to overall prevalence of DP.Conclusions:Prevalence of DP in the general population is close to that of type 1 diabetes. Three out of five DP cases develop after acute pancreatitis. There is a variation in age of onset of DP, with the working and ageing population most affected. Men have a 40% higher risk of developing DP than women.
