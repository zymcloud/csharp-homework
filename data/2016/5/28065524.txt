Background:Laparoscopic approach in colorectal surgery has demonstrated to give advantages in terms of postoperative outcomes, particularly in high-risk patients. The aim was to assess the impact of patients' age on the short-term outcomes after laparoscopic right colectomy for cancer.Methods:From January 2004 to September 2014, all patients who underwent laparoscopic right colectomy for cancer in a single institution were divided into four groups (A: <64 years; B: 65-74 years; C: 75-84 years; D â‰¥85 years). Risk factors for postoperative complications were determined on multivariable analysis.Results:Laparoscopic right colectomy was performed in 507 patients, including 171 (33.7%) in A, 168 (33.1%) in B, 131 (25.8) in C and 37 (7.4%) in D. Patients in Group C and Group D had higher ASA score (p<0.0001) and presented more frequently with anaemia (20.6% and 29.7%, p=0.001). Stages III and IV were more frequently encountered in groups C and D. Overall morbidity was 27.5% without any difference in the four groups (24.5%, 29.1%, 7.5% and 18.4% respectively, p=0.58). The rate of minor complications (such as wound infection or postoperative ileus) was higher in Group D compared to other groups (p=0.05). The only independent variable correlated with postoperative morbidity was intraoperative blood transfusion (OR 2.82; CI 95% 1.05-4.59, p<0.0001).Conclusions:The present series suggests that patient's age did not significantly jeopardize the postoperative outcomes after laparoscopic right colectomy for cancer.
