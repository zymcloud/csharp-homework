Background and objectives:The development of HCC is multifactorial, resulting from the interaction of environmental factors (possibly hepatitis viruses) and host factors (genetic factors). So identification of risk factors that contribute to HCC and thus early diagnosis and therapy is necessary. This study aimed to investigate the role of tumor suppressor genes RASSF1A Ala133Ser and RECK rs11788747polymorphisms and their haplotypes in HCC.Subjects and methods:104 cases of HCC and 100 healthy controls were included in a case-control study. RASSF1A and RECK genotypes, allele and haplotypes were detected by PCR-RFLP.Results:Risk of HCC was significantly associated with carriers of A1a/Ser, Ser/Ser, Ser allele and A1a/Ser +GA haplotypes (OR=20.57, pConclusions:The RASSF1AAla133Ser polymorphism, RECK gene polymorphism and for the first time haplotype of both genes influence molecular carcinogenesis and clinic pathological features of HCC within the Egyptian population.
