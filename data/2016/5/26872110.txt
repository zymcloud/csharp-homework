Background:Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease with a strong association with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Medical treatment for PSC is still disappointing, whereas immunomodulators and biologics have been proven to be effective in IBD.Aims:This study aimed to analyze (i) the natural history of patients with PSC with or without IBD and (ii) the long-term efficacy of biologics in patients with PSC and concomitant IBD or rheumatological disorders.Patients and methods:This study included 92 consecutive PSC patients, 50 (54.3%) men and 42 (45.7%) women, with a mean age of 32.0±14.3 years at diagnosis and a mean follow-up duration of 103.8±86 months. Forty-nine (53.3%) patients had associated IBD (38 ulcerative colitis, 10 Crohn's disease, one indeterminate colitis).Results:No significant differences were found between PSC patients with and without associated IBD in terms of liver transplantation, cancer, and death rates. Cholangiocarcinoma was only identified among patients with PSC alone, whereas other cancers (hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal, and gallbladder cancer) were found only in the group with associated IBD. Five PSC patients were treated with biologic agents: three with adalimumab and one with infliximab for IBD or for rheumatoid arthritis, and one patient with rituximab for rheumatoid arthritis. Adalimumab decreased alkaline phosphatase in two of three patients after 6 and 12 months, infliximab reduced γ-glutamyltransferase after 6 and 12 months, but liver function tests tended to deteriorate thereafter. Cholangiography changes remained stable in all patients.Conclusion:Biologic agents may improve liver function tests in PSC patients, but may be associated with adverse events including deterioration of liver function.
