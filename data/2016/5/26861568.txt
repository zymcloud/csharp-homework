Background:This study aimed to determine preoperative predictors of early (Methods:Between 2000 to 2013, 166 patients underwent LR for huge HCC. Optimal cut-offs for alpha fetoprotein (AFP), NLR, PLR, and PNI were determined by plotting the receiver operator curves (ROC) in predicting early mortality and utilizing the Youden index.Results:The 30-day/in-hospital postoperative mortality rate was 4.2%. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and the 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 43% and 24%, respectively. Early mortality from disease recurrence occurred in 35 of 159 (22%) patients. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that tumor rupture and high AFP (>1,085 ng/ml) were independent preoperative predictors of early mortality after LR for HCC, and both a low PNI (Conclusions:Spontaneous rupture, high AFP, and low PNI were predictors of early mortality from disease recurrence after LR for huge HCC.
