Background & aims:Sofosbuvir is widely prescribed for treatment of HCV infection. We compared the sustained virologic response rates (SVR12) and the haematologic toxicity of various sofosbuvir-based regimens in routine clinical practice.Methods:We used ERCHIVES (Electronically Retrieved Cohort of HCV infected Veterans) to identify HCV-infected persons initiated on sofosbuvir-based regimens. Treatment duration and regimen were defined as per labelling guidelines. We excluded persons with HIV, positive hepatitis-B surface antigen, hepatocellular carcinoma and missing HCV RNA.Results:Among 4257 sofosbuvir-treated persons, sofosbuvir/simeprevir (30%), sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (29%) and sofosbuvir/ribavirin (23%) were the most common combinations prescribed. The mean age (SD) was 60.22 (6.3) years, 96% were male, 22.4% were black, 37.2% had cirrhosis, 29.7% were treatment-experienced; baseline mean HCV RNA was 6.73 log lIU/ml. Comorbidities included: 40.2% alcohol abuse or dependence, 39.7% drug abuse or dependence, 25.1% diabetes and 14.4% stage 3-5 chronic kidney disease. Overall, 86.7% completed a full course of treatment. Overall, SVR12 rates were 88-98% in the sofosbuvir/simeprevir group and 93-98% in the sofosbuvir/ledipasvir group and did not vary based on previous treatment history or cirrhosis at baseline. For genotype 2/3 patients treated with sofosbuvir/ribavirin, SVR12 rates ranged from 69 to 87% with lowest rates in treatment-experienced cirrhotics. For the sofosbuvir/simeprevir and sofosbuvir/ledipasvir groups, grade3/4 haematologic adverse events were uncommon; these trended back close to baseline values after completion of treatment.Conclusions:Sofosbuvir-based regimens in clinical practice are associated with SVR rates comparable to those seen in clinical trials and low rates of grade 3/4 haematological adverse events.
