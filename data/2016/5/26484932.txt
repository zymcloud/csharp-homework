Telbivudine is a relatively novel oral nucleoside analogue with favourable efficacy and tolerability in treatment-naïve chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, but its data in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) was lacking. The efficacy and tolerability of telbivudine in four treatment-naïve HBsAg-positive KTRs were reviewed (treatment duration 54 (36-72) months) HBV DNA declined from 2.6 × 10(5) (7.8 × 10(3) -1.5 × 10(7) ) copies/mL at baseline to 170 (0.0-3.2 × 10(4) ) copies/mL at 12 months, and became undetectable at 24 and 36 months (P = 0.060, 0.118 and 0.005 compared with baseline). Alanine aminotransferase levels dropped from 46.5 (30-48) IU/mL at baseline to 28 (13-45) IU/mL, 34.5 (15-71) IU/mL and 26 (12-41) IU/mL at 12, 24 and 36 months, respectively (P = 0.109, 0.715 and 0.068 compared with baseline). Serum creatinine level and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) remained stable after 36 months of treatment (P all > 0.05 compared with baseline). No virological breakthrough, cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma occurred. Our pilot data suggests that telbivudine has favourable efficacy and renal safety profiles in HBsAg-positive KTRs.
