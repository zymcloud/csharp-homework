Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent human cancers, with a rising incidence worldwide. The molecular mechanisms associated with the development of HCC are complex and include multiple interconnected molecular alterations with mounting evidence indicating an important role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of HCC. In humans, the development of HCC is commonly associated with liver cirrhosis. To study fibrosis-associated liver carcinogenesis, we used a mouse model designed to emulate the development of HCC in cirrhotic liver. Specifically, we were interested in evaluating the role of miRNAs in the molecular pathogenesis of liver carcinogenesis in male B6C3F1/J mice treated with N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) or carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 ) alone or a combination of DEN and CCl4 and characterized by a differential tumor incidence that increased in the following order: DEN
hepatocellular carcinoma; liver carcinogenesis; microRNAs; mouse.
