Background:The fibrosis score 4 (FIB-4) score is a useful tool to determine the degree of hepatic fibrosis. Liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are well-known predictors of postoperative complications after hepatectomy. This study examined the impact of FIB-4 on postoperative short-term outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Three hundred and fifty patients undergoing hepatectomy for HCC between 2008 and 2013 were enrolled. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the cutoff value of the FIB-4. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify the risk factors. The correlation of the preoperative FIB-4 value with clinicopathological parameters was examined.Results:Postoperative complications were observed in 202 (57.7%) patients. The optimal cutoff value of the FIB-4 was set at 2.88 and 3.85 for postoperative complications and intraoperative blood loss respectively. It was also an independent prognostic factor for postoperative complications (hazard ratio [HR], 1.202; 95% CI, 1.076-1.344; P = 0.001) and intraoperative blood loss (HR, 1.196; 95% CI, 1.091-1.343; P Conclusion:Preoperative FIB-4 is a useful index to predict postoperative outcomes in patients with HCC. The FIB-4 should be assessed routinely for hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
