Protumorigenic PD-1(hi) B cells, induced in hepatocellular carcinoma, suppress tumor-specific T-cell response via IL10-dependent pathways upon PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. Anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies may function not only through blocking the PD-1 coinhibitory pathway in T cells but also via abolishing the suppressive function of regulatory B cells.
