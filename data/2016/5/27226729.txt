Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate whether the level of serum microRNA-199a/b-3p (miR-199a/b-3p) can serve as a predictor of treatment response to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Serum miR-199a/b-3p expression level was measured in 132 patients with HCC before TACE (t1) and 3-5 days after TACE (t2). Additionally, 126 patients of these 132 patients had levels measured 4 weeks after TACE (t3) and 3-5 days after second TACE (t4). Serum miR-199a/b-3p expression levels were compared with those of 50 healthy controls. Correlations between miR-199a/b-3p expression levels and clinicopathologic factors and tumor responsiveness were analyzed. The modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors assessment was conducted at t3.Results:A lower mean baseline miR-199a/b-3p expression level was observed in patients with HCC compared with healthy controls (0.68±0.81 vs 2.50±2.16, P25% decrease in serum miR-199a/b-3p expression levels compared with the nonresponder group (64% vs 39%).Conclusion:Serum miR-199a/b-3p may represent a novel biomarker for predicting efficacy of TACE in patients with HCC.
