The present study was carried out in an attempt to synthesize a new class of antimicrobial and antiplasmodial agents by copper catalyzed click chemistry to afford 25 compounds 10-14(a-e) of 1,4-disubstituted-1,2,3-triazole derivatives of chalcones and flavones. The structures of the newly synthesized compounds were established by elemental analysis, IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and Mass spectral data. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against Gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis), Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella boydii, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and antifungal activity against (Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Dermatophyte) as well as molds (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus). The antiplasmodial and cytotoxic activities of these compounds were also evaluated against human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum strain 3D7 and human hepato-cellular carcinoma cells (Huh-7), respectively. Compounds 10a, 10c, 10d, 12c and 14e showed promising antibacterial activity while compounds 10e, 11d, 11e, 12c, 13a, 13b, 13e, 14a and 14d showed good antifungal activity as compared to the corresponding standard drugs. Compound 10b was found to be the most active against Plasmodium falciparum while the remaining compounds showed moderate to weak antiplasmodial activity. However, cytotoxic activities of all compounds were found ineffective against Huh-7 cells.
