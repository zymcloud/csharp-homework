Background and aim:Diabetes at time of liver transplantation is associated with reduced post-transplant survival. We aimed to assess whether additional metabolic conditions such as obesity or hypertension had additive prognostic impact on post-transplantation survival.Methods:A multi-center cohort study of 617 adult subjects undergoing liver transplantation between 2003 and 2009 has been used. Dry body mass index was calculated following adjustment for ascites.Results:After a median follow-up of 5.8 years (range 0-10.5), 112 (18.2%) patients died. Diabetes was associated with reduced post-transplant survival (hazard ratio 1.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-2.86, P = 0.003), whereas obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and the metabolic syndrome itself were not (P > 0.3 for all). Patients with concomitant diabetes and obesity had lower survival (adjusted Hazard Ratio [aHR] 2.40, 95%CI 1.32-4.38, P = 0.004), whereas obese non-diabetic patients or diabetic non-obese patients had similar survival compared with non-diabetic, non-obese individuals. The presence of hypertension or dyslipidemia did not impact on survival in patients with diabetes (P > 0.1 for both). Obese diabetic patients had longer intensive care and hospital stays than non-obese diabetic or obese, non-diabetic patients (P Conclusions:Concomitant diabetes and obesity but not each condition in the absence of the other is associated with reduced post-liver transplant survival. The impact of diabetes and obesity is greater in older patients and those with hepatocellular carcinoma.
