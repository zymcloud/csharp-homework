A 72-year-old woman with hepatitis C virus cirrhosis underwent a surveillance ultrasound examination which identified a new hepatic lesion. A workup triphasic CT examination demonstrated a 3.7 cm lesion at the hepatic dome with arterial enhancement and portal venous washout consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma. She subsequently proceeded for treatment with radiofrequency ablation (RFA). RFA was technically successful, but the patient became hypotensive and tachycardic postprocedure. A CT angiogram demonstrated active arterial intraperitoneal haemorrhage from the RFA site. The patient returned to the interventional suite for catheter angiography which confirmed the presence of active haemorrhage from the hepatic arterial branch supplying segment VIII. The bleeding vessel was selectively catheterised with a microcatheter, and successfully embolised with 250-355 Âµm polyvinyl alcohol particles.
