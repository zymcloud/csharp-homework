Purpose:Risk stratification after surgery for colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM) is achieved using clinicopathologic variables, however, is of limited accuracy. We sought to derive and externally validate a multigene expression assay prognostic of overall survival (OS) that is superior to clinicopathologic variables in patients with surgically resected CRLM.Experimental design:We measured mRNA expression in prospectively collected frozen tumor from 96 patients with surgically resected CRLM at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC, New York, NY). We retrospectively generated a 20-gene molecular risk score (MRS) and compared its prognostic utility for OS and recurrence-free survival (RFS) with three common clinical risk scores (CRS). We then tested the prognostic ability of the MRS in an external validation cohort (European) of 119 patients with surgically resected CRLM at the University Medical Center Utrecht (Utrecht, the Netherlands) and Paul Brousse Hospital (Villejuif, France).Results:For OS in the MSKCC cohort, MRS was the strongest independent prognosticator (HR, 3.7-4.9; P < 0.001) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (HR, 0.3; P ≤ 0.001). For OS in the European cohort, MRS was the only independent prognosticator (HR, 3.5; P = 0.007). For RFS, MRS was also independently prognostic in the MSKCC cohort (HR, 2.4-2.6; P ≤ 0.001) and the European cohort (HR, 1.6-2.5; P ≤ 0.05).Conclusions:Compared with CRSs, the MRS is more accurate, broadly applicable, and an independent prognostic biomarker of OS in resected CRLM. This MRS is the first externally validated prognostic multigene expression assay after metastasectomy for CRLM and warrants prospective validation. Clin Cancer Res; 22(10); 2575-82. ©2016 AACR.
