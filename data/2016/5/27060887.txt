Dichromate binds to surface-active maghemite nanoparticles (SAMNs) to form a stable core-shell nanostructures (SAMN@Cr(VI) ). The hybrid was characterized by MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy, high-angle annular dark-field imaging, electron energy-loss spectroscopy, and electrochemical techniques, which revealed a strong interaction of dichromate with the nanoparticle surface. Electrochemical characterization showed lower charge-transfer resistance, better electrochemical performance, and more reversible electrochemical behavior with respect to naked SAMNs. Moreover, SAMN@Cr(VI) is an excellent electrocatalyst for hydrogen peroxide reduction. Furthermore, an enzyme, namely, bovine serum amine oxidase (BSAO: EC 1.4.3.6), was immobilized on SAMN@Cr(VI) by self-assembly to give a ternary hybrid nanostructured catalyst for polyamine oxidation (SAMN@Cr(VI) -BSAO). SAMN@Cr(VI) -BSAO was applied for the development of a reagentless, fast, inexpensive, and interference-free polyamine biosensor, which was successfully exploited for the discrimination of tumorous tissue from healthy tissue in human crude liver extracts.
