Background:Primary liver malignancy is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) representing the majority. Combined HCC-CC, in contrast, accounts for less than 5% of these liver cancers and has not been clearly characterized by imaging, making diagnosis and management difficult.Materials and methods:This retrospective study investigated 32 patients with early-stage combined HCC-CC tumor who underwent hepatectomy (n = 24) or liver transplantation (n = 8). Preoperative imaging and pathologic reports were retrospectively reviewed and correlated. Survival and recurrence rates were then analyzed.Results:Twelve patients with more than 50% CC component showed typical CC enhancement, whereas 17 patients with less than 50% CC component exhibited typical HCC enhancement. Those with equivocal imaging findings resulted near equal tumor component. The majority demonstrated either heterogeneous or peripheral enhancement. Considering the major tumor component, 66% of the images were consistent with histopathology. The over-all 3-year recurrent rate was 59%, with a mean time to recurrence of about 7 months. The 3-year survival rate of combined tumor after hepatectomy was 76% and after transplant was 75%, regardless of major tumor component. However, patients with more than 50% CC component showed a decrease in 3-year survival rate to 50% when transplantation was performed.Conclusion:The overall survival rate for combined tumor after either hepatectomy or transplantation seems to be satisfactory but carries a high risk of recurrent when compared to pure HCC. On the other hand, a major CC component tumor after transplantation is associated with poor survival outcome; thus, liver transplantation has no role and is not a good management option.
