Background:Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) increases morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation (LT). The identification of risk factors for HAT may aid transplant teams in the development of strategies aimed at reducing HAT. This article describes the risk factors for HAT and outcomes after LT.Methods:This report describes a retrospective study (1995 to 2015) of primary pediatric living donor LT (LDLT). Pretransplant and technical variables were included in the study. Binary logistic regression was used for data analysis.Results:This study included 656 primary LDLT. The median age, body weight, and pediatric end-stage liver disease score at the time of transplant were 13 months, 8.4 kg and 15, respectively. Twenty-one (3.2%) patients developed HAT. Intraoperative HAT (odds ratio, 62.63; 95% confidence interval, 12.64-310.19; P < 0.001) and the use of liver grafts with a graft-to-recipient weight ratio less than 1.1% (odds ratio, 24.46; 95% confidence interval, 4.55-131.56; P < 0.001) retained statistical significance in the multivariate model. Patient and graft survivals were significantly worse in cases with HAT. The overtime trend analysis revealed a decrease in the incidence of HAT (P = 0.008) and an increase in the use of 2-arterial anastomosis (P < 0.001).Conclusions:A graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 1.1% or less and intraoperative HAT were independently associated with HAT. Trend analysis further revealed a significant reduction in the incidence of HAT over time, as well as the increased use of 2 hepatic arteries for anastomosis during graft implantation. The double artery anastomosis may represent an extra protection to pediatric recipients undergoing LDLT.
