Objective:To verify the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic adrenalectomy for large tumours, as since it was described, the laparoscopic approach for adrenalectomy has become the 'gold standard' for small tumours and for large and non-malignant adrenal tumours many studies have reported acceptable results.Patients and methods:This is a retrospective study from a general surgery department from January 2006 to December 2013 including 45 patients (56 laparoscopic adrenalectomies). We divided patients into two groups according to tumour size: Results:There was no statistical difference between the two groups for conversion rate (3.7% vs 11.7% P = 0.32), postoperative complications (14% vs 12%, P = 0.4), postoperative length of hospital stay (5 vs 6 days P = 0.43) or mortality (3.5% vs 0% P = 0.99). The only statistical difference was the operating time, at a mean (SD) 155 (60) vs 247 (71) min (P Conclusion:Laparoscopic adrenalectomy for large tumours needs more time but appears to be safe and feasible when performed by experienced surgeons.
