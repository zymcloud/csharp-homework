BACKGROUND We investigated whether the plant-derived agent triptolide (TPL) could effectively inhibit the growth and invasion of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS MHCC-97H cells were treated with various concentration of TPL for various times. To detect the effect of NF-κB on TPL-induced signal pathways, MHCC-97H cells were transfected with p65 siRNA or p65 cDNA, then treated with TPL. We detected cell survival and apoptosis by MTT, soft-agar colony formation assay, flow cytometry, and TUNEL assay. Cell migration and invasion was determined by Matrigel invasion and a wound-healing assay. NF-κB activity was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA); MMP-9 activity was detected by ELISA. Western blot and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assays were used to detect p65 and MMP-9 protein and mRNA expression. A subcutaneously implanted tumor model of MHCC-97H cells in nude mice was used to assess the effects of TPL on tumorigenesis in vivo. RESULTS We showed that TPL treatment significantly suppressed growth and induced apoptosis of MHCC-97H cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner in vitro. Furthermore, TPL treatment inhibited invasion in vitro and inhibited the growth and lung metastasis of MHCC-97H cells in vivo. NF-κB and MMP-9 were inactivated with TPL treatment. Overexpression of p65 restored MMP-9 activity and inhibited the TPL anti-tumor effect on MHCC-97H cells. Knockdown of p65 blocked MMP-9 activation and enhanced TPL-induced cell apoptosis and survival inhibition, and TPL inhibition of migration and invasion in vitro. CONCLUSIONS TPL treatment inhibited MHCC-97H cell growth, invasion, and metastasis in vitro and vivo, suggesting that TPL could be developed as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of HCC.
