Objectives:The purpose of this study was to study the expression of CCL15 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and explore its clinicopathological significance, and study relationships between expressions of CCL15 and malignant behaviors of HCC.Methods:The SP immunohistochemical method was used to detect expression of CCL15 in routinely paraffin-embedded sections from 80 cases of HCC, 80 of adjacent cancerous specimens and 50 of normal liver tissue. In these patients with HCC, Kaplan-Meier was used to assess survival outcomes.Results:The positive rates and scores of CCL15 were significantly higher in HCC than adjacent cancerous specimens and normal liver tissue (p 0.05). The expression of CCL15 was significantly correlated to tumor size, tumor thrombi in portal vein of HCC, capsule and TNM stage (p 0.05). Survival time of the patients with positive CCL15 expression was significantly decreased, and multivariate analysis indicated CCL15 expression was one of the independent predictors of survival (p = 0.042).Conclusion:The expression of CCL15 was significantly correlated with malignant behaviors of HCC, and CCL15 might be important biological markers for reflecting the carcinogenesis, progression, biological behaviors and prognosis of HCC.
