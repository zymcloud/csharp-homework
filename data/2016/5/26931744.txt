Introduction:Patients with hereditary bleeding disorders who have developed end-stage liver disease as a consequence of hepatitis C infection (HCV) acquired from factor concentrates prior to the introduction of viral inactivation continue to be referred for liver transplantation.Methods:A retrospective review of case notes and electronic records was performed on all patients with bleeding disorders who have undergone liver transplantation at the University Hospital Birmingham (UHB).Results:Between 1990 and 2014, 35 liver transplants have been performed in 33 patients with hereditary bleeding disorders. The indication for transplantation was mainly end-stage liver disease secondary to HCV. Five patients had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection. No excess mortality due to bleeding occurred in the peri or postoperative period. Median overall survival post transplant is 9.7 years. Overall survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years are 90%, 72% and 64% respectively. The predominant cause of mortality was liver failure secondary to either recurrent HCV or recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The median overall survival in patients with HIV co-infection is shorter than in those with mono-infection but this is not statistically significant. Patients with a pre-existing HCC had a statistically significant shorter survival (2.4 years vs. 13.6 years, P = 0.007).Conclusion:Liver transplantation has become an accepted treatment option for patients with hereditary bleeding disorders and HCV associated end-stage liver disease with survival rates similar to non-bleeding disorder patients.
