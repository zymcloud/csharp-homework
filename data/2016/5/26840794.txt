The effective therapeutic targets for hepatocellular carcinoma remain limited. Pituitary homeobox 1 (PITX1) functions as a tumor suppressor in hepatocarcinogenesis by regulating the expression level of Ras guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein. Here, we report that protein tyrosine phosphatases 1B (PTP1B) directly dephosphorylated PITX1 at Y160, Y175, and Y179 to further weaken the protein stability of PITX. The PTP1B-dependent decline of PITX1 reduced its transcriptional activity for p120RasGAP (RASA1), a Ras guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein. Both silencing of PTP1B and PTP1B inhibitor up-regulated the PITX1-p120RasGAP axis through hyperphosphorylation of PITX1. Sorafenib, the first and only targeted drug approved for hepatocellular carcinoma, directly decreased PTP1B activity and promoted the expression of PITX1 and p120RasGAP by PITX1 hyperphosphorylation. Molecular docking also supported the potential interaction between PTP1B and sorafenib. PTP1B overexpression impaired the sensitivity of sorafenib in vitro and in vivo, implying that PTP1B has a significant effect on sorafenib-induced apoptosis. In sorafenib-treated tumor samples, we further found inhibition of PTP1B activity and up-regulation of the PITX1-p120RasGAP axis, suggesting that PTP1B inhibitor may be effective for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. By immunohistochemical staining of hepatic tumor tissue from 155 patients, the expression of PTP1B was significantly in tumor parts higher than nontumor parts (P = 0.02). Furthermore, high expression of PTP1B was significantly associated with poor tumor differentiation (P = 0.031).Conclusion:PTP1B dephosphorylates PITX1 to weaken its protein stability and the transcriptional activity for p120RasGAP gene expression and acts as a determinant of the sorafenib-mediated drug effect; targeting the PITX1-p120RasGAP axis with a PTP1B inhibitor may provide a new therapy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
