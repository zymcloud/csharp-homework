Background:We assessed the risk factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following successful eradication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) with interferon (IFN) therapy in a long-term, large-scale cohort study.Methods:We reviewed 1094 consecutive patients with HCV who achieved sustained virological response (SVR) following IFN therapy between January 1995 and September 2013.Results:During the observation period (median 50 months: range 13-224), 36 (3%) of 1094 patients developed HCC after SVR. The median period from SVR to diagnosis of HCC was 37 months (range 17-141), and the cumulative rates of HCC at 5, 10, and 15 years were 4%, 6%, and 12%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified old age (≥60 years, HR, 3.1: 95%CI, 1.3-6.6: P = 0.009), male sex (HR, 12.0: 95%CI, 2.8-50.0: P Conclusions:Older age and male sex (host factors), advanced fibrosis stage (pre-IFN treatment factor), and higher alpha-fetoprotein values (post-treatment factor) were significantly associated with HCC development after HCV eradication.
