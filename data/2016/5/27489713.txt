Objective:We presented a rare case of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma after liver transplant manifested as an isolated mediastinal mass.Methods:A 62-year-old man was referred for evaluation of atypical chest pain and abnormal finding of a computed tomography of the chest. He had history of chronic hepatitis C liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma underwent orthotopic liver transplant as a curative treatment three years earlier.Results:The computed tomography of the chest demonstrated paratracheal mediastinal lymphadenopathy. He subsequently underwent endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). The right paratracheal lymph node station 4R was sampled. Rapid on-site cytology evaluation demonstrated recurrent metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.Conclusion:Pulmonologist should be cognizant of diagnostic utility of EBUS-TBNA in this clinical setting as more transplant patients on immunosuppressive medications with enlarged mediastinal lymphadenopathy of unknown origin will be referred for further evaluation.
