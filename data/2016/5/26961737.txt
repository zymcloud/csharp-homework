Embolotherapies used in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) include bland embolization, conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) using ethiodol as a carrier, TACE with drug-eluting beads and super absorbent polymer microspheres (DEB-TACE), and selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT). Successfully treated HCC lesions undergo coagulation necrosis, and appear as nonenhancing hypoattenuating or hypointense lesions in the embolized region on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance. Residual or recurrent tumours demonstrate arterial enhancement with portal venous phase wash-out of contrast, features characteristic of HCC, in and/or around the embolized area. Certain imaging features that result from the procedure itself may limit assessment of response. In conventional TACE, the high-attenuating retained ethiodized oil may obscure arterially-enhancing tumours and limit detection of residual tumours; thus a noncontrast CT on follow-up imaging is important post-cTACE. Hyperenhancement within or around the treated zone can be seen after cTACE, DEB-TACE, or SIRT due to physiologic inflammatory response and may mimic residual tumour. Recognition of these pitfalls is important in the evaluation embolotherapy response.
