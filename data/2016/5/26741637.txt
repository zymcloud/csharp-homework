Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer mortality among men worldwide. Serotonin is a biogenic amine, which may be involved in the tumorigenesis of HCC.Aim:We aimed to determine whether serotonin is a dependable marker for the diagnosis of HCC in cirrhotic patients in comparison with Î±-fetoprotein protein (AFP) and prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA-II).Patients and methods:Serum serotonin, AFP, and PIVKA-II were measured in 262 patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC): 82 cirrhotic patients with HCC (group I), 80 cirrhotic patients without HCC (group II), and 100 CHC-infected patients without cirrhosis (group III); in addition, 60 healthy controls were studied (group IV).Results:AFP showed significant statistical differences among the groups studied (PConclusion:Serotonin may be used together with PIVKA-II to screen for HCC in cirrhotic patients with CHC.
