Purpose:To evaluate survival, tumor response, and treatment toxicity of transarterial ethanol ablation (TEA) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:This prospective study involved 186 patients (146 men and 40 women; median age, 65 y [interquartile range, 57-72.3 y]). Of 186 patients, 146 (78.5%) were hepatitis B virus carriers, 18 (9.7%) were hepatitis C virus carriers, 82 (44.1%) had tumors â‰¥ 5 cm, and 43 (23.1%) had multifocal tumors. Overall survival (OS), complete response (CR) by European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria, time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), and treatment toxicities were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses for prognostic factors of OS were performed.Results:Median OS was 25.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.9-30.5) and varied significantly between Child-Pugh A and B (28.7 mo vs 13.4 mo, P 1 treatments, and CR of all tumors at 6 months. TTP was 9.1 months (95% CI, 6.9-11.3). PFS was 8.4 months (95% CI, 7.1-9.7). CR occurred in 69.1% (159/230) of lesions and 48.9% (88/180) of patients at 6 months. Any one symptom of the postembolization syndrome of grade 2 severity occurred in Conclusions:TEA appears to be safe and effective for local control of HCC.
