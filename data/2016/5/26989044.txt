Background and objectives:To compare the impact of concurrent TACE + sorafenib versus TACE alone on overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). A secondary goal was to determine if sorafenib use increases the interval between courses of TACE.Methods:This study enrolled 150 patients with uHCC from June 2011 to June 2014, including 50 treated with TACE + sorafenib and 100 treated with TACE alone. Factors associated with OS and TTP were identified by univariate and multivariate Cox-regression model analyses. Average TACE interval was defined as TTP/TACE frequency.Results:The median OS (21.7 vs. 11.5 months) and TTP (10.2 vs. 6.7 months) were longer in the TACE + sorafenib group compared to the TACE group. Patients receiving combination therapy had higher survival rate (P Conclusion:Concurrent sorafenib with TACE provides survival benefits over TACE monotherapy, which may be related to a prolonged interval between subsequent TACE courses.
