Patients with primary and secondary liver cancers generally have a poor prognosis with limited potentially curative options. Liver-directed, intra-arterial therapies such as selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) and trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) are taking a larger role in the management of these patients. The current standard of therapy is for delivery of SIRT or TACE particles through an end-hole microcatheter. Antireflux microcatheters (ARM) are a novel class of microcatheters designed to enhance intra-arterial therapies. These catheters are designed with a flexible tip at the end of the microcatheter, which partially collapses during systole and expands during diastole, reducing antegrade and retrograde particle reflux while allowing for forward flow. Initially designed to reduce the risk of particle reflux during SIRT, there is evidence that ARMs may lead to improved particle distribution to tumors during SIRT. Furthermore, ARMs improve embolization efficiency which may lead to improved disease response from TACE for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
