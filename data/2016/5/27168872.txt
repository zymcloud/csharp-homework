Aim:To identify factors that influence long-term liver function following radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with viral hepatitis-related hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:A total of 123 patients with hepatitis B virus- or hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular car-cinoma (HCC) (n = 12 and n = 111, respectively) were enrolled. Cumulative rates of worsening Child-Pugh (CP) scores (defined as a 2-point increase) were examined.Results:CP score worsening was confirmed in 22 patients over a mean follow-up period of 43.8 Â± 26.3 mo. Multivariate analysis identified CP class, platelet count, and aspartate aminotransferase levels as signi-ficant predictors of a worsening CP score (P = 0.000, P = 0.011 and P = 0.024, respectively). In contrast, repeated RFA was not identified as a risk factor for liver function deterioration.Conclusion:Long-term liver function following RFA was dependent on liver functional reserve, the degree of fibrosis present, and the activity of the hepatitis condition for this cohort. Therefore, in order to maintain liver function for an extended period following RFA, suppression of viral hepatitis activity is important even after the treatment of HCC.
