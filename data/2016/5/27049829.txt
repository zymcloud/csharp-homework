Basal cell carcinomas (BCC) of the skin are the most common of human cancers. The noncanonical NF-κB pathway is dependent on IKKα. However, the role of IKKα in BCC has not been elucidated. We show here that IKKα is expressed in the nucleus in BCC and non-malignant diseases. Nuclear IKKα could directly bind to the promoters of inflammation factors and LGR5, a stem cell marker, in turn, upregulating LGR5 expression through activation of STAT3 signaling pathway during cancer progression. Activation of STAT3 signaling pathway contributes LGR5 expression in dependent of IKKα after the interplay between STAT3 and IKKα. Meanwhile knockdown of IKKα inhibits tumor growth and transition of epithelial stage to mescheme stage. Taken together, we demonstrate that IKKα functions as a bone fide chromatin regulator in BCC, whose promoted expression contributes to oncogenic transformation via promoting expression stemness- and inflammatory- related genes. Our finding reveals a novel viewpoint for how IKKα may involve in BCCs tumor progression in the inflammatory microenvironment.
