Background:This study aimed to assess the prognostic impact of preoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) on long-term survival outcomes in patients undergoing resection of small solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Enrolled patients had undergone macroscopic curative resection of solitary 2-5 cm HCC with (n = 105) or without (n = 830; control group) preoperative TACE.Results:TACE group was divided into subgroups A (n = 68, 1-2 TACEs within 12 months), B (n = 23, ≥ 3 TACEs within 12 months), and C (n = 14, TACE prior to 12 months). The number of TACE sessions was 1.8 ± 1.6. In TACE A-C subgroups, pathological response of tumor necrosis >50 % at median post-TACE period after final TACE was observed in 41 (60.3 %) at 1.9 months, 10 (43.5 %) at 2.1 months, and 2 (14.3 %) at 18.9 months, respectively. The 5-year tumor recurrence and patient survival rates were 62.8 and 70.4 % in TACE group and 51.4 and 83.4 % in control group, respectively (p ≤ 0.003). Median periods of postoperative tumor recurrence in TACE A-C subgroups and control group were 35, 13, 14, and 55 months, respectively (p Conclusions:Preoperative TACE for small solitary HCCs may adversely affect post-resection prognosis, irrespective of pathological responses. Preoperative TACE should be avoided for patients with resectable small HCCs.
