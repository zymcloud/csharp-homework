Insecticides and their residues are known to cause several types of ailments in human body. An attempt had been made to assess digitally the geno-toxicity of methyl parathion (MP) and chlorpyrifos (CP) to in vitro-grown HepG2 cell line, with Hoechst 33342 staining, comet, and micronucleus assays. Additionally, "acridine orange/ethidium bromide" (AO/EB) staining was done for the determination of insecticide-induced cytotoxicity, in corollary. Hoechst 33342 staining of cells revealed a decrease in live cell counts at 8-40 mg/L MP and 15-70 mg/L CP. Moreover, nuclear fragmentations in ranges 8 to 40 mg/L MP and 15 to 70 mg/L CP were recorded dependant on individual doses, increasingly with concomitant increases in comet tail length values. DNA fragmentation index measured in comet assays was 94.3 ± 0.57 at 40 mg/L MP and 93.3 ± 2.08 at 70 mg/L CP. Average micronuclei number was 59.0 ± 2.00 at 40 mg/L MP and 62.6 ± 1.52 at 70 mg/L CP, per 1000 cell nuclei, in micronucleus assay. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values with AO/EB staining for monitoring cytotoxicity were 4 and 10 mg/L for MP and CP, respectively. Lethal concentration50 (LC50) values were 20.89 mg/L MP and 79.43 mg/L CP in AO/EB staining, for cytotoxicity with probit analyses. It was concluded that MP was comparatively more geno-toxic than CP to HepG2 cell. It was discernible that at lower levels of each insecticide, geno-toxicity was recorded in comparison to cytotoxicity.
