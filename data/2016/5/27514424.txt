Objective:To investigate the impact of coal workers' pneumoconiosis complicated by the pathological changes in lymph nodes in lung cancer on surgical treatment.Methods:A total of 63 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who received pulmonary lobectomy and systemic mediastinal lymph node dissection were enrolled and divided into the group with coal workers' pneumoconiosis complicated by lung cancer (30 patients) and the non-pneumoconiosis liver cancer group (33 patients). The short-term outcome was compared between the two groups and confirmed by lymph node fibrosis shown by postoperative pathological examination. The predictive value of lymphadenectasis on chest CT was analyzed.Results:Compared with the non-pneumoconiosis liver cancer group, the group with coal workers' pneumoconiosis complicated by lung cancer had significant increases in time of operation, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative extubation time, and length of hospital stay (P<0.05). The patients were divided into groups according to the presence or absence of lymph node fibrosis, and the group with lymph node fibrosis had a significantly longer time of operation and greater intraoperative blood loss than the group without lymph node fibrosis (P<0.05).Conclusion:When coal workers' pneumoconiosis is complicated by lung cancer, severe lymph node fibrosis often causes difficulties in surgery, and thoracotomy may be a safe and effective therapeutic method.
