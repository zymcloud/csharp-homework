Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell immunotherapy represents an effective treatment strategy for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the therapeutic benefits of CIK cell treatment can be influenced by differences in complex immune microenvironment between patients. Herein, we investigated the relationship between PD-L1 expression and survival benefits of CIK cell immunotherapy in HCC patients. This retrospective study included 448 HCC patients: 217 cases underwent hepatectomy alone; 231 cases received hepatectomy and post-operative CIK cell transfusion. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue sections from all patients. Meanwhile, flow cytometry was performed to explore the relationship between PD-L1 expression and localized inflammatory response in HCC microenvironment. We found a significantly improved prognosis in CIK treatment group compared with surgery alone group. In the CIK treatment group, higher PD-L1 expression was observed in patients who exhibited long-term survival benefit. Survival analysis showed patients with â‰¥5% PD-L1 expression had better overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) than patients with 1-5% or
