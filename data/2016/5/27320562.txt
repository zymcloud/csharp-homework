Background:The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of pain management with the use of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) fentanyl with IV parecoxib between patients with healthy liver with patients with diseased liver undergoing major liver resection.Methods:Patients with healthy liver undergoing partial hepatectomy as liver donors for liver transplantation (group 1) and patients with liver cirrhosis (Child's criteria A) undergoing major liver resection for hepatoma (group 2) were identified retrospectively. Both groups routinely received post-operative IV PCA fentanyl and a single dose of parecoxib 40 mg. They were followed up for 3 days or until PCA fentanyl was discontinued post-operatively. Daily Visual Analog Scale, PCA fentanyl usage, rescue attempts, and common drug side effects were collected and analyzed with the use of SPSS version 20.Results:One hundred one patients were included in the study: 54 in group 1, and 47 in group 2. There were no statistical differences between the two groups in terms of the daily and total fentanyl usage, VAS resting, and incidence of itchiness. The rate of rescue analgesia on post-operative day (POD) 1 was lower in group 2, with a value of P = .045. VAS dynamics were better on POD 1 and 2 for group 2, with P = .05 and P = .012, respectively.Conclusions:We found that combining a single dose of IV parecoxib 40 mg with PCA fentanyl is an easy and effective method of acute pain control after major liver resection. We propose the careful usage of post-operative fentanyl and parecoxib in patients with diseased liver, given the difference in effect as compared with healthy liver.
