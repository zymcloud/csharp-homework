Substantial evidence implicates that low-abundance cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for tumor metastasis and recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Side population (SP) cells possess typical CSCs-like features, and are frequently considered as a special subpopulation in which CSCs are enriched and in studies may be considered as a substitute for CSCs. The aim of the present study was to examine the abundance of SP cells in human HCC cell lines with different metastatic potentials and compare their CSC-like, tumorigenic and invasive properties with those of the main population (MP) cells. An experimental system is described for identifying SP cells and analyzing their CSC-like properties. The relative abundance of SP cells correlated directly with the metastatic potential of the HCC cell line: HCCLM3, 16.3±2.2%; MHCC97-H, 8.4±0.7%; MHCC97-L, 4.7±0.5%; and Huh7, 1.0±0.3% (Pin vitro and greater tumorigenicity in mice. Expression levels of all CSC-associated genes tested, except EpCAM and Oct4, were significantly higher in SP cells. The findings revealed that the proportion of SP cells correlates with metastatic potential, and SP cells demonstrated the characteristics expected of CSCs, implicating them in HCC metastasis. Further studies on the identification and characterization of SP cells using clinical HCC specimens will contribute to the understanding of how SP cells are involved in these disease processes.
