The strong invasiveness and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not only the important pathological mechanisms of high recurrence rate and poor long-term outcome, but also the important pathological basis for developing individualized regimens to control metastasis and recurrence in clinical practice. This article introduces the important molecular events in invasion-metastasis cascade discovered in recent years, including the formation mechanism of metastatic niches, methods for molecular pathological evaluation, and standardized pathological diagnosis.
