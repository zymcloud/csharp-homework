Objective:This study aims to evaluate the local efficacy and long-term outcomes of microwave ablation (MWA) for treating large unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).Methods:A total of 82 patients with 5-6 cm unresectable HCCs, who underwent a single MWA procedure during the period of January 2007 to July 2011, were retrospectively enrolled into this study. Percentages of technical success and complications of MWA and HCC local recurrence (LR) after MWA were determined. In addition, prognostic factors were screened and overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were estimated.Results:One-, three- and five-year OS rates in this MWA-treated cohort were 92.7, 63.4 and 41.1%, respectively; and the corresponding RFS rates were 65.9, 31.7 and 23.0%, respectively. Primary technical efficacy was 89.0% after the first round of ablation, three (3.7%) patients developed major complications, and LR rate was 20.7%. Child-Pugh classification (p Conclusions:MWA is safe and effective for the treatment of selected large HCCs, and provides an alternative treatment option for patients with unresectable HCCs. Furthermore, the favourable local efficacy of MWA could potentially improve long-term survival.
