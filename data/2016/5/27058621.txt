Proteasome-mediated degradation of promyelocytic leukemia tumor suppressor (PML) is upregulated in many viral infections and cancers. We previously showed that PML knockdown promotes early-onset hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg)-transgenic mice. Here we report the effects of PML restoration on late-onset HBsAg-induced HCC. We compared protein expression patterns, genetic mutations and the effects of pharmacologically targeting PML in wild-type, PML-/-, PML+/+HBsAgtg/o and PML-/-HBsAgtg/o mice. PML-/- mice exhibited somatic mutations in DNA repair genes and developed severe steatosis and proliferative disorders, but not HCC. PML-/-HBsAgtg/o mice exhibited early mutations in cancer driver genes and developed hyperplasia, fatty livers and indolent adipose-like HCC. In PML+/+HBsAg-transgenic mice, HBsAg expression declined over time, and HBsAg-associated PML suppression was concomitantly relieved. Nevertheless, these mice accumulated mutations in genes contributing to oxidative stress pathways and developed aggressive late-onset angiogenic trabecular HCC. PML inhibition using non-toxic doses of arsenic trioxide selectively killed long-term HBsAg-affected liver cells in PML+/+HBsAgtg/o mice with falling HBsAg and rising PML levels, but not normal liver cells or early-onset HCC cells in PML-/-HBsAgtg/0 mice. These findings suggest dual roles for PML as a tumor-suppressor lost in early-onset HBsAg-induced hepatocarcinogenesis and as an oncogenic promoter in late-onset HBsAg-related HCC progression.
