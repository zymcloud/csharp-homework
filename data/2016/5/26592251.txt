Betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) catalyzes the synthesis of methionine using betaine and homocysteine (Hcy), which is restricted to the liver and kidney. Impaired BHMT pathway has been associated with hepatocellular carcinogenesis in Bhmt-/- mice model, and decreased BHMT was observed in a small sample of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. However, the prognostic significance of BHMT in HCC has not been elucidated. This study aimed to examine the expression of BHMT in HCC and investigate the relationship between its expression and prognosis of HCC patients. BHMT expression was analyzed in 68 paired HCC samples (HCC tissues vs matched adjacent non-cancerous liver tissues), 115 paraffin-embedded HCC sections (primary cohort), and 65 paraffin-embedded HCC sections (validation cohort) using immunohistochemistry (IHC). The results of IHC analysis showed that BHMT was decreased in tumorous tissues in 85.2 % (58/68) of cases compared to the corresponding adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues. Further correlation analyses indicated that the decreased BHMT expression was closely correlated with serum Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) (p = 0.011), tumor size (p = 0.039), and vascular invasion (p = 0.017). Moreover, HCC patients with low BHMT expression had shorter overall survival (OS) and time to recurrence (TTR) than those with high BHMT expression in both primary cohort (p
