Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling networks by terminating signals produced by active Gα subunits. RGS17, a member of the RZ subfamily of RGS proteins, is typically only expressed in appreciable amounts in the human central nervous system, but previous works have shown that RGS17 expression is selectively upregulated in a number of malignancies, including lung, breast, prostate, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, this upregulation of RGS17 is associated with a more aggressive cancer phenotype, as increased proliferation, migration, and invasion are observed. Conversely, decreased RGS17 expression diminishes the response of ovarian cancer cells to agents commonly used during chemotherapy. These somewhat contradictory roles of RGS17 in cancer highlight the need for selective, high-affinity inhibitors of RGS17 to use as chemical probes to further the understanding of RGS17 biology. Based on current evidence, these compounds could potentially have clinical utility as novel chemotherapeutics in the treatment of lung, prostate, breast, and liver cancers. Recent advances in screening technologies to identify potential inhibitors coupled with increasing knowledge of the structural requirements of RGS-Gα protein-protein interaction inhibitors make the future of drug discovery efforts targeting RGS17 promising. This review highlights recent findings related to RGS17 as both a canonical and atypical RGS protein, its role in various human disease states, and offers insights on small molecule inhibition of RGS17.
