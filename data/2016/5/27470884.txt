Many advances have been achieved in the clinical and basic studies on metastasis and recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) over the past 20 years. The achievements mainly include the following aspects: (1) a group of molecules related to metastasis and recurrence including osteopontin have been identified, and multi-molecular predictive models for metastasis have been established and optimized; (2) it has been found that the imbalance of immune response in tumor microenvironment is important in promoting metastasis and can be used to predict metastasis and recurrence; (3) it has been found and confirmed that interferon can prevent postoperative recurrence, and patients with a lower miR-26a expression level can achieve greater benefits; (4) the breakthroughs in liquid biopsy and immunotherapy bring a promising future for the prediction, prevention, and treatment of HCC metastasis and recurrence. However, these predictive models still need to be validated by multi-center studies, and the effects of adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization and targeted therapy with sorafenib still need further evaluation.
