Background:Safety of non-operative management for low-risk branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs) is debated.Aim:To perform a systematic review/meta-analysis to determine their risk of developing pancreatic malignancy and of pancreatic malignancy-related deaths.Methods:A MEDLINE search was performed and methodology was based on PRISMA statement. Incidence rates of overall pancreatic malignancy, malignant BD-IPMN, IPMN-distinct PDAC, and of pancreatic malignancy-related death rates were calculated by dividing the total number of events by the total number of person-years (pyrs) of follow-up. Heterogeneity was determined by I(2) statistic.Results:20 studies including 2177 patients were included. Mean follow-up ranged from 29.3 to 76.7 months. Overall, 82 patients (3.7%) developed a pancreatic malignancy with a pooled estimate rate of 0.007/pyrs (I(2)=32.8%). The pooled estimate rate of malignant IPMN was 0.004/pyrs (I(2)=40.8%), and the pooled estimate rate of distinct PDAC 0.002/pyrs (I(2)=0%). The rate of death due to pancreatic malignancy during follow-up was 0.9%, with an overall pooled estimate rate of death of 0.002/pyrs (I(2)=0%).Conclusion:Non-operative management of low-risk BD-IPMN is safe, with a very low risk of malignant transformation of IPMN and of distinct PDAC. The rate of pancreatic malignancy-related mortality is low, particularly when compared with the mortality of pancreatic surgery.
