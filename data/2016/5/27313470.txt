Background:This meta-analysis aimed to assess available evidence on possible associations of interleukin-28B polymorphisms rs8099917 and rs12979860 with development of hepatitis virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were systematically searched to identify relevant studies. Meta-analyses were performed to examine the association of interleukin-28B rs8099917 G/T and rs12979860 T/C polymorphisms with development of hepatitis virus-related HCC. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.Results:A total of ten studies involving 2,529 cases and 2,412 controls were included. The G-allele and GT genotype of rs8099917 were significantly associated with increased risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC (allelic model, OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.13-1.96, P=0.005; heterozygous model, OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.04-1.88, P=0.03). Conversely, the TT genotype was found to be significantly associated with lower risk of HBV-related HCC (dominant model, OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51-0.91, P=0.01). Similar results were observed in the subgroup of Chinese patients and controls. In the pooled data set, the T-allele and TT genotype of rs12979860 showed a significant association with increased HCC risk (allelic model, OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.05-1.78, P=0.02; recessive model, OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.28-2.39, P=0.005; homozygous model, OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.41-2.80, PConclusion:The G-allele of rs8099917 may confer elevated risk of HBV-related HCC, while the wild-type TT genotype may protect against the disease. The T-allele of rs12979860 may increase the risk of HCC, in Caucasians, especially hepatitis C virus-related HCC. The TT genotype of rs12979860 may confer increased risk of HBV-related HCC, especially in Asians. These conclusions should be verified in large, well-designed studies.
