Recent studies indicate that a high level of nesfatin-1/Nucleobindin-2 (NUCB-2) is associated with poor outcome and promotes cell migration in breast cancer and prostate cancer. However, the role of NUCB2 is not well known in colon cancer. In this study, NUCB-2 level in colon cancer tissue was higher than that in non-tumor tissue. Suppression of NUCB-2 in a colon cancer cell line SW620 inhibited migration and invasion. The microarray analysis showed that low expression level of transcription factor ZEB1 in NUCB-2 knockdowned SW620 cells. In addition, expression level of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related molecules including N-cadherin, E-cadherin, Î²-catenin, Slug and Twist was affected by NUCB-2 suppression and ZEB1-denepdent pathway. The signaling pathway liver kinase B1(LKB1)/AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK)/target of rapamycin complex (TORC) 1 was involved in regulation of NUCB-2-mediated metastasis and EMT properties. Suppression of NUCB-2 inhibited tumor nodules formation in a murine colon tumor model as well. In summary, nesfatin-1/NUCB-2 enhanced migration, invasion and EMT in colon cancer cells through LKB1/AMPK/TORC1/ZEB1 pathways in vitro and in vivo.
