Hydralazine (HYD), an old routine clinical anti-hypertension drug, is rarely used in clinic nowadays. Since the strategy of repositioning old drugs was put forward, HYD has been reported to possess various biological activities, including antitumor efficacy and reducing intra-tumor microvessel. Here, we investigated that whether HYD had the ability of anti-angiogeneis and its underlying mechanism. Cells proliferation, wound-healing, Transwell migration and invasion, tube formation and rat aortic ring assays in vitro and chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model in vivo were designed to investigated HYD's anti-angiogenic effect. Levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were assessed by enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mice model was used to evaluate HYD's effect on tumor growth and microvessel density. Our results showed that HYD not only inhibited human umbilical vascular endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation, wound-healing, Transwell migration and invasion and tube formation, but also suppressed the microvessel outgrowth of rat aortic ring in vitro and the neovascularzation of CAM in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HYD attenuated tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. In the co-culture system of Transwell migration, the secretion of VEGF and bFGF was reduced by HYD respectively. In sum, our data indicate that HYD has the pharmacological effect of ant-angiogenesis by interference with VEGF and bFGF signaling pathways in endothelial cells. These findings suggest that HYD might be a promising angiogenesis inhibitor and a potential effective therapeutic agent for cancer therapy.
