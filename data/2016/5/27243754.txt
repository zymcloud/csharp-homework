Alu and LINE-1 elements are retrotransposons with a ubiquitous presence in the human genome that can cause genomic instability, specifically relating to telomere length. Genotoxic agents may induce methylation of retrotransposons, in addition to oxidative DNA damage in the form of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). Methylation of retrotransposons induced by these agents may contribute to biliary atresia (BA) etiology. Here, we investigated correlations between global methylation, 8-OHdG, and relative telomere length, as well as reporting on Alu and LINE-1 hypomethylation in BA patients. Alu and LINE-1 hypomethylation were found to be associated with elevated risk of BA (OR = 4.07; 95% CI: 2.27-7.32; P < 0.0001 and OR = 3.51; 95% CI: 1.87-6.59; P < 0.0001, respectively). Furthermore, LINE-1 methylation was associated with liver stiffness in BA patients (Î² coefficient = -0.17; 95% CI: -0.24 to -0.10; P < 0.0001). Stratified analysis revealed negative correlations between Alu and LINE-1 methylation and 8-OHdG in BA patients (P < 0.0001). In contrast, positive relationships were identified between Alu and LINE-1 methylation and relative telomere length in BA patients (P < 0.0001). These findings suggest that retrotransposon hypomethylation is associated with plasma 8-OHdG and telomere length in BA patients.
