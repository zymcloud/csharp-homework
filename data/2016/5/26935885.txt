Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) that are activated by human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells secrete a variety of cytokines, which are the main component of the HCC microenvironment. We aimed to determine whether 8-bromo-7-methoxychrysin (BrMC) could interfere in cross-talk of the human hepatic stellate cell line LX-2 and liver cancer stem-like cells (LCSLCs) to inhibit the characteristics of LCSLCs endowed with the capacity of sustaining human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) self-renewal and progression, and to identify its potential mechanism of action. We found that the levels of fibroblast activation protein (FAP) were augmented in LX-2 cells treated with the conditioned medium of LCSLCs (LCSLC-CM) compared to those cultured with routine medium, indicating that the LCSLC-CM can activate LX-2 cells to become liver cancer-associated stellate cells (LCAHSCs). Furthermore, sphere forming capability of SMMC-7721 cells was enhanced and stem cell-related protein expression was significantly increased following treatment with the conditioned medium of LCAHSCs (LCAHSC-CM). Moreover, the level of p-STAT3 was increased in LX-2 cells treated with LCSLC-CM and BrMC reduced expression of p-STAT3. Combination of BrMC and the selective inhibitor of STAT3 cucurbitacin I (JSI-124) synergistically suppressed the LCSLC characteristics in SMMC-7721 cells. Collectively, our data showed that BrMC inhibited the interaction between LX-2 cells and HCC-derived CSCs, and did so potentially through modulation of the STAT3 pathway. Future therapeutic strategies employing anti-CSC therapy should confirm the potential of cucurbitacin I (JSI-124) and BrMC as potent therapeutic agents.
