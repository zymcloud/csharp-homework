The role of metastasectomy on survival in advanced/urologic malignancies still remains unclear. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common solid tumor within the kidney. 25-30 % of patients have metastases at manifestation. Urothelial carcinoma (UC) consists of bladder carcinoma, upper urinary tract urothelial cell carcinoma and urethral carcinoma. Bladder cancer is the ninth most common cancer worldwide. Half of patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer have lymph node or distant metastases. In metastatic disease first-line treatment is multi-agent platinum-based systemic chemotherapy. Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men between the age of 15 and 35. Testicular tumors represent excellent oncologic outcomes. Prostate cancer is the most common solid tumor in Europe. Surgical resection of metastases can be considered as a treatment choice in advanced/metastatic urologic malignancies to improve survival rates, particularly in RCC and UC. Metastasectomy can be suggested in conjunction with effective chemotherapy if complete resection is possible. Solitary metastasectomy can represent better survival rates compared to multiple metastasectomy even if multiple metastases confined to single organ. Site of metastases is one of the main determinants of successful metastasectomy such as lung metastasectomy in urothelial cell carcinoma and liver metastasectomy in RCC may lead to better oncologic outcomes. Due to the lack of the relevant data it is not possible to make an evidence-based recommendation on the role of metastasectomy for solitary-/organ-confined metastases of prostate cancer, testicular cancer and penile cancer.
