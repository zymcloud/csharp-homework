The ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of proteins controls signaling and cellular survival. In this study, we found that ubiquitin associated protein 2 (UBAP2) was significantly downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, higher expression of UBAP2 in cancer tissues was correlated with good prognosis in HCC patients. Knockdown of UBAP2 significantly enhanced the invasion and proliferation of HCC cells in vitro and promoted tumor growth in vivo, while enforced expression of UBAP2 impaired the aggressive ability and tumor growth of HCC cells. Mechanistically, UBAP2 formed a complex with Annexin A2 and promoted the degradation of Annexin A2 protein by ubiquitination, and then inhibited HCC progression. Collectively, UBAP2 appears as a novel marker for predicting prognosis and a therapeutic target for HCC.
