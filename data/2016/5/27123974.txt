Background and aims:Eradicating chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection improves liver fibrosis and reduces hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence in chronic HCV patients. We evaluated the relationship between fibrosis regression, as assessed by sequential biopsies, and clinical factors of patients with sustained virological response (SVR).Methods:We retrospectively enrolled 130 patients (74 men; 60.1 ± 8.1 years) with chronic HCV treated with interferon and ribavirin therapy who achieved SVR. To evaluate the change in fibrosis stage over time, all patients underwent a pre-therapy initial biopsy and a second biopsy after achieving SVR.Results:The mean time between biopsies was 5.5 ± 1.2 years. Fibrosis stage regressed in 55 patients (42.3%), remained stable in 69 (53.1%), and progressed in 6 (4.6%). The mean fibrosis stage significantly decreased, from 2.01 ± 0.99 units to 1.61 ± 1.24 units (P Conclusions:Lower post-treatment AFP levels and HCV genotype 2 significantly correlated with liver fibrosis regression after SVR.
