microRNAs (miRNAs) were known as transcriptional regulators to regulate the repertoires of target genes during the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we investigated the roles of miR-4262 in the process of HCC. Our results showed that miR-4262 is overexpressed in HCC tissues and hepatoma cell lines (HepG2 and Sk-hep-1). We also found that miR-4262 enhanced the process of cell cycle and inhibited the apoptosis leading to promoted cell proliferation and activity. Moreover, the 3'UTR of PDCD4 was complementary to miR-4262 seed region and we confirmed that PDCD4 is the direct target of miR-4262 with 3'UTR luciferase assay. qPCR and WB analysis revealed that the level of PDCD4 was negatively correlated with the expression of miR-4262 in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that miR-4262-promoted cell proliferation was mediated by PDCD4 and miR-4262 can activate the NF-κB pathway to promote the accumulation of nuclear NF-κB/P65. All of these findings suggested miR-4262 may play a role in the development of HCC.
