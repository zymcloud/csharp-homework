Objectives:In the present study, our aim was to investigate the possible protective effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced hepatotoxicity by using Hep3B human hepatoma cells. Specifically, the study examines the role of some proinflammatory markers and oxidative damage as possible mechanisms of LPS-associated cytotoxicity. Consequently, the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Hep3B was chosen as a model for investigation of LPS toxicity and the effect of EGCG on LPS-exposed cells.Materials and methods:The Hep3B human hepatoma cells were used for this study. The cytotoxic effects of chemicals (EGCG and LPS), AST and ALT levels, SOD and CAT activities, GSH-Px level and TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels were detected by using different biochemical and molecular methods. LPS and EGCG were applied to cells at various times and doses.Results:The highest treatment dose of EGCG (400 µM) led to a dramatic decrease in SOD level and increase in CAT and GSH levels. Additionally, the highest dose of EGCG also led to a dramatic increase in TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels. On the other hand, effective doses of EGCG (200 and 100 µM) normalized all related parameters levels.Conclusion:LPS caused hepatotoxicity, but interestingly, a high dose of EGCG was found to be a cytotoxic agent in this study. However, other two doses of EGCG led to a decrease in both inflammatory cytokine levels and antioxidant enzyme levels. Further studies should examine the effect of EGCG on secondary cellular signaling pathways.
