Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) could induce extensive and rapid future liver remnant hypertrophy. However, the morbidity for ALPPS is very high. This paper reports a modified ALPPS (associating microwave ablation and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy, AMAPS), which was successfully applied in the treatment of huge hepatocellular carcinoma with cirrhosis, and the procedure of operation was greatly simplified. Hence, AMAPS is feasible and safe in selected patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis.
