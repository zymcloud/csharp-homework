Objective:To investigate the impact of intraoperative blood transfusion on the long-term outcomes of liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma.Method:Adult patients who had non-salvage liver transplantation at our centre between January 2005 and December 2012 for hepatocellular carcinomas that were within the University of California, San Francisco criteria and could not be resected or ablated were divided into groups with and without intraoperative blood transfusion. Comparisons were made between groups.Results:Ninety-nine patients were included in the study. Sixty-two (62.6%) patients received intraoperative blood transfusion. Patients without transfusion were younger (54 versus 56 years; P = 0.04) and had a lower Model for End-stage Liver Disease score (11 versus 14; P Conclusion:Intraoperative blood transfusion was shown to have no significant impact on the long-term outcomes of liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma, whereas postoperative complications of grade IIIA or above were associated with worse recipient survival.
