To improve the poor water solubility of sorafenib and to monitor its distribution and the early feedback effects on its in vivo treatment efficacy in a precise manner, sorafenib (SF) and gadolinium (Gd) co-loaded liposomes (SF/Gd-liposomes) were prepared. The simultaneous imaging and therapy efficacies of the SF/Gd-liposomes were tested. The solubility of SF in SF/Gd-liposomes was significantly increased from 0.21 μg/mL to 250 μg/mL. The imaging capability of SF/Gd-liposomes were tested by in-vitro and the in-vivo imaging ability tests and the results confirmed that SF/Gd-liposomes could be served as an effective contrast agent. The design of SF/Gd-liposomes allowed the MRI-guided in vivo visualization of the delivery and biodistribution of liposome. In the in vivo antitumor studies, SF/Gd-liposomes had better antitumor effects in H22 tumor-bearing mice than SF solution (oral or i.v. administration) (P
