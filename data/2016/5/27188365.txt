Objective:To analyze the morbidity and mortality of malignant tumor in Zhejiang province in 2014.Methods:The data were collected from Zhejiang provincial chronic disease surveillance system in 2014. The crude rate, age-standardized rate, cumulative rate(0-74 years old), cut rate(35-64 years old), age-specific and area-specific morbidity/mortality as well as the constitution of top 10 leading cancers were then calculated and analyzed. The age-standardized rate was calculated according to the standard population in China in 1982 and the Segi' s world standard population.Results:The crude morbidity was 348.80/100 000(370.74/100 000 in males and 326.51/100 000 in females). The age-standardized morbidity according to the standard population in China and according to world standard population were 168.84/100 000 and 217.23/100 000 respectively, the cumulative morbidity was 24.66% and the cut morbidity was 376.40/100 000. Age-specific morbidity in age group 0-34 years remained low; however, the morbidity increased obviously in age group ≥35 years, increased more rapidly in age group ≥50 years and finally reached the peak in age group 80-84 years(1 618.20/100 000). The morbidity of malignant tumor, age-standardized morbidity(China standard)and age-standardized morbidity(world standard)were 381.81/100 000, 185.15/100 000 and 236.27/100 000 respectively in urban area, and 330.23/100 000 , 159.47/100 000 and 206.29/100 000, respectively in rural area. The crude mortality was 189.08/100 000(248.57/100 000 in males, 128.72/100 000 in females), and the age-standardized mortality according to China population and world population were 97.56/100 000 and 135.54/100 000 respectively. The cumulative mortality was 15.08%, and the cut mortality was 162.75/100 000. Age-specific mortality increased in age group 45-49 years(92.29/1000 000)and reached the peak in age group ≥85 years(2 263.70/100 000). The mortality was higher in rural area(190.60/100 000)than in urban area(186.38/100 000). The leading cancers were lung cancer, colorectum cancer, thyroid cancer, stomach cancer and liver cancer, accounting for 58.64% of the total. Lung cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer, colorectum cancer and esophagus cancer were the major cancers causing deaths, accounting for 70.72% of all the total.Conclusion:The leading cancers were lung cancer, colorectum cancer, thyroid cancer, stomach cancer and liver cancer in Zhejiang in 2014, close attention should be paid to thyroid cancer in women. The disease burden of malignant tumor is increasing,it is necessary for health department to take effective measures to reduce the disease burden caused by malignant tumor.
