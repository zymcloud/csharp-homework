Objective:To investigate the effects of microRNA-379-5p (miR-379-5p) on proliferation, migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.Methods:Human HCC cell line HepG2 was infected with lentivirus carrying miR-379-5p (miR-379-5p group) or lentivirus carrying negative control sequences (negative control group). The untreated HepG2 cells represented blank control group. Cell proliferation was determined by 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assays. Cell migration and invasion were assessed by Transwell assays. The mRNA and protein expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively.Results:Compared with negative control group and blank control group, cell migration and invasion was significantly inhibited in miR-379-5p group (P0.05). Furthermore, the mRNA and protein levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in miR-379-5p group were significantly lower than that in negative control group and blank control group (PConclusion:miR-379-5p can suppress migration and invasion of HCC cell lines, which may be achieved by inhibiting MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions.
