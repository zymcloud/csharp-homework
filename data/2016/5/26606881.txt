Background:Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) has emerged as an additional tool to increase the size of the future liver remnant (FLR) in the settings of advanced tumor burden in the liver. Initial reports have indicated high feasibility but also high mortality and morbidity. The aim of this study was to assess the initial experience with ALPPS in Scandinavia regarding feasibility, morbidity, and mortality.Materials and methods:We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent ALPPS since its introduction at 3 Scandinavian hepatobiliary centers.Results:Thirty-six patients were identified, 21 male and 15 female. Median age was 67 years (22-83). Colorectal liver metastases (n = 25) were the most common indication for ALPPS followed by hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 4), cholangiocarcinoma (n = 4), and other (n = 3). Median growth of the FLR between the operations was 67% (-17 to 238) in 6 (5-13) days. All patients completed the second operation, and 71% of the resections were R0. Although the total percentage of patients with complication(s) was 92%, only 4 patients (11%) had a grade 3b complication according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, and no other severe complications were noted. There was no in-hospital mortality, but 1 (2.8%) patient died within 90 days of operation.Conclusion:ALPPS is a highly feasible method to stimulate FLR growth in patients with colorectal liver metastases as well as primary hepatobiliary malignancies. The treatment can be carried out with relative safety.
