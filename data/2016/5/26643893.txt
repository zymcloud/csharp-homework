Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CD14 and its soluble form sCD14 play important roles in immunity and are involved in the translocation of bacteria and their products which is related to the pathogenesis in chronic HBV infection. This study investigated serum sCD14 levels in HBV chronically infected patients with various clinical diseases. Serum sCD14 levels in HBV patients were significantly elevated compared with those of healthy controls. HCC patients had significantly highest levels of serum sCD14 across all the HBV-related diseases. Serum sCD14 levels significantly discriminated HCC from other HBV-related non-HCC diseases. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of sCD14 levels for HCC was significantly higher in comparison with other HBV-related non-HCC diseases. The AUC of sCD14 for HCC (0.868, 95 % CI 0.791-0.946, P 20 ng/mL being significantly related to poorer OS (P = 0.017). Multivariate regression showed that serum sCD14 level was an independent factor associated with the OS rates of HBV-related HCC patients (HR 2.544, 95 % CI 1.169-5.538, P = 0.019). HCC resection resulted in a significant decrease of sCD14 levels (P
