Purpose:To investigate whether dynamic contrast -enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) can distinguish the type of liver nodules in a rat model with N-nitrosodiethylamine- induced cirrhosis.Methods:Liver nodules in cirrhosis were induced in 60 male Wistar rats via 0.01 % N-nitrosodiethylamine in the drinking water for 35-100 days. The nodules were divided into three groups: regenerative nodule (RN), dysplastic nodule (DN), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). DCE-MRI was performed, and parameters including transfer constant (Ktrans), rate constant (Kep), extravascular extracellular space volume fraction (Ve), and initial area under the contrast concentration versus time curve (iAUC) were measured and compared.Results:The highest Ktrans and iAUC values were seen in HCC, followed by DN and RN (all P < 0.05). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for DN and HCC were 0.738 and 0.728 for Ktrans and iAUC, respectively. The AUROC for HCC were 0.850 and 0.840 for Ktrans and iAUC, respectively. Ordinal logistic regression analysis showed that Ktrans had a high goodness of fit (0.970, 95 % confidence interval, 13.751-24.958).Conclusion:DCE-MRI is a promising method to differentiate of liver nodules. Elevated Ktrans suggested that the nodules may be transformed into HCC.Key points:• DCE-MRI is promising for differentiating among RN, DN, and HCC • K trans and iAUC positively correlated with malignancy degree of liver nodules • Elevated K trans suggests that the nodules may be transformed into HCC.
