Objectives:Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is an uncommon cause of chronic liver disease in children. The literature on the management of pediatric BCS is scarce. Our aim was to determine the long-term outcome of patients undergoing a radiological intervention for the treatment of BCS.Methods:Thirty-two children diagnosed with BCS between 2004 and 2014 were included. Data on the course of disease, medical management, response, and complications related to radiological interventions and outcome were collected.Main results:Twenty-five patients who were on regular follow-up were analyzed. The median age of the patients at presentation was 9 months (4.5-214). Sixteen patients initially received anticoagulation alone. This was associated with a high failure rate of 66%. Twenty patients underwent a radiological intervention in the form of angioplasty (n=7), hepatic vein stenting (n=3) or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) (n=14). Success with angioplasty was achieved in 43% of cases. Hepatic vein stenting was successful in 66%, whereas TIPS was successful in 72% of cases. TIPS was feasible in all patients. The median follow-up duration was 44 months (5-132). Four patients developed hepatopulmonary syndrome after a median period of 3 years (1.5-5.25) and one patient developed hepatocellular carcinoma.Conclusion:BCS commonly presents during infancy. Anticoagulation alone and angioplasty of the hepatic veins are associated with a high failure rate. Hepatic vein stenting or TIPS is feasible and efficacious in improving liver function, portal hypertension, and growth. It is associated with good long-term outcome and delays the need for liver transplantation, but may not prevent complications such as hepatopulmonary syndrome and hepatocellular carcinoma.
