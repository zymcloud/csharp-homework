Background:FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab is a valid option as upfront treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. While several trials investigated the effect of combining bevacizumab with different chemotherapy regimens, including fluoropyrimidines monotherapy and oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-containing doublets, no randomized comparison assessing the impact of the addition of bevacizumab to FOLFOXIRI is available.Patients and methods:A total of 122 mCRC patients received first-line FOLFOXIRI in the phase III trial by the GONO (FOLFOXIRI group) and 252 patients received first-line FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab in the TRIBE trial (FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab group). A propensity score-adjusted method was adopted to provide an estimation of the benefit from the addition of bevacizumab to FOLFOXIRI in terms of survival and activity parameters.Results:Patients in the FOLFOXIRI group had more frequently Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of one or two, high KÃ¶hne score, metachronous and liver-limited disease, had previously received adjuvant treatments and had their primary tumors resected. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 12.3 months in the FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab group compared with 10.0 months in the FOLFOXIRI group {propensity score-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.74 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59-0.94], P = 0.013}. This association was significant also in the multivariable model (P = 0.024). The median OS was 29.8 months in the FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab group compared with 23.6 months in the FOLFOXIRI group [propensity score-adjusted HR: 0.72 (95% CI 0.56-0.93), P = 0.014]. At the multivariable model, the addition of bevacizumab was still associated with significantly longer OS (P = 0.030). No significant differences in RECIST response rate (RR) [65.1% versus 55.7%; propensity score-adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.29 (95% CI 0.81-2.05), P = 0.280], early RR [62.7% versus 57.8%; OR: 1.14 (95% CI 0.68-1.93), P = 0.619] and median depth of response (42.2% versus 53.8%, P = 0.259) were reported.Conclusions:Though in the absence of a randomized comparison, the addition of bevacizumab to FOLFOXIRI provides significant benefit in PFS and OS, thus supporting the use of FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab as upfront treatment for mCRC patients.Trials numbers:NCT01219920 and NCT00719797.
