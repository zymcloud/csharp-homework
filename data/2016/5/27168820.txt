Many studies have found the function of nitric oxide (NO) in cancer as a pro-neoplastic vs. an anti-neoplastic effector, but the role of NO in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of nitric oxide (NO) on the biological behavior of the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. HepG2 cell was cultured in vitro and treated with or without sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO donor. Subsequently, we evaluated the effects of NO in cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration and invasion by MTT assay, flow cytometry, wound healing assay and Matrigel invasion assay. We demonstrate that NO significantly inhibited HepG2 cell proliferation by inducing G0/G1 phase arrest in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, compared to the control group, cells treated with SNP showed obviously higher apoptosis ratios in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we revealed that NO effectively inhibited the ability of migration and invasion of HepG2 cells. Taken together, our results suggested that NO has an important role in the regulation of biological behavior in HepG2 cells and the potential for use in the prevention and treatment of HCC.
