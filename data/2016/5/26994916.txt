Purpose:We have reported that short-term and middle-term clinical outcomes including prognosis after laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG) are excellent in cT1 gastric cancer.Methods:In this study, long-term prognosis was finally confirmed in detail in 491 cT1 gastric cancer patients who underwent LAG between 1998 and 2010, where clinical course was completely pursued for recurrent cases.Results:Among the 491 cases, follow-up examination at 5 years (60 months) after operation was done in 423 (86.2 %). Recurrent cases were seen in nine cases (1.8 %) who inevitably died despite aggressive multimodality treatments. The initial recurrent sites were the peritoneum in three, the liver in two, the bone in one, the ovary in one, the liver/bone in one, and the Virchow lymph node/bone in one. As a result, the 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) was 98.3 %. cT1 gastric cancer was finally diagnosed as pathological stages IA to III, and the 5-year DSS was 99.7 % in pathological stage IA, 96.9 % in pathological stage IB, and 81 % in pathological stage II/III. The initial recurrent sites were the liver/bone in stage IA (M/N0), the liver in stage IB (MP/N0), the liver in stage IIA (MP/N1), the liver and the ovary in two stages IIB (T1N3), 3 peritoneum and 1 Virchow lymph node/bone in four stage III cases. Importantly, there were no initial recurrences in the regional lymph node, and all recurrences were seen within 5 years after operation.Conclusions:Although long-term prognostic outcome was extremely good in cT1 gastric cancer patients who underwent LAG, cases with recurrence inevitably died due to disease progression.
