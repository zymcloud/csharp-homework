Background & aims:Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality, with no Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy. Chronic alcohol consumption causes a pro-oxidant environment and increases hepatic lipid peroxidation, with acrolein being the most reactive/toxic by-product. This study investigated the pathogenic role of acrolein in hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, steatosis, and injury in experimental ALD, and tested acrolein elimination/scavenging (using hydralazine) as a potential therapy in ALD.Methods:In vitro (rat hepatoma H4IIEC cells) and in vivo (chronic+binge alcohol feeding in C57Bl/6 mice) models were used to examine alcohol-induced acrolein accumulation and consequent hepatic ER stress, apoptosis, and injury. In addition, the potential protective effects of the acrolein scavenger, hydralazine, were examined both in vitro and in vivo.Results:Alcohol consumption/metabolism resulted in hepatic accumulation of acrolein-protein adducts, by up-regulation of cytochrome P4502E1 and alcohol dehydrogenase, and down-regulation of glutathione-s-transferase-P, which metabolizes/detoxifies acrolein. Alcohol-induced acrolein adduct accumulation led to hepatic ER stress, proapoptotic signaling, steatosis, apoptosis, and liver injury; however, ER-protective/adaptive responses were not induced. Notably, direct exposure to acrolein in vitro mimicked the in vivo effects of alcohol, indicating that acrolein mediates the adverse effects of alcohol. Importantly, hydralazine, a known acrolein scavenger, protected against alcohol-induced ER stress and liver injury, both in vitro and in mice.Conclusions:Our study shows the following: (1) alcohol consumption triggers pathologic ER stress without ER adaptation/protection; (2) alcohol-induced acrolein is a potential therapeutic target and pathogenic mediator of hepatic ER stress, cell death, and injury; and (3) removal/clearance of acrolein by scavengers may have therapeutic potential in ALD.
