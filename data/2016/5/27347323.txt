Accumulating evidence suggests that miR-138 expression was frequently downregulated in different cancer types and involves in the progression of tumorigenesis. However, the biological role and molecular mechanism of miR-138 involvement in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) still remains largely unknown. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the role of miR-138 in the progression of HCC. We found that miR-138 expression levels were significantly downregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines compared with the corresponding noncancerous liver tissues and normal hepatic cell line. In addition, we also found that enforced expression of miR-138 inhibited proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion in HCC cells. Using a luciferase reporter assay, SOX9 was confirmed as a direct target of miR-138. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot assay showed that overexpression of miR-138 in HCC cells significantly inhibited SOX9 expression on mRNA level and protein level. Furthermore, SOX9 expression was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, and its mRNA expression is negative correlated with miR-138 expression in clinical HCC tissues (r=-0.689, P
