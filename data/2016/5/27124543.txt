Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold promise as cellular vehicles for the delivery of therapeutic gene products because they can be isolated, expanded, and genetically modified in vitro and possess tumor-oriented homing capacity in vivo. (1) Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) is a dominant transcriptional regulator of hepatocyte differentiation and hepatocellular carcinogenesis (HCC). (2,3) We have previously demonstrated that overexpression of HNF4α activates various hepatic-specific genes and enhances MSC differentiation. (4) However, the extent that overexpression of HNF4α in MSCs influences HCC progression has yet to be examined. Here we sought to investigate what effect MSCs overexpressing HNF4α (MSC-HNF4α) have on human hepatoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Conditioned medium collected from in vitro MSC-HNF4α cultures significantly inhibited hepatoma cell growth and metastasis compared with controls. Additionally, nude mice administered MSC-HNF4α exhibited significantly smaller tumors compared with controls in vivo. Immunoblot analysis of HCC cells treated with MSC-HNF4α displayed downregulated β-catenin, cyclinD1, c-Myc, MMP2 and MMP9. Taken together, our results demonstrate that MSC-HNF4α inhibits HCC progression by reducing hepatoma cell growth and metastasis through downregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
