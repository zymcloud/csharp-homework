Purpose:To prospectively evaluate the efficacy of a new three-dimensional gradient-echo sequence (Turbo LAVA) that uses undersampled k-space acquisition combined with a two-dimensional parallel imaging technique for hepatobiliary MRI.Materials and methods:Sixty patients underwent T1-weighted gadoxetic acid-enhanced hepatobiliary axial MRI during a single breath-hold using both Turbo LAVA (thickness/interval=1.6/0.8mm) and conventional three-dimensional gradient-echo (4/2mm; LAVA) sequences at 3T. Axial 4-mm-thick reformation was performed from Turbo LAVA images. Portal vein-to-liver contrast (PLC), bile duct-to-liver contrast (BLC), and lesion-to-liver contrast (LLC) were compared. Two radiologists independently assessed image quality using a five-point scale. Sagittal 4-mm-thick multiplanar reconstructions (MPR) were performed from both sequences and assessed together with directly obtained 4-mm-thick sagittal LAVA images in terms of sharpness. The paired t-test was used to compare PLC, BLC, and LLC. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare five-point scales.Results:The mean PLC (PConclusion:High-spatial-resolution single-breath-hold hepatobiliary MRI using Turbo LAVA was feasible. Diagnostic-quality MPR images can be obtained using this sequence.
