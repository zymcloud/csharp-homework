Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents primary liver cancer. Because the development of HCC limits the prognosis as well as the quality of life of the patients, its management should be properly conducted based on an accurate diagnosis. The liver is the major target organ of ultrasound (US), which is the simple, non-invasive, and real-time imaging method available worldwide. Microbubble-based contrast agents are safe and reliable and have become popular, which has resulted in the improvement of diagnostic performances of US due to the increased detectability of the peripheral blood flow. Sonazoid (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA), a second-generation contrast agent, shows the unique property of accumulation in the liver and spleen. Contrast-enhanced US with Sonazoid is now one of the most frequently used modalities in the practical management of liver tumors, including the detection and characterization of the nodule, evaluation of the effects of non-surgical treatment, intraoperative support, and post-treatment surveillance. This article reviews the 10-year evidence for contrast-enhanced US with Sonazoid in the practical management of HCC.
