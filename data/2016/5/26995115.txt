Aims:This study aimed to compare the therapeutic efficacy of liver resection (LR) and percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy (PMCT) for single hepatocellular carcinoma ≤3 cm (HCC) in cirrhotic livers.Methods:In this study, 190 patients with single HCC ≤3 cm and Child-Pugh A cirrhosis were retrospectively reviewed. Among these patients, 122 patients underwent LR, and 68 patients received PMCT. The therapeutic efficacy and complications were compared between the two procedures.Results:There was no treatment-related hospital mortality in either group. Major complications were significantly more frequent in the LR group compared to the PMCT group (22.1% vs 5.9%, p = 0.004). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates for the LR group and PMCT group were 98.4%, 93.6%, 55.2% and 97.1%, 87.7%, 51%, respectively. There was no significant difference in OS rates between the LR group and PMCT group (p = 0.153). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year DFS rates were 96.7%, 70.5% and 43.7%, respectively, in the LR group, which were significantly higher compared to the PMCT group (92.6%, 50.5% and 26.3%, p = 0.006). Subgroup analyses revealed that HCC patients with portal hypertension (PH), OS and DFS were similar between the two groups.Conclusions:LR may provide better DFS and lower recurrence rates than PMCT for single HCC ≤3 cm and Child-Pugh A cirrhosis. For HCC patients with PH, PMCT may provide therapeutic effects that are similar to LR.
