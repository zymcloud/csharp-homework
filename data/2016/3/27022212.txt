Hepatocarcinogenesis in human chronic liver diseases is a multi-step process in which hepatic precancerous lesions progress into early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and progressed HCC, and the close surveillance and treatment of these lesions will help improve the survival rates of patients with HCC. The rapid development and extensive application of imaging technology have facilitated the discovery of nodular lesions of ambiguous significance, such as dysplastic nodules. Further investigations showed that these nodules may be hepatic precancerous lesions, and they often appear in patients with liver cirrhosis. Although the morphology of these nodules is not sufficient to support a diagnosis of malignant tumor, these nodules are closely correlated with the occurrence of HCC, as indicated by long-term follow-up studies. In recent years, the rapid development and wide application of pathology, molecular genetics and imaging technology have elucidated the characteristics of precancerous lesions. Based on our extensive review of the relevant literature, this article focuses on evidence indicating that high-grade dysplastic nodules are more likely to transform into HCC than low-grade dysplastic nodules based on clinical, pathological, molecular genetic and radiological assessments. In addition, evidence supporting the precancerous nature of large cell change in hepatitis B virus-related HCC is discussed.
