We conducted a case-control study to investigate the role of three common single nucleotide polymorphisms of IL-10 (-592G/A, -819T/C, and -1082A/C) in the development of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The study included 173 HBV-related HCC patients and 182 healthy controls. A polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay was applied to assess the sequence variants of interest. Compared with control subjects, HCC patients were more likely to be older (t = 1.94, P = 0.03), have a family history of cancer (chi square = 17.86, P
