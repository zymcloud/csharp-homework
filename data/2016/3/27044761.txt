Many guidelines for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been published and updated globally. In contrast to other cancers, there is a range of treatment options for HCC involving several multidisciplinary care of the patient. Consequently, enormous heterogeneity in management trends has been observed. To support standard care for HCC, we systematically appraised 8 current guidelines for HCC around the world, including 3 guidelines from Asia, 2 from Europe, and 3 from the United States according to the selection criteria of credibility influence and multi-faceted. After a systematic appraisal, we found that these guidelines have both similarities and dissimilarities in terms of surveillance and treatment allocation recommendations due to regional differences in disease and other variables (diagnosis, staging systems) secondary to the lack of a solid, high level of evidence. In contrast to other tumors, the geographic differences in tumor biology (i.e., areas of increased hepatitis B prevalence) and available resources (organ availability for transplantation, medical technology, accessibility to treatment, health systems, and health resources) make it impractical to have an internationally universal guideline for all patients with HCC. Although Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) has long been dominant system for treatment-guiding staging of HCC, many Asia-pacific experts do not fully agree with its principle. The concepts of BCLC, for surgical resection or other locoregional therapy, are considered too conservative. Asian guidelines represent consensus about surgical resection and TACE indication for more advanced tumor.
