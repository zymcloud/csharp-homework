Background:Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive malignancy of the biliary tract that is a challenging issue for the medical community, with increasing incidence. Risk factors for CCA are similar to those known for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), such as cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B and C, obesity, diabetes, and alcohol. We describe the outcome and the management of patients who underwent liver transplantation (LT) with an incidental diagnosis of intrahepatic (iCCA) or hepatocholangiocarcinoma (CHC).Methods:From 2000 to May 2015, 655 LT were performed LT at the Liver Transplant Center in Modena, Italy. We retrospectively reviewed the pathological data of the explanted livers, finding 5 cases of iCCA or CHC. The pathological examination of the explanted livers showed 1 case of iCCA; 1 case of multifocal HCC associated with a nodule of iCCA; 2 cases of CHC associated with nodules of HCC; and 1 case of CHC associated with iCCA. Mean disease-free survival (DFS) was 15.49 months (1.55-42.04) and mean overall survival (OS) was 24.76 months (3.91-75.49). All patients died of recurrent tumor progression.Results:iCCA incidental finding after LT affects patient outcomes, massively causing OS and DFS reduction. We stress the necessity of a more accurate selection of the candidates whenever an augmented risk of iCCA or CHC is present.Conclusions:Further investigations are required to better understand the role of LT in these patients and to define the best management for them once they have been transplanted and the histological examination reveals the presence of iCCA or CHC.
