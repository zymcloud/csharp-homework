Sunitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is used as an anticancer drug in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PNETs) and gastrointestinal stromal tumour. Elevated liver enzymes are frequently observed during treatment but acute liver failure is uncommon. We describe a case of fulminant acute liver failure and acute kidney injury during treatment with sunitinib for metastatic RCC.
