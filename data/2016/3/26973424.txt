A case in which implantation of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma onto a post-dissection gastric ulcer was strongly suspected is presented. A 72-year-old man with alcoholic liver cirrhosis underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Esophageal cancer (EC) (Mt, 20 mm, 0-Is) and gastric cancer (GC) (antrum, 15 mm, 0-IIc) were identified. Biopsy specimens revealed moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and differentiated adenocarcinoma, respectively. The GC was resected by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) [14 mm Ã— 9 mm, type 0-IIc, tub1, pT1a(M), ly0, v0, HM(-), VM(-)]. Two months after ESD, radiation therapy was started for the EC, and an almost complete response was obtained. Nine months after the ESD, a follow-up EGD showed a submucosal tumor-like lesion with ulceration, located immediately under the post-ESD scar, and biopsy specimens showed moderately differentiated SCC. There were no similar lesions suggesting hematogenous or lymphatic metastasis in the stomach.
