Purpose:To discover protein markers in chronic/advanced opisthorchiasis for the early detection of Opisthorchis viverrini (OV)-associated cholangiocarcinoma (CCA).Experimental design:Liver tissues derived from normal hamsters and those with chronic/advanced opisthorchiasis (n = 5 per group) were subjected to 2DE and LC-MS/MS. Candidate protein expression was confirmed in hamster models and human CCA tissue microarray (TMA) using immunohistochemistry and Western blot.Result:Proteomics analysis detected 14-3-3 eta only in infected hamsters, not in uninfected controls. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis confirmed low expression of 14-3-3 eta in normal hamster livers and demonstrated increased expression through time in infected livers. This protein was also observed in parasite organs, especially during the chronic phase of opisthorchiasis. Moreover, increased expression of 14-3-3 eta, relative to normal hamster livers, was observed during the early stage of CCA induced by OV infection and administration of N-nitrosodimethylamine. Immunohistochemical analysis of human TMA revealed that 14-3-3 eta was highly expressed in CCA (84.23%, 187/222 cases) but was not found in hepatocellular carcinoma or healthy liver tissues.Conclusions and clinical relevance:14-3-3 eta protein has potential as a screening and early diagnostic marker for CCA.
