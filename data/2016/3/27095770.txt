In the past, we used to think that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) only occurred when nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progressed to liver cirrhosis. However, recent clinical studies have shown that HCC may occur during the stage of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The prevalence of NAFLD and the increasing incidence of NASH-associated HCC require the elucidation of the pathogenesis of NASH-HCC and the assessment of the efficacy of novel therapies as early as possible, while these evaluations need reliable animal models. This article reviews the characteristics of NASH-HCC models with a practical value to uncover the mysteries of NASH-HCC.
