Epidemiological survey identified that the variant patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) gene at I148M position exerts direct effect in promoting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) under extraneous oxidative stress by interaction with obesity. However, the mechanism is still unknown. HepG2 cells were overexpressed by transinfection of PNPLA3 with wild-type 148I (PNPLA3(WT)) and mutant 148M (PNPLA3(I148M)), respectively. Variation in metabolic indicators, hepatic steatosis, biological behaviors and signaling molecules related to cancer promotion was measured in hepatocytes using low-dose free fatty acid (FFA) exposure. Effect of PNPLA3(I148M) on xenograft biology and its interaction with dietary obesity were also evaluated in animal study. Cells overexpresssing PNPLA3(I148M) in low-dose FFA incubation showed more proliferation, migration, invasion, and less apoptosis (P
