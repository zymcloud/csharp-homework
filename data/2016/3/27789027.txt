Aim:To validate the usefulness of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the differentiation of high-flow haemangiomas showing pseudo-washout appearance on gadoxetic acid-enhanced hepatic MRI from small hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).Materials and methods:DWI (b=50, 800 s/mm2) with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps for 50 haemangiomas (6.4±2.9 mm) showing intense enhancement on arterial dominant phase imaging and hypointensity on transitional and/or hepatobiliary phase imaging during gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI were retrospectively analysed and compared with that of 113 hypervascular HCCs (12.8±3.7 mm). In addition to measurement of mean ADC values on DWI and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) on corresponding T2-weighted imaging, qualitative analysis of DWI was performed for each lesion by two independent observers using a five-point scale.Results:Both of mean ADC value (1.902 versus 0.997×10-3 mm2/s) and mean CNR (119.2 versus 36.9) for haemangioma were significantly larger than for HCC (p<0.001). On receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.995 for ADC values was significantly larger than 0.915 for CNRs (p=0.002). When the ADC value of 1.327×10-3 mm2/s was used as the threshold for the diagnosis of haemangioma, the sensitivity and specificity were 98% and 97.3%, respectively. The mean sensitivity and specificity of qualitative analysis for the differentiation of haemangioma from HCC were 92% and 99.1%, respectively.Conclusion:For high-flow small haemangiomas showing pseudo-washout appearance during gadoxetic acid-enhanced hepatic MRI, high b-factor DWI including an ADC map may provide additional information to enhance the confidence to exclude small hypervascular HCCs.
