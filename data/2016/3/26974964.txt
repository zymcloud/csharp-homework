This study aimed to investigate the anti-tumor activity of RY10-4, a small molecular that was designed and synthesized based on the structure of protoapigenone. A previous screening study showed that RY10-4 possessed anti-proliferative effects against HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. However, the full range of RY10-4 anti-cancer effects on liver tumors and the underlying mechanisms have not been identified. Herein, employing flow cytometry, and Western blot analysis, we demonstrate that RY10-4 can induce cell cycle arrest, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis in HepG2 cells. In HepG2 cell xenograft tumor model, RY10-4 significantly inhibited the growth of tumors and induced apoptosis in tumor cells, with little side effects. Moreover, RY10-4 caused the suppression of STAT3 activation, which may be involved the apoptosis induction. In addition, RY10-4 inhibited the proliferation of Hep3B and HuH-7 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Taken together, our results suggest that RY10-4 has a great potential to develop as chemotherapeutic agent for liver cancer.
