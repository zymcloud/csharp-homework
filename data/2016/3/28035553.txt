Background:Sustained abnormal serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels can increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B.Aim:This study is aimed to confirm the impact of rapid ALT normalization (≤30 IU/L) on HCC risk in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated cirrhosis after entecavir (ETV) commencement.Methods:A total of 578 treatment-naïve patients with HBV-associated cirrhosis (mean age 51 ± 9 years, male sex 63.3%) were treated with ETV for more than 1 year. Serum ALT and HBV DNA levels were measured at three time points (baseline, 6, and 12 months after ETV commencement) and subjected to risk factor analysis.Results:Median follow-up after ETV commencement was 43 (12-98) months. Cumulative incidences of HCC at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years were 0.3, 8.5, 19.5, and 30.6%, respectively. Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that older age, abnormal ALT at 6 months or 12 months, and lower platelet count were significant risk factors for HCC. However, gender, HBeAg positivity, abnormal ALT levels or HBV DNA levels at baseline, and detectable HBV DNA at 6 or 12 months were not risk factors. Multivariate analysis showed that older age (P Conclusions:Abnormal serum ALT levels after ETV commencement are significant risk factor for HCC. Therefore, ALT should be rapidly normalized to minimize the risk of HCC development in patients with HBV-associated cirrhosis.
