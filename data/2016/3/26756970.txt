Background:HDL-C plasma levels are modulated by dietary fatty acid (FA), but studies investigating dietary supplementation in FA gave contrasting results. Saturated FA increased HDL-C levels only in some studies. Mono-unsaturated FA exerted a slight effect while poly-unsaturated FA mostly increased plasma HDL-C.Aims:This study presents two aims: i) to investigate the relationship between HDL-C levels and plasma FA composition in a Sicilian population following a "Mediterranean diet", ii) to investigate if FA that resulted correlated with plasma HDL-C levels in the population study and/or very abundant in the plasma were able to affect HDL catabolism in an "in vitro" model of cultured hepatoma cells (HepG2).Results:plasma HDL-C levels in the population correlated negatively with myristic acid (C14:0, Î² = -0.24, p Conclusions:C14:0 was correlated with decreased plasma HDL-C levels in a Mediterranean population. C14:0 might reduce HDL-C levels by increasing HDL trapping to cell surface HSPG and CE stripping from bound HDL. Other mechanisms are to be investigated to explain the effects of other FA on HDL metabolism.
