The clinical course of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection greatly differs in individuals. Various viral, host, and environmental factors influence the natural history of HBV infection. Recent genome-wide association studies identified several host genetic factors influencing the clinical course of HBV infection. Genetic variations in HLA class II loci were significantly associated with susceptibility to persistent HBV infection. Other polymorphisms in or near the genes EHMT2, TCF19, and HLA-C, located near HLA class II loci, and UBE2L3 were also associated with persistent HBV infection. Meanwhile, polymorphisms in KIF1B, GRIK1, and STAT4 were associated with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Interestingly, HLA class II genetic variations were strongly associated with not only persistent HBV infection, but also disease progression and HBV-related HCC in chronic hepatitis B. Understanding the various genetic factors associated with the clinical course of HBV infection is essential for personalized treatment and surveillance of disease progression and HCC.
