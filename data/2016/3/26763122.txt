Cylindromatosis (CYLD) is a deubiquitination enzyme involved in the regulation of different cellular processes including inflammation, fibrosis, and cancer. The function of CYLD is via deubiquitination of specific substrates in different signaling pathways including NF-ÎºB, Notch, and JNK. CYLD contributes to hepatic homeostasis and restoration upon liver injury. Mutation or disruption of the activity of CYLD in animals aggravates acute as well as chronic liver injury and promotes development and progression of hepatocellular cancer. This is mediated by a shift of the balance toward pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrogenic, and pro-oncogenic pathways. In this review, we will explain the liver-associated signaling pathways that CYLD regulates in hepatocytes and nonparenchymal liver cells under physiological and pathological conditions. We will also describe the most recent findings concerning CYLD-mediated downstream signaling in the liver in situations such as injury, infection, inflammation, and cancer. Furthermore, we will discuss the potential of novel diagnostic tools and treatment strategies utilizing CYLD and its target genes.
