Aim:To investigate whether the regulation of aquaporin 3 (AQP3) and AQP9 induced by Auphen and dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP) inhibits hepatic tumorigenesis.Methods:Expression of AQP3 and AQP9 was detected by Western blot, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and RT-PCR in HCC samples and paired non-cancerous liver tissue samples from 30 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. A xenograft tumor model was used in vivo. Nine nude mice were divided into control, Auphen-treated, and dbcAMP-treated groups (n = 3 for each group). AQP3 and AQP9 protein expression after induction of xenograft tumors was detected by IHC and mRNA by RT-PCR analysis. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay and histological evaluation were used to detect apoptosis of tumor cells, and the concentration of serum Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) was measured using RT-PCR and an ELISA kit.Results:The volumes and weights of tumors decreased significantly in the Auphen- and dbcAMP-treated mice compared with the control mice (P Conclusion:AQP3 increases in HCC while AQP9 decreases. Regulation of AQP3 and AQP9 expression by Auphen and dbcAMP inhibits the development and growth of HCC.
