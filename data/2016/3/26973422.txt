Aim:To detect the expression of sal-like protein 4 (SALL4) and to explore its relationship with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:One hundred and twenty-six samples of HCC tissue, 44 of adjacent noncancerous cirrhotic tissue and 10 of liver hemangioma tissue, were obtained from patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC at the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University. None of the patients had received any form of treatment before the operation. After resection, all the tissues were fixed in 10% neutral formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Expression of SALL4 was detected by immunohistochemistry. Patients were followed up for postoperative survival until February 2014. The relationships between SALL4 expression level and clinicopathological data and prognosis of HCC were analyzed.Results:SALL4 expression was negative in the 10 samples of tissue from liver hemangioma, was weakly positive in the two samples from adjacent noncancerous cirrhotic tissue, and positive in 58 samples of HCC tissues. The differences were statistically significant (P Conclusion:Expression of SALL4 is relevant to the prognosis of HCC patients. Patients with higher expression levels of SALL4 and AFP have worse prognosis.
