Background:Hepatic resection has the highest local controllability that results in long-term survival for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to investigate the role of hepatic resection in selected patients of intermediate and advanced stage.Methods:Clinical, pathological, and outcome data of 542 consecutive patients were retrospectively analyzed from a single center. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival. Postoperative prognostic factors were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 89.0, 64.3, and 53.0%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 72.2, 44.5, and 34.2%, respectively. Preoperative Î±-fetoprotein level >400 ng/mL, macroscopic vascular invasion, microscopic portal vein thrombosis, multiple tumor nodules, and the largest tumor size >5 cm were significantly correlated with overall survival. When these clinical risk factors were used in a postoperative staging system, assigning one point for each factor, the total score was precisely predictive of long-term survival. For patients with surgery plus adjuvant TACE (transarterial chemoembolization), the median overall survival was 56 months (range 1-110 months) and the 5-year OS rate was 48.5%.Conclusions:Hepatic resection is efficient and safe for HCC patients of intermediate and advanced stage. The adjuvant TACE should be recommended for HCC patients with poor risk factors.
