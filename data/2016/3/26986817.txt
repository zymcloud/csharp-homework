Sorafenib has improved the median overall survival of unresectable or otherwise untreatable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of âˆ¼3 months, compared to supportive cares. Complete response, although rare, has been reported. The authors reported herein a case of complete biochemical and radiological remission of advanced unresectable HCC with lymph node metastasis and tumoral portal vein thrombosis treated by 5 months therapy with sorafenib followed by adjuvant Yttrium-90 radioembolization. At 12 months follow-up, there is no evidence of HCC recurrence.
