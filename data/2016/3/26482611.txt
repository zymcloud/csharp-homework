Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play critical roles in the development and progression of diseases. lncRNA activated by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²) (lncRNA-ATB) was discovered as a prognostic factor in hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer. However, little is known about the role of lncRNA-ATB in pancreatic cancer. This study aimed to assess lncRNA-ATB expression in pancreatic cancer and explore its role in pancreatic cancer pathogenesis. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect lncRNA-ATB expression in 150 pancreatic cancer tissues and five pancreatic cancer cell lines compared to paired adjacent normal tissues and normal human pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line HPDE6c-7. The correlations between lncRNA-ATB expression and clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis were also analyzed. We found that lncRNA-ATB expression was decreased in pancreatic cancer tissues and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Low lncRNA-ATB expression levels were significantly correlated with lymph node metastases (yes vs. no, P = 0.009), neural invasion (positive vs. negative, P = 0.049), and clinical stage (early stage vs. advanced stage, P = 0.014). Moreover, patients with low lncRNA-ATB expression levels exhibited markedly worse overall survival prognoses (P
