Familial clustering of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is commonly observed in various parts of the world including China and Eastern Asia where HBV is endemic while in western world, genetic factors and metabolic disorders may play an important role. In India, HCC is considered to be a rare tumour and till date no case of familial HCC has been reported here. Therefore the present case demonstrates rare occurrence of familial HCC which is being reported for the first time from India on cytology. The case also highlights an unusual feature that it was not associated with any risk factor including HBV, HCV infection, alcoholism, obesity, diabetes or smoking suggesting its independent association with genetic factors. Cytology is uncomplicated diagnostic tool for HCC and may be useful for its early diagnosis. This case also highlights the importance of early surveillance and follow up of blood relatives for every case of HCC so that early diagnosis and management of familial HCC is possible.
