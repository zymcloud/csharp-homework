Objective:To evaluate the prognostic significance of serum GGT in patients with hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCV-HCC) treated with transcatheeter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:The clinicopathological data of 110 patients with hepatitis C virus-related stage B hepatocellular carcinoma, who received TACE treatment from January 2008 to May 2011, were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups: the normal GCT group (GGTResults:The pretreatment GGT level was (160.0±120.2) U/L in the high GGT group and (40.1±8.5) U/L in the normal GGT group (PConclusion:The level of serum GGT before TACE is an independent prognostic factor for patients with stage B HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma.
