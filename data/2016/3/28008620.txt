Background/aims:We compared overall survival (OS) of patients with a solitary large (>5 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated surgically or by transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:The archived records of HCC patients registered at the Korean Central Cancer Registry from 2003 through 2005 (registry A, n = 4 520) or from 2008 through 2010 (registry B, n = 4 596) were retrospectively analyzed. In these registries, 578 and 315 patients had a single large HCC, respectively. In registry A, 442 (cohort A) underwent surgery (n = 96) or TACE (n = 346). In registry B, 253 (cohort B) underwent surgery (n = 110) or TACE (n = 143). Cohort C (n = 695) was constructed by combining cohorts A and B, and thus, 206 and 489 patients received surgery and TACE, respectively.Results:In cohort C, cumulative OS rates at 1-, 3-, and 5-years were significantly higher for surgery than TACE (89.3%, 67.4%, and 58.0% vs 67.7%, 38.2%, and 27.2%, respectively, P Conclusions:Surgery is associated with improved OS for a solitary large HCC of BCLC stage A.
