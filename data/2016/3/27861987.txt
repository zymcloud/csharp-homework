Purpose:To compare contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) using Sonazoid with Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI (EOB-MRI) in the diagnosis of liver metastases in patients with colorectal cancer.Methods:A total of 69 patients diagnosed with or suspected of having liver metastasis were enrolled. These hepatic lesions were diagnosed by histopathological examination after surgical resection or based on follow-up using various imaging modalities. The diagnostic accuracies of CEUS and EOB-MRI were compared.Results:One hundred thirty-three lesions were detected. Of these lesions, 109 were diagnosed as liver metastases. Of the 133 lesions, 90.2% were detected on CEUS, and 98.5% on EOB-MRI. One hundred nine lesions were diagnosed as liver metastasis. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for diagnosis were 0.906 and 0.851 on CEUS and EOB-MRI, respectively (p = 0.41). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, and overall accuracy were 90.8%, 84.5%, 97.1%, 67.1%, and 90.2%, respectively, for CEUS, and 95.4%, 70.8%, 93.7%, 77.3%, and 91%, respectively, for EOB-MRI.Conclusions:CEUS has a higher specificity and PPV for the diagnosis of liver metastasis than EOB-MRI.
