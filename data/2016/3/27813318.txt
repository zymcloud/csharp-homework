Background:Hepatitis C is the major cause of end-stage liver disease and the major indication for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx) in individuals with haemophilia.Aim:To assess the epidemiology and outcomes of OLTx in U.S. haemophilia patients.Methods:We investigated haemophilia liver transplant recipients between 1993 and 2012, using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, identified by ICD9 code 50.59.Results:Of the 11 267 (weighted n = 54 691) patients undergoing OLTx, 44 (0.4%; weighted n = 213) had haemophilia. Those with haemophilia were more likely than non-haemophilic OLTx recipients to have bleeding complications (45.3% vs. 31.5%, P = 0.009) and hypovolemic shock (7.0% vs. 1.1%, P Conclusions:Bleeding complications are common in haemophilia OLTx recipients. Thus, aggressive correction of coagulation defects in this group may be a medically sound approach to reduce complications and mortality associated with OLTx.
