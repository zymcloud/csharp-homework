Purpose:This retrospective study was an investigation of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and prognostic factors affecting OS and DFS in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative radiofrequency ablation (IORFA).Methods:Between April 2009 and November 2013, 112 patients (94 men, 84%; 18 women, 16%) underwent IORFA for 185 cases of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Repeat IORFA was done in 9 patients during the same period (total of 121 treatments).Results:All patients were followed-up for at least 12 months (mean follow-up, 32 months). Surgical resection combined with IORFA was performed in 20 patients. The technical effectiveness at 1 week was 91.78% (111 of 121). Readmission was 9.1% (11 of 121) and the most common cause was ventral hernia. Procedure-related mortality was 2.7% (3 of 112) and continued fatal biliary leakage was 1.8% (2 of 112). Local recurrence developed in 10 patients (8.9%). Most recurrence was intrahepatic. Cumulative survival was assessed in 33 patients who received IORFA as primary treatment (naive patients) and 79 non-naive patients. The cumulative DFS and OS rate at l and 3 years was 54% and 24%, and 87% and 66%, respectively. Moderate ascites (P = 0.001), tumor located segment I (P = 0.001), portal vein thrombosis (P = 0.001) had poor survival were significant factors by multivariate analysis.Conclusion:IORFA alone or in combination with surgical resection extends the spectrum of liver surgery. A fundamental understanding of RFA, additional comorbidities, and postablation complication are necessary to maximize the safety and efficacy of IORFA for treating HCC with cirrhosis.
