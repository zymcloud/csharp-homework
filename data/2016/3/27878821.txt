Background:Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma (FL-HCC) is a rare primary liver tumor that usually presents in younger patients without underlying liver disease.Methods:We queried the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) database between October 1988 and January 2013 to evaluate outcomes in patients with FL-HCC undergoing liver transplantation in the United States compared to patients with conventional Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).Results:Sixty-three patients were identified (57% female, mean age 30 years). Only one patient (2%) had an associated Hepatitis C Virus. Mean Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score at the time of transplantation was 11.3. Mean waiting time was 325 days and mean cold ischemic time was 6 hr. Overall survival of FL-HCC patients at 1, 3, and 5 years was 96%, 80%, and 48% as compared to HCC patients whose rates were 89%, 77%, and 68%. Six patients had tumor recurrence (10%). The Cox Model demonstrated that MELD and cold ischemic time are the strongest predictors of overall survival in FL-HCC patients. Age and wait time were not associated with poor patient survival in this series.Conclusions:Good results can be obtained in selected patients transplanted for FL-HCC. FL-HCC patients had similar survival compared to those transplanted for HCC. J. Surg. Oncol. 2017;115:319-323. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
