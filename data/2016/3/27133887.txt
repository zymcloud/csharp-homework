A 78-year-old man was admitted to our department for a right renal mass detected by computed tomography which was accompanied by right hypochondriac pain. Dynamic computed tomography demonstrated a 7cm hypovascular right renal mass invading the liver. No metastatic disease was evident. Transabdominal nephrectomy and partial hepatectomy were performed under the diagnosis of right renal cell carcinoma in July 2014. Pathological examination revealed right renal pelvic carcinoma with liver invasion. After the operation, a subcutaneous nodule in the right forearm rapidly grew in one week. A needle biopsy revealed that it was a metastasis of the urothelial carcinoma. Additionally, lung metastases and lymph node swelling were detected. The patient received two courses of combination chemotherapy (gemcitabine, carboplatin) in August 2014. The subcutaneous metastasis was decreased, but it was not effective for other metastases. Two courses of another combination chemotherapy (methotrexate, vinblastine, epirubicin, calboplatin) were performed. It was effective for all metastatic lesions. During the third course, the patient developed melancholia and rejected additional therapy. He died in March 2015 due to disease progression.
