Objective:To establish a strategy for surgical resection of hepatic malignancies confined to segment VII.Background:Various surgical procedures can be used to resect hepatic malignancies in segment VII, the deepest region of the liver, by open and/or laparoscopic approaches: nonanatomic wedge resection (WR), segmentectomy VII, right lateral sectionectomy (RLS), and right hepatectomy.Methods:WR and segmentectomy VII were applied as first-line surgical procedures for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), respectively. RLS and right hepatectomy were indicated only when tumor infiltration to the proximal Glissonian sheath was suspected. Operative outcomes were evaluated in 200 consecutive patients who underwent hepatic resection for HCC (n = 120) or CRLM (n = 80).Results:WR, segmentectomy VII, RLS, and right hepatectomy were performed in 104 (52.0%), 57 (28.5%), 22 (11.0%), and 17 (8.5%) patients, respectively. Local hepatectomy (WR and segmentectomy VII) led to shorter operation times and lower blood loss volumes than did extensive hepatectomy (RLS and right hepatectomy). Thoracotomy was performed in half of the WR and two-thirds of the segmentectomy VII procedures. The availability of a laparoscopic approach was 40% (8 patients) after its application in October 2012.Conclusions:Even for hepatic malignancies located in segment VII, WR and segmentectomy should be prioritized over extensive hepatectomy to preserve the postoperative functional hepatic volume. Full mobilization of the right liver and a good surgical field provided by a large thoracoabdominal or abdominal incision or a laparoscopic approach are key factors for safe performance of deep hepatic transection.
