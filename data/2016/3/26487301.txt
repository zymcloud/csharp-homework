Background:Long non-coding RNA-activated by TGF-β (lncRNA-ATB) promotes the invasion-metastasis cascade in hepatocellular carcinoma via downregulating E-cadherin (E-cad) and inducing epithelial-to- mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is clinically significant in human colon cancer. However, its molecular mechanisms in colon cancer progression remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the role of lncRNA-ATB and its clinical value in colon cancer.Methods:Expression levels of lncRNA-ATB in colon cancer tissues and colon cancer cell lines were evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The clinicopathological significance and prognostic value of lncRNA-ATB were investigated, and roles of lncRNA-ATB in regulating E-cad and other EMT-related markers expression and colon cancer progression were evaluated in vitro. Expression levels of lncRNA-ATB and E-cad in human plasma were evaluated.Results:Long non-coding RNA-activated by TGF-β was upregulated in colon cancer tissues compared with adjacent mucosa (P Conclusions:Long non-coding RNA-activated by TGF-β may act on colon tumorigenesis by suppressing E-cad expression and promoting EMT process, and lncRNA-ATB inhibition may provide a promising therapeutic option for suppressing colon cancer progression.
