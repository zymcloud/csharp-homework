Purpose:To describe the multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) imaging features of HCC that develops in patients who are free from underlying liver cirrhosis and to determine if the MDCT presentation of this specific tumor differs from that of the more common HCC that develops in patients with liver cirrhosis using a retrospective case-control study.Patients and methods:The MDCT examinations of 38 patients with HCC in non-cirrhotic liver (group 1) were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed and compared to those obtained in 38 patients with HCC in cirrhotic liver (group 2) matched for age and gender. Quantitative and qualitative characteristics of HCC of both groups were compared using univariate analysis.Results:HCCs were significantly larger in group 1 (81.5mm±55.5) than in group 2 (44.5mm±39.1 SD; P=0.0015). In group 1, HCCs were more frequently single tumors (87%) than in group 2 (37%) (PConclusion:HCC in non-cirrhotic liver are larger than those observed in cirrhotic liver and more frequently present as a single encapsulated tumor. They have the same patterns of enhancement than HCC that develops in cirrhotic liver.
