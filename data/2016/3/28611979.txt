Background:Retinoids, vitamin A and its derivatives, have an antitumor effect on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The function of retinoids is exerted by the complex of retinoic acid (RA) with the heterodimer of retinoid X receptor and the RA receptor. The preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma (PRAME) acts as a dominant repressor of RA signaling by binding to the complex. The significance of PRAME on the prognosis of HCC remains to be clarified.Methods:PRAME mRNA expression was examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in both tumor and non-tumor tissues of 100 HCC patients who received surgical resection. The effect of PRAME knockdown on DR5-mediated RA transcriptional activity was examined.Results:In tumor tissues, there were significant associations among PRAME expression, clinical stage, tumor markers, and tumor numbers. In non-tumor tissues, there were significant associations among PRAME expression, overall survival, and disease-free survival. The knockdown of PRAME caused no reduction in DR5-mediated transcriptional activity of RA, suggesting that PRAME acts via other mechanisms than the DR5 RA-responsive elements.Conclusion:Our findings indicate that PRAME expression is a novel prognostic marker in HCC patients.
