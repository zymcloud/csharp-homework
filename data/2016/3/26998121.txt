A 42-year-old male patient was admitted to the Department of General Surgery of The First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology (Luoyang, China) presenting with abdominal discomfort. Enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a 15.1×7.0-cm, enhanced, double-spherical, exogenous, solid tumor originating from the left lateral hepatic lobe, in addition to a 4.3×4.2-cm mass in the mid portion of the left kidney. Pre-operative imaging analysis resulted in the diagnosis of double cancer, consisting of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The patient subsequently underwent left hemihepatectomy and left nephrectomy. Histological examination confirmed that the tumor originating from the left lateral hepatic lobe was HCC, and the tumor arising from the mid portion of the left kidney was clear cell RCC (ccRCC). The post-operative follow-up was uneventful. To the best of our knowledge, the present case is the first of its kind to describe the resection of synchronous double cancer, consisting of primary HCC and ccRCC.
