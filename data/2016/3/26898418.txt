Aim:The inhibitory effects on expression of JNK1 in mouse hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and cell migration and invasion were mediated by ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD).Materials and methods:The best shRNA vector was built and screened. The hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines were cultured in vitro and divided into five groups: the group of normal Hca-F cells, the group of shRNA plasmid (already selected from the above procedure), the group of Lipofectamine, the group of UTMD (ultrasound microbubbles combined with ultrasound exposure) and the group of Lipofectamine and UTMD. The transfection rate was observed by inverted fluorescence microscope. The expression levels of JNK1 mRNA and protein were evaluated by fluorescence quantitative PCR and Western Blot respectively. The cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8. The ability of migration and invasion in vitro was detected by transwell assay.Results:The best shRNA vector was established. The comparison of the transfection rate: The group of Lipofectamine and UTMD was larger than that of the groups of shRNA plasmid, Lipofectamine lipofection and UTMD (all P0.05). The comparison of the expression levels of JNK1 mRNA and protein: Both of the mRNA and protein expression levels were lowest in the group of Lipofectamine and UTMD (all PConclusion:The transfection rate of JNK1 shRNA can be improved through the combination of lipofection and UTMD in mouse hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, therefore enhancing the inhibitory effects of gene expression. The inhibitory effects of cell proliferation, migration and invasion can also be enhanced.
