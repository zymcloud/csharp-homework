Background:Penile cancer is a relatively uncommon cancer in developed nations. Metastatic disease is rare, but lymphatic or vascular spreading has been previously reported to the liver, lungs, bones, brain, heart and skin.Case presentation:We report a case of a 49-year-old white man with a penile squamous cell carcinoma previously treated with partial penectomy and bilateral inguinal lymph node dissection, followed by adjuvant therapy. Three years after treatment, the primitive neoplasm metastasized to the breast, presenting as a painful lump. Differentials of a secondary versus a malignant primary tumor were considered and in view of a diagnostic dilemma the lesion was excised.Conclusions:This case is unusual in its site of metastatic progression as well as in its pattern of clinical presentation. Awareness of such a condition by physicians is mandatory in order to make an early diagnosis and start prompt and correct therapeutic planning.
