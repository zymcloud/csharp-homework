The necessity of liver donors has contributed to overcoming the traditional criteria and to propose new ones for the acceptance of livers for transplantation. For this reason expanded or extended criteria donation (ECD) or even overextended criteria for marginal or high-risk organ donors have been developed. Ethical, Legal and Psychological Aspects of Organ Transplantation (ELPAT) and European Liver and Intestine Transplant Association (ELITA) - European Liver Transplantation Registry (ELTR) coordinated the distribution of a previously reported questionnaire that was sent to 53 European liver transplant centers. Criteria were divided based on the response rate. Donor criteria such as steatosis and serum sodium >165 mmol/L, as well as recipient criteria such as previous history of cancer, were not considered contraindications to transplantation in more than 60% of cases. Criteria such as ICU (intensive care unit) stay, body mass index >30, serum bilirubin >3 mg/dL, and HIV infection or critical illness were not considered adequate for transplantation in 30% to 59% of cases. On the other hand, there was no agreement on other extended liver donor and recipient criteria, such as age up to 80 years, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase >90 U/L, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase >105 U/L, high-risk sex practices, drug users, patients older than 65 years, and patients younger than 65 years, respectively. Criteria such as serum sodium could not be considered ECD criteria. In conclusion, development of more studies and inclusion of more liver transplantation centers are required to confirm these data.
