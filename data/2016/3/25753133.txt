Aim:Considering the dramatic increase in average life expectancy during the 20th century throughout the world, the management of elderly patients with cancer has become a global issue. We herein investigated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of super-elderly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients over 80 years old not indicated for surgical resection.Methods:We retrospectively evaluated 206 newly diagnosed HCC patients. The patients were divided into two groups according to their age at inclusion; a super-elderly group (n = 37, â‰¥80 years) and a younger group (n = 169, Results:The proportion of women was higher in the super-elderly group than in the younger group (P = 0.017). There were no significant differences in the OS (P = 0.171) or DSS (P = 0.176) between the two groups. The multivariate analysis revealed that only the Cancer Liver Italian Program score (hazard ratio [HR], 2.972; P Conclusion:There were no significant differences in the OS and DSS rates among the super-elderly HCC patients and younger HCC patients not indicated for surgical resection. An advanced age itself does not restrict the therapeutic approach, even in super-elderly HCC patients not indicated for surgical resection.
