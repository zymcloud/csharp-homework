Objective:To investigate the expressions of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in patients with liver diseases and the effects and mechanism of intervening NF-κB activation on multiple drug resistance (MDR) reversal.Methods:The levels of circulating NF-κB and P-gp expression were quantitatively detected in 294 patients with liver diseases by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. NF-κB gene transcription in human HepG2 cells was intervened by specific siRNA with/without doxorubicin treatment. Levels of protein or gene expression were analyzed by Western blotting or fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Results:The dynamic increase of circulating NF-κB and P-gp expressions were observed during patients from chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. The levels of serum NF-κB and P-gp expression in HCC were significantly higher (PConclusion:The over-expressions of NF-κB and P-gp are closely associated with MDR formation; intervention of NF-κB activation can inhibit P-gp expression, and enhance the sensitivity to anti-cancer drug and reverse MDR of HCC.
