Objective:To evaluate the effect and safety of acupuncture combined with Jiawei Mojie tablet for the prevention of endometriosis recurrence after surgery.Methods:One hundred and six patients after the conservative surgery against endometriosis were randomly divided into a western medication group and an acupuncture and medication group(a combination group), 53 cases in each one. In the western medication group, gestrinone was applied orally. In the combination group, acupuncture and Jiawei Mojie tablet with oral administration were adopted. Xuehai (SP 10), Sanyinjiao (SP 6) and Guanyuan (CV 4) were mainly used, and acupoints based on syndrome differentiation were combined. After the surgery and when the menstruation was end, 3 to 5 days later the preventive treatment was used successively for 6 months. Patients were followed up after treatment and in 3 months, 6 months, and 18 months (two years after surgery) after treatment. The recurrence [Abdominal/perineal ultrasonic examination, serum cancer antigen 125 (CA125) test], menstruation score, endometriosis health profile-5 (EHP-5) and the safety index of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were compared between the two groups.Results:Eight patients (five cases in the western medication group and three cases in the combination group) were rejected because of dropping, and six ones (two cases in the western medication group and four cases in the combination group) discontinued. When patients were followed up in 18 months after treatment, the suspected recurrence rate through ultrasonic examination was 2.0% (1/50), and the unusual rate of serum CA125 text was 4.0% (2/50) in the combination group, which were apparently lower than 18.8% (9/48) and 25.0% (12/48) in the western medication group (both P < 0.01). After treatment and 3-month, 6-month, and 18-month following up, the menstruation scores of the combination group were obviously lower than those of the western medication group (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). After 18 months, the positive rate of EHP-5 in the combination group was 0 (0/50), which was markedly lower than 18.8% (9/48) in the western medication group (P < 0.01). After treatment and 3-month, 6-month, and 18-month following up, the unusual rates of serum ALT text in the combination group were lower than those in the western medication group (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). After treatment, the unusual rate of serum ALT text was not significantly different in the combination group compared with that before treatment (P > 0.05), and after treatment and 3-month, 6-month following up, the unusual rates of serum ALT text in the western medication group were remarkablely higher than those before treatment (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). After 18-month following up, the unusual rate of serum ALT text in the western medication group was not statistically significant compared with that before treatment (P > 0.05).Conclusion:Acupuncture combined with Jiawei Mojie tablet can effectively prevent endometriosis recurrence after surgery, and improve menstruation condition and life quality, which are less injurious for liver than gestrinone.
