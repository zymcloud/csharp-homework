Background:Recent studies showed that signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) was downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. However, the role of STAT4 in HCC is still unknown. The aim of this study is to explore the association between STAT4 expression and other clinicopathological features in HCC and to test the effect of STAT4 on cell growth and apoptosis in vitro.Methods:STAT4 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 171 HCC and corresponding paraneoplastic liver, 37 cirrhosis, and 33 normal liver tissues. Association between STAT4 and clinicopathological parameters was analyzed. Meta-analysis on STAT4 in cancer was performed. The effect of STAT4 small interfering RNA (siRNA) on cell growth and cell apoptosis was also detected.Results:Positive rate of STAT4 was 29.2% (50/171) in HCC tissues, 53.2% (91/171) in paraneoplastic liver tissues, 64.9% (24/37) in cirrhosis tissues, and 72.7% (24/33) in normal liver tissues. STAT4 was upregulated in younger patients who were female, with single tumor node, early TNM stage, without portal vein tumor embolus, and Î±-fetoprotein (AFP)-positive tumors compared with the groups comprising older patients, males, and those with multiple tumor nodes, advanced TNM stage, with portal vein tumor embolus, and AFP negative tumors. Meta-analysis showed STAT4 was correlated with TNM stage (OR =0.50, 95% CI =0.30, 0.83, P=0.008) and age (OR =0.58, 95% CI =0.38, 0.95, P=0.032) in malignant tissues, and with AFP level (OR =1.76, 95% CI =1.06, 2.94, P=0.03) in HCC. STAT4 siRNA promoted growth and suppressed apoptosis of HepG2 cells.Conclusion:STAT4 might play a vital role in development of HCC, via influencing cell growth and apoptosis, as a tumor suppressor.
