Aim:To evaluate overall survival (OS) in unresectable American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage I/II hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with drug-eluting-bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) versus best supportive care.Materials & methods:OS in consecutive patients with AJCC stage I/II unresectable HCC diagnosed in 2005-2010 who underwent DEB-TACE and similar patients from SEER with no surgery/radiation recommended/performed was evaluated.Results:Median OS from HCC diagnosis was 28.9 months (DEB-TACE) versus 10.0 months (SEER), p Conclusion:DEB-TACE in patients with unresectable AJCC stage I/II HCC was a significant independent prognostic factor for greater OS in a population-based study.
