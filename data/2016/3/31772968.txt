Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Many treatment modalities were developed for HCC, including surgical resection, percutaneous ethanol injection, radiofrequency ablation, transarterial chemoembolization, liver transplantation, and sorafenib therapy. Our institution has shown that proton beam therapy (PBT) is also a safe, effective, and feasible treatment modality for HCC. The University of Tsukuba began to use PBT for HCC in 1983, and we have reported many findings during the past 3 decades. In this review, we will describe the history of PBT, our experience of using PBT for HCC, and its application based on tumor location, thrombosis, tumor size, and liver function.
