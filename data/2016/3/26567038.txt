A decade ago we proposed to enlist for transplantation those patients with resected hepatocellular carcinoma in whom pathology registered pejorative histological markers (microvascular invasion and/or satellites; ab initio indication) and not wait for the appearance of recurrence. This study evaluates the outcome of this approach. From 1995 to 2012, 164 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma underwent resection. Eighty-five patients were potential candidates for liver transplantation and were considered for it upon detection of pejorative histological markers. Patients without these markers were followed, and salvage liver transplantation was considered upon development of tumor recurrence/liver function impairment. Thirty-seven patients were at high risk and 48 at low risk of recurrence at pathology. Twenty-three out of 37 high-risk patients recurred during follow-up, but in nine of them the tumor burden extent contraindicated liver transplantation. Seventeen were finally transplanted: 10 of them presented recurrence at imaging/explant. After a median posttransplant follow-up of 50.9 months, hepatocellular carcinoma had recurred in two patients and five patients had died, the 5-year survival being 82.4%. Twenty-six of the 48 low-risk patients developed recurrence, and 11 of them were transplanted. After a median posttransplant follow-up of 59 months, two patients developed recurrence and five died, their 5-year survival being 81.8%.Conclusion:Enlistment of patients at high risk of HCC recurrence after resection but before recurrence development seems a valid strategy and is associated with excellent long-term outcome; as early (
