Stepwise pH-responsive nanoparticle system containing charge reversible pullulan-based (CAPL) shell and poly(β-amino ester) (PBAE)/poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLAG) core is designed to be used as carriers of paclitaxel (PTX) and combretastatin A4 (CA4) for combining antiangiogenesis and chemotherapy to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CAPL-coated PBAE/PLGA (CAPL/PBAE/PLGA) nanoparticles displayed step-by-step responses to weakly acidic tumor microenvironment (pH ≈6.5) and endo/lysosome (pH ≈5.5) respectively through the cleavage of β-carboxylic amide bond in CAPL and the "proton-sponge" effect of PBAE, thus realized the efficient and orderly releases of CA4 and PTX. In human HCC HepG2 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, CAPL/PBAE/PLGA nanoparticles significantly enhanced synergistic effects of PTX and CA4 on cell proliferation and cell migration. In HepG2 tumor-bearing mice, CAPL/PBAE/PLGA nanoparticles showed excellent tumor-targeting capability and remarkably increased inhibitory effects of PTX and CA4 on tumor growth and angiogenesis. In conclusion, this novel nanoparticle system is a promising candidate as carrier for drugs against HCC.
