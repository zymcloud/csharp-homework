Cancer/testis antigen HCA587/MAGE-C2 has been considered as a tumor specific target for immunotherapy. It has been reported that HCA587/MAGE-C2 plays an active role in tumorigenesis by promoting the growth and survival of tumor cells. However, the regulation of HCA587/MAGE-C2 expression in cancer cells remains largely unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a large family of gene regulators, have been shown to negatively regulate the expression of important cancer-related genes and contribute to the initiation and development of cancers. In this study, we conducted searches of miRNAs that regulate HCA587/MAGE-C2 expression. We combined bioinformatics tools with biological validation assays to demonstrate that HCA587/MAGE-C2 is a direct target of microRNA-874 (miR-874). Furthermore, we investigated the expression levels of miR-874 in human hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and paired adjacent normal tissues by stem-loop reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The results revealed a significant downregulation of miR-874 expression in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Finally, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-874, as well as HCA587/MAGE-C2 silencing, resulted in suppression of tumor cell proliferation and invasion. Moreover, the inhibition effects of miR-874 on cell proliferation and invasion were reversed by co-expression of HCA587/MAGE-C2 in A375 cells. Taken together, our data demonstrated that HCA587/MAGE-C2 is a direct target of miR-874, and miR-874 may function as a tumor suppressive miRNA, at least in part, by negatively regulating HCA587/MAGE-C2 expression in cancer cells.
