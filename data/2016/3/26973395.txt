Aim:To investigate the long-term survival and prognostic factors in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as a first-line treatment.Methods:From 2000 to 2013, 316 consecutive patients with 404 HCC (1.0-5.0 cm; mean: 3.2 ± 1.1 cm) underwent ultrasonography-guided percutaneous RFA as a first-line treatment. There were 250 males and 66 females with an average age of 60.1 ± 10.8 years (24-87 years). Patients were followed for 1 year to > 10 years after RFA (234, 181, 136, and 71 for 3, 5, 7, and 10 years, respectively). Overall local response rates and long-term survival rates were assessed. Survival results were generated using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox regression model.Results:In total, 548 RFA sessions were performed and major complications occurred in 10 sessions (1.8%). Local tumor progression and/or new tumor development were observed in 43.3% (132/305) of the patients during the follow-up period. Overall 5- and 10-year survival rates were 49.7% and 28.4%, respectively. Based on multivariate analysis, three factors were identified as independent prognostic factors for overall survival: Child-Pugh classification (HR = 4.054, P Conclusion:RFA can achieve acceptable outcomes for HCC patients as a first-line treatment, especially for patients with Child-Pugh class A, patients with a single tumor and patients without portal vein hypertension.
