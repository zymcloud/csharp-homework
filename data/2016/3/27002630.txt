Fucosylated haptoglobin (Fuc-Hpt) and Mac-2 binding protein (Mac-2 bp) are identified as cancer biomarkers, based on the results from a glyco-proteomic analysis. Recently, we reported that these glyco-biomarkers were associated with liver fibrosis and/or ballooning hepatocytes in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We evaluated the ability of these glycoproteins to estimate liver fibrosis in 317 patients with chronic hepatitis C. We measured the serum Fuc-Hpt and Mac-2 bp levels using a lectin-antibody ELISA and ELISA, respectively. The serum levels of both Fuc-Hpt and Mac-2 bp increased with the progression of liver fibrosis. The multivariate analysis revealed that Mac-2 bp was an independent factor associated with moderate liver fibrosis (F ≥ 2). In contrast, Fuc-Hpt was an independent factor associated with advanced liver fibrosis (F ≥ 3). In terms of evaluating liver fibrosis, the serum levels of these glycomarkers were correlated with well-known liver fibrosis indexes, such as the aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 (FIB4) index. An assay that combined the APRI or FIB4 index and the Fuc-Hpt or Mac-2 bp levels increased the AUC value for diagnosing hepatic fibrosis. Interestingly, the cumulative incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was significantly higher in the patients with elevated serum levels of Fuc-Hpt and Mac-2 bp. In conclusion, both Fuc-Hpt and Mac-2 bp could be useful glyco-biomarkers of liver fibrosis and predictors of HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis C.
