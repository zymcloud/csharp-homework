Purpose:The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of F-FDG PET/CT by predicting histopathological findings in the pretransplant evaluation of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:F-FDG PET/CT findings of 34 patients with HCC who underwent liver transplantation were reviewed retrospectively. Visual and quantitative analysis (tumor standardized uptake values normalized to the background activity of the liver: SUVmax T/L) was done. PET tumor characteristics were compared with the histological analysis (differentiation and microvascular invasion). All patients were followed up (mean, 12 months).Results:Ten patients showed tumoral uptake greater than background activity (PET+). Higher-grade tumor was more common in the F-FDG-avid tumor group (P Conclusions:F-FDG uptake is predictive for microvascular invasion and tumor differentiation. This examination has a prognostic value regarding tumor recurrence after liver transplantation for HCC.
