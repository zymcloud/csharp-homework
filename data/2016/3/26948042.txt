AKR1B10 is involved in hepatocarcinogenesis via modulation of fatty acid and lipid synthesis. AKR1B10 inhibition results in apoptosis of tumor cells whose lipids, especially phospholipids, were decreased by over 50%, suggesting involvement of phospholipids like sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in AKR1B10's oncogenic function. Using a co-culture system, we found that co-culture of QSG-7701 (human hepatocyte) with HepG2 (hepatoma cell line) increases QSG-7701's proliferation, in which AKR1B10-S1P signaling plays a pivotal role. Consistent with previous findings, AKR1B10 mRNA and protein levels were higher in primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC) tissues than in peri-tumor tissues. Interestingly, the level of S1P was also higher in PHC tissues than in peri-tumor tissues. After analyzing the correlation between AKR1B10 mRNA expression in PHC tissues and the clinical data, we found that AKR1B10 mRNA expression was associated with serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, and lymph node metastasis, but not with other clinicopathologic variables. A higher AKR1B10 mRNA expression level is related to a shorter DFS (disease free survival) and OS (overall survival), serving as an independent predictor of DFS and OS in PHC patients with surgical resection.
