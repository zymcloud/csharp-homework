The present study determines the oncologic outcome of the combined resection and ablation strategy for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). Between January 1994 and December 2014, 360 patients underwent surgery for CRLM. There were 280 patients who underwent hepatic resection only (group 1) and 80 hepatic resection plus ablation (group 2). group 2 patients had a higher incidence of multiple metastases than group 1 cases (100% in group 2 vs. 28.2% in group 1; P<0.001) and bilobar involvement (76.5% in group 2 vs. 12.9% in group 1; P<0.001). Perioperative mortality was nil in either group with a higher postoperative complication rate amongst group 1 vs. group 2 cases (18 vs. 0, respectively). The median follow-up was 90 months (range, 1-180) with a 5-year overall survival for group 1 and group 2 of 49 and 80%, respectively (P=0.193). The median disease-free survival for patients with R0 resection was 50, 43 and 34% at 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively, and remained steadily higher (at 50%) in those patients treated with resection combined with ablation up to 5 years (P=0.069). The only intraoperative ablation failure was for a large lesion (â‰¥5 cm). Our data support the use of intraoperative ablation when complete hepatic resection cannot be achieved.
