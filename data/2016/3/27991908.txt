The effects of paracrine action from early activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) on resident liver epithelium cells are not clear. Here, we investigated whether a systemic infusion of early activated HSC-derived paracrine factors (HSC-CM) would evoke an enhanced liver protective response in acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver injury (ALI) in mice and explored the possible underlying mechanisms. The survival rate, liver injury, and liver regeneration were analyzed in mice with or without HSC-CM treatment in vivo. A systemic infusion of HSC-CM provided a significant survival benefit in APAP-induced ALI. HSC-CM therapy resulted in a reduction of hepatocellular death and increased numbers of both proliferating hepatocytes and adult hepatic progenitor cells (AHPCs) with up-regulation of liver regeneration relevant genes. The HSC-CM treatment reduced leukocyte infiltration and down-regulated systemic inflammation with decreases in IFN-γ, IL-1ra, IL-1β, TNF-α, and increases in IL-10. The direct anti-death and pro-regeneration effects of HSC-CM on AHPCs were demonstrated using in vitro assays. Treatment with HSC-CM promoted AHPCs proliferation and resulted in increased pAkt expression in vitro, and this effect was abolished by the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002. These data provide evidence that early activated HSC-CM therapy offered trophic support to the acutely injured liver by inhibiting liver cell death and stimulating regeneration, potentially creating a new method for the treatment of ALI.
