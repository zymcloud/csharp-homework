Background:Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a tumor marker used widely for detecting the recurrence and predicting the prognosis of colorectal cancer. This study investigates the possibility of serial measurement of serum CEA in several weeks after liver resection for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) in detecting earlier detection of recurrence.Methods:From 2007 to 2014, CEA levels were assessed at 1 week and at 2-3 weeks after curative-intent liver resection among a total of 240 patients with CRLM. The CEA half-life was calculated and patients were divided into two groups: those with a CEA half-life ≤10 days or normalized (Group S), and those with a CEA half-life >10 days or rising (Group L).Results:The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates in Group S versus Group L were 91.3% versus 83.3%, 64.0% versus 41.3%, and 44.2% versus 29.3%, respectively (P = 0.0079). Multivariate analysis revealed that resection of extrahepatic lesions, four or more lesions of liver metastases, and categorization in Group L were independent factors of rapid recurrence within 100 days.Conclusion:A CEA half-life >10 days or rising 1 month after curative-intent liver resection was associated with rapid recurrence of CRLM within 100 days.
