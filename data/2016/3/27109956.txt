Background:Elderly donor livers are thought to be marginal graft. In the present study, we aimed to identify an age threshold to consider a graft as elderly to identify the trend (if any) of the donor age in our series and to identify an efficient allocation criteria for elderly grafts.Methods:We reviewed in a retrospective manner our series of 1520 liver transplants, comparing graft survival under and over a certain age. On the basis of the results of this analysis, we identified a threshold of 70 years to define a graft as old. The donor age trend analysis showed an increasing rate of transplants from elderly donors.Results:To identify efficient allocation criteria for elderly graft, we stratified the series by the disease of the recipient: 556 patients underwent transplants for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC+ group) and 964 for other diseases (HCC- group). Two hundred twenty-one patients of 556 of the HCC+ group were hepatitis c virus (HCV) negative (HCC+/HCV- group), and 312 of 964 of the HCC- group were HCV positive (HCC-/HCV+). The survival analysis showed no significant differences in comparing the outcome for elderly and young grafts in the HCC+ (P = .135) and HCC- (P = .055) groups.Conclusions:When comparing the survival of old and young livers in the HCC+/HCV- group, the elderly livers appear to have a better outcome (P = .05); on the other hand, the same analysis in the HCC-/HCV+ group shows a worse outcome for old-aged grafts (P = .026). Therefore, the present study suggests that elderly livers should be allocated to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and should be avoided in HCV+ recipients.
