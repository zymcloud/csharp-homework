The interplay between viral and host factors plays a major role in viral pathogenesis. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem that leads to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although HBV proteins have been studied extensively about their implication in hepatocarcinogenesis, the molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis are still largely unknown. A recent concept in gene regulation, in which competitive endogenous RNAs compete for common microRNAs (miRNAs), suggests that mRNA targets are key elements in the regulation of miRNA availability. Here, we show that HBV mRNA in the preS2 region can be targeted by host miRNA let-7 g. This leads to the sequestration of let-7 g and inhibition of let-7 g function. The expression of HBV transcripts, including the preS2 region, de-repressed let-7 g targets, which may contribute to long-term oncogenesis. HBV transcript-expressing transgenic mice, but not non-targeted transcript-expressing mice, were more prone to chemically induced hepatoocarcinogenesis. Let-7 target protein expression was upregulated in human HCC tissues derived from HBV-infected patients. On the other hand, let-7 g inhibited HBV preS2 protein expression and viral products. These results suggest that the interplay between viral intermediate transcripts during HBV replication and host miRNAs is crucial to the pathogenesis of chronic viral infection.
