Introduction:Hepatitis B virus infection (VHB) is a serious condition which can lead to serious complications, such as cirrhosis and hepato-cellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV genotypes greatly influence its evolution and the effectiveness of treatment. The aim was to evaluate the HBV genotypes and the evolutionary pathways of chronic HBsAG patients.Methods:A cross-sectional study was conducted at the University Hospital of Kamenge and at the Digestive and liver diseases Center "CEMADIF" between June 2013 and Mai 2014. Genotyping, quantitative assay of HBeAG and HBV DNA levels were determined in the CERBA Laboratory Cergy Pontoise, France. Fibrotest or Fibroscan were used to evaluate fibrosis.Results:In total 33 patients (52,4% were males, median age 38,1) were enrolled. According to evolutionary markers, 112 patients (78,3%) had negative HBeAG. As regards the viral load, 106 patients (74,2%) had viremia lower than 2000UI/ml and minimal fibrosis below 7 kPa according FibroScan. Of these, 13 patients had undetectable HBV DNA (0,8UI/ml). It was possible to determine genotype in 51 patients who had a high enough viremia to technically enable dosing. These patients had genotype A.Conclusion:HBV genotype-A is the most common in Bujumbura. It is associated with HBV inactive carries.
