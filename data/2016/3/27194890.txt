Background:There are no univocal opinions on the role of genetic thrombophilia on splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT). We defined genetic thrombophilia the presence of one of these thrombophilic genetic factors (THRGFs): PAI-1 4G-4G, MTHFR 677TT, V Leiden 506Q, and prothrombin 20210A.Objectives:To evaluate the frequencies of these THRGFs in SVT patients, we analyzed individual data of 482 Caucasian patients, recruited from 2000 to 2014 in three prospective studies. SVT was defined as the presence of thrombosis of portal (PVT), mesenteric (MVT), splenic (SPVT), cava (CT), and hepatic vein (Budd Chiari syndrome, BCS). Pre-hepatic SVT (pre-HSVT) was defined as PVT with or without MVT/SPVT, without BCS. Post-hepatic SVT (post-HSVT) was BCS with or without PVT/MVT/SPVT.Methods:We compared 350 patients with liver cirrhosis (LC), 47 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 37 myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), 38 associated disease (AD), 10 without any associated disease (WAD), vs 150 healthy controls (HC); 437 patients showed pre-HSVT and 45 post-HSVT.Results:Thrombophilia was present in 294/482 (60.9%) patients: 189/350 LC (54.0%), 31/47 (66.0%) HCC, 29/39 (74.4%) MPN, 35/38 AD (92.1%), and 10/10 (100%) WAD, and 54/150 (36.0%) in HC. In the total group, we found 175 PAI-1 4G-4G, 130 MTHFR 677TT, 42V Leiden 506Q, and 27 prothrombin 20210A; 75 patients showed presence of >1 TRHGF; the more frequent association was PAI-1 4G-4G/MTHFR 677TT, in 36 patients. PAI-1 4G-4G and MTHFR 677TT were significantly more frequent in patients with SVT (P values Conclusions:Our study shows the significant prevalence of PAI-1 4G-4G and MTHFR 677TT in SVT, mainly in post-HSVT.
