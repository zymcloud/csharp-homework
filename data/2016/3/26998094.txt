Liver cancer, of which the most common form is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide. Immunotherapy based on the direct attack of tumor cells and the stimulation of an antitumor immune response may represent a novel strategy to control HCC recurrence and metastasis. The present study reports the case of a patient with HCC, and describes the safety and feasibility of successful administration with a mass of autologous activated T cells on numerous occasions subsequent to liver transplantation (LT), in order to kill the residual tumor cells and stimulate the immune system. A large number of infused activated T cells may pose a potential risk to the allograft. However, no acute or delayed adverse effects of cytokine-induced killer cell (CIK) therapy, or other symptoms of secondary acute host-versus-graft disease (HVGD), were observed. These observations demonstrate the relatively low toxicity of CIK infusion to a patient that has undergone LT, and more importantly, they demonstrate the feasibility of this immunotherapy for the patient, following successful LT.
