Background:Accurate assessment of characteristics of tumor and portal vein tumor thrombus is crucial in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma.Aims:Comparison of the three-dimensional imaging with multiple-slice computed tomography in the diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus.Method:Patients eligible for surgical resection were divided into the three-dimensional imaging group or the multiple-slice computed tomography group according to the type of preoperative assessment. The clinical data were collected and compared.Results:74 patients were enrolled into this study. The weighted Îº values for comparison between the thrombus type based on preoperative evaluation and intraoperative findings were 0.87 for the three-dimensional reconstruction group (n = 31) and 0.78 for the control group (n = 43). Three-dimensional reconstruction was significantly associated with a higher rate of en-bloc resection of tumor and thrombus (P = 0.025). Using three-dimensional reconstruction, significant correlation existed between the predicted and actual volumes of the resected specimens (r = 0.82, P Conclusion:For hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus, three-dimensional imaging was efficient in facilitating surgical treatment and benefiting postoperative survivals.
