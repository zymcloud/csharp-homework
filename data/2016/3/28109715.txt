A tumor composed of large eosinophilic cells in the liver raises concern for hepatocellular carcinoma, which is typically composed of such cells. However, there are other tumors, both primary and metastatic, that may be composed predominantly of large epithelioid cells. Distinction of these tumors from hepatocellular carcinoma and from each other is of obvious importance for patient management. Similarly, a clear cell tumor anywhere in the body triggers suspicion for renal cell carcinoma. However, other tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma can rarely be composed entirely of cell cells and the distinction of these from one another, and of primary from metastatic disease is vital. As with the latter, accurate diagnosis is essential for patient management. Using illustrative examples, this article discusses differential diagnosis of liver tumors comprised predominantly of epithelioid cells or clear cells.
