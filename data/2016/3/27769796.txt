Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is known for its metastatic potential. The most common sites are liver, adrenal, bone and brain. We report a case of a 37year old female patient, diagnosed with SCLC, presenting with gingival metastasis, an unusual metastatic site. Radiation therapy to the metastatic lesion to a dose of 20 Gray in 5 fractions over 5days was delivered which achieved haemostasis and good palliation. However, the patient expired in 2months owing to systemic metastasis.
