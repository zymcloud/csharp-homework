Micro RNA (miR)-486-5p is often aberrantly expressed in human cancers. The aim of this study was to identify the prognostic value of miR-486-5p expression in digestive system cancers. Tissue microarrays were constructed with 680 samples including 185 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs), 90 gastric adenocarcinomas (GCs), and 60 digestive system cancer tissues from 10 ESCC, 10 GC, 10 colon, 10 rectum, 10 liver, 10 pancreatic cancer, and corresponding normal tissues. Twenty normal digestive system mucosa tissues from healthy volunteers were included as normal controls. In GC, miR-486-5p expression was decreased in 62.8% of cases (59/94), increased in 33.0% (31/94), and unchanged in 4.2% (4/94); in ESCC its expression was decreased in 66.2% (129/195), increased in 32.3% (63/195), and unchanged in 1.5% (3/195). Expression of miR-486-5p was decreased in 12, and increased in 8, of 20 cases of colon or rectum cancer; decreased in 6, and increased in 4, of 10 cases of liver cancer; and decreased in 8, and increased in 2, of 10 cases of pancreatic cancer. Multivariate and univariate regression analysis demonstrated that low/unchanged miR-486-5p predicted poor prognosis in ESCC (hazard ratio [HR], 4.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.62-7.14; P < 0.001; HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 2.43-6.22; P < 0.001, respectively) and GC (HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.35-4.50; P = 0.003; HR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.39-4.69; P = 0.002, respectively). MiR-486-5p might therefore be an independent tumor marker for evaluating prognosis in patients with ESCC or GC.
