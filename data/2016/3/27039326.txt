Purpose:The aim of this study was to develop a quantitative measurement of perfusion reduction using color-coded digital subtraction angiography (ccDSA) to monitor intra-procedural arterial stasis during TACE.Materials and methods:A total number of 35 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who had undergone TACE were enrolled into the study. Pre- and post-two-dimensional digital subtraction angiography scans were conducted with same protocol and post-processed with ccDSA prototype software. Time-contrast-intensity (CI[t]) curve was obtained by region-of-interest (ROI) measurement on the generated ccDSA image. Quantitative 2D perfusion parameters time to peak, area under the curve (AUC), maximum upslope, and contrast intensity peak (CI-Peak) derived from the ROI-based CI[t] curve for pre- and post-TACE were evaluated to assess the reduction of antegrade blood flow and tumor blush. Relationships between 2D perfusion parameters, subjective angiographic chemoembolization endpoint (SACE) scale, and clinical outcomes were analyzed.Results:Area normalized AUC and CI-Peak revealed significant reduction after the TACE (P Conclusion:ccDSA application provides an objective approach to quantify the perfusion reduction and subjectively evaluate the arterial stasis of antegrade blood flow and tumor blush caused by TACE.
