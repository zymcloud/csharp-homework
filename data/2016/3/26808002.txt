Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), the main hydrolysate of glycyrrhizic acid extracted from the root of licorice, has been used in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy. Particularly, GA as a ligand in HCC therapy has been widely explored in different drug delivery systems, including liposomes, micelles, and nanoparticles. There is considerable interest worldwide with respect to the development of GA-modified drug delivery systems due to the extensive presence of GA receptors on the surface of hepatocyte. Up until now, much work has been focused on developing GA-modified drug delivery systems which bear good liver- or hepatocyte-targeted efficiency both in vitro and in vivo. Owing to its contribution in overcoming the limitations of low lipophilicity and poor bioavailability as well as its ability to promote receptor-mediated endocytosis, GA-modified drug delivery systems play an important role in enhancing liver-targeting efficacy and thus are focused on the treatment of HCC. Moreover, since GA-modified delivery systems present more favorable pharmacokinetic properties and hepatocyte-targeting effects, they may be a promising formulation for GA in the treatment of HCC. In this review, we will give an overview of GA-modified novel drug delivery systems, paying attention to their efficacy in treating HCC and discussing their mechanism and the treatment effects.
