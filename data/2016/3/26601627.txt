Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. An increasing number of reports describe HCC in the setting of obesity and diabetes, two major risk factors for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The increasing incidence of these conditions and the emerging evidence of HCC in non-cirrhotic NAFLD prioritize a better understanding of NAFLD-related HCC epidemiology and pathogenesis in order to target screening policies and develop preventive-therapeutic strategies. In this review, we focus on the epidemiological impact of this condition, suggesting a possible link between HCC in cryptogenic cirrhosis and NAFLD. Furthermore, we analyse the suggested pathogenic mechanisms and the possible preventive-therapeutic strategies.
