A healthy and asymptomatic 55-year-old woman underwent a complete (R0) non-anatomical resection of an incidentally detected solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a non-cirrhotic liver. Six years following the initial R0 non-anatomical resection, intrahepatic recurrence was diagnosed and the patient underwent a second R0 non-anatomical resection. At 12.5 years following the initial resection, a further intrahepatic recurrence was diagnosed, which was once again completely resected by left lateral hepatectomy. This represents one of the longest reported periods between initial resection and HCC recurrence, following repeated R0 resections in the absence of cirrhosis. The appropriate surveillance period and genetic testing protocol for such cases remains to be established.
