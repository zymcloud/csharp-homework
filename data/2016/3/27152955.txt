Aim:Acting as a tumor suppressor, microRNA (miR)-125b shows aberrant low expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and researchers have found that its dysregulation has a close relationship with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Here, we investigated the expression profile of this miRNA in the plasma of healthy subjects and patients with chronic HBV-related liver diseases in order to confirm the feasibility of this circulating miRNA as a differential diagnostic biomarker for HBV-induced HCC (HBV-HCC).Methods:A total of 242 individuals were enrolled in this study. The expression levels of plasma miR-125b were examined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction technology.Results:The levels of plasma miR-125b were remarkably decreased in HBV-HCC patients compared to healthy controls and HBV subjects without HCC (all P Conclusion:The measurement of plasma-based miR-125b holds promise as a diagnostic marker for HBV-HCC differential diagnosis and for chronic HBV viral infection. Those HBV-infected individuals with increased risk of HCC would be detected early through monitoring the changes in this circulating miRNA.
