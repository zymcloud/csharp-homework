Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) represents a valuable choice in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, local recurrence of HCC is common after RFA. Here, 20 primary HCC patients treated by RFA were enrolled. Before (termed 0d) and after RFA treatment for 1 and 7 days (termed 1d and 7d, respectively), plasma and noncancerous tissue were collected. ELISA assay showed that plasma C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) was increased in ten patients (type I patients) but decreased in the other 10 patients (type II patients). The mean interval for HCC recurrence in type I patients was less than the mean interval in type II patients. Interestingly, a significant negative correlation between interval for HCC recurrence and fold change of plasma CXCL10 (1d/0d or 7d/0d) was identified, suggesting that RFA-induced CXCL10 is associated with earlier HCC recurrence. Immunofluorescence assay showed that the receptor of CXCL10, chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 3 (CXCR3), was significantly increased in type I, but not type II, patients after RFA. In vitro assay demonstrated that CXCL10 stimulus increased the rate of CD133(+) cancer stem cells (CSCs) in HepG2 cells by binding to CXCR3 and then inducing c-Myc expression. Many studies have reported that induction of CD133(+) CSCs contributes to HCC recurrence. Thus, CXCL10-increased CD133(+) CSCs by activating CXCR3/c-Myc pathway might accelerate HCC recurrence after RFA. These data might have potential implications for HCC therapy.
