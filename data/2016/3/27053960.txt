Recent studies indicated that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) played important regulatory roles in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. However, the contribution of small nucleolar RNA host gene 20 (SNHG20) to cancer development remains largely unknown. The aim of the study is to investigate the expression of SNHG20 and its clinical significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our results showed that the expression of SNHG20 was remarkably up-regulated in HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor liver tissues from 49 fresh HCC samples (cohort 1) detected by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR, P = 0.004). The results were confirmed in 144 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded HCC tissues (cohort 2) by in situ hybridization (ISH). Meanwhile, the expression of SNHG20 was associated with tumor size (P = 0.027 for cohort 1 and P = 0.046 for cohort 2) and clinical stage (P = 0.027 for cohort 1 and P = 0.028 for cohort 2). Importantly, patients with high expression of SNHG20 had a shorter overall survival (OS, P
