Objective:To investigate the relationship between the expression of immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (Bip) and calreticulin (CRT) and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Western blot and RT-qPCR were used to detect the expression of Bip and CRT in normal hepatic cells and hepatocellular carcinoma cells. 43 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma tissues were collected from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University between June 2014 and May 2015, Western blot and immunohistochemistry assay were used to detect the expression of Bip and CRT in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, adjacent non-cancer tissues, 5 cases adjacent liver hemangioma tissues and the clinical significance was also analyzed.Results:The expression of Bip and CRT in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and hepatocellular carcinoma tissues was higher than normal hepatic cells and adjacent non-cancer tissues and also adjacent liver hemangioma tissues. The positive rate of Bip and CRT were 86.0%(37/43) and 65.1%(28/43) in 43 hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, which was significantly higher than those adjacent non-cancer tissues and adjacent liver hemangioma tissues (PConclusions:The expression of Bip and CRT is correlation with metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma.
