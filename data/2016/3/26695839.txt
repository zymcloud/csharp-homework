Background:Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is associated with poor survival. This study compared the outcomes of patients with unresectable ICC treated with hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) plus systemic chemotherapy (SYS) with the outcomes of patients treated with SYS alone.Methods:Consecutive patients with ICC were retrospectively reviewed. Clinicopathologic data were reviewed. Survival rates were compared by Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank testing.Results:Between January 2000 and August 2012, 525 patients with ICC were evaluated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and 236 patients with unresectable tumors (locally advanced or metastatic) were analyzed. Disease was confined to the liver in 104 patients, who underwent treatment with combined HAI and SYS (n = 78 or 75%) or SYS alone (n = 26 or 25%). The response rate in the combined group was better than the rate in the group receiving SYS alone, although this did not reach statistical significance (59% vs 39%, P = .11). Overall survival for the combined group was longer than overall survival for the patients who received SYS alone (30.8 vs 18.4 months, P < .001), and this difference was maintained when patients with portal lymph node disease were included in the survival analysis (29.6 months with HAI and SYS [n = 93] vs 15.9 months with SYS [n = 74], P < .001). Eight patients who initially presented with unresectable tumors responded enough to undergo complete resection and had a median overall survival of 37 months (range, 10.4-92.3 months).Conclusions:In patients with unresectable ICC confined to the liver or with limited regional nodal disease, a combination of SYS and HAI chemotherapy is associated with greater survival than SYS alone.
