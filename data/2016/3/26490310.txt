Purpose:Nesvacumab (REGN910) is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that specifically binds and inactivates the Tie2 receptor ligand Ang2 with high affinity, but shows no binding to Ang1. The main objectives of this trial were to determine the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of nesvacumab.Experimental design:Nesvacumab was administered intravenously every two weeks with dose escalations from 1 to 20 mg/kg in patients with advanced solid tumors.Results:A total of 47 patients were treated with nesvacumab. No patients in the dose escalation phase experienced DLTs, therefore a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached. The most common nesvacumab-related adverse events were fatigue (23.4%), peripheral edema (21.3%), decreased appetite, and diarrhea (each 10.6%; all grade ≤ 2). Nesvacumab was characterized by linear kinetics and had a terminal half-life of 6.35 to 9.66 days in a dose-independent manner. Best response by RECIST 1.1 in 43 evaluable patients included 1 partial response (adrenocortical carcinoma) of 24 weeks duration. Two patients with hepatocellular carcinoma had stable disease (SD) > 16 weeks, with tumor regression and >50% decrease in α-fetoprotein. Analyses of putative angiogenesis biomarkers in serum and tumor biopsies were uninformative for treatment duration.Conclusions:Nesvacumab safety profile was acceptable at all dose levels tested. Preliminary antitumor activity was observed in patients with treatment-refractory advanced solid tumors. On the basis of cumulative safety, antitumor activity, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, the 20 mg/kg dose was determined to be the RP2D.
