Background and aim:Entecavir is one of the most-used nucleoside analogues for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The aim of this study was to clarify the effects of long-term entecavir treatment on the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The participants were 249 patients with chronic HBV infection who had been treated by entecavir for more than 2 years. Hepatic functional reserve and incidence of HCC were evaluated, and the factors that might contribute to the development of HCC were analyzed.Results:Prothrombin activity was significantly elevated at 60 months after starting entecavir (from 85.9 ± 17.4 to 97.0 ± 16.9%, p Conclusions:Long-term treatment with entecavir improved hepatic functional reserve and decreased the incidence of HCC over time after 3 years. To decrease the incidence of HCC, careful induction of long-term entecavir treatment in younger patients with chronic HBV infection and better hepatic functional reserve would be important.
