Purpose:The aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index were developed as a non-invasive parameter for predicting liver fibrosis. This study aimed to validate the APRI and FIB-4 indexes in patients treated with curative therapy for non-B non-C (NBNC) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Accumulated database comprising 399 patients who underwent hepatectomy was reviewed retrospectively. Analyses were performed to evaluate whether the APRI and FIB-4 indexes are predictors of liver cirrhosis and/or the prognosis in patients with NBNC-HCC. Forty-seven patients with NBNC-HCC who underwent curative radiofrequency ablation therapy (RFA) in the same period were enrolled as the validation set.Results:The APRI and FIB-4 indexes were significantly higher in the cirrhosis group than in the no-cirrhosis group (P = 0.001 and P Conclusions:The present findings showed that the FIB-4 index is a significant predictor of background liver cirrhosis and the prognosis after curative resection for NBNB-HCC.
