Aims:Sarcopenia and physical disability assessed by a 6-min walking test (6MWT) are associated with poor prognosis of patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). However, CLD patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mostly rest in bed during hospitalization. We aimed to investigate the effects of therapeutic exercise on liver function, 6MWT, and skeletal muscle mass during HCC treatment in patients with CLD.Methods:We enrolled 54 CLD patients with HCC (median age, 76 years). During hospitalization, patients performed a combination of stretching, strength training, balance practice, and endurance training (2.5-4 metabolic equivalents/20 min/day). Primary outcomes were changes from admission to discharge in Child-Pugh class, 6MWT, and skeletal muscle mass. Furthermore, factors associated with skeletal muscle atrophy were analyzed by a decision-tree analysis.Results:Exercise did not worsen the Child-Pugh class. On discharge, the 6MWT ambulation distance was maintained, and heart rate variability during the 6MWT was significantly improved compared to that on admission (area under the curve 50.3 vs. 39.0 arbitrary units; P = 0.0027). Although skeletal muscle mass was significantly reduced (20.6 kg vs. 20.0 kg, P = 0.0301), branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) treatment was identified as the most distinguishable factor for minimizing muscle mass atrophy (-1.1 kg vs. -0.5 kg/hospitalization).Conclusions:Therapeutic exercise improved physical ability without worsening liver function during hospitalization for HCC treatment in CLD patients. Although exercise did not completely prevent skeletal muscle atrophy, BCAA treatment minimized the skeletal muscle atrophy. Thus, exercise with BCAA treatment may be important for the management of CLD patients with HCC.
