A 40-years-old Japanese female suffering from misswallowing and hoarseness, who had undergone hepatectomy due to hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) 4 years before, revealed solitary subaortic mass in the chest computed tomography scan and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. The mass was surgically resected by video assisted thoracoscopic surgery and pathological examination revealed lymph node metastasis of HCC. Symptoms of recurrent nerve palsy disappeared after surgery.
