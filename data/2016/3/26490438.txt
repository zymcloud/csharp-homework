Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most frequent cancer and the third cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The primary risk factor for HCC is liver cirrhosis secondary to persistent infection with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus. Although a number of cellular phenomena and molecular events have been reported to facilitate tumor initiation, progression and metastasis, the exact etiology of HCC has not yet been fully uncovered. miRNA, a class of non-coding RNA, negatively regulate post-transcriptional processes that participate in crucial biological processes, including development, differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation. In the liver, specific miRNA can be negative regulators of gene expression. Recent studies have uncovered the contribution of miRNA to cancer pathogenesis as they can function as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. In addition, other studies have demonstrated their potential value in the clinical management of patients with HCC as some miRNA may be used as prognostic or diagnostic markers. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the roles of miRNA in the carcinogenesis and progression of HCC.
