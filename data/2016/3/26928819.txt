Primary care physicians have the resources they need to screen for a cancer that's growing in prevalence and hitting Texas harder than almost any other state. What's missing is awareness of what physicians can do to facilitate early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of primary liver cancer. That's what a TMA Foundation-funded workgroup, Texas HepCA, is trying to change as HCC rates in the state continue to rise, particularly among the Hispanic population in South Texas.
