Objective:To evaluate the clinical effects of autologous cytokine-induced killer cell(CIK) on the cumulative survival and reactivation rate of hepatitics B virus(HBV) after radiofrequency ablation(RFA) combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(TACE).Methods:A total of 156 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated from June 2006 to September 2012 in Shengli Oilfield Central Hosptial were divided into control group(RFA, TACE) and research group(RFA, TACE, CIK). According to the tumors number, diameter and vascular invasion condition, the patients were divided into another 4 groups: the high and low risk group with tumor ≤5 cm, the high and low risk group with tumor>5 cm.The prognosis of these groups was analyzed. The effects on HBV reactivation rate between antiviral and unantiviral patients were respectively analyzed .Results:The ratios of the research and control group over 1-, 3-, 5-year were 75.3%(70/93), 58.9%(53/90), 21.5%(20/93)vs 71.4%(45/63), 55.6%(35/63), 22.2%(14/63)(P>0.05), the ratios of the research and control group in the high risk group with tumor≤5 cm were 75.0%(18/24), 58.3%(14/24), 37.5%(9/24)vs 58.8%(10/17), 41.2%(7/17), 23.5%(4/17)(PConclusion:Postoperative adjuvant CIK therapy with tumor≤5 cm after RFA combined with TACE is beneficial to the high risk group and decreases the risk of HBV reactivation.
