Liver transplantation requires thorough preoperative imaging. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) and MR imaging are the main modalities utilized for this purpose. Radiation-reducing protocols, advanced imaging techniques for evaluation of parenchymal fat and iron content, and 3-dimenionsal and volumetric reformations are routinely used. The helpful diagnostic radiologist has a complete understanding of indications for transplant, the indications for bridging and/or down-staging therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma, and the components of the transplant operation. With this information at hand, the radiologist can craft a thorough, yet succinct report that will help the surgeon plan and execute successful donor and recipient transplant operations.
