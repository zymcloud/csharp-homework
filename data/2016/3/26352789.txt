Background & aims:There has been remarkable progress in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during the last several decades, but its effect on the prognosis of HCC patient needs clarification. We analysed the changes that affected prognosis of HCC patients diagnosed over two different eras.Methods:A retrospective study of 1318 patients diagnosed with HCC from 1986 to 2012 was conducted. Analysis was done according to two cohorts, cohort 1 (patients diagnosed with HCC from 1986 to 1992) and cohort 2 (patients diagnosed from 2006 to 2012).Results:Hepatitis B virus was the most common cause of liver disease for both cohorts (66.2% and 66.0%). The proportion of patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 0/A was significantly lower in cohort 1 than in cohort 2 (14.4% vs. 39.5%, P Conclusions:Implementation of national cancer surveillance and the advancement of treatment modalities have likely led to early detection of HCC and improvements in prognosis over the last 20 years.
