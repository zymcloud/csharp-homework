Introduction:In extreme obesity, bariatric surgery or weight loss by lifestyle modification is often not possible because of presence of decompensated cirrhosis. Endoscopic intragastric balloon placement may be used as minimal invasive technique to promote weight loss and make them better candidates for liver transplantation surgery; however, there is no literature in this regard.Methods:Patients with body mass index (BMI) >40 kg/m(2) or BMI between 35 and 40 (with a low graft to recipient weight ratio) were considered for weight reduction modalities including dietary counseling and intragastric balloon placement when feasible.Results:Intragastric balloon placement was done in six males and two females, age 46 ± 5 years, BMI 43.5 ± 6.9 kg/m(2). All patients (except one with hepatocellular carcinoma) had decompensated liver disease, mean Child score was 8.5 ± 1.6. Five of them had successful liver transplantation (three deceased and two living donor liver transplantation) after weight loss, while three are waiting. All these five patients had uneventful post-transplant course. All patients had transient vomiting except one, in whom volume of balloon was decreased due to persistent vomiting. All patients except one had weight loss. None of patients had any serious complications. Three of five patients maintained weight loss post-transplant also.Conclusion:Intragastric balloon placement is a useful modality for promoting short-term weight loss and thereby making morbidly obese recipients fit for liver transplantation surgery.
