We aimed to investigate regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) by interferon alpha (IFN-α) and to analyze the relationship between STAT3 and SOCS3 during hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Changes in STAT3 and SOCS3 were analyzed at both mRNA and protein levels in human hepatoma cells infected with HCV (J6/JFH1). At 72h of HCV infection, STAT3 expression was decreased with sustained phosphorylation, and IFN-α increased such decrease and phosphorylation. HCV increased SOCS3 expression, while IFN-α impaired such increase, indicating different regulation of STAT3 and SOCS3 by IFN-α. IFN-α-induced expression and phosphorylation of upstream kinases of the JAK/STAT pathway, Tyk2 and Jak1, were suppressed by HCV. Moreover, knockdown of STAT3 by RNA interference led to decreases in HCV RNA replication and viral protein expression, without affecting either the expression of Tyk2 and Jak1 or the SOCS3 induction in response to IFN-α. These results show that IFN-α antagonizes STAT3 and SOCS3 signaling triggered by HCV and that STAT3 regulation correlates inversely with SOCS3 induction by IFN-α, which may be important in better understanding the complex interplay between IFN-α and signal molecules during HCV infection.
