In recent years, an increasing number of studies have found that the interaction between CX3CL1 and its receptor plays an important role in a series of inflammatory, infectious, and neurological processes and in various cancers. Therefore, its therapeutic targeting represents a promising treatment strategy for diseases. This review summarizes the structure, biological function, and mechanism of signal transduction of CX3CL1 and its receptor, and introduces the research progress in CX3CL1 and its receptor in hepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatoma.
