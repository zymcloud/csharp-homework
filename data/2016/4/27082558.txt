There are several interventional therapies that improve the prognosis and increase the survival rate of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (early-stage HCC), but it is uncertain about whether one is superior to others, and available researches investigating the comparative effects of different treatments are limited. The main objective of this Bayesian network meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy of these different treatment strategies for early-stage HCC and rank these interventions for practical consideration. We performed an electronic search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, and extracted data from randomized controlled trials that compared different interventional therapies for early-stage HCC. Direct comparison and network meta-analyses were conducted with Aggregate Data Drug Information System software. Consistency models were created to determine whether there was a significant difference between any 2 therapies, and cumulative probability was used to rank different treatments. Twenty-one randomized controlled trials involving 2691 patients were included. In our network meta-analysis, the combination therapy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was associated with better 1-year survival rate, as compared with hepatic resection alone (P
