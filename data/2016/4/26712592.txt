There is paucity of literature regarding hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. In the study described herein we evaluated several aspects of HCV infection in HCT recipients, including the impact of this infection on cancer status, liver-related outcomes, mortality, and the role of antiviral treatment (AVT), including direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). The medical records of HCV-infected allogeneic and autologous HCT recipients, seen at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center from August 2009 to November 2015, were reviewed. Patients seen from August 1, 2009 to October 30, 2012 were reviewed retrospectively, whereas those seen from November 1, 2012 to November 30, 2015 were analyzed prospectively in an observational study. Of 434 HCV-infected cancer patients evaluated, 64 underwent 69 HCTs. Most (78%) underwent autologous transplantation. Thirteen percent of patients became HCV-seronegative post-HCT. Compared with patients who did not receive AVT, treated patients had fewer relapses of HCV-associated non-Hodgkin lymphomas (20% versus 86%; P = .015), higher 5-year survival rates (75% versus 39%; P = .02), and a trend toward lower rate of progression to cirrhosis (5% versus 21%; P = .06). AVT discontinuation rate post-HCT was 71% in those receiving IFN-containing regimens and 0% in those receiving DAAs (P < .01). AVT was effective in 12 of 37 patients (32%) and 11 of 13 patients (85%) receiving IFN-based and DAA regimens, respectively (P = .003). HCV is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. HCV seropositivity can be lost post-HCT, posing a diagnostic challenge. Treatment of HCV infection in HCT recipients improves both oncologic and hepatic outcomes. These patients can be successfully treated with DAAs.
