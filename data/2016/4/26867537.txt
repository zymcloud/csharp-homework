Objectives:Despite living-donor liver transplant being a life-saving therapy for patients with hepatitis B virus with or without hepatocellular carcinoma, outcomes for patients with these diseases are worse. Hepatitis B virus recurrence or relapse of hepatocellular carcinoma can result in subsequent graft loss or patient death. In this study, we discuss the postoperative outcomes of patients with hepatitis B virus infection after living-donor liver transplant.Materials and methods:We retrospectively analyzed 125 patients with hepatitis B virus-related end-stage liver disease, comparing results with 1228 control patients who had other pathologies, including hepatitis C virus, combined hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and neither virus.Results:Survival rates of patients with hepatitis B virus did not differ from the control groups (P > .05). Patients with concurrent hepatitis B virus and hepatocellular carcinoma were significantly older (P Conclusions:Our study provides details on long-term outcomes of patients with hepatitis B virus infection who had undergone living-donor liver transplant. Based on our results, we suggest that prolonged antiviral prophylactic therapy in the form of hepatitis B immunoglobulin with either lamivudine or entecavir be considered for patients who associated with risk factors to prevent postoperative recurrence.
