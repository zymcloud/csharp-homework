Background:Total laparoscopic living donor right hemihepatectomy (LDRH) has been successfully performed in several transplant centers. Here we report the first LDRH performed in mainland China and review current literature, focusing on perioperative donor evaluation and surgical procedure to secure donor safety.Methods:A 47-year-old man volunteered for living donation to his wife who suffered from sclerosing cholangitis-related liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Donor height is 165 cm and weight is 65 kg, whereas the body mass index is 23.9. The CT volume evaluation showed that the graft-to-body weight ratio was 1.42%, and the remnant liver volume was 36.3% for right graft without middle hepatic vein (MHV). The anatomy of hepatic vein, artery, portal vein, and bile duct was normal. Preoperative liver function tests were normal.Results:Intraoperative biopsy result showed minimal steatosis. A transection was performed along the right side of the MHV. Two branches of MHV (V5 and V8) were Conclusions:Total LDRH has been proven to be technically feasible in selected adult donors. Following increased experience, it might be a safe and minimally invasive option for adult donors.
