Gender disparity has long been considered as a key to fully understand hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. At the same time, immunotherapy related to IL12 still need more investigation before being applied in clinical settings. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of the androgen receptor (AR) on natural killer (NK) cell-related innate immune surveillance in liver cancer, and provide a novel therapeutic approach to suppress HCC via altering IL12A. By using in vitro cell cytotoxicity test and in vivo liver orthotopic xenograft mouse model, we identified the role of AR in modulating NK cell cytotoxicity. Luciferase report assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay were applied for mechanism dissection. IHC was performed for sample staining. Our results showed AR could suppress IL12A expression at the transcriptional level via direct binding to the IL12A promoter region that resulted in repressing efficacy of NK cell cytotoxicity against HCC, and sorafenib treatment could enhance IL12A signals via suppressing AR signals. These results not only help to explain the AR roles in the gender disparity of HCC but also provide a potential new therapy to better suppress HCC via combining sorafenib with NK cell-related immunotherapy.
