The rate of development of fibrosis varies among HCV patients and affected by many variables. We aimed to investigate the association between mutations in Factor V, prothrombin gene and thrombospondin 1 polymorphisms with hepatic fibrosis progression rate and development of HCC in patients infected with HCV and if they are potential markers for early prediction of disease progression. A total of 280 HCV-infected patients (70 with mild fibrosis, 70 with advanced fibrosis, 70 cirrhotic patients and 70 HCC patients) and 100 healthy controls were included. Factor V Leiden G1691A, prothrombin G20210A and thrombospondin 1 mutations were analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. We observed that there were no significant differences between Factor V Leiden (G1691A) or TPS-1 (A2210G) polymorphisms in the four patient subgroups and control group. In HCC patients, the frequencies of GA genotype were significantly increased compared with control subject. HCV patients carrying GA genotype were more likely to develop hepatocellular carcinoma (OR=5.4, 95% CI=1.09-27.05; P=0.026).We concluded that the risk of HCC was increased 5-fold in subjects carrying GA genotype of prothrombin G20210A gene. However, there was no evidence for a significant association between thrombogenic genes polymorphisms and progression of fibrosis in HCV Egyptian patients.
