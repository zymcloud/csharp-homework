Unresectable hepatoma accounts for the majority of malignant liver tumor cases for which embolization therapy is considered a viable treatment option. However, the potential risk of aberrant particle deposition in non-target regions could cause severe side-effects, alongside diminished efficacy. A computational model has been developed to analyze the particle-hemodynamics before and after deployment of an FDA-approved anti-reflux catheter. The catheter features a retractable, porous cone-like tip designed to allow forward blood flow while preventing microsphere reflux. A patient-specific hepatic artery system, with different daughter branches connected to a liver tumor, was chosen as a representative test bed. In vitro as well as in vivo measurements were used to validate the computer simulation model. The model captures the effect of tip-deployment on blood perfusion and pressure drop in an interactive manner under physiologically realistic conditions. A relationship between the pressure drop and embolization level was established, which can be used to provide clinicians with real-time information on the best infusion-stop point. However, the results show that the present procedure for embolization of downstream vessels which feed a tumor is quite arbitrary. Nevertheless, a method to recycle aberrant particles captured by the deployed tip was proposed to minimize side-effects.
