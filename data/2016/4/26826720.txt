Objective:To investigate practical patterns for stereotactic body radiotherapy to hepatocellular carcinoma in Korea.Methods:In June 2013, the Korean Stereotactic Radiosurgery Group of the Korean Society for Radiation Oncology conducted a national patterns-of-care survey about stereotactic body radiotherapy to the liver lesion in hepatocellular carcinoma, consisting of 19 questions and 2 clinical scenarios.Results:All 208 radiation oncologists (100%), who are regular members of Korean Society for Radiation Oncology, responded to this survey. Among these, 95 radiation oncologists were specialists for hepatology; 64 physicians did not use stereotactic body radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma, and 31 physicians used stereotactic body radiotherapy. Most physicians (52%) performed stereotactic body radiotherapy to hepatocellular carcinoma in â‰¤5 cases per year. Physicians applied stereotactic body radiotherapy according to tumour size and baseline Child-Pugh class. All physicians agreed the use of stereotactic body radiotherapy to 2.8-cm hepatocellular carcinoma with Child-Pugh class of A, while 23 physicians (74%) selected stereotactic body radiotherapy for Child-Pugh class of B. Nineteen physicians (61%) selected stereotactic body radiotherapy to 5-cm hepatocellular carcinoma with Child-Pugh class of A, and only 14 physicians (45%) selected stereotactic body radiotherapy for Child-Pugh class of B. On the other hand, the preferred dose scheme was same as 60 Gy in three fractions.Conclusions:Among radiation oncologists in Korea, there was diversity in the practice for stereotactic body radiotherapy to the liver lesion in hepatocellular carcinoma. Additional prospective studies are necessary to standardize the practice and establish Korea-specific practice guidelines for hepatocellular carcinoma stereotactic body radiotherapy.
