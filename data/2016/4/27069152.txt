Background:A right-sided hepatectomy with total caudate lobectomy is indicated for colorectal-cancer liver metastases (CLM) and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) located in the caudate lobe with extension to the right lobe of the liver. Caudate-lobe resection (i.e. segmentectomy 1 according to the Brisbane terminology) is one of the most difficult types of hepatectomy to carry out radically and safely. The deep portion of hepatic transection around the caudate lobe, hepatic veins and inferior vena cava is a critical source of massive bleeding. Prolonged transection can increase blood loss.Patients and methods:We analyzed the outcome of 10 patients who underwent right-sided hepatectomy with caudate lobectomy using a modified liver hanging maneuver (mLHM) in comparison with 16 patients who underwent the operation without mLHM.Results:Blood loss during liver transection and blood loss per unit area of cut surface were significantly less in the mLHM group (p=0.014 and 0.015, respectively). In patients diagnosed pathologically with liver impairment, transection time was significantly shorter in the mLHM group (p=0.038), as were red blood cell transfusion volume (p=0.042) and blood loss (p=0.049) during transection.Conclusion:Use of mLHM can potentially improve surgical outcomes by reducing blood loss and transection time, which are especially important for patients with liver impairment.
