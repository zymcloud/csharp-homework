Objective:Brain metastases (BM) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are rare and are associated with a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical features and evaluate the prognostic factors of brain metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:The clinical data of thirty-one patients with HCC and BM treated in the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University between January 1998 and December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed to identify possible prognostic factors.Results:Thrity-one patients were diagnosed with BM from HCC, an incidence rate of 0.61%. The median age at diagnosis of brain metastases was 48.5 years. Twenty-six patients were male. The median interval from diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma to brain metastases was 14 months. The median survival after the diagnosis of BM was 10 weeks. Univariate analysis showed that treatment modality, number of brain lesions, Karnofsky performance score, recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class, and Child-Pugh classification had a statistically significant impact on the survival. The multivariate analysis showed that the low RPA class and aggressive brain radiotherapy were positively associated with improved survival.Conclusion:BM from HCC is rare and associated with an extremely poor prognosis. However, patients with a low RPA class may benefit from aggressive brain radiotherapy.
