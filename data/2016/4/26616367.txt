Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common and deadly forms of human malignancies. JS-K, O(2)-(2, 4-dinitrophenyl) 1-[(4-ethoxycarbonyl) piperazin-1-yl] diazen-1-ium-1, 2-diolate, has the ability to induce apoptosis of tumor cell lines. In the present study, JS-K inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and significantly induced apoptosis. JS-K enhanced the ratio of Bax-to-Bcl-2, released of cytochrome c (Cyt c) from mitochondria and the activated caspase-9/3. JS-K caused an increasing cytosolic Ca(2+) and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Carboxy-PTIO (a NO scavenger) and BAPTA-AM (an intracellular Ca(2+) chelator) significantly blocked an increasing cytosolic Ca(2+) in JS-K-induced HepG2 cells apoptosis, especially Carboxy-PTIO. Meanwhile, Carboxy-PTIO and BAPTA-AM treatment both attenuate JS-K-induced apoptosis through upregulation of Bcl-2, downregulation of Bax, reduction of Cyt c release from mitochondria to cytoplasm and inactivation of caspase-9/3. In summary, JS-K induced HepG2 cells apoptosis via Ca(2+)/caspase-3-mediated mitochondrial pathway.
