Previous studies have demonstrated the aberrant expression and oncogenic role of B-cell CLL/lymphoma-3 (BCL-3) in human malignancies. However, the clinical significance of BCL-3 and its biological function in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown. In the present study, the expression levels of BCL-3 protein and mRNA in 90 pairs of HCC and matched non-tumor tissues were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR). We found that the expression levels of BCL-3 protein and mRNA in HCC tissues were significantly higher than those in the matched tumor-adjacent tissues. In addition, positive expression of BCL-3 was associated with adverse clinicopathological characteristics of the HCC patients including hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, tumor size, cirrhosis and advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. Moreover, HCC patients with positive expression of BCL-3 had significantly decreased 5-year overall survival and recurrence-free survival. Importantly, BCL-3 expression was an independent prognostic factor for indicating the survival of the HCC patients. Functionally, BCL-3 knockdown markedly inhibited cell viability, proliferation and cell cycle progression in HepG2 cells, while BCL-3 overexpression promoted these cellular processes in Huh7 cells. Accordingly, in vivo experiments indicated that BCL-3 knockdown prominently suppressed the tumor growth of HepG2 cells in nude mice. Mechanistically, we revealed that the expression of cyclin D1 was decreased after BCL-3 knockdown in the HepG2 cells and was increased after BCL-3 overexpression in the Huh7 cells. Cyclin D1 silencing was found to abrogate the functional effects of BCL-3 on cellular processes in Huh7 cells. Taken together, our data suggest that BCL-3 may serve as a promising biomarker and an effective therapeutic target of HCC.
