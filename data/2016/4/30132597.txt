Objective:To investigate the mechanism of human liver cancer HepG-2 cells apoptosis induced by total saponins of Ornithogalum caudatum( OCA-TS).Methods:The anti-proliferative effects of OCA-TS on HepG-2 cells was detected by MTT assay; the inverted microscope was used to observe cell morphology; transmission electron microscope( TEM) was used to observe the cellular ultrastructure changes; flow cytometry method was used to detect the apoptosis rate, mitochondrial membrane potential, and protein expression level of Cyt-C; Caspase-3 activity was measured by ELISA.Results:OCA-TS can inhibit the proliferation of HepG-2 cells and the IC50 was 79. 80 ± 0. 18 μg / m L. After treated by OCA-TS, cells became round, and the refractivity of cells receded, the number of suspension cells increased. By TEM method, the cells presented typical apoptosis characteristics. With the increasing of concentration of OCA-TS, cell apoptosis rate, the protein expression level of Cyt-C and the activity of Caspase-3 were increased markedly( P Conclusion:OCA-TS can effectively inhibit the proliferation of human liver cancer HepG-2 cells by inducing apoptosis of HepG-2 cells through mitochondrial pathway.
