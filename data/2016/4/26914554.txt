Hepatoid adenocarcinoma is a rare extrahepatic tumor that shows clinicopathologic and morphologic similarities to hepatocellular carcinoma. An FDG PET/CT imaging of primary mediastinal hepatoid adenocarcinoma in a 43-year-old man who had an elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein level was reported in this case. The patient's mediastinal lesion had avid FDG uptake. Hepatoid adenocarcinoma should be considered among the differential diagnoses when an FDG-avid extrahepatic mass is seen in patients with increased alpha-fetoprotein.
