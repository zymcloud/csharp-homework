It has been reported that there are multiple mechanisms by which bufalin could exert its antimetastatic effect. HIF-1α has been reported to be involved in tumor migration and invasion by regulating EMT. However, it is not known whether bufalin could exert the antimetastatic effect by modulating HIF-1α expression in hepatocellular carcinoma. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the antimetastatic potential of bufalin in vivo and in vitro. Our results demonstrated that the liver/lung metastases were significantly reduced in bufalin-treated mice, as tested in the orthotopic transplanted and tail vein injection tumor models. Furthermore, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was inhibited in bufalin-treated tumors, as reflected the upregulation of E-cadherin, and downregulation of N-cadherin, vimentin, Snail. Similar results were observed in SMMC7721 cells treated with bufalin. Moreover, the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-induced EMT was also abrogated by bufalin. Mechanistically, our study demonstrated that hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) played an important role in the antimetastatic effect of bufalin in hepatocellular carcinoma. Importantly, HIF-1α expression may be regulated through the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Taken together, our results suggest that bufalin suppresses hepatic tumor invasion and metastasis and that this process may be related to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/ HIF-1α axis.
