Background:Surgical site infection (SSI), particularly organ/space SSI, remains a clinically important issue even after laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) for gastric cancer (GC). This study aimed to identify specific clinical and surgical factors associated with organ/space SSI after LG.Methods:This was a retrospective study of 407 patients who underwent LG for clinical stage I GC. SSI was defined according to the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System. The incidence and treatment outcomes of either incisional or organ/space SSI after LG were examined, and the risk factors for each type of SSI were identified using univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:Organ/space SSI was observed in 21 patients (5.2 %), while incisional SSI was detected in 18 patients (4.4 %). Although no mortality was observed, the occurrence of either incisional or organ/space SSI significantly prolonged postoperative hospital stays (p = 0.000 and 0.000, respectively); however, organ/space SSI required more re-operations and re-admissions, and eventually longer total hospital stays than incisional SSI (p = 0.036). Intra-abdominal abscess around the pancreas was the main cause of organ/space SSI, while no anastomotic leakage was observed. Multivariate analyses identified male gender (odds ratio (OR) 3.385; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.073-15.07, p = 0.037), chronic liver disease (OR 8.897; 95 % CI 2.502-28.99, p = 0.001), and total gastrectomy (TG) (OR 3.817; 95 % CI 1.380-10.24, p = 0.011) as independent risk factors for organ/space SSI, while TG (OR 3.130; 95 % CI 1.102-8.768, p = 0.033) and operation time â‰¥320 min (OR 3.732; 95 % CI 1.109-16.98, p = 0.033) were independently associated with incisional SSI.Conclusions:Male gender, chronic liver disease, and TG are independent risk factors for organ/space SSI after LG for GC; thus, meticulous surgical procedures need to be performed among patients with these specific risk factors.
