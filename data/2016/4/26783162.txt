Background:Bone metastases (BM) are rare in patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In many centers, liver transplantation (LTx) policies require patients with HCC to undergo bone scans (BSs).Methods:We retrospectively assessed the benefit of BS for patients with a diagnosis of HCC wait-listed for LTx.Results:BS was performed in 259 of 328 patients (78.9%) and was suggestive of BM in only one (0.4%). At follow-up, 276 patients had received LTx, of whom 207 had undergone BS. Histopathological examination of explants failed to confirm the presence of HCC in 20 patients from the BS group. The survival and recurrence rates of the 187 patients with confirmed HCC in the explant who underwent BS as part of pre-LTx assessment and 69 patients who did not undergo BS were compared. The one- and five-yr post-transplant survival rates were 81% and 69%, respectively, in the BS group vs. 78% and 62%, respectively, in patients who did not undergo BS (p = 0.25). The one- and five-yr post-LTx recurrence rates were 4.8% and 10.7%, respectively, in the BS group vs. 2.9% and 10.1%, respectively, in patients who did not undergo BS (p = 0.46).Conclusions:BS generated expenditures of US$39 296 and was not cost-effective.
