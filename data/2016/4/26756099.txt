Purpose:To correlate 18F-FDG uptake on PET/CT with patterns of arterial and portal perfusion on multi-detector CT (MDCT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to assess the value of variables from PET/CT and MDCT in predicting histological grades and overall survival.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed MDCT and PET/CT of 66 patients with HCC who underwent surgical treatment. Tumor peak standard uptake value (SUV) was divided by the mean liver SUV (T/LSUV). The mean tumor Hounsfield unit (HU) to mean liver HU was calculated for arterial (T/LHU-A) and portal phases (T/LHU-P). All patients were divided into three groups: I, T/LHU-A ≤l and T/LHU-P 1 and T/LHU-P 1 and T/LHU-P ≥1. The relationships between the CT perfusion groups and T/LSUV were assessed. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed using clinical and imaging parameters for predicting histological grade. Overall survival curves stratified by T/LSUV and CT perfusion groups were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:Statistically significant differences in T/LSUV were noted between groups I and II (2.29 [range 1.74-3.60] vs. 1.20 [range 1.07-1.58], P 1.46 was the only independent predictor of tumor grade, with an odds ratio of 8.462 (95% confidence interval 1.799-39.803). Kaplan-Meier curves showed significant differences in OS according to T/LSUV >1.62, group I perfusion pattern, and T/LSUV >1.62 plus group I perfusion pattern (P = 0.04, P = 0.021, and P = 0.002, respectively).Conclusion:18F-FDG PET/CT is not commonly used for detecting HCC due to its limited sensitivity. We found that increased 18F-FDG uptake is associated with decreased arterial and portal perfusion on MDCT. This can be used to preselect patients who would benefit the most from PET/CT. Meanwhile, 18F-FDG uptake remained as the only independent predictor of histological grade, and higher 18F-FDG uptake and lower perfusion pattern on MDCT were significantly related to shorter OS.
