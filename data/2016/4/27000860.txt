XPO5 (Exp5, Exportin-5) is a transporter protein mainly mediating pre-microRNAs' nuclear export. Recent studies have demonstrated that XPO5 may play crucial roles in a few of cancers. However, little is known about XPO5 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we elucidated the expression of XPO5 by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical staining in HCC samples and conducted several functional analyses to address its effects on HCC development. The results demonstrated that both mRNA and protein levels of XPO5 were downregulated in HCC tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous livers. Ectopic expression of XPO5 significantly suppressed cell proliferation, colony formation, growth in soft agar, and tumorigenicity in nude mice, whereas knockdown of XPO5 by RNA inference showed opposite phenotypes. Moreover, XPO5 knockdown promoted HCC cell migration and decreased the expression of E-cadherin and p53. Additionally, after treatment with DAC and TSA, the mRNA level of XPO5 was upregulated in HCC cells tested, implicating that epigenetic modulation may be involved in the transcription of XPO5. Collectively, our findings suggest that XPO5 functions as a potential tumor suppressor in the development and progression of HCC as well as a promising molecular target for HCC therapy.
