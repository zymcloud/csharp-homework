Aim:To evaluate the efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) compared with surgical intervention and sorafenib for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with tumor thrombus extending to the main portal vein.Methods:From 2009 to 2013, a total of 418 HCC patients with tumor thrombus extending to the main portal vein were enrolled in this study and divided into four groups. These groups underwent different treatments as follows: TACE (n = 307), surgical intervention (n = 54), sorafenib (n = 15) and palliative treatment (n = 42). Overall survival rates were determined by Kaplan-Meier method, and differences between the groups were identified through log-rank analysis. Cox's proportional hazard model was used to identify the risk factors for survival.Results:The mean survival periods for patients in the TACE, surgical intervention, sorafenib and palliative treatment groups were 10.39, 4.13, 5.54 and 2.82 mo, respectively. For the TACE group, the 3-, 6-, 12- and 24-mo survival rates were 94.1%, 85.9%, 51.5% and 0.0%, respectively. The corresponding rates were 60.3%, 22.2%, 0.0% and 0.0% for the surgical intervention group and 50.9%, 29.5%, 0.0% and 0.0% for the sorafenib group. Evidently, the results in the TACE group were significantly higher than those in the other groups (P 0.05). These values significantly increased after TACE with/without sorafenib compared with other treatments (P Conclusion:For HCC patients with tumor thrombus extending to the main portal vein, TACE can yield a higher survival rate than surgical intervention or sorafenib treatment.
