We report a case of a 31-year-old man with metastatic fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLHCC) treated with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin complicated by hyperammonemic encephalopathy biochemically consistent with acquired ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Awareness of FLHCC-associated hyperammonemic encephalopathy and a pathophysiology-based management approach can optimize patient outcome and prevent serious complications. A discussion of the management, literature review, and proposed treatment algorithm of this rare metabolic complication are presented.Implications for practice:Pathophysiology-guided management of cancer-associated hyperammonemic encephalopathy can improve patient outcome and prevent life-threatening complications. Community and academic oncologists should be aware of this serious metabolic complication of cancer and be familiar with its management.
