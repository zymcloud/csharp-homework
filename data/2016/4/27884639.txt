Polymeric nanoparticles were prepared from self-assembled amphiphilic N-vinylpyrrolidone polymers in aqueous media and evaluated as novel carriers of indomethacin, a non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drug. It was determined that these nanoparticles could be created in spherical morphologies with sizes less than 100nm, narrow size distributions and high indomethacin contents(up to 35%) combined with high drug loading efficiencies(up to 95%). In cytotoxicity tests using the human embryonic stem cell derived fibroblasts (EBF-H9) and hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), the indomethacin-loaded polymeric nanoparticles showed higher cell viability compared to that of free indomethacin at the same concentration. The median LD50 values, determined by the Litchfield-Wilcoxon method, were 55-70mg/kg body weight depending on the polymer molecular design in both mice and rats. Based on the acquired results, these novel amphiphilic poly-N-vinylpyrrolidone nanoparticles can be considered as potential carriers for new, highly efficient, injectable drug delivery systems for hydrophobic drugs such as indomethacin.
