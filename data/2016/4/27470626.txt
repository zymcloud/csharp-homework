Objective:To evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of sole percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy (PMCT) compared to that of PMCT combining with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for the treatment of primary hepatoma.Methods:A total of 50 patients diagnosed with primary hepatocellular carcinoma were recruited and divided into two groups. Group A included 15 patients only treated with PMCT. The other 35 ones falling into group B were treated with PMCT in combination with TACE. Analysis of therapeutic efficacy and adverse effects were conducted.Results:The objective effect rates in group A and group B were 40.0% and 62.8%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups(P = 0.136). The one-year survival rates of the two groups were 46.6% and 71.4%,respectively(P = 0.095);and the two-year survival rates were 26.7% and 42.8%,respectively (P = 0.048). No grade III adverse effects or beyond were observed.Conclusion:PCMT combining with TACE is safe and more effective in one-year survival than PCMT alone for the treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma.
