Background:Although nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) therapy effectively reduces the hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA load in the serum of patients with chronic hepatitis B, it does not completely reduce the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods and results:A total of 109 patients who had chronic hepatitis B and were receiving NA therapy were analyzed. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age (>60 years had a hazard ratio [HR] of 2.66), FIB-4 index (an index of >2.1 had a HR of 2.57), and the presence of HBV core-related antigen (HBcrAg; HR, 3.53) during treatment were significantly associated with the development of HCC. The amount of HBV DNA and pregenomic RNA in liver were significantly higher in 16 HBcrAg-positive patients, compared with 12 HBcrAg-negative patients, suggesting active HBV replication in HBcrAg-positive livers. Hepatic gene expression profiling showed that HBV-promoting transcriptional factors, including HNF4α, PPARα, and LRH1, were upregulated in HBcrAg-positive livers. HepAD38 cells overexpressing LRH1 increased HBV replication, characterized by higher HBV DNA and pregenomic RNA levels, during long-term exposure to entecavir. Conversely, overexpression of precore/core in HepG2 cells increased levels of these transcriptional factors. Metformin efficiently repressed HBV replication in primary human hepatocytes.Conclusions:Modulating HBV transcriptional factors by metformin in combination with NA therapy would potentiate anti-HBV activity and reduce the incidence of HCC in HBcrAg-positive patients.
