Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been reported to be effective for local control of different-sized hepatocellular carcinomas. However, it is unclear if these benefits could also be applicable to different-sized liver metastases from gastrointestinal cancers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of TACE combined with RFA for liver metastases from gastrointestinal cancers. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 19 consecutive patients who had a total of 26 liver metastatic lesions from gastrointestinal cancers and underwent RFA followed by first-time TACE treatment. The tumor recurrence, overall survival rate and procedure-related complications were evaluated. Moreover, patients' demographics and tumor characteristics were analyzed to determine their impact on the outcomes. The technical success of TACE plus RFA was achieved with 2 major procedure-related complications found. The mean follow-up was 21.3 months. The total 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rate was 89.4%, 52.6%, and 35.1%, respectively. It was found that the tumor size and the ratio of enhancement area were significant factors that influenced the overall survival. In conclusion, patients with gastrointestinal cancer-derived liver metastatic lesions of smaller size and larger enhancement area are considered appropriate candidates for TACE plus RFA.
