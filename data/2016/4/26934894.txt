Percutaneous image-guided ablation is now commonly performed in many institutions for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, liver metastases, and renal cell carcinoma in select patients. Accurate interpretation of post-ablation imaging is of supreme importance because treatment algorithms for these diseases rely heavily on imaging to guide management decisions. The purpose of this pictorial essay is to provide abdominal imagers with a review of the indications for percutaneous ablation in the abdomen, a basic overview of ablation modalities in clinical use today, the expected post-ablation imaging findings in the liver and kidney, and potential complications of hepatic and renal ablation procedures.
