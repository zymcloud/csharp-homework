Background and objectives:Patients who undergo liver resection for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have reported 5-year survivals ranging from 25% to 50%. The current study updated long-term survival for patients with resected liver metastases treated with adjuvant hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) and systemic (SYS) chemotherapy.Methods:Updated survival and recurrence free survival for patients treated on four consecutive adjuvant protocols with HAI and SYS from 1991 to 2009. Patients were divided into two groups: those treated on protocols before 2003 and after 2003. Median follow-up for all patients was 11 years.Results:All 287 patients enrolled in four prospective protocols after liver resection are included. Patients treated before 2003 had a median follow-up of 15 years, 5 and 10-year survivals of 56% [95%CI: 49-64%] and 40% [95%CI: 32-47%], respectively, and median survival of 71 months. Patients treated after 2003 had a median follow-up of 9 years, 5 and 10-year survivals of 78% [95%CI: 70-84%] and 61% [95%CI: 51-70%], respectively, and median survival has not been reached.Conclusions:Survival is improving for patients with mCRC who undergo liver resection. These data support the durability of long-term survival in patients who undergo resection followed by adjuvant HAI and SYS therapy. J. Surg. Oncol. 2016;113:477-484. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
