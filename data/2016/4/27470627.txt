Objective:To establish an apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) double-knockout (ApoE(-/-)/LDLR(-/-)) mouse model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) induced by high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet.Methods:ApoE(-/-) knockout mice were crossed with LDLR(-/-) knockout mice to obtain ApoE(-/-)/LDLR(-/-) mice. The ApoE(-/-)/LDLR(-/-) mice mated with each other, and the offspring were injected with low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) at 2-3 days after birth. Some mice were fed with HFHC diet after weaning as the model group (n = 15), and some mice were fed with normal diet as the control group (n = 15). Mice were sacrificed at the end of weeks 10, 16, and 20 (5 mice at each time point). The body weight was measured. Liver tissue and blood were collected to measure biochemical parameters, evaluate the pathological changes in the liver tissue by HE staining, oil red O staining, and Masson staining, and detect the expression of glypican-3 (a marker of HCC) by immunohistochemical staining.Results:The model group had significantly higher levels of fasting blood glucose and total cholesterol than the control group (P Conclusion:The mouse model of NASH-related HCC can be developed by giving STZ injection to neonatal ApoE(-/-)/LDLR(-/-) mice and feeding them with HFHC diet after weaning for 20 weeks. Early HCC may develop directly from NASH.
