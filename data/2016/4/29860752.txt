We designed two novel polymer materials N-glycyrrhetinic acid-polyethylene glycol-chitosan derivatives (NGPC) and N-quaternary ammonium-chitosan derivatives (NQC). We prepared three kinds of drug loaded chitosan nanoparticles (brucine/NGPC-NPs, brucine/NQC-NPs, brucine/MNPs) by ionic crosslinking method with brucine as a model drug and chitosan nanoparticles（brucine/NGPC-NPs, brucine/NQC-NPs） as the reference formulation. Using high content analysis, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy and other advanced technology, we tested the effect of 20 μg·mL(-1) concentration of brucine solution and brucine/ chitosan nanoparticles（brucine/CTS-NPs） in hepatocarcinoma (HEpG2) cells and evaluated the apoptosis induced by the treatment. The results suggested that brucine-CTS/NPs had a strongest activity in killing tumor cells, and increased the total cell apoptosis rate with a significant formation of "crescent-shaped" body, swelling mitochondria, mitochondria cristae missing, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome C. The activity was enhanced by multifunctional nanocomposite particles that increased the cumulative amount of drug in the mitochondria for the anti-tumor effect.
