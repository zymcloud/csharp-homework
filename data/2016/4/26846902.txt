Background and objectives:Metastasectomy of spinal lesions from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a promising strategy. However, its clinical outcome after spinal metastasectomy is unknown owing to the difficulty of curative surgical resection. This is the first study to examine the survival rates of patients who underwent metastasectomy of solitary spinal metastases from RCC.Methods:A retrospective cohort study of 36 consecutive patients with RCC who underwent nephrectomy and complete removal of solitary spinal lesions between 1995 and 2010 at our institution. Cancer-specific survival (CSS) time from the spinal metastasectomy to death or last follow-up was the main endpoint. Potential factors associated with survival were evaluated with Kaplan-Meier analysis and the long-rank test.Results:For all patients, the estimated median CSS time was 130 months. The 3, 5, and 10-year CSS rates were 77.8%, 69.1%, and 58.0%, respectively, for all patients, and 72.7%, 54.5%, and 27.3%, respectively, for patients with lung metastases at the time of surgery. Only the presence of liver metastases was significantly associated with short-term survival after spinal metastasectomy.Conclusions:Liver metastases were associated with short-term survival, although lung metastases were not. For selected patients, curative resection of solitary spinal metastases can potentially prolong survival. J. Surg. Oncol. 2016;113:587-592. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
