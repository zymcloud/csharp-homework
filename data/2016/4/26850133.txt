Background:We have shown that an Akt inhibitor, MK2206, reduces hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) proliferation. To further delineate MK2206, we sought to investigate the Notch1 pathway and hypothesize that MK2206 treatment will result in Notch1 inhibition with either subsequent or parallel Akt suppression.Methods:HCC cell lines were treated with various concentrations of MK2206. Cell proliferation was determined via real-time live cell imaging. Knockdown of Notch1 was used to observe interaction between Notch1 and pAkt. Cell lysates were analyzed via Western blotting for Notch and Akt pathway targets.Results:After treatment with MK2206 (up to 2 Î¼M), there was a 60% reduction in cell viability at 48 hours with a concomitant reduction in Notch1 expression. Knockdown of Notch1 in HCC cell lines correlated with reduction in Akt phosphorylation.Conclusions:MK2206 inhibits both the PI3-K/Akt and Notch1 pathways. Therefore, further characterization of MK2206 comparing the 2 pathways is warranted and the effect of dual targeting in HCC.
