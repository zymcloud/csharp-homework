Background:Recently, increasing studies have revealed the association of inflammatory parameters, such as preoperative platelet count, and the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the link between the platelet count and the prognosis of patients with HCC after hepatic resection is still controversial.Methods:We searched PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and CBM for relevant trials and analyzed outcomes with random-effects model. The hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.Results:In total, 31 studies, including a total of 10,730 patients, met our criteria. The results showed that thrombocytopenia in HCC patients was associated with poor overall survival (HR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.21-1.78), disease-free survival (HR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.08-1.72), and a high risk of cancer recurrence (HR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.22-1.62), but a low risk of extrahepatic metastasis (HR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.47-0.63).Conclusions:The meta-analysis revealed that preoperative platelet count could act as a significant biomarker in the prognosis of HCC, especially a platelet count of 3/mm3. Additional high-quality trials are needed, considering the low-quality studies analyzed.
