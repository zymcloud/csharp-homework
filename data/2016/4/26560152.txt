Background:Although laparoscopy is widely accepted for liver resection, lesions in the posterior and superior segments and deep region in the right lobe are difficult for visualization during laparoscopic liver resection (LLR). In this study, we aim examine the effects of using sterile gloves (SG) pouch padding during LLR.Methods:Forty-two hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients were included in our study. We performed LLR using SG (n = 24, SG group) and without SG during LLR (n = 18, NSG). We also compared the time of various procedures, blood loss, and liver function between the two groups.Results:We did not observe any major complications or death in all patients. The time of liver parenchyma transection and portal triad clamping in SG group is significantly shorter than those in NSG group (30.29 ± 5.55 vs. 39.00 ± 3.68 min p Conclusions:Our data suggests that a sterile glove pouch could enhance exposure in surgical field, which results in decrease in blood loss and procedure time. More studies with large sample size, large tumor size, and longer follow-up are needed.
