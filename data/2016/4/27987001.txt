Although transcatheter arterial chemoembolization is one of the established treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it is difficult to treat HCCs with prominent arterioportal (AP) shunts because anticancer drugs and embolic materials migrate into the non-tumorous liver through the AP shunts and may cause liver infarction. We developed a novel method of balloon-assisted chemoembolization using a micro-balloon catheter alongside a microcatheter simultaneously inserted through a single 4.5-Fr guiding sheath, comprising proximal chemoembolization with distal arterial balloon occlusion. We applied this method to treat an HCC with a prominent distal AP shunt induced by previous proton beam therapy and achieved successful chemoembolization without non-tumorous liver infarction under temporal balloon occlusion of a distal AP shunt.
