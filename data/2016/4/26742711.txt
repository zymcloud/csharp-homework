This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of (18)F-FDG uptake in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who had transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or concurrent intraarterial chemotherapy with external-beam radiotherapy (CCRT) and to compare the prognosis between patients treated with TACE and those with CCRT according to (18)F-FDG uptake.Methods:Two hundred fourteen intermediate-to-advanced-stage HCC patients without extrahepatic metastasis who underwent staging (18)F-FDG PET/CT before TACE (153 patients) or CCRT (61 patients) were recruited from 7 hospitals. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared using an optimal cutoff value for tumor-to-normal liver uptake ratio (TLR). Further, PFS and OS were compared according to treatment modalities (TACE vs. CCRT) using the same TLR cutoff value.Results:On multivariate analysis, age and TLR were independent prognostic factors for PFS (PConclusion:(18)F-FDG uptake was an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS in HCC patients treated with TACE or CCRT. Especially, in HCCs with high (18)F-FDG uptake, patients treated with CCRT showed better survival than those treated with TACE. (18)F-FDG PET/CT may help determine the treatment modality for intermediate-to-advanced-stage HCCs.
