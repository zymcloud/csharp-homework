Objectives:To evaluate optimal window settings for display of virtual monoenergetic reconstructions in third-generation dual-source, dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) of the liver.Methods:Twenty-nine subjects were prospectively evaluated with DECT in arterial (AP) and portal venous (PVP) phases. Three reconstructed datasets were calculated: standard linearly-blended (LB120), 70-keV standard virtual monoenergetic (M70), and 50-keV advanced image-based virtual monoenergetic (M50+). Two readers assessed optimal window settings (width and level, W/L), establishing a mean for each reconstruction which was used for a blinded assessment of liver lesions.Results:The optimal W/L for M50+ were significantly higher for both AP (W=429.3 ± 44.6 HU, L=129.4 ± 9.7 HU) and PVP (W=376.1 ± 14.2HU, L=146.6 ± 7.0 HU) than for LB120 (AP, W=215.9 ± 16.9 HU, L=82.3 ± 9.4 HU) (PVP, W=173.4 ± 8.9 HU, L=69.3 ± 6.0 HU) and M70 (AP, W=247.1 ± 22.2 HU, L=72.9 ± 6.8 HU) (PVP, W=232.0 ± 27.9 HU, L=91.6 ± 14.4 HU). Use of the optimal window setting for M50+ vs. LB120 resulted in higher sensitivity (AP, 100% vs. 86%; PVP, 96% vs. 63%).Conclusions:Application of dedicated window settings results in improved liver lesion detection rates in advanced image-based virtual monoenergetic DECT when customized for arterial and portal venous phases.
