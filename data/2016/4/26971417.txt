Objectives:Direct puncture of subcapsular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for tumor ablation has been considered high risk due to a perceived increased incidence of hemorrhage or tumor seeding. The purpose of this retrospective multicenter study was to identify the rate of tumor seeding, hemorrhage and local tumor progression (LTP) associated with direct puncture radiofrequency (RF) and microwave (MW) ablation of subcapsular HCC.Methods:A multicenter, retrospective review of direct-puncture RF and MW performed on subcapsular HCC was conducted. Complications and local tumor progression were documented. Data was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests.Results:The study group consisted of 60 cirrhotic patients (M/F=43/17; mean age 69.6 years) with 67 subcapsular HCC (mean diameter 2.3 cm Â± 1.0 cm) that were directly punctured for RF (n=40) or MW (n=27) under ultrasound (US) guidance. The mean follow-up period was 30.8 months. There were no hemorrhagic complications. The overall LTP rate was 13.4%. There was one case of tumor tract seeding in a patient who had undergone a percutaneous biopsy two weeks prior to RF.Conclusions:Thermal ablation of HCC by direct puncture appears safe and effective. There were no cases of intraperitoneal hemorrhage, and tumor seeding was seen in a single case in which a preceding percutaneous biopsy had been performed.
