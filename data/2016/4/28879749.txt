3D in vitro toxicity testing model was developed by magnetic levitation method for culture of the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 and applied to evaluate the drug hepatotoxicity. After formation of stable 3D structure for HepG2 cells, their glycogen storage capacity under 2D and 3D culture conditions were detected by immunohistochemistry technology, and the mRNA expression levels of phase Ⅰ and Ⅱ drug metabolism enzymes, drug transporters, nuclear receptors and liver-specific marker albumin(ALB) were compared between 2D and 3D culture conditions by using RT-PCR method. Immunohistochemistry results showed that HepG2 cells had abundant glycogen storage capacity under 3D culture conditions, which was similar to human liver tissues. The mRNA expression levels of major drug metabolism enzymes, drug transporters, nuclear receptors and ALB in HepG2 cells under 3D culture conditions were up-regulated as compared with 2D culture conditions. For drug hepatotoxicity evaluation, the typical hepatotoxic drug acetaminophen(APAP), and most reported drugs Polygonum multiflorum Thunb.(Chinese name He-shou-wu) and Psoraleae corylifolia L.(Chinese name Bu-gu-zhi) were selected for single dose and repeated dose(7 d) exposure. In the repeated dose exposure test, 3D HepG2 cells showed higher sensitivity. This established 3D HepG2 cells model with magnetic levitation 3D culture techniques was more close to the human liver tissues both in morphology and functions, so it was a better 3D hepatotoxicity evaluation model.
