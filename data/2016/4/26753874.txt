Stefins have been reported to be associated with the progression and metastasis of various malignant tumors. However, the expressions of stefins in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been well-defined. In this study, the protein levels of stefin A and stefin B were assessed by immunohistochemical staining, and the mRNA levels were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 85 primary HCC tissues, 85 surrounding non-cancerous tissues, and 9 normal hepatic tissues. The immunohistochemical staining of cathepsin B and cathepsin D, and the ratio of cathepsins to stefins were assessed. The mRNA expressions of stefin A and stefin B in HCC tissues were significantly higher than surrounding noncancerous tissues and normal hepatic tissues, respectively. A significant positive relationship of stefin A and stefin B was found with node metastasis, tumor size, and Edmondson grade for HCC. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that Edmondson grade and stefin B expression were independent factors associated with the risk of lymph node metastasis in HCC. The ratios of cathepsin B to stefin A, cathepsin D to stefin A, cathepsin B to stefin B and cathepsin D to stefin B of the HCC group were significantly higher than that of the surrounding noncancerous group. A significant positive correlation between the ratio of cathepsins to stefins (cathepsin B/stefin A, cathepsin B/stefin B and cathepsin D/stefin B) and node metastasis was demonstrated. We concluded that high expressions of stefin A and stefin B may be an important factor contributing to the development and metastasis of HCC.
