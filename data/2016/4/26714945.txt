Background:Microvascular invasion (MiVI) is a major risk factor of survival outcomes after curative resection for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to investigate the impact of postoperative adjuvant transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (PA-TACE) on HCC patients with MiVI.Methods:From January 2004 to June 2013, HCC patients with histologically confirmed MiVI and well-tolerated liver function who underwent PA-TACE after R0 hepatectomy (RH) or RH alone were studied retrospectively. In the PA-TACE group, PA-TACE was given 4 weeks after RH. Uni- and multivariate analyses were used to identify the prognostic significance of PA-TACE.Results:Of the 322 HCC patients with MiVI included in the analysis, 185 entered into the RH group and 137 entered into the PA-TACE group. The baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar except for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level (p = 0.037). The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were respectively 69.3, 55.5, 46.7, and 35.0 % for the PA-TACE group and 47.0, 36.2, 34.1, and 30.3 % for the RH group (log-rank, χ(2) = 6.309; p = 0.012). The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were respectively 94.2, 78.8, 71.5, and 54.0 % for the PA-TACE group and 78.9, 62.2, 54.1, and 43.2 % for the RH group (log-rank, χ(2) = 7.537; p = 0.006). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed PA-TACE to be an independent risk factor of postoperative RFS and OS.Conclusions:This study showed that PA-TACE may be beneficial for HCC patients with MiVI.
