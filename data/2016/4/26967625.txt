The obtusallenes are a significant subset of C15-halogenated acetogenins that incorporate 12-membered cyclic ethers. We have recently reported the isolation from Laurencia marilzae of 12-epoxyobtusallene IV (1) and its related α,β-unsaturated carboxylate ester (2), both of special biogenetic relevance. Here we describe the final step of our study, the isolation of three new analogues (3-5), among these, the first bromopropargylic derivative (3) of this class of macrocyclic C15-acetogenins. The structures were elucidated by analysis of NMR and X-ray data. 12-Epoxyobtusallene IV (1), its new isomer 4, and known obtusallene IV (6) were evaluated for their apoptosis-inducing activities in a human hepatocarcinoma cell line.
