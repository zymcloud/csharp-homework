Aim and main method:The medicinal properties of fermented papaya preparation (FPP) derived from Carica papaya fruit was investigated in order to determine its ability to modulate the progression of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea induced hepatocellular carcinoma in Balb/c mice.Key findings:As well as reducing the physical symptoms associated with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma, supplementation of Balb/c mice with 500mg FPP/kg BW for 92days normalized the blood cell count, led to an increased activity of several key antioxidant enzymes (SOD: +20%, CAT: +81%, GPx: +66.1%, GR: +54.4%; PSignificance:Results demonstrated the ability of FPP to preserve the integrity of liver against oxidative damage and protect hepatocytes against irreversible DNA structural modifications induced by MNU, highlighting its potential role as an immune-defense modulator during hepatocarcinoma.
