Objective:We investigated the miR-196a2T>C rs11614913 variant in the initiation and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A case-control research model was conducted and the genotypes of 109 HCC patients and 105 healthy controls were identified by direct sequencing. The correlation between the rs11614913 genotypes and the susceptibility to HCC was evaluated using an unconditional logistic regression model.Results:We found that 20/109 (18.3%) patients were TT homozygote, whereas 64/109 (58.8%) patients had the CT genotype, and 25/109 (22.9%) patients had the CC genotype. In control samples, the frequency of the TT homozygote was 33.3%, that of CT was 49.5%, and that of CC was 17.1%. After adjusting for age and gender by logistic regression analysis, we found significant differences in susceptibility to HCC by genotype (TT vs. CT+CC: OR = 2.52, 95%CI = 1.18-4.19; p Conclusions:In this study, we found that the CT+CC genotypes of rs11614913 were significantly associated with an increased risk and poor prognosis for HCC in the Chinese population.
