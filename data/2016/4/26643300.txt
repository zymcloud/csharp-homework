Background:Improvements in liver surgery have led to decreased mortality rates. Symptomatic perihepatic collections (SPHCs) requiring percutaneous drainage remain a significant source of morbidity.Study design:A single institution's prospectively maintained hepatic resection database was reviewed to identify patients who underwent hepatectomy between January 2004 and February 2012.Results:Data from 2173 hepatectomies performed in 2040 patients were reviewed. Overall, 200 (9%) patients developed an SPHC, the majority non-bilious (75.5%) and infected (54%). Major hepatic resections, larger than median blood loss (â‰¥360 ml), use of surgical drains, and simultaneous performance of a colorectal procedure were associated with an SPHC on multivariate analysis. Non-bilious, non-infected (NBNI) collections were associated with lower white blood cell (WBC) counts, absence of a bilio-enteric anastomosis, use of hepatic arterial infusion pump (HAIP), and presence of metastatic disease, and resolved more frequently with a single interventional radiology (IR) procedure (85 vs. 46.5%, p < 0.001) more quickly (15 vs. 30 days, p = 0.001).Conclusions:SPHCs developed in 9% of patients in a modern series of hepatic resections, and in one third were non-bilious and non-infected. In the era of modern interventional radiology, the need for re-operation for SPHC is exceedingly rare. A significant proportion of minimally symptomatic SPHC patients may not require drainage, and strategies to avoid unnecessary drainage are warranted.
