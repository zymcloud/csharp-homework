Background:Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) can migrate to the tumor tissue and enhance the angiogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); thus, they are associated with a poor prognosis. However, the specific molecular mechanism underlying the homing of EPCs to the HCC neovasculature remains unrevealed.Methods:Co-culture experiments of endothelial progenitor cells with HCC cells with modulation of EphA1 were performed in vitro. Using EPCs as angiogenic promoters by injecting them into HCC xenograft-bearing nude mice via their tail veins to test homing ability of EPCs changed according to different EphA1 level in HCC xenograft.Results:In this study, we found that the up-regulation of EphA1 expression in HCC cells could affect not only the chemotaxis of EPCs to tumor cells and endothelial cells (ECs) but also the tube formation ability of EPCs in a paracrine fashion. Further, we revealed that the increased expression of EphA1 in HCC cells led to an increased SDF-1 concentration in the tumor microenvironment, which in turn activated the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis and enhanced the recruitment of EPCs to HCC. In addition, the EphA1-activated SDF-1 expression and secretion was partially mediated by the PI3K and mTOR pathways. In vivo experiments demonstrated that blocking EphA1/SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling significantly inhibited the growth of HCC xenografts. Using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence assays, we verified that the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis was at least partially caused by the decreased number of EPCs homing to tumor tissue.Conclusions:Our findings indicate that targeting the EphA1/SDF-1 signaling pathway might be a therapeutic anti-angiogenesis approach for treating HCC.
