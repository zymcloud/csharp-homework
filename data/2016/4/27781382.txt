Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is a rare benign epithelial neoplasm with potential for hemorrhage, rupture, or malignant transformation. Reported annual incidence of HCA is approximately 1/1,000,000. We identified 12 cases of HCA among adults with a history of childhood or young adult cancer. The most common cancer diagnosis was leukemia (N = 4). Five had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant with total body irradiation. All 11 females had prior estrogen therapy; the male case was hypogonadal. This report suggests childhood and young adult cancer survivors may be at increased risk for HCA, but further investigation is needed.
