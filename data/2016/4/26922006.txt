Purpose:To retrospectively evaluate safety and efficacy of conventional transarterial chemoembolization with ethiodized oil (Lipiodol) combined with CT-guided radiofrequency (RF) ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) adjacent to the hepatic hilum.Materials and methods:Between January 2007 and December 2010, conventional transarterial chemoembolization combined with CT-guided RF ablation was performed in 40 patients with HCC adjacent to the hepatic hilum within Milan criteria (group A). Major complications, complete tumor ablation rate, local tumor progression rate, and overall survival were compared with 107 patients with HCC nonadjacent to the hepatic hilum (group B) treated by conventional transarterial chemoembolization combined with CT-guided RF ablation during the same period.Results:Major complications included one case of large hepatic artery-portal vein fistula in group A (2.5%; 1/40) and one case of acute portal vein thrombosis, left heart failure, and tumor seeding in group B (2.8%; 3/107); the difference was not significant between the two groups (P = 1.000). There were no significant differences between the two groups in complete tumor ablation rate (80.0% vs 86.0%; P = .374), local tumor progression rates (1-year, 12.5% vs 14.1%; 2-year, 28.2% vs 24.2%; 3-year, 32.0% vs 27.6%; P = .723), and overall survival (1-year, 92.3% vs 91.8%; 3-year, 79.1% vs 79.3%; 5-year, 59.5% vs 58.4%; P = .555).Conclusions:Conventional transarterial chemoembolization combined with CT-guided RF ablation was safe and effective in selected patients with HCC adjacent to the hepatic hilum within Milan criteria.
