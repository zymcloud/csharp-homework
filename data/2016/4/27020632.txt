Background:Pathologic response (PR) predicts survival after preoperative chemotherapy and resection of a malignancy. Occasionally, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) may be selected for preoperative management of resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study investigated whether PR to preoperative TACE can predict recurrence after resection for resectable HCC.Methods:We conducted analysis of 106 HCC patients who underwent TACE followed by liver resection with a curative intent. The PR was evaluated as the mean percentage of non-viable tumor area within each tumor. We divided the patients into three groups according to response rate: complete PR (CPR), major response (MJR: PRâ‰¥50%) and minor response (MNR: PRResults:Among the 121 TACE patients, PR could be measured in 106 (87.6%). The mean interval between TACE and liver resection was 33.1 days. The 5-year disease-free survival rates by PR status were as follows: 40.6% CPR, 43.7% MJR, and 49.0% MNR (P=0.815). There were also no significant differences in overall survival between the three groups. Multivariate analyses revealed that microvascular invasion and capsular invasion (hazard ratio [HR]=11.224, P=0.002 and HR=2.220, P=0.043) were independent predictors of disease-free survival. Multivariate analysis of the predictors of above 50% PR revealed that only hepatitis B was an independent factor.Conclusion:These data could reflect that the PR after TACE for resectable HCC may not be useful for predicting recurrence of HCC after resection.
