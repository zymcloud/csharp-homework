Aim:To establish if a distinct urinary metabolic profile could be identified in Bangladeshi hepatitis-B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients compared to cirrhosis patients and controls.Methods:Urine samples from 42 Bangladeshi patients with HCC (39 patients with hepatitis-B HCC), 47 with cirrhosis on a background of hepatitis B, 46 with chronic hepatitis B, and seven ethnically-matched healthy controls were analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. A full dietary and medication history was recorded for each subject. The urinary NMR data were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squared discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) techniques. Differences in relative signal levels of the most discriminatory metabolites identified by PCA and OPLS-DA were compared between subject groups using an independent samples Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with all pairwise multiple comparisons. Within the patient subgroups, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare metabolite levels depending on hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) status and treatment with anti-viral therapy. A Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment was applied to acquire the level of significance for multiple testing, with a declared level of statistical significance of P Results:There were significant differences in age (P Conclusion:Urinary NMR changes in Bangladeshi HCC were identified, corroborating previous findings from Egypt and West Africa. These findings could form the basis for the development of a cost-effective HCC dipstick screening test.
