Golgi Protein 73 (GP73) is a potential liver disease glycobiomarker warranting comprehensive analyses of its glycan structure and glycosylation function. In this study, we used mass spectrometry to identify glycosylation sites and the glycan structure, high-throughput lectin microarray to provide rapid and sensitive profiling of glycoconjugates, and site-directed mutagenesis to clarify the impact of glycans on target glycoproteins in vivo. We identified three GP73 N-glycosylation sites: Asn109, Asn144 and Asn398. We found five glycoforms on Asn144, including biantennary, triantennary and fucosylated glycans. Removal of N-glycans at Asn144 enhanced the motility and invasiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, possibly due to inhibition of cell adhesion related to the changes of cell membrane glycosylation. This study increases our understanding of the functional relevance of GP73 glycosylation and suggests that Asn144-deleted GP73 can influence the progression and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma.
