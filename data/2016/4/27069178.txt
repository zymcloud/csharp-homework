Background:Liver metastases occur in 60-80% of patients with colorectal carcinoma. The only potentially curative method is surgical resection, with an operability of 20-25%. The main reason for such low resectability is insufficient future liver remnant volume (FLRV). Portal vein embolization (PVE) alone is associated with failure in up to 40% of patients. A new method that could lead to acceleration of FRLV growth appears to be combination of PVE and application of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The aim of our study was to evaluate the importance of growth factors and interleukins for FLRV growth after PVE and HSC application and also their possible effect on growth of colorectal liver metastases.Patients and methods:From June 2010 to July 2014, PVE was combined with application of adult HSCs in 16 primarily inoperable patients with colorectal liver metastases. We determined the serum levels of growth factors [hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), insulin-like growth factor binging protein 3 (IGF-BP3), epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor (TGFα), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)] and interleukins (IL2, -6, -8 and -10) at given time intervals by immunoanalytic methods. The growth of FLRV was evaluated by multidetector computed tomography at intervals of 1 week until sufficient growth of FLRV.Results:We were able to perform radical surgery in 13 primarily inoperable patients (81.4%). The average FLRV growth was 23.1% (range=21.9-38.6%); from an initial FLRV of 30.5% (range=20.6-39%) to 40.1% (range=29-48%) before resection. The combination of levels of EGF, HGF, VEGF, IGF, TGFα and IL2,-6,-8 appears to be crucial for predicting operability. IL8 was statistically significant for the growth of colorectal liver metastases, and TGFα, IL2, and IL8 are important for a longer disease-free interval.
