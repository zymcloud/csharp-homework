Purpose:The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy and efficacy of a needle-tracking system in phantom and clinical studies using bipolar electrodes.Methods:To observe the tip of the electrode, a needle-tracking system with a volume navigation system was used. In the phantom study, the electrode was inserted at various angles and the error was verified. In the clinical study, 21 nodules close to extrahepatic organs or major vessels were enrolled between May and October 2014. After puncturing with the needle-tracking system, computed tomography (CT) was performed. The distances between the electrode tip and extrahepatic organs or major vessels were measured on both B-mode ultrasound (US) and CT. By comparing these distances, the accuracy of this system was evaluated.Results:In the phantom study, the deviation between the tip of the electrode and the virtual tip of the electrode was analyzed. The median values were within 2 mm at each puncture angle. In the clinical study, the difference between B-mode US and CT was less (mean value 1.17 Â± 1.76 mm; range 0-3.5 mm).Conclusion:The needle-tracking system is an accurate and useful system for bipolar radiofrequency ablation.
