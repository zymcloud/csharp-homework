Hepatocellular carcinoma is the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. It is characterized by unique features that can be utilized for selective and targeted therapy, which aids in preserving healthy tissues from deteriorating effects of traditional chemotherapeutics. In this minireview, a brief overview of recent drug delivery attempts for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma with the aid of nanomedical structures is presented. The beneficial impact of nanomaterials in terms of prolonged retention in blood and target sites, controlled biodistribution and improved stability of the encapsulated payloads, will be described, together with the possibility of incorporating more than one cargo into the same nanostructure. Incorporation of stimuli-responsive components, decoration with targeting moieties and the use of molecularly targeted drugs for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma are also highlighted.
