Background:Micrometastasis (MM) in colorectal cancer (CRC) is not considered in tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) staging currently and also the prognostic significance of these occult tumoural cells is not proven yet. This study was designed to find whether MM to bone marrow (BM) and/or liver cause upstaging of the tumour according to conventional staging system and if it may alter the survival rate.Methods:Thirty-eight CRC patients who were candidates of surgical procedure were enrolled in our cross-sectional study. Liver and BM biopsy were obtained during the surgery to be looked for tissue-specific marker of CRC, CK20. CK20 expression in BM and liver was assessed by the two methods of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry.Results:Among the 38 submitted patients, a total number of 14 MM, including 10 BM (23%) and seven hepatic (18%) were detected. There was no significant difference in clinicopathological aspects including size, location, stage, grade, local invasion to vessels and neurons, TNM staging and relapse rate of tumour among patients with/without disseminated tumoural cells. The result did not demonstrate a survival difference between patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared to other patients.Conclusion:Our study did not confirm that the presence of MM influences TNM staging and overall survival of the patients. Additional clinical investigations with longer follow-up period and larger number of cases are required to decide on administration of neoadjuvant therapy in CRC patients.
