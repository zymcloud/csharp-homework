Background:Some changes of glycoproteins have been identified in the serum of patients with different liver diseases, which provided potential glycan biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of disease progression.Methods:We established a lectin-antibody sandwich ELISA method to detect fucosylated fetuin A (fuc-fetuin A) level in serum, in which biotinylated Aleuria aurantia lectin (AAL) was used for specific recognition. Then serum fuc-fetuin A level was detected in 108 healthy controls and 548 hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients, including 232 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, 114 liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, 86 liver fibrosis (LF) patients, and 116 asymptomatic HBV carriers, to assess its diagnostic and prognostic value in HBV-related liver diseases.Results:Serum fetuin A level decreased in LC patients as compared to HCC patients or healthy controls, while it decreased further according to the increasing Child-Pugh grades. The fuc-fetuin A level was in a decreasing order in LC, HCC, LF, HBV-carriers and healthy controls. For distinguishing LC and HCC patients from LF, HBV-carriers and healthy controls, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is 0.871, with a sensitivity of 0.818 and specificity of 0.819. The survival analysis revealed that higher fuc-fetuin A level was significantly associated with worse recurrence-free survival in HCC patients (p=0.018).Conclusions:The results indicated that the serum fuc-fetuin A might serve as a potential glycan biomarker for distinguishing LC and HCC from LF, HBV-carriers and healthy controls. Furthermore, the preoperative fuc-fetuin A level could be a useful prognostic biomarker for HCC patients.
