Background and objectives:Liver resection of colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) may necessitate large metabolic and physiologic reserve. As the population ages, resection of CRLM is increasingly required in the elderly. We assessed the safety and efficacy of these operations.Methods:Between February 2010 and 2015, 174 patients underwent liver resection of CRLM. Fifty-four and 120 patients were over and under the age of 70 at the time of surgery, respectively (mean ages: 76 ± 4 and 56.5 ± 9 years). Patient and tumor characteristics, perioperative, and long-term outcomes were compared.Results:Elderly patients had increased rates of IHD (18.5% versus 6.6%, P = 0.0002), COPD (9.2% versus 4.1%, P = 0.01), and DM (30% versus 14%, P = 0.02). Operative time was shorter in elderly patients (222 ± 109 versus 261 ± 110 min; P = 0.04). Intraoperative blood loss was comparable. The rate of minor postoperative complications was similar between groups, but elderly patients had higher rate of major complications (11.1% versus 2.5%, P < 0.0001). One elderly patient died following surgery (1.8%). Length of hospital stay was similar between groups. No difference in 3-year survival was demonstrated.Conclusions:Although associated with a small increase in postoperative morbidity and mortality, liver resection may be performed safely and effectively in carefully selected elderly patients.
