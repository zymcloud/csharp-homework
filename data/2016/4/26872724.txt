The efficiency of surgery in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is limited due to metastasis and recurrence, but the molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here, we show that MMP-8 and TGF-β1 accumulate in highly invasive HCC cell lines and invasive HCC patient tissues. Upregulation of MMP-8 and TGF-β1 correlated with changes in cellular epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes and HCC migration and invasion. The expression of TGF-β1 was markedly restored by MMP-8 overexpression in TGF-β1-depleted HCC cells mainly via the activation of PI3K/Akt/Rac1 pathway. Similarly, the expression of MMP-8 was restored by TGF-β1 treatment in MMP-8-depleted HCC cells mainly through the activation of the same PI3K/Akt/Rac1 pathway. MMP-8 expression was significantly related to TGF-β1 expression in HCC patient tissues, and high expression of MMP-8 or TGF-β1 was significantly associated with TNM stage and HCC metastasis. Specifically, patients with high co-expression of MMP-8 and TGF-β1 had a shorter time-to-recurrence than those with low co-expression. Therefore, the reciprocal positive interplay between MMP-8 and TGF-β1 contributes to HCC invasion and metastasis by inducing EMT mainly through the PI3K/Akt/Rac1 pathway.
