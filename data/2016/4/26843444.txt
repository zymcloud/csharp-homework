Background:In patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high viral load was associated with tumour recurrence and deaths.Aims:To investigate the effect of nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA) on the clinical outcomes after different HCC treatments.Methods:A territory-wide cohort study was conducted using the database from Hospital Authority. We identified CHB patients with HCC by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes in 2000-2012. HCC treatments, NA use and laboratory parameters were retrieved. The primary endpoint was HCC recurrence and death. A 3-month landmark analysis was used to evaluate the primary outcome in patients with or without NA treatment.Results:A total of 2198 CHB patients (1230 NA-untreated and 968 NA-treated) with HCC, receiving at least one type of HCC treatment were included in the analysis. At a median follow-up of 2.8 (IQR 1.4-4.9) years, tumour recurrence and death occurred in 451 (36.7%) and 578 (47.0%) untreated patients; and in 216 (22.3%) and 301 (31.1%) NA-treated patients respectively. NA therapy reduced the risk of overall HCC recurrence [adjusted sub-hazard ratio (SHR) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49-0.80; P Conclusion:Our findings show that nucleos(t)ide analogues treatment reduces the risk of HCC recurrence in patients with chronic hepatitis B treated by surgical resection.
