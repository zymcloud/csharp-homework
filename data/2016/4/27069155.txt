Aim:There is poor evidence regarding effective treatment for recurrent endometrial cancer. We treated patients with recurrent endometrial cancer with docetaxel-cisplatin (DP) therapy as second-line or third-line chemotherapy. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of DP therapy for patients with recurrent endometrial cancer.Patient and methods:We included 26 patients diagnosed with recurrent endometrial cancer, who underwent DP chemotherapy at our Institution. Docetaxel at 70 mg/m(2)and cisplatin at 60 mg/m(2)were administered by intravenous injection every 3 weeks. We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological factors associated with the response rate (RR) and prognosis. We also analyzed the adverse effects of DP therapy.Results:Median follow-up was 33.8 months and the median number of therapy cycles was six. Grade 3 or 4 adverse effects included leukopenia (66%), neutropenia (81%), anemia (9%), diarrhea (12%), general fatigue (12%), liver dysfunction (4%), peripheral neuropathy (4%), and hyponatremia (4%). RR was 58% and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.5 months. The group with a treatment-free interval of 6 months or more tended to have better PFS than that with less than 6 months (p=0.01). The group with a platinum-free interval of 6 months or more had significantly better PFS than that with less than 6 months (p=0.09). Although the history of taxane usage was not relevant to prognosis, a taxane-free interval of 12 months or more was associated with a tendency for better PFS (p=0.06).Conclusion:DP therapy was fully feasible and demonstrated efficacy for patients with recurrent endometrial cancer.
