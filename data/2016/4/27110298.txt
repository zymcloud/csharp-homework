Background:Related to genetic alteration, frequent promoter hypermethylation is also a contributing factor in the development of human cancers. Recently, we discovered numerous novel genes that were aberrantly methylated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip array. We utilized a quantitative methylation-specific PCR (Q-MSP) system for the evaluation of PAX6 methylation in 29 normal controls and 160 paired HCC tissues and their adjacent non-tumor tissues. We verified the correlation between the methylation status of PAX6 and clinical characteristics with different viral status.Results:Paired-box 6 promoter methylation was observed in 39.4 %, 15.6 %, and 3.4 % in primary HCCs, adjacent non-tumors, and normal control tissues, respectively. Methylation of the PAX6 promoter region in HCCs significantly increased compared with control tissues. PAX6 was frequently methylated in HCV-positive HCC tissues (61.3 %) and rarely methylated in HBV-positive (22.1 %) and double-negative HCC tissues (33.3 %).Conclusions:Our data suggests that promoter hypermethylation of PAX6 is a common event in HCCs and the association of PAX6 methylation in clinicopathological features is divergent with different viral status.
