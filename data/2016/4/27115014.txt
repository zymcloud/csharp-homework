Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly heterogenous disease and intratumor heterogeneity is a well-known fact within each individual tumor, and may involve morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular heterogeneities. Understanding of intratumor heterogeneity of HCC should provide critical knowledge about prognosis of the disease and response to therapy. In a recent article by Friemel and colleagues, the investigators utilized a comprehensive approach in linking immunohistochemical markers and molecular changes to morphological intratumor heterogeneity in HCC. The study found that intratumor heterogeneity was detectable in 87% of HCC cases. Combined heterogeneities with respect to morphologic, immunohistochemical, and mutational status of the two most important driver mutations CTNNB1 and TP53 were seen in 22% of HCC cases. The study demonstrates the challenges facing therapeutic strategies targeting single molecules and may explain the limited success so far in developing molecular targeted therapy for HCC.
