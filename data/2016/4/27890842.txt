Background:The surgical tactics in cases of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) and intra-abdominal malignancy are not uniform in the literature and are still a matter of debate. In this case report, we present a patient with coexisting AAA and primary liver cancer managed by simultaneous open AAA repair and liver resection After laparotomy and intraoperative liver ultrasonography that confirmed resectability of the tumor, aneurysm repair was performed with aorto-aortic tube grafting after interrenal cross-clamping Radiofrequency-assisted liver transection was performed to complete an anterior anatomic resection of liver segments VI and VII. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on a postoperative day 10.Methods:This was prospective follow up of one patient.Results:The patient is free from disease at 18-month follow-up.Conclusions:The best treatment strategy for patients with AAA and malignant disease is still not clearly defined. Strategy selection is made individually according to the risk of rupture of AAA, general condition of the patient, experience of the teams that should perform the procedure and estimated life expectancy after resection of malignant disease.
