Objectives:To compare transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)-related hepatic toxicities of conventional TACE (cTACE) and drug-eluting beads TACE (DEB-TACE) in patients with intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:In this retrospective study, 151 consecutive patients undergoing cTACE or DEB-TACE and MRI 3-6 weeks before and after therapy were included. Toxicity was assessed on imaging (global hepatic damages (GHD), overall biliary injuries, biliary cast, bile duct dilatation, intrahepatic biloma, portal thrombosis), and clinico-biological follow-ups. Tumour response, time to progression (TTP), and overall survival were assessed. Factors influencing complication rate were identified by generalized equation logistic regression model.Results:Biliary injuries and intrahepatic biloma incidence were significantly higher following DEB-TACE (p Conclusions:DEB-TACE was associated with increased hepatic toxicities compared to cTACE. GHD, biliary injuries, and intrahepatic biloma were more frequently observed with high baseline prothrombin value, suggesting that cTACE might be more appropriate than DEB-TACE in patients with less advanced cirrhosis.Key points:• DEB-TACE demonstrated more therapy-related hepatic locoregional complications compared to cTACE. • TACE-related hepatic locoregional toxicities occurred more frequently with high baseline PT value. • cTACE may be more appropriate in patients with high baseline PT value.
