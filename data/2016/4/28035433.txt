Adoptive immunotherapy leveraging chimeric antigen receptor-modified T (CAR-T) cells holds great promise for the treatment of cancer. However, tumor-associated antigens often have low expression levels in normal tissues, which can cause on-target, off-tumor toxicity. Recently, we reported that GPC3-targeted CAR-T cells could eradicate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) xenografts in mice. However, it remains unknown whether on-target, off-tumor toxicity can occur. Therefore, we proposed that dual-targeted CAR-T cells co-expressing glypican-3 (GPC3) and asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 (ASGR1) (a liver tissue-specific protein)-targeted CARs featuring CD3Î¶ and 28BB (containing both CD28 and 4-1BB signaling domains), respectively, may have reduced on-target, off-tumor toxicity. Our results demonstrated that dual-targeted CAR-T cells caused no cytotoxicity to ASGR1+GPC3- tumor cells, but they exhibited a similar cytotoxicity against GPC3+ASGR1- and GPC3+ASGR1+ HCC cells in vitro. We found that dual-targeted CAR-T cells showed significantly higher cytokine secretion, proliferation and antiapoptosis ability against tumor cells bearing both antigens than single-targeted CAR-T cells in vitro. Furthermore, the dual-targeted CAR-T cells displayed potent growth suppression activity on GPC3+ASGR1+ HCC tumor xenografts, while no obvious growth suppression was seen with single or double antigen-negative tumor xenografts. Additionally, the dual-targeted T cells exerted superior anticancer activity and persistence against single-targeted T cells in two GPC3+ASGR1+ HCC xenograft models. Together, T cells carrying two complementary CARs against GPC3 and ASGR1 may reduce the risk of on-target, off-tumor toxicity while maintaining relatively potent antitumor activities on GPC3+ASGR1+ HCC.
