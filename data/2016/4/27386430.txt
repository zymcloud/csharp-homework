Liver transplantation (LT) is an ideal treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) because it not only resects HCCs but it also replaces the underlying damaged liver with normal tissue. However, the selection criteria are still a matter of debate. After the introduction of the Milan criteria, some expanded criteria focusing on tumor size and number have been proposed. In addition, new expanded criteria considering tumor biology have been proposed using tumor markers and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. This review summarizes the selection criteria in LT for HCC and introduces current issues focusing on the treatment for hepatitis C virus infection and the significance of sarcopenia in this field.
