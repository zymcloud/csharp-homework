In recent years, with the development of transcriptomics, the effect of long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) on the regulation of biological processes is being elucidated. LncRNAs play an important role in tumor occurrence and development. LncRNA associated with microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (LncRNA MVIH) was first identified in hepatocellular carcinoma and is associated with angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis upregulation, and poor recurrence-free survival. MVIH has an important role in non-small cell lung cancer, in which it promotes cell proliferation and metastasis, and high MVIH expression indicates poor overall survival. However, the involvement of MVIH in breast cancer is unclear. Our research revealed that the expression levels of MVIH in breast cancer tissues were higher than in adjacent noncancerous tissues, and high MVIH expression was correlated with Ki67 expression. Moreover, breast cancer patients with high MVIH expression levels showed poor overall survival and disease-free survival. Multivariate analysis results indicated that MVIH was an independent prognostic factor in breast cancer. In addition, upregulated MVIH expression levels promoted cell proliferation and cell cycle, and inhibited cell apoptosis, while reduced MVIH expression showed the converse. In summary, our findings suggest that MVIH may have an important role in breast cancer and may serve as a new biomarker and a potential therapeutic target.
