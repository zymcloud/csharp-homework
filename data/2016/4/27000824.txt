Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant tumor worldwide. The prognosis and treatment of this disease have changed little in recent decades because the mechanisms underlying most events of this disease remain obscure. Allelic variation of gene expression is associated with many important biological processes, which provide a new perspective to understand HCC pathogenesis at the molecular level. To identify allelic expression imbalance (AEI) genes in HCCs, we developed a computational method that considered accurate mapping and vigorous AEI detection using paired DNA-seq and RNA-seq data. We analyzed the DNA-seq and RNA-seq data derived from two HCC samples and two cell lines. By applying a strict criterion, a total of 203 tumor-specific AEI genes were identified with high confidence, and several genes have been reported to be associated with the migration or proliferation of cancer cells, such as the genes RELN and DHRS3. In addition, we also found some novel AEI genes in HCCs, such as HNRNPR and PTAFR. Our study provides new insight into AEI events that may contribute to understanding gene expression regulation, cell proliferation and migration, and tumorigenesis.
