Background:Extensive research results support the use of herbal medicine or natural food to augment therapy for various cancers. Studies have associated glabridin with numerous biological activities, such as regulating energy metabolism and estrogenic, neuroprotective, antiosteoporotic, and skin-whitening activities.Hypothesis/purpose:However, how glabridin affects tumor cell autophagy has not been clearly determined.Methods:Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway essential for cell survival and tissue homeostasis. In this study, the roles of autophagy and related signaling pathways during glabridin-induced autophagy in human liver cancer cells were investigated. Additionally, the molecular mechanism of the anticancer effects of glabridin in human hepatoma cells was investigated.Results:The results revealed that glabridin significantly inhibited cell proliferation in human hepatoma cells. Glabridin induced apoptosis dose-dependently in Huh7 cells through caspase-3, -8, and -9 activation and PARP cleavage. Furthermore, autophagy was detected as early as 12h after exposure to a low dose of glabridin, as indicated by the up-regulated expression of LC3-II and beclin-1 proteins. The inhibition of JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK by specific inhibitors significantly reduced glabridin-induced activation of caspases-3, -8, and -9. Blocking autophagy sensitize the Huh7 cells to apoptosis.Conclusion:This study demonstrated for the first time that autophagy occurs earlier than apoptosis does during glabridin-induced apoptosis in human liver cancer cell lines. Glabridin induces Huh7 cell death through apoptosis through the p38 MAPK and JNK1/2 pathways and is a potential chemopreventive agent against human hepatoma.
