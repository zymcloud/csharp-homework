Objective:To investigate the influence of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway on the proportion and characteristics of the stem-like CD90(+) subpopulation of the human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line MHCC-97.Methods:MHCC-97H cultures were treated with the PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitor LY294002. The proportion of the CD90(+) subpopulation was determined by flow cytometry, and the expression of related proteins was measured by Western blot. The clonogenicity of CD90(+) and CD90(-) cells was measured by plate colony formation assay. The tumorigenicity was compared between CD90(+) and CD90(-) subpopulations (with different concentrations) in xenograft experiments in nude mice, and the changes in tumorigenicity after the addition of LY294002 were evaluated. The changes in the expression of CD90, SHP2, P-AKT, and AKT in CD90(+) and CD90(-) cell xenografts after the addition of LY294002 were examined. Data were analyzed using t test.Results:LY294002 was capable of reducing the proportion of CD90(+) HCC stem cells from 2.98%±0.08% to 0.78%±0.08% (t = 32.400, P Conclusion:The CD90(+) subpopulation of MHCC-97H cells has the characteristics of stem cells and is dependent on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
