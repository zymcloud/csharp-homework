MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are aberrantly expressed in virtually all cancer types, including digestive cancers. Herein, we aggregated and systematically analyzed miRNA expression profiles of 1765 tumor samples, including esophageal, gastric, liver, pancreatic, colon and rectal cancers, obtained through small RNA sequencing by The Cancer Genome Atlas. We found that digestive cancers of different tissue origins could be differentiated according to their miRNA expression profiles. In particular, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and esophageal adenocarcinoma exhibited distinct miRNA expression patterns. Thirteen (e.g. miR-135b, miR-182) and sixteen (e.g. miR-139, miR-133a-1, miR-490) miRNAs were commonly upregulated and downregulated in more than four cancer types, respectively. Pertinent to pathological features, low miR-181d expression was associated with microsatellite instability in colon and gastric cancers whereas low miR-106a expression was associated with hepatitis B virus infection in hepatocellular carcinoma. Progression in colon cancer could also be predicted by low let-7f-2 and high miR-106a expression. Molecular subtypes with distinct prognostic outcomes independent of tumor-node-metastasis staging were identified in hepatocellular carcinoma and colon cancer. In total, 4 novel and 6 reported associations between specific miRNAs and patients' survival were identified. Collectively, novel miRNA markers were identified to stratify digestive cancers with different pathological features and survival outcomes.
