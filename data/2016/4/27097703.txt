Objective:To determine incidence and trend of the liver cancer in Iran.Study design:An observational study.Place and duration of study:The Cancer Registry System in Iran, from 2003 to 2009.Methodology:Crude incidence rate for liver cancer were calculated per 100,000 people. Age standardized incidence rates (ASRs) were estimated using direct standardization and the standard population of World Health Organization (WHO). Data was analyzed using Cochran-Armitage test for linear trend and software of WinPepi 2.1.Results:Of 3,584 cases of liver cancer recorded between 2003 and 2009, 2,224 and 1,360 cases were men and women, respectively, which revealed significantly increasing trends (p=0.001). The highest incidence rate (950 cases) occurred in 2007 and the lowest rate (256 cases) in 2003. Based on the result, liver cancer incidence was more in men compared to women and the incidence increased with age.Conclusion:According to this study, the trend of age-standardized incidence rate of liver cancer in Iran is rising. Hence to prevent and control this cancer, it is necessary to investigate the related risk factors and implement prevention programs in Iran.
