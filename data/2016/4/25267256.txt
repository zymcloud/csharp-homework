Background:This study investigates whether there has been any survival improvement for hepatocellular carcinoma patients with resectable and unresectable lung metastases over time.Methods:The data of 280 hepatocellular carcinoma patients who developed metachronous lung metastases after hepatectomy with curative intent were analysed. Overall survival was compared in patients with resectable and unresectable lung metastases and in different periods (Era I: 1989-1995, Era II: 1996-2010).Results:The median overall survival of patients with unresectable and resectable diseases was 7.46 and 40.36 months, respectively (P Conclusions:Patients with resectable lung metastases had better overall survival than those with unresectable lung metastases. Notably, patients with unresectable lung metastases had significant improvement in survival over the years.
