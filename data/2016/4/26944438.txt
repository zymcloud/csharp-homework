Aim:Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) promotes cell growth, proliferation and survival. Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), which converts sphingosine to S1P, is a key promoter in cancer. We previously found that the SphK1 inhibitor II (SKI II), suppresses the cell growth and induces apoptosis in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. However, the precise regulatory mechanism and signaling pathway on SKI II inhibiting tumor growth remains unknown.Main methods:The expressions of β-catenin and related molecules of Wnt/β-catenin signal were detected by western blot in HepG2 cells. And the mRNA expression of β-catenin was detected by RT-PCR. The Wnt5A gene was silenced by siRNA. The colony formation was determined by staining with crystal violet. And the cell growth was examined by SRB assay and BrdU assay.Key findings:We found that SKI II decreased the expression of β-catenin and the downstream molecules of β-catenin signal pathway and promotes the β-catenin degradation. In addition, SKI II induced the expression of Wnt5A, and then triggered β-catenin degradation. Furthermore, silencing Wnt5A decreased the anti-tumor effects of SKI II through recovering the expressions of β-catenin and downstream molecules of β-catenin signal pathway.Significance:SKI II-induced downregulation of HepG2 cell proliferation was associated with Wnt signaling pathway through Wnt5A-mediated β-catenin degradation. Our study revealed that a novel signal pathway was involved in SKI II-inhibited cell proliferation in human hepatoma cells.
