Background:Single nucleotide polymorphism in miRNAs can alter its expression, thus lead to the development of cancers. Numerous studies have explored the association between miR-149 gene rs2292832 polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma risk, but the results remains inconsistent. So, we performed this pooled analyses in order to get a precise result.Methods:Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), calculated by STATA software, were used to determine whether miR-149 gene rs2292832 polymorphism contributes to the risk of Hepatocellular carcinoma. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on Medline (mainly PubMed), Cochrane Library database, Web of science and the China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) up to March 22, 2016.Results:A total of 20 studies including 8,201 cases and 9,294 controls were included in this meta-analysis. Four of 20 studies related to the hepatocellular carcinoma risk. When all the eligible studies were pooled into this meta-analysis, a significant association between miR-149 gene rs2292832 polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma risk was found. While no association was found between this gene polymorphism and overall cancer risk.Conclusions:Our meta-analysis supports that the miR-149 gene rs2292832 polymorphism contributed to the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma from currently available evidence. However, a study with a larger sample size is needed to further evaluate gene-environment interaction on MiR-149 gene rs2292832 polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma risk.
