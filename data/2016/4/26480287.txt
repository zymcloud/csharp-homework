Background and aim:The aim of this study is to explore the value of volume navigation image fusion-assisted contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in detection for radiofrequency ablation guidance of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), which were undetectable on conventional ultrasound.Methods:From May 2012 to May 2014, 41 patients with 49 HCCs were included in this study. All lesions were detected by dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and planned for radiofrequency ablation but were undetectable on conventional ultrasound. After a bolus injection of 2.4 ml SonoVue® (Bracco, Italy), LOGIQ E9 ultrasound system with volume navigation system (version R1.0.5, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) was used to fuse CEUS and MRI images. The fusion time, fusion success rate, lesion enhancement pattern, and detection rate were analyzed.Results:Image fusions were conducted successfully in 49 HCCs, the technical success rate was 100%. The average fusion time was (9.2 ± 2.1) min (6-12 min). The mean diameter of HCCs was 25.2 ± 5.3 mm (mean ± SD), and mean depth was 41.8 ± 17.2 mm. The detection rate of HCCs using CEUS/MRI imaging fusion (95.9%, 47/49) was significantly higher than CEUS (42.9%, 21/49) (P Conclusions:Imaging fusion combining CEUS and MRI is a promising technique to improve the detection, precise localization, and accurate diagnosis of undetectable HCCs on conventional ultrasound, especially small and atypical HCCs.
