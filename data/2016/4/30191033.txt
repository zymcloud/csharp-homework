Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies and represents a unique challenge for physicians and patients. Treatment patterns are not uniform between areas despite efforts to promote a common protocol. Even if most hepatologists worldwide adopt the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system, Asian and North American physicians are also independently making an effort to expand the indications of each treatment, combining therapies for better outcomes. Also, new therapeutic techniques have emerged and an increasing number of studies are trying to include these paradigm shifts into newer treatment guidelines. Controversial and diverging points in the current international guidelines are emphasized and discussed. Unanswered questions are also analyzed to identify the most needed and promising future perspectives.
