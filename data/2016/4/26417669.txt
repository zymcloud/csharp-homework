Purpose:To quantify baseline relaxation rates R2* and R1 in the abdomen, their changes after respiratory challenges, and their reproducibility in healthy volunteers and patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at 1.5T and 3.0T.Materials and methods:R2* measurements were acquired in the liver in 8 volunteers and 27 patients with 34 HCCs using multiecho T2* at baseline and after respiratory challenges with 100% oxygen (O2 ) and carbogen (CB = 95%O2 /5%CO2 ). R1 was measured at 1.5T in one volunteer and 21 patients with 23 HCCs. Test-retest coefficient of variation (CV) was assessed in 10 subjects. Intra- and interobserver variability of R2* and R1 measurements was assessed in 12 and 10 patients, respectively. Parameters for HCC, liver, and muscle were compared between baseline and after gas challenges.Results:We observed that R2* and R1 imaging of HCCs with O2 and CB is feasible and reproducible (test-retest CV R2*0.88/R1 >0.7 and CV R2*Conclusion:R2* measurements in HCC and liver parenchyma are more reproducible at 1.5T than at 3.0T, and with O2 than with CB challenge. We observed a decrease in R2* and an increase in R1 of HCCs from baseline in response to O2 challenge, as expected with increased tissue and blood oxygenation.
