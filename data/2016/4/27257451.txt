Hemangiomas are the most common tumor of the liver and distinguishing them from malignancy is important. This is a report of 3 hemangiomas in 2 patients that exhibit transient washout of gadoxetate disodium (Eovist), relative to blood pool and liver parenchyma, a characteristic that is used to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma in at-risk patients. It is important to recognize that high-flow hemangiomas can exhibit transient washout when using a small volume of injected contrast agent. This finding is unlikely to be present on CT examinations because of the larger volume of contrast administered.
