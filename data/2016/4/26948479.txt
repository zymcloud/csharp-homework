Objectives:The platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) have been studied widely in cancer diseases. However, their correlation with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of PLR and NLR with disease severity in patients with HCV-related liver disease and the virological response in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients.Methods:The clinical data of 120 HCV-infected patients and 40 healthy controls were analyzed. The clinical data of 24 CHC patients who had been followed up regularly were collected for the following time points: before treatment (week 0) and weeks 4, 48, and 72 during treatment. These data were also analyzed. All data were collected from the database of the hospital patient electronic medical record system.Results:The HCV-related cirrhosis group and HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma group were found to have lower PLRs (61±31 and 51±23) than the healthy controls (115±23). The PLR of the HCV cleared group (154±85) was significantly higher than that of the HCV untreated group and HCV uncleared group (90±28 and 88±40, respectively). Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis for the PLR showed an area under the curve of 0.772 (95% confidence interval 0.674-0.869, pConclusions:The PLR is closely related to disease severity in patients with HCV-related liver disease and to the virological response in CHC patients. Dynamic continuous monitoring of the PLR will contribute to disease surveillance, with an increasing tendency predicting a good virological response.
