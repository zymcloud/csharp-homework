Recent studies have indicated that increased ribosomal activity contributes to cancer progression. Transcription termination factor, RNA polymerase I (TTF1) acts as a transcription factor for RNA polymerase I. However, the role which TTF1 plays in cancer progression still remains unknown. The present study aimed to determine whether TTF1 plays a critical role in the progression of human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was conducted to evaluate TTF1 mRNA expression in 60 HCC tissue samples in order to determine the clinicopathological significance of TTF1. To investigate whether the expression levels of TTF1 were associated known gene signatures which represented ribosomal activity, we applied gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to HCC cases in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) a. We also performed in vitro proliferation assays using TTF1â€‘overexpressing HCC cells. TTF1 expression was significantly higher in HCC tumor tissues than in adjacent liver tissues (P
