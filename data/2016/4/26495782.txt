Objectives:Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are premalignant pancreatic cysts commonly found incidentally. Immunosuppression accelerates carcinogenesis.Thus, we aimed to compare IPMN progression in liver transplant (LT) recipients on chronic immunosuppression to progression among an immunocompetent population.Methods:We retrospectively assessed adult LT recipients between 2008 and 2014 for imaging evidence of IPMN. Diagnosis of IPMN was based on history, imaging, and cyst fluid analysis. The immunocompetent control group consisted of nontransplant patients from our pancreatic cyst surveillance program with IPMN under surveillance for greater than 12 months between 1997 and 2013. Four hundred fifty-four patients underwent LT in the study period and had cross-sectional imaging.Results:The prevalence of suspected IPMN was 6.6% (30 of 454). Compared with 131 controls, the transplant cohort was younger, with increased prevalence of diabetes and smoking. The prevalence of other risk factors for IPMN progression (history of pancreatitis, family history of pancreatic cancer) was similar. After an average follow-up of 31 months, most cysts increased in diameter, with a similar increase of dominant cyst (0.4 cm vs 0.5 cm; P = 0.6). Type of immunosuppression was not associated with the increased rate of cyst growth.Conclusions:Our findings suggest that LT recipients with incidental IPMN can be managed under similar guidelines as immunocompetent patients.
