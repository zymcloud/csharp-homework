Objectives:The aim of the study was to retrospectively compare the diagnostic performance of ultrasound (US), contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and contrast-enhanced MRI in cirrhotic patients who were candidates for liver transplantation.Materials and methods:A total of 273 consecutive patients with 218 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) nodules, who underwent imaging and subsequent transplantation, were examined. Diagnosis of HCC was based on explant correlation of the whole liver. Three different imaging data sets were evaluated: US, MDCT and MRI unenhanced and dynamic phases. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value, with corresponding 95% confidence intervals, were determined. Statistical analysis was performed for all lesions and for two lesion subgroups (â‰¤2 and >2 cm). Preoperative tumour staging was analysed.Results:Patient sensitivity to US, MDCT and MRI was 80.4, 81.1 and 90.5%, respectively. Specificity was 96.3, 96.2 and 82.1%. Combined US and MDCT improved sensitivity (88%) without significant loss in specificity (95.7%). Imaging tests resulted in accurate tumour staging in 83.4% of the patients. In per-nodule analysis, technique sensitivity was 55.6, 52.4 and 65.9%, respectively. Sensitivity figures improved when the nodule was larger than 2 cm.Conclusion:Combining imaging techniques is a good strategy for pretransplant HCC diagnosis and provides more accurate cancer staging in patients, which is necessary to decide the correct therapeutic approach.
