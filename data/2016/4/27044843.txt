MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNAs with post-transcriptional regulatory function, playing crucial roles in cancer development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previous studies have indicated that miR-1180 was implicated in diverse biological processes. However, the underlying mechanism of miR-1180 in HCC has not been intensively investigated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of miR-1180 and its target genes in HCC. We found that miR-1180 expression was significantly increased in HCC cells and clinical tissues compared with their corresponding controls. Overexpression of miR-1180 promoted cell proliferation in HCC cell line HepG2. TNFAIP3 interacting protein 2 (TNIP2), a potential target gene of miR-1180, and were validated by a luciferase assay. Further studies revealed that miR-1180 regulated cell proliferation of HCC by directly suppressing TNIP2 expression and the knockdown of TNIP2 expression reversed the effect of miR-1180-in on HCC cell proliferation. In summary, our data indicated that miR-1180 might act as a tumor promoter by targeting TNIP2 during development of HCC.
