Combination therapy has been developed as a promising therapeutic approach for hepatocellular carcinoma therapy. Here we report a low toxicity and high performance nanoparticle system that was self-assembled from a poly(ethylenimine)-glycyrrhetinic acid (PEI-GA) amphiphilic copolymer as a versatile gene/drug dual delivery nanoplatform. PEI-GA was synthesized by chemical conjugation of hydrophobic GA moieties to the hydrophilic PEI backbone via an acylation reaction. The PEI-GA nanocarrier could encapsulate doxorubicin (DOX) efficiently with loading level about 12% and further condense DNA to form PEI-GA/DOX/DNA complexes to codeliver drug and gene. The diameter of the complexes is 102 ± 19 nm with zeta potential of 19.6 ± 0.2 mV. Furthermore, the complexes possess liver cancer targeting ability and could promote liver cancer HepG2 cell internalization. Apoptosis of cells could be induced by chemotherapy of DOX, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway acts a beneficial effect on the modulation of autophagy. Here, it is revealed that utilizing PEI-GA/DOX/shAkt1 complexes results in effective autophagy and apoptosis, which are useful to cause cell death. The induction of superfluous autophagy is reported to induce type-II cell death and also could increase the sensity of chemotherapy to tumor cells. In this case, combining autophagy and apoptosis is meaningful for oncotherapy. In this study, PEI-GA/DOX/shAkt1 has demonstrated favorable tumor target ability, little side effects, and ideal antitumor efficacy.
