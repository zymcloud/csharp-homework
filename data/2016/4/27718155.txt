Purpose:In the VELOUR study, aflibercept + FOLFIRI regimen resulted in improved survival in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients who progressed after oxaliplatin. The use of aflibercept outside the clinical trial framework needs to be further assessed in terms of effectiveness and tolerability.Methods:Early access to aflibercept through a named patient programme (NPP) was provided to mCRC patients receiving FOLFIRI as second-line treatment in Spain. The effectiveness of aflibercept was assessed as progression-free survival (PFS) achieved within the NPP population. Post hoc analyses on PFS were done according to certain baseline characteristics (K-RAS mutation, prior targeted therapy) or prognostic factors.Results:Registries from 71 mCRC patients included in the NPP were reviewed retrospectively. The median age for the NPP population was 64 years (19.7 % aged ≥70 years) and 63.4 % patients had ≥2 metastases. A median PFS of 5.3 months (95 % CI, 3.6-8.5 months) was achieved, which did not depend on K-RAS mutation status or prior targeted therapy received. The risk of progression or death increased in patients with a poor prognosis as per the GERCOR score (performance status [PS] 1-2 and increased baseline lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] level) compared with patients with a good prognosis (PS 0 and normal LDH level) (median PFS: 2.6 vs. 8.3 months, respectively; p = 0.0124). Aflibercept was well tolerated, with a manageable toxicity profile.Conclusions:Bearing in mind the differences in sample size, the PFS achieved with the aflibercept + FOLFIRI regimen in the real-life practice setting is comparable to that observed in the clinical trial setting.
