We aimed to evaluate the associations of visceral adiposity with cardiometabolic risk factors in normal subjects with integrated 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). A total of 58 normal subjects who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT scan for cancer screening were included in this study. Volume and average Hounsfield unit (HU) of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was measured from CT components of integrated PET/CT. Standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of liver, spleen, lumbar spine and ascending aorta (AA) were measured from PET components of integrated PET/CT. Body mass index (coefficient 78.25, p = 0.0259), glucose (37.62, p<0.0001), insulin (348.90, p = 0.0011), logarithmic transformation of homeostatic model assessment index-insulin resistance (-2118.37, p = 0.0007), and VAT HU (-134.99, p<0.0001) were independently associated with VAT volume. Glucose (0.1187, p = 0.0098) and VAT volume (-0.004, p<0.0001) were found to be associated with VAT HU. Both VAT volume and VAT HU of whole abdominal cavity is significantly associated with cardiometabolic risk factors.
