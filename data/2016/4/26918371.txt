Objective:To investigate the potential prognostic roles of polymorphisms in the X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XPCC1), xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) and excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1) genes for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:Clinical data and blood samples from 308 HCC patients receiving TACE were collected between January 2010 and December 2013. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RLFP) analyses was used to determine the genotypes of the XPCC1 (rs25487), XPD (rs13181) and ERCC1 (rs11615) genes. The relationships between the genotypes and the efficacy of TACE treatment were analyzed.Results:The XRCCI rs25487 polymorphism was associated with a favorable prognosis in HCC patients receiving TACE (p = 0.006), and patients carrying variant genotypes (A/A + G/A) were associated with significantly reduced risk of death compared with those with the wild genotype (G/G) (HR = 0.556; 95% CI = 0.354-0.874). These findings were supported by Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showing that median survival time for patients with A/A + G/A genotypes was significantly longer compared with those with the G/G genotype (11.2 month vs. 8.0 months; log rank p = 0.006). Stratified analyses revealed that A/A + G/A genotypes of XRCC1 rs25487 are associated with significantly reduced risk of death compared with the G/G genotype in patients grouped by tumor size, portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and TNM stage (all p 0.05).Conclusion:The XRCC1 rs25487 polymorphisms are prognostic for HCC patients receiving TACE. The ERCC1 and XPD polymorphisms had no relationship to the clinical outcomes.
