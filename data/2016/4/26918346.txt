Post-liver transplantation tumor recurrence is a major challenge for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recipients. We aimed to identify early-phase circulating microRNAs after liver transplantation for predicting tumor recurrence and survival of HCC recipients. Circulating microRNA profiles at early-phase (2-hour after portal vein reperfusion) after liver transplantation were compared between HCC recipients with (n=4) and without tumor recurrence (n=8) by microarray analyses. Candidate microRNAs were validated in 62 HCC recipients by quantitative RT-PCR. The prognostic values of microRNAs for tumor recurrence and survival were examined. Simulated in vitro ischemia-reperfusion injury models were employed to characterize the possible mechanism of up-regulation of circulating microRNAs. Our results showed that up-regulation of circulating miR-148a, miR-1246 or miR-1290 at early-phase was significantly associated with HCC recurrence after liver transplantation. Among them, miR-148a (p=0.030) and miR-1246 (p=0.009) were significant predictors of HCC recurrence. MiR-1246 was an independent predictor of overall (p=0.023) and disease-free survival (p=0.020) of HCC recipients. The level of early-phase circulating miR-1246 was positively correlated with serum AST and ALT levels in HCC recipients after liver transplantation. The expression of hepatic miR-1246 was positively correlated with TNFÎ± mRNA. In vitro experiments indicated that injury-induced activation and differentiation of macrophages significantly elevated the expression and secretion of miR-1246. In conclusion, early-phase circulating miR-1246 is an indicator of hepatic injury and a novel prognostic biomarker for tumor recurrence and survival of HCC recipients after liver transplantation.
