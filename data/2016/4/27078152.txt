Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Most cases of HCC are associated with cirrhosis related to chronic hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infections. Hypermethylation of promoter regions is the main epigenetic mechanism of gene silencing and has been involved in HCC development. The aim of this study was to determine whether aberrant methylation of RASSF1A and DOK1 gene promoters is associated with the progression of liver disease in Brazilian patients. Methylation levels were measured by pyrosequencing in 41 (20 HCC, 9 cirrhotic, and 12 non-cirrhotic) liver tissue samples. Mean rates of methylation in RASSF1A and DOK1 were 16.2% and 12.0% in non-cirrhotic, 26.1% and 19.6% in cirrhotic, and 59.1% and 56.0% in HCC tissues, respectively, showing a gradual increase according to the progression of the disease, with significantly higher levels in tumor tissues. In addition, hypermethylation of RASSF1A and DOK1 was found in the vast majority (88%) of the HCC cases. Interestingly, DOK1 methylation levels in HCC samples were significantly higher in the group of younger (
