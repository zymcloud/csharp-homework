Tripartite motif 16 (TRIM16), a member of the RING B-box coiled-coil (RBCC)/tripartite totif (TRIM) protein family, has been demonstrated to have significant effects on tumor migration by previous studies, but its specific contribution to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of TRIM16 and investigate its functional roles in HCC. The expression of TRIM16 in HCC patient samples were examined using qRT-PCR and western blotting. HCC cell lines with either TRIM16 overexpression or knockdown were established. The effect of TRIM16 on HCC cell migration and invasion was investigated using these cells. Compared with paired normal liver tissues in clinical cancer samples, we found that the expression of TRIM16 was significantly downregulated in HCC lesions. We also found knockdown of TRIM16 promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in a manner associated with HCC metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, TRIM16 inhibited ZEB2 expression, which in turn inhibited transcription of the pivotal ZEB2 target gene E-cadherin. RNA interference-mediated silencing of ZEB2 attenuated shTRIM16-enhanced cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, our findings define TRIM16 as an inhibitor of EMT and metastasis in HCC that predicts poor clinical outcomes.
