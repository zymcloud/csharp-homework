Purpose:To evaluate clinical impact of different intervals between multiple transarterial chemoembolization sessions in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:A retrospective cohort study of 305 consecutive patients with HCC who underwent multiple sessions of on-demand transarterial chemoembolization by two independent physicians with different management policies in terms of transarterial chemoembolization interval was performed; 180 patients had intervals between the first and second transarterial chemoembolization session of Results:The short-interval group had more cases of advanced-stage HCC, less favorable response to transarterial chemoembolization, and higher likelihood of having Child-Pugh class A. The short-interval group underwent more transarterial chemoembolization sessions (6.6 vs 5.5, P = .011), although the total number of admissions and total hospital stay were similar to the conventional-interval group. Overall survival was similar in the two groups in the full and the propensity score-matched cohorts. Although the overall survival of patients with Child-Pugh class A was comparable between the two groups in the full and propensity score-matched cohorts, the short-interval group showed inferior survival (P = .005) and a nonsignificant trend toward inferior survival (P = .117) in the full and propensity score-matched cohorts, respectively, for patients with Child-Pugh class B.Conclusions:Transarterial chemoembolization interval did not affect survival outcomes of patients with Child-Pugh class A. A shorter transarterial chemoembolization interval showed a nonsignificant trend of adversely affecting survival for patients with Child-Pugh class B.
