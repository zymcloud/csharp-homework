Aims:Sorafenib is the current standard treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. We carried out a national audit of UK patients treated with sorafenib as standard-of-care and those treated with systemic therapy in first-line trials.Materials and methods:Sorafenib-treated and trial-treated patients were identified via the Cancer Drugs Fund and local databases. Data were collected retrospectively from medical records according to a standard case report form. The primary outcome measure was overall survival, estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:Data were obtained for 448 sorafenib-treated patients from 15 hospitals. The median age was 68 years (range 17-89) and 75% had performance status â‰¤ 1. At baseline, 77% were Child-Pugh A and 16.1% Child-Pugh B; 38% were albumin-bilirubin grade 1 (ALBI-1) and 48% ALBI-2; 23% were Barcelona Clinic Liver Classification B (BCLC-B) and 72% BCLC-C. The median time on sorafenib was 3.6 months, with a mean daily dose of 590 mg. The median overall survival for 448 evaluable sorafenib-treated patients was 8.5 months. There were significant differences in overall survival comparing Child-Pugh A versus Child-Pugh B (9.5 versus 4.6 months), ALBI-1 versus ALBI-2 (12.9 versus 5.9 months) and BCLC-B versus BCLC-C (13.0 versus 8.3 months). For trial-treated patients (n=109), the median overall survival was 8.1 months and this was not significantly different from the sorafenib-treated patients.Conclusion:For Child-Pugh A patients with good performance status, survival outcomes were similar to those reported in global randomised controlled trials. Patients with ALBI grade > 1, Child-Pugh B or poor performance status seem to derive limited benefit from sorafenib treatment.
