Introduction:This meta-analysis aimed to compare perioperative and survival outcomes in patients who underwent hepatectomy with and without Bile Duct Tumour Thrombus (BDTT).Methods:A comprehensive search of Cochrane Library, PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed to identify relevant articles. The perioperative, postoperative and long term outcomes were compared.Results:Eleven studies including 6051 patients met the inclusion criteria. The perioperative outcomes were comparable between the 2 groups. The BDTT group had higher proportion poorly differentiated tumours (OR = 1.87, X(2) = 10.00, df = 6, p = 0.002, I(2) = 40%), Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (OR = 4.85, X(2) = 28.21, df = 9, p = Conclusion:Patients with HCC with BDTT had more advanced stage HCC with adverse histological features including higher rates of MVI, LVI and poor differentiation. Hepatectomy in this group of patients offers similar survival at 3 years but inferior long-term survival and should be considered when feasible.
