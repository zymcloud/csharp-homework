Aim:To study the therapeutic effect of norcantharidin (NCTD) combined with ABT-737 on hepatocellular carcinoma cells and the molecular mechanism.Methods:Two hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, HepG2 and SMMC-7721, were selected. ABT-737 and NCTD were allocated into groups to be used alone or in combination. HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells were cultured in vitro. Liver cancer cells in the logarithmic phase of growth were vaccinated and cultured to the cell wall stage; these cells were treated for 48 h with different concentrations of NCTD, or ABT-737, or NCTD combined with ABT-737. The cell proliferation inhibition rate was detected by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium. The expression of Mcl in HCC cells was detected by Western Blotting, and the cells in each group after treatment had apoptosis detected by flow cytometry. The proliferation inhibition rate, the expression of Mcl-1 in cells and the apoptosis inducing effect of treatment were observed in each group, and the effect of NCTD on ABT-737 in the treatment of HCC and its mechanism of action were analyzed.Results:As the concentration of NCTD increased, the cell proliferation inhibition rate gradually decreased; and the treatment effect of ABT-737 1-3 Î¼m combined with NCTD on cell proliferation inhibition was stronger than that of ABT-737 alone. The difference was statistically significant (P 0.05). The effect on inducing apoptosis in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells with the treatment of ABT-737 combined with NCTD for 48 h was greater than that of ABT-737 or NCTD alone. The difference was statistically significant (P Conclusion:NCTD combined with ABT-737 has a positive role in the treatment of HCC, and it has great value in clinical research.
