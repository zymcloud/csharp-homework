To evaluate the diagnostic performance of quantitative analysis as an adjunctive diagnostic tool to contrast-enhanced ultrasound (US) for the differentiation of atypical benign focal liver lesions (FLLs) from malignancies in fatty liver. Twenty-seven benign FLLs and fifty-six malignant FLLs that appeared hyper-enhanced during the arterial phase with washout in the portal or late phase in fatty liver were analyzed. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were applied to identify the specific features. Three sets of criteria were assigned: 1) all FLLs subjected to routine contrast-enhanced US; 2) all FLLs subjected to quantification analysis and contrast-enhanced US; and 3) parts of FLLs that could not be diagnosed using contrast-enhanced US (n = 66, 75.9%) but instead were diagnosed using parametric features. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the three sets of criteria were analyzed. The AUCs of the criterion set 2 were significantly higher than those of criterion set 1 (0.904 versus 0.792, P = 0.008). Criterion set 3 showed a relatively high sensitivity (90.2%) with a relatively high AUC (0.845). The quantification analysis offers improved diagnostic performance for the differential identification of atypical benign FLLs from malignancies in fatty liver.
