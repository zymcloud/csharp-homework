Background/aim:Hepatocellular cancer is a rising dilemma. Patients with unresectable disease may benefit from locoregional therapy. The comparative effectiveness of radioembolization and Doxorubicin-Drug-Eluting-Beads (DEBDOX) has not been established to date. We compared the performance of radioembolization and DEBDOX in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.Patients and methods:An analysis of our prospectively managed locoregional therapy (LRT) database was performed. Three hundred and fifty-eight patients were treated with LRT for unresectable HCC, out of which 291 were treated with DEBDOX and 67 with Ytrrium-90 ((90)Y). Comparative toxicity, tumor response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Propensity score matching was used to reduce treatment-selection bias, producing 48 pairs. Comparative analysis was repeated after propensity matching.Results:Median age was 67 and 65 years for the DEBDOX and (90)Y groups respectively (p=0.2). Overall survival favored the DEBDOX group (DEBDOX: 15-months, (90)Y: 6-months, pConclusion:Our observation suggests that DEBDOX outperforms (90)Y with superior efficacy and survival with a trend towards lower all-grade toxicity.
