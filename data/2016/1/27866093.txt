Coumalamide derivatives are one of 2-pyrones derivatives, exerting multifunctional bioactivity. An array of coumalamide derivatives have been developed and presented good antiproliferative properties on cancer cells. However, the synthesis of 5-substituted coumalamide derivatives has not yet been published. Resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs is a major obstacle in hepatocellular carcinoma therapy. Recent evidence suggests that overexpression of constitutively active Akt confers on cancer cells resistance to chemotherapy. In this study, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of a novel N-substituted coumalamide derivative (NSCA-1). The results indicated that NSCA-1 exerts synergistic cytotoxicity with Adriamycin in HepG2/ADR (HepG2/adriamycin) cells. Furthermore, both of the Akt kinase activity and phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) were found to be inhibited by NSCA-1 and subsequently resulting in decreased phosphorylation of GSK-3Î². The intracellular accumulation of Adriamycin was also boosted by NSCA-1 via reducing the expression of p-gp. In addition, we found that combined treatment with NSCA-1 enhance cell apoptosis induced by Adriamycin via p53-dependant apoptotic pathway.
