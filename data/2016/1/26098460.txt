Purpose:To determine the performance of dynamic contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the diagnosis of small (≤2-cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to identify factors that influence this performance.Materials and methods:Medline and Embase databases were searched for studies performed from January 2000 to March 2014 in which the performance of MR imaging was reported for the detection of HCC up to 2 cm on either a lesion- or patient-based level, with sufficient data to construct 2 × 2 contingency tables. Diagnostic performance was quantitatively pooled for all studies by using a bivariate random-effects model with exploration involving subgroup analysis, meta-regression, and determination of study heterogeneity.Results:Twenty-two studies with 1387 small HCC lesions in 1908 patients met inclusion criteria. Heterogeneity was higher for sensitivity (range, 30%-99%) than specificity (range, 61%-100%). Overall sensitivity was 78% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 68%, 85%; I(2) = 89%), and overall specificity was 92% (95% CI: 88%, 95%; I(2) = 69%). The primary potential source of bias was use of explant as the reference standard in only 13% of studies, although lower sensitivity in such studies was not significant (59% vs 80%, P = .165). Sensitivities were significantly higher for studies that originated from Asia compared with those that originated elsewhere (89% vs 71%, P = .028), those performed with hepatobiliary phase imaging compared with those without (87% vs 65%, respectively; P = .004), and those in which gadoxetate disodium was used versus an extracellular agent (92% vs 67%, P ≤ .001). Specificity was not significantly different between subgroups (P ≥ .122). At pairwise meta-regression analysis with either study origin from Asia or performance of hepatobiliary phase imaging, only gadoxetate disodium contrast agent showed significant independent association with higher sensitivity (P = .002-.007).Conclusion:Results of this meta-analysis suggest that dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging has moderate sensitivity and excellent specificity in the detection of HCC up to 2 cm. Gadoxetate disodium contrast agent showed the strongest association with increased sensitivity.
