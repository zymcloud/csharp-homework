Background:Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proved to play important roles in the tumorigenesis and development of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of our study is to investigate the expression and function of BRAF-activated noncoding RNA (BANCR) in HCC.Methods:BANCR expression was detected in HCC tissues and cell lines by using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Association between BANCR levels and clinicopathological factors and patient prognosis was also analyzed. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), flow cytometry, and transwell invasion and migration assays were used to investigate the role of BANCR in the regulation of biological behaviors of HCC cells.Results:BANCR expression was remarkably increased in HCC tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues (PConclusions:These findings suggested that BANCR may contribute to HCC initiation and progression and would be used as not only a novel prognostic marker but also a potential therapeutic target for this disease.
