Background:Evaluation of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) by using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and volume perfusion computed tomography (VPCT) as methods that display tumor vascularization.Purpose:To assess early results of TACE in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using CEUS and VPCT.Material and methods:Twenty patients with HCC underwent CEUS and VPCT in the pre- and post-TACE setting (1 day). Hepatic perfusion index (HPI), arterial liver perfusion (ALP), blood flow (BF), and blood volume (BV) were measured with VPCT. Peak intensity (PI), time-to-peak (TTP), and regional blood flow (RBF) were measured with CEUS. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values, and cutoff values for these parameters were calculated. Immediate tumor response after TACE was classified as responder or non-responder. Results were compared with those at follow-up after 2 and 4 months (FU2mo/FU4mo) following modified RECIST.Results:CEUS and VPCT showed comparable immediate post-TACE results in 20/20 cases. Complete response was confirmed in 10/20 patients at FU2mo and in 9/20 at FU4mo. For responders, reduction in HPI, ALP, BV, and BF at day 1 post TACE proved significant (P 29.6%, in BV of >41.4%, or in BF of >53.1% was indicative of response according to FU2mo. For responders only, changes in PI (P Conclusion:CEUS performs equally to VPCT for assessment of early response to TACE in HCC by a lesion-by-lesion assessment and showed prognostic value at mid-term.
