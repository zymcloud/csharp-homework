Introduction:Laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy has been proven to be a safe and effective treatment for liver lesions. However, most of the literatures only reported this treatment method on benign lesion or colorectal metastases. The data on long-term outcome of laparoscopic left lateral section resection in patients with HCC and cirrhosis are still limited. The aim of this study is to analyze the survival outcome of laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy when compared to open approach in patients with HCCs.Method:Between January 2004 and September 2014, 967 patients had primary HCC with hepatectomy performed. Twenty-four patients had undergone pure laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Twenty-nine patients with case-matched tumor characteristics and liver functions but received open left lateral sectionectomy for HCC were included for comparison.Results:Comparing laparoscopic group to open resection group, the median operation time was 190.5 versus 195 min (P = 0.734); the median blood loss was 100 versus 300 ml (P 115 months versus >125 months in the open group (P = 0.853).Conclusion:Laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy for HCC is a safe and simple procedure associated with less blood loss. The survival outcome is comparable with conventional open approach. It is becoming a more favorable treatment option even for patients with HCC and cirrhosis.
