Background:The aim of the present study was to clarify the outcome of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within Milan criteria.Patients and methods:The study comprised of 197 adult patients. One hundred twenty-nine patients were within Milan criteria. The overall and recurrence-free survival rates after the LDLT were calculated.Results:The 1-, 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 94.5%, 89.9% and 88.6%, respectively. The 1-, 5- and 10-year recurrence-free survival rates were 100%, 97.0% and 94.0%, respectively. Four patients had HCC recurrence. The mean neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (6.75 vs. 2.75, p=0.002) or alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (3,239 vs. 197, pConclusion:The outcome of LDLT for patients with HCC within Milan criteria was outstanding. Careful follow-up after LDLT is necessary for patients with high NLR or AFP.
