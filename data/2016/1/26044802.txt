Background:Although cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) has been associated with perioperative morbidity, data are lacking regarding the risk of prolonged length of stay (pLOS) and delay to receipt of systemic therapy (ST).Objective:To evaluate the association of clinicopathologic features with postoperative complications, pLOS, and time to receipt of ST.Design, setting, and participants:We evaluated 294 patients with M1 renal cell carcinoma treated between 1990 and 2009.Interventions:CN.Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:Logistic and Cox regressions were used to evaluate associations of clinicopathologic features with 30-d postoperative complications, pLOS (LOS ≥75th percentile), and time to receipt of ST.Results and limitations:Fifteen (5%) patients experienced at least one Clavien grade ≥3 early complication. Among patients for whom postsurgical ST was recommended, 61% did not receive ST within 60 d, but the delay was surgery-related in only 11%. In multivariable models limited to preoperative features, liver metastases were associated with complications (odds ratio [OR] 3.73, p=0.004) and pLOS (OR 2.46, p=0.03), while a laparoscopic approach was associated with earlier administration of ST (hazard ratio [HR] 5.05, p<0.001). In multivariable models incorporating operative features, intraoperative transfusion was associated with complications (OR 1.14, p<0.001) and pLOS (OR 1.22, p<0.001), while pN1 disease was associated with pLOS (OR 2.12, p=0.049) and delay to ST (HR 0.38, p=0.004). Limitations include the retrospective design and surgical selection bias.Conclusions:Overall, 61% of CN patients did not receive timely ST, but only 5% of patients experienced Clavien grade ≥3 complications and the delay to ST was surgery-related in 11%. Liver metastases, intraoperative transfusion, and pN1 disease were independently associated with perioperative morbidity.Patient summary:We evaluated the morbidity of cytoreductive nephrectomy and identified predictors of unfavorable perioperative outcomes. Although 61% of patients did not receive timely systemic therapy, the rates of complications and surgery-related delay to systemic therapy were low.
