Liver metastasis is the major cause of death from colorectal cancer (CRC). Understanding its mechanisms is necessary for timely diagnosis and development of effective therapies. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is an IL-1 cytokine family member that uniquely functions as a cytokine and nuclear factor. It is released by necrotic epithelial cells and activated innate immune cells, functioning as an alarmin or an early danger signal. Its role in invoking type 2 immune response has been established; however, it has contrasting roles in tumor development and metastasis. We identified IL-33 as a potently upregulated cytokine in a highly metastatic murine CRC cell line and examined its role in tumor growth and metastasis to the liver. IL-33 was transgenically expressed in murine and human adenocarcinoma and carcinoma cell lines and their growth and spontaneous metastasis to the liver were assessed in orthotopic models of CRC in wild-type C57Bl/6 and Il33 knockout mice. The results showed that increased expression of IL-33 in CRC cells enhanced their tumor take, growth, and liver metastasis. Tumor- rather than host-derived IL-33 induced the enhanced recruitment of CD11b+ GR1+ and CD11b+ F4/80+ myeloid cells to remodel the tumor microenvironment by increased expression of mobilizing cytokines, and tumor angiogenesis by activating endothelial cells. IL-33 expression was elevated in patient tumor tissues, induced early in adenoma development, and activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines derived from the tumor microenvironment. The data suggest that tumor-derived IL-33 modulates the tumor microenvironment to potently promote colon carcinogenesis and liver metastasis, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target.
