Biomechanical properties and cytoskeletal organization of cancer cells are known to be closely related with their aggressive phenotype. In this study, based on atomic force microscopy (AFM), we aimed to evaluate the mechanical property of liver cancer stem-like cells (LCSCs) and compare it with human hepatoma cells (HHCs). LCSCs were enriched from human hepatoma cell line MHCC97H through a sphere culture system. AFM nanoindentation was investigated as a method for measuring the cell stiffness, and reflecting by Young׳s modulus. Microfilament bundles of F-actin were observed with immunofluorescence staining by confocal microscopy. We found that LCSCs show lower Young׳s modulus and higher migration ability compared to MHCC97H cells. Moreover, the decrease in Young׳s modulus is accompanied with a dramatic decline in F-actin content. These results demonstrated a close relationship between the cell Young׳s modulus and metastatic potential of HHCs, which suggest that Young׳s modulus detected by AFM can be used to evaluate metastatic potential of cancer cells.
