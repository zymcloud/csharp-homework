Background:To evaluate the association between the therapeutic outcomes of sorafenib for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the parameters of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM).Methods:Nine patients were evaluated prospectively. All patients were Child-Pugh score A. The mean dimension of the lesion was 32 mm (range: 15-74 mm). MR images were obtained using a 1.5-Tesla superconductive MRI system. Diffusion-weighted imaging was performed under breath-holding using b-values of 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 400, and 800 s/mm(2). The following IVIM parameters were calculated: apparent diffusion coefficient, true diffusion coefficient (DC), pseudo-diffusion coefficient, and perfusion fraction. MRI was performed before treatment and at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after beginning treatment. Tumor response at 4 weeks was assessed by CT or MRI using modified RECIST. IVIM parameters of the treatment responders and non-responders were compared.Results:The DC of responders at baseline was significantly higher than that of the non-responders. The sensitivity and specificity, when a DC of 0.8 (10(-3) mm(2)/s) or higher was considered to be a responder, were 100 % and 67 %, respectively. No significant differences were found in the other parameters between the responders and the non-responders. All IVIM parameters of the responders and non-responders did not change significantly after treatment.Conclusion:The DC before treatment may be a useful parameter for predicting the therapeutic outcome of sorafenib for advanced HCC.
