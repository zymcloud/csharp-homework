Purpose:To explore whole-lesion histogram analysis of the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) defect in indeterminate hypovascular liver lesions for predicting progression to arterial-enhancing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Twenty patients undergoing gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI for HCC screening with 12° and 25° flip angle (FA) HBP acquisitions demonstrating an indeterminate lesion showing HBP hypointensity but no arterial enhancement were included. Volumes-of-interest were placed on HBP defects, from which histogram metrics were obtained. Associations between these metrics and progression to arterial-enhancing HCC on follow-up imaging were investigated. Lesions were also assessed for the presence of a signal abnormality on conventional sequences.Results:40% of lesions progressed to arterial-enhancing HCC; 60% were stable at ≥6 months follow-up. Neither T2-hyperintensity increased diffusion signal nor portal/equilibrium phase washout was different between progressing and nonprogressing lesions (p = 1.0). Among direct signal intensity-based measures (overall mean; mean of bottom 10th, 10-25th, and 25-50th percentiles), area-under-the-curve (AUC) for prediction of progression to arterial-enhancing HCC was consistently higher at 25° (range 0.619-0.657) than at 12° (range 0.512-0.548). However, at both FAs, the four measures with highest AUC were measures related to lesion texture and heterogeneity [standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), skewness, and entropy], having AUC of 0.655-0.750 at 12° and 0.686-0.800 at 25. The metric with highest AUC at 12° was SD (AUC = 0.750) and at 25° was CV (AUC = 0.800).Conclusion:Whole-lesion histogram HBP measures of indeterminate hypovascular liver lesions may help predict progression to arterial-enhancing HCC by reflecting greater lesion heterogeneity, particularly at higher FA. Larger studies are therefore warranted.
