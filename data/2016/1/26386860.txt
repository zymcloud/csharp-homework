Background and aim:Aberrant methylation of specific genes is frequent event in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our present study aims to explore the methylation levels of acid phosphatase locus 1 (ACP1), bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), and testis-specific protein, Y-encoded-like 5 (TSPYL5) and their potential clinical applications in HCC.Methods:The methylation levels of ACP1, BMP4 and TSPYL5 were analyzed in 188 HCC tissues, 163 matched adjacent non-tumor tissues, and 29 normal liver tissues using a method of methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme-based quantitative PCR, and their associations with clinicopathological features and prognosis were evaluated.Results:Compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues and normal liver tissues, the methylation levels of ACP1, BMP4, and TSPYL5 were significantly increased in HCC tissues (All p Conclusions:Our findings suggest that hypermethylation of ACP1, BMP4, and TSPYL5 are common events in HCC and could be used as potentially detectable biomarkers in HCC tissues. Moreover, BMP4 could be potentially served as a methylated biomarker to predict recurrence and metastasis after hepatectomy for HCC patients. However, their potential clinical application value need to be further clarified.
