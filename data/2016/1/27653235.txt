Aim:There were differences in progression and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after surgery between liver resection (LR) and liver transplantation (LT). In this study, immunohistochemical (IHC) markers associated with the prognosis of HCC were assessed.Methods:Data were collected from 167 patients who underwent LT (n=41) or LR (n=126) for HCC. IHC markers including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), p53, Ki-67, cytokeratin 7 (CK7), and cytokeratin 19 (CK19) were compared between the treatment methods in tumor tissue.Results:AFP- and p53-negative patients had a significantly higher survival rate than AFP- and p53-positive patients (AFP: disease-free survival [DFS] P=.006, overall survival [OS] P=.016; p53: DFS P=.005, OS P=.038) in the LR group. CK19 was related to DFS (P=.005), while CK7 (P=.014) and CK19 (P=.06) were related to OS in the LT group. When we combined factors that were significant in both groups (LR: AFP and p53, LT: CK7 and CK19), all-negative patients had a higher survival rate (LR: DFS P=.025, OS P=.043, LT: DFS P=.034, OS P=.008).Conclusion:p53 and AFP were predictors for poor prognosis of HCC after LR; CK7 and CK19 could be predictors for poor prognosis of patients with HCC after LT.
