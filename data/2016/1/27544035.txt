Objective:To assess the safety and utility of more aggressive surgical resection of renal cell carcinoma involving the liver at the time of nephrectomy.Materials and methods:We identified 34 cases at our institution where patients underwent simultaneous nephrectomy and hepatic resection for direct hepatic invasion (n = 17) or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (n = 21). Perioperative outcomes and complication rates were compared with a matched referent cohort (n = 68) undergoing simultaneous nephrectomy and resection of non-hepatic locally invasive or metastatic disease.Results:Of the 34 cases, 17 (50%) patients underwent hepatic resection for pT4 liver involvement and 21 (62%) patients underwent simultaneous nephrectomy and hepatic metastasectomy. Deep vein thrombosis occurred more frequently following hepatic resection (15% vs 1%, P = .02); however, no significant differences were noted in Clavien grade 3-4 complications (12% vs 3%, P = .10) or perioperative mortality (3% vs 0%, P = .67). Two-year cancer-specific and overall survival for patients undergoing hepatic resection and non-hepatic resection were 40% and 29% (hazard ratio: 0.72, P = .2) and 40% and 28% (hazard ratio: 0.80, P = .30), respectively.Conclusion:In carefully selected patients, hepatic resection at the time of nephrectomy is associated with a higher risk of deep vein thrombosis and may be associated with a trend toward an increased risk of short-term Clavien IV complications; however, perioperative and overall mortality are comparable with those in matched patients undergoing surgical resection of locally advanced or metastatic disease involving non-hepatic organs.
