Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common digestive malignancy. MiR-223, a well-identified miRNA, exhibits diverse properties in different cancers. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-223 could suppress cell growth and promote apoptosis in HepG2 and Bel-7402 HCC cell lines. We screened and identified a novel miR-223 target, Ras-related protein Rab-1(Rab1). Upregulation of miR-223 would specifically and markedly down-regulate Rab1 expression. In addition, miR-223-overexpressing subclones showed significant cell growth inhibition by increasing cell apoptosis in HepG2 and Bel-7402 cells. To identify the mechanisms, we firstly investigated the mTOR pathway and found that pmTOR, p70S6K and Bcl-2 were dramatically down-regulated after miR-223 transfection, while no changes in the level of Bax was visualized. Furthermore, our data showed that the anti-tumor effects arising from miR-223 transfection in HCC cells may be due to the deactivation of mTOR pathway caused by the suppression of Rab1 expression when miR-223 is overexpressed. In summary, our results indicate that miR-223 functions as a tumor suppressor and plays a critical role in inhibiting the tumorigenesis and promoting the apoptosis of HCC through the mTOR signaling pathway in vitro. By targeting Rab1, miR-223 efficiently mediates the mTOR pathway. Given these, miR-223 may be a potential therapeutic target for treating HCC.
