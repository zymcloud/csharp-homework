The current optimization of IG-105 (3) on the carbazole-ring provided a series of new carbazole sulfonamides derivatives 13a-13m. All of the compounds have been evaluated against HepG2 cells (hepatoma cancer) for antiproliferative activity. Compounds that showed activity better or comparable to that of 3 versus HepG2 were evaluated against MCF-7 (breast cancer), MIA PaCa-2 (pancreatic cancer), and Bel-7402 (hepatoma/liver cancer) for antiproliferative activity. Of the seven compounds selected for further study five (13b, 13g, 13j, 13k and 13l) were found to give IC50 values against the four cell lines comparable to those for 3. Two compounds (13f and 13i) were more active than 3 and their activity against HepG2 and MCF-7 (IC50:0.01-0.07μM) approached that of the positive controls podophyllotoxin (podo) and CA-4. Most of compounds showed aqueous solubility (0.11-19.60μg/mL at pH 7.4 and 2.0) better than 3. These promising results warrant further development of new compounds 13f and 13i as potential potent antitumor drug candidates.
