Objective:To determine the frequency of deaths in hepatitis C virus infected hepatocellular carcinoma patients, and its relationship with raised serum alpha-fetoprotein levels.Methods:The cross-sectional study was conducted at Isra University Hospital, Hyderabad, Pakistan, between March 2013 and April 2014, and comprised all patients diagnosed with hepatitis C virus and hepatocellular carcinoma over 30 years ofage. Blood sample was drawn for the measurement of serum Alfa fetoprotein levels. Data was analysed using SPSS 16.Results:The mean age of the 165 patients was55.49±11.67 years. The mean tumour size was 5.63 ± 2.14cm. Of the total, 31(18.8%) patients had tumour size 5cm. The mean serum Alfa fetoprotein level was 7641.0±3665.32 IU/ml. Overall mortality rate was 70(41.9%). Tumour size >5cm was significantly associated with mortality (p=0.016).Conclusions:Serum Alfa fetoprotein levels were a useful tool for the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis C virus patients.
