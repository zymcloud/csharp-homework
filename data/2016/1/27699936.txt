The increasing incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Western countries requests reliable tumour markers for preclinical diagnosis. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP), in comparison with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in a French cohort using a new analyser. One hundred and sixty-two patients with virus-related cirrhosis (46 HCC patients and 116 controls) were recruited in this retrospective proof-of-concept study. DCP was measured on new Lumipulse® G600 analyzer and AFP on usual Cobas e602 analyzer in serum samples that were collected at the time of HCC diagnosis for HCC patients or during follow-up for controls. DCP and AFP levels were higher in HCC patients. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve was larger for DCP than for AFP (0.89 vs 0.77, P=.03). At the cut-off value of 128 mAU/mL, sensitivity and specificity for DCP were 74% and 92%. At the cut-off value of 20 μg/L, sensitivity and specificity for AFP were 63% and 82%. NRI>0 for the association of "AFP+DCP" were 101%, P<.0001, and 23%, P=.03, compared to "AFP" or "DCP" alone, respectively. We conclude that DCP outperformed AFP for the detection of HCC.
