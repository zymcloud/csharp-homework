Acute hepatitis C exacerbations can occur in cancer patients carrying hepatitis C virus (HCV) when receiving systemic chemotherapy. However, clinical studies evaluating these complications remain rare due to the lack of clinically proven effective and tolerable anti-HCV treatments at late cancer stages. Furthermore, no data were available regarding hepatitis C exacerbation in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients receiving chemotherapy. To address this issue, 48 patients with HCV-related advanced HCC, who underwent systemic chemotherapy using 5- fluorouracil, cisplatin, and mitoxantrone from 2008 to 2014 were analyzed. Nine patients developed acute hepatitis exacerbations defined by HCV-RNA elevation ≥10-fold and alanine transaminase (ALT) elevation ≥5-fold of the upper normal limit. Six were genotype 1b and 3 were genotype 2. Three patterns of clinical courses were observed including single episode of exacerbation (n = 5), fluctuated flares (n = 3), and delayed exacerbation (n = 1). Hepatic failure developed in five patients. Patients with acute exacerbations were less likely to have pretreatment ascites (11.1% vs. 53.8%; P = 0.028) and displayed a lower baseline ALT (44.1 ± 28.5 U/L vs. 72.6 ± 19.2 U/L; P = 0.007). Paradoxically, despite a high risk of hepatic failure, occurrence of hepatitis C exacerbation was associated with a favorable overall survival (P = 0.027; 22.8 vs. 5.4 months). In conclusion, hepatitis C exacerbation can occur in HCC patients receiving chemotherapy, leading to liver failure. However, the flare was associated with a better overall survival, possibly due to its association with a better baseline liver function. J. Med.
