Objective:To investigate the relationship between the changes of the copy numbers of mtDNA in peripheral blood mono-nucle- ar cell(PBMC) and the disordered of antioxidant capacity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:The Ficoll Hypaque method was used to isolate the PBMC from blood specimens. The ND1 gene of the mitochondrial was amplified by real-time PCR; meantime β-actin was served as a quantitative standard marker; the difference of mtDNA copy number in PBMC was compared between HCC and healthy control group. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PBMC was determined by flow cytometry. The change of total antioxidant capacity (T- AOC) of plasma was detected by the biochemistry examination.Results:The copy numbers of ND1 gene in PBMC of HCC was 73% that of the healthy control group,which suggested a decrease of the copy numbers of mtDNA in HCC. The levels of ROS of PBMC in HCC was (417. 82 ± 110.62) and (301.82 ± 75.54) in control group, which showed that the levels of ROS of PBMC in HCC were significant higher than that in control group (P Conclusion:There was a certain relationship between the decrease of the copy numbers of mtDNA and the disordered antioxidant capacity in hepatocellular carcinoma, which may be associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
