Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary hepatic malignant tumor. With widespread use of liver imaging, various cirrhosis-related nodules are frequently detected in patients with chronic liver disease, while diverse hypervascular hepatic lesions are incidentally detected but undiagnosed on dynamic computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, use of hepatocyte-specific MR contrast agents with combined perfusion and hepatocyte-selective properties have improved diagnostic performance in detection and characterization of focal liver lesions. Meanwhile, the enhancement patterns observed during dynamic phases using hepatocyte-specific agents may be different from those observed during MRI using conventional extracellular fluid agents, leading to confusion in diagnosis. Therefore, we discuss useful tips for the differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma from similar lesions in patients with and without chronic liver disease using liver MRI with hepatocyte-specific agents.
