This study aims to assess the nephrotoxicity and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir), telbivudine and entecavir. A retrospective study of 587 patients with chronic hepatitis B treated with tenofovir (n = 170), telbivudine (n = 184) and entecavir (n = 233) for at least 1 year. Renal function and efficacy were assessed. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decreased significantly in the tenofovir group after a mean of 17 months treatment (from 92.2 to 85.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2), p
