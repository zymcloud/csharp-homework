Aberrant glycosylation of target glycoprotein is a frequent and significant event involved in many cancers, for example, increased fucosylated haptoglobin (Hp) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The normal and reverse Aleuria aurantia lectin (AAL) ELISA were used to measure fucosylated Hp in 98 HCC patients and 98 healthy controls. Simultaneously, protein ELISA was used to measure its protein expression. ELISA Index (OD value of fucosylated Hp/OD value of protein Hp) was developed to reflect Hp fucosylation level on its protein level (Fuc-Hp). Normal ELISA Index exhibited an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.727 with sensitivity of 61.22%, specificity of 81.63%, and accuracy of 71.43% in distinguishing HCC from healthy controls. AUC of reverse ELISA Index was 0.836 with 68.36% of sensitivity, 95.92% of specificity, and 82.14% of accuracy. Thus, AAL ELISA, especially the reverse AAL ELISA, is a promising technology to evaluate diagnostic potential of serum glycoprotein. Fuc-Hp could serve as a useful glycobiomarker for the diagnosis and prediction of HCC.
