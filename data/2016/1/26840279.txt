A (pyridazinyl)acetate derivative was reacted with thiosemicarbazide and hydrazine hydrate to yield spiropyridazinone and acetohydrazide derivatives, respectively. The acetohydrazide derivative was used as a starting material for synthesizing some new heterocyclic compounds such as oxoindolinylidene, dimethylpyrazolyl, methylpyrazolyl, oxopyrazolyl, cyanoacetylacetohydrazide and oxadiazolylacetonitrile derivatives. The behavior of the cyanoacetylacetohydrazide and oxadiazolylacetonitrile derivatives towards nitrogen and carbon nucleophiles was investigated. The assigned structures of the prepared compounds were elucidated by spectral methods (IR, Â¹H-NMR (13)C-NMR and mass spectroscopy). Some of the newly prepared compounds were tested in vitro against a panel of four human tumor cell lines, namely hepatocellular carcinoma (liver) HePG-2, colon cancer HCT-116, human prostate cancer PC3, and mammary gland breast MCF-7. Also they were tested as antioxidants. Almost all of the tested compounds showed satisfactory activity.
