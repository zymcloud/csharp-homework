Background:The aberrant expression of sperm-associated antigen 9 (SPAG9) is associated with numerous cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The exploration of molecules and mechanisms regulating SPAG9 expression may provide new options for HCC therapy.Methods:MiRNA target prediction programs were used to explore SPAG9-targeted miRNAs. SPAG9 and miR-141 expression were detected in HCC tissues and cell lines by Western blot and real-time PCR. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was utilized to validate SPAG9 as a direct target gene of miR-141. Cell proliferation, invasion, and migration assays were used to determine whether miR-141-mediated regulation of SPAG9 could affect HCC progression.Results:An inverse correlation was observed between SPAG9 and miR-141 expression in HCC tissues and cell lines. Dual-luciferase reporter assay further showed that SPAG9 was a direct target gene of miR-141. The ectopic expression of miR-141 could markedly suppress SPAG9 expression in HCC cells. MiR-141 overexpression also resulted in significantly reduced cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, and imitation of the SPAG9 knockdown effects on HCC cells. Furthermore, SPAG9 restoration in miR-141-expressing cells sufficiently attenuated the tumor-suppressive effects of miR-141. Finally, JNK activity was found to be reduced by miR-141 overexpression the same way as by SPAG9 silencing. The overexpression of SPAG9 lacking its 3'-UTR significantly restored JNK activity and its downstream genes in miR-141-transfected HCC cells.Conclusion:MiR-141 suppression may cause aberrant expression of SPAG9 and promote HCC tumorigenesis via JNK pathway.
