Percutaneous ethanol injection is an important localized treatment method for patients presenting with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Among the advantages of percutaneous ethanol injection are its minimal invasiveness, simplicity, low cost and low risk of complications. However, the increasing popularity of percutaneous ethanol injection has resulted in serious adverse effects attributed to individual variations. The present study describes the case of a patient who exhibited acquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenic purpura, caused by percutaneous ethanol injection treatment for HCC. This complication was promptly identified, and platelet transfusion and injection of recombinant human interleukin-11 resulted in a rapid recovery of the patient's platelet count. Attention should be given to this rare complication in patients administered percutaneous ethanol injection treatment for HCC.
