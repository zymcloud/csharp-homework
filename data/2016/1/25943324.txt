Purpose:The Korean National Cancer Screening Survey (KNCSS), a nationwide cross-sectional survey, has been conducted annually since 2004. The current study was conducted to report on the trends in screening rates among Korean men and women, and to evaluate policies regarding cancer screening programs implemented to reduce the burden of cancer.Materials and methods:The current study used KNCSS data. The eligible study population included men aged 40-74 years and women aged 30-74 years with no cancer history. The lifetime screening rate, screening rate with recommendation, and changes in annual rates were calculated for five major cancers (i.e., stomach, liver, colorectal, breast, and cervix uteri).Results:The screening rates with recommendation increased by 4.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.7% to 4.8%) annually for stomach cancer, 1.2% (95% CI, 0.1% to 2.4%) for liver cancer, 3.0% (95% CI, 1.8% to 4.1%) for colorectal cancer, 3.7% (95% CI, 2.7% to 4.8%) for breast cancer, and 1.3% (95% CI, 0.8% to 1.8%) for cervical cancer. In 2013, the screening rates with recommendation for stomach, liver, colorectal, breast, and cervical cancers were 73.6%, 33.6%, 55.6%, 59.7%, and 67.0%, respectively.Conclusion:Both the lifetime screening rates and screening rates with recommendation for the five above-mentioned cancers increased annually from 2004 to 2013.
