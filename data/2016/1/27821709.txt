The 2016 annual National Toxicology Program Satellite Symposium, entitled "Pathology Potpourri" was held in San Diego, CA, at the Society of Toxicologic Pathology's (STP) 35th annual meeting. The goal of this symposium was to present and discuss challenging diagnostic pathology and/or nomenclature issues. This article presents summaries of the speakers' talks, along with select images that were used by the audience for voting and discussion. Some lesions and topics covered during the symposium included malignant glioma and histiocytic sarcoma in the rodent brain; a new statistical method designed for histopathology data evaluation; uterine stromal/glandular polyp in a rat; malignant plasma cell tumor in a mouse brain; Schwann cell proliferative lesions in rat hearts; axillary schwannoma in a cat; necrosis and granulomatous inflammation in a rat brain; adenoma/carcinoma in a rat adrenal gland; hepatocyte maturation defect and liver/spleen hematopoietic defects in an embryonic mouse; distinguishing malignant glioma, malignant mixed glioma, and malignant oligodendroglioma in the rat; comparison of mammary gland whole mounts and histopathology from mice; and discussion of the International Harmonization of Nomenclature and Diagnostic Criteria collaborations.
