Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is effective for the local control of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly when a patient's liver functional reserve does not allow radical resection. There is controversy regarding the superiority of surgical resection compared with RFA for such patients, particularly those with three or fewer tumors with diameters â‰¤3 cm. Moreover, HCC often recurs after RFA, and the tumor cells show distinct phenotypic changes. Incomplete ablation accounts for tumor recurrence, and recent studies provide new insights into the biological mechanisms responsible for the pathological changes of HCC after RFA. This review focuses on the roles of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stemness that are driven by a mechanism that involves microRNA-mediated upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1. The studies reviewed here provide compelling evidence that complete ablation of HCC is required to prevent recurrence and indicate that further research is urgently required to develop a new systematic strategy to prevent tumor recurrence by targeting hypoxia-inducible factor-1.
