Three new (1-3) and seven known (4-10) triterpenoids, together with one new (11) and fifteen known (12-26) dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans, were isolated from the fruit of Schisandra sphenanthera Rehd. et Wils. Their structures were elucidated by extensive analysis of spectroscopic methods, including HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR spectra and CD experiments. All of the isolated triterpenoids (1-10) were evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxicities against HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, and compounds 1, 3-7 and 10 exhibited moderate antiproliferative effects against HepG2 cell line with IC50 ranging from 18.12 to 49.52μM. The lignans (11-26) were tested for their neuroprotective activities against CoCl2, H2O2 and Aβ25-35-induced SH-SY5Y cell injuries and showed considerable neuroprotective effects of different degrees. And at the low concentration of 3.2nM, compounds 14, 17-19, 23 in CoCl2-induced, compounds 11, 13-15, 17, 19-20, 22-24 in H2O2-induced, and compounds 12-14, 19, 25-26 in Aβ25-35-induced SH-SY5Y cell injury models, showed statistically significant neuroprotective activities compared with the negative control group, respectively.
