In order to develop agents with superior chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic properties against hepatocellular carcinomas, mitochondria-targeted hydroxycinnamic acids (MitoHCAs) were synthesized by conjugation with a triphenylphosphonium cation. These synthetic compounds were evaluated for their antioxidant activities in hepatic mitochondria, including against OH∙- and ROO∙- induced lipid peroxidation. H2O2 production was decreased significantly by increasing glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities. In addition, cell proliferation data from three cell lines (HepG2, L02 and WI38) indicated that the MitoHCAs were selective for cancer cells. Interestingly, the MitoHCAs both with or without Ca2+ triggered mitochondrial dysfunction by inducing mitochondrial swelling, collapsing the mitochondrial membrane potential and causing cytochrome c release. In particular, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), cyclosporin A, attenuated mitochondrial damage and cell apoptosis, indicating that mPTP may be involved in the antiproliferative activity of MitoHCAs. Further studies focused on structural optimization of these compounds are onging.
