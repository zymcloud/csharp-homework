Background and aim:Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a frequent event in patients with cirrhosis. The effects of anticoagulation on these patients were still unclear, especially for more advanced PVT. The aim of this study was to retrospectively assess the resolution of PVT and liver disease progression in a large cohort of cirrhotic patients with PVT with or without anticoagulation therapy.Methods:We analyzed data from 66 cirrhotic patients with PVT from January 2002 to June 2014. Thirty patients were anticoagulated with warfarin and 36 patients were untreated. PVT and hepatic decompensation were evaluated.Results:For anticoagulated patients, the thrombosis had improved in 15 (68.2%) patients, was stable in four patients (18.2%), and progressed in three patients (13.6%). For untreated patients, the thrombosis had improved in four patients (25%), was stable in six patients (37.5%), and progressed in six patients (37.5%). The anticoagulation group had significantly better recanalization rates than the untreated group (P=0.011). Degree of superior mesenteric vein (P=0.032, hazard ratio: 15.4; 95% confidence interval: 1.3-200) was a significant predictor. In addition, anticoagulation can effectively improve PVT with a degree less than 75% in the main portal vein compared with untreated patients (6/6 vs. 2/6, P=0.030). The probability of hepatic decompensation at 1 year was 15.6 and 17.9% between the anticoagulation and the untreated groups (P=0.847). Albumin (P=0.06, hazard ratio: 0.860; 95% confidence interval: 0.772-0.959) was a significant predictor.Conclusion:Anticoagulation with warfarin might result in the resolution of more advanced PVT effectively and safely in patients with liver cirrhosis. In addition, we did not demonstrate the benefit of anticoagulation for the decompensation or death.
