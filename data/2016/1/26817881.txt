Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of liver transplantation. In an attempt to predict their recurrence after liver transplantation, evaluation of tumor number and size, degree of histologic differentiation, and the presence of vascular invasion already have their importance established. In this context, the role of biologic markers such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is still not clear. This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed the AFP relationship with recurrence of HCC after orthotopic liver transplantation.The current study retrospectively analyzed data from 206 patients with a histopathologic confirmed HCC between 1997 and 2010.The overall survival rates at 1, 3, 5, and 14 years were 78.6%, 65.4%, 60.5%, and 38.7%, respectively. The frequency of recurrence was 15.5%, and recurrence was significantly associated with a lower survival rate (P
