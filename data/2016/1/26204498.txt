Hepatocellular carcinoma develops in cirrhotic liver. The nitric oxide (NO) synthase type III (NOS-3) overexpression induces cell death in hepatoblastoma cells. The study developed gene therapy designed to specifically overexpress NOS-3 in cultured hepatoma cells, and in tumors derived from orthotopically implanted tumor cells in fibrotic livers. Liver fibrosis was induced by CCl4 administration in mice. The first-generation adenoviruses were designed to overexpress NOS-3 or green fluorescent protein, and luciferase complementary DNA under the regulation of murine alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) promoters, respectively. Both adenovirus and Hepa 1-6 cells were used for in vitro and in vivo experiments. Adenoviruses were administered through the tail vein 2 weeks after orthotopic tumor cell implantation. AFP-NOS-3/RSV-luciferase increased oxidative-related DNA damage, p53, CD95/CD95L expression and caspase-8, -9 and -3 activities in cultured Hepa 1-6 cells. The increased expression of CD95/CD95L and caspase-8 activity was abolished by NÏ‰-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride, p53 and CD95 small interfering RNA. AFP-NOS-3/RSV-luciferase adenovirus increased cell death markers, and reduced cell proliferation of established tumors in fibrotic livers. The increase of oxidative/nitrosative stress induced by NOS-3 overexpression induced DNA damage, p53, CD95/CD95L expression and cell death in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The effectiveness of the gene therapy has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo.
