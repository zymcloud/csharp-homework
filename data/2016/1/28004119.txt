Patients with unresectable, chemo-refractory colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLM) have limited local treatment options. We report our institutional experience on the efficacy of resin-based yttrium-90 (90Y) radioembolization for the treatment of CRCLM and our findings on associated circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) studies. A total of 58 patients treated with 90Y for CRCLM at the Medstar Georgetown University Hospital had a median survival of 6 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.55‑7.45 months] after treatment, with a 12-month survival rate of 33%. The median survival from treatment stratified by mutational status was longer in the wild-type (WT) as compared to the KRAS mutant patients at 7 vs. 5 months, but did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.059). Median tumor local control duration after 90Y treatment was 2 months (95% CI, 0.34‑3.66 months) for the entire cohort and was longer in the WT vs. the mutant patients (2 vs. 1 month, respectively, p=0.088). Plasma was prospectively collected from a subset of 9 patients both before and after single lobe treatment, and ccfDNA concentration and fragmentation index (FI) were measured using quantitative PCR and atomic-force microscopy (AFM). In the WT and KRAS mutant patients, DNA FI was reduced from a median of 0.73-0.65 after treatment. A reduction in DNA FI after single lobe treatment was associated with an improved overall survival (p=0.046). Analysis by AFM of paired pre- and post-treatment samples from KRAS mutant and WT patients revealed a larger average decrease in fragment size in the WT patients (p=0.013). 90Y radioembolization extends local control for CRCLM, however, KRAS mutant tumors may be more radio-resistant to treatment. Changes in the FI of patients following treatment were noted and may be evaluated in a larger study for relevance as a biomarker of response.
