Background:We evaluated the effects of pre-transplant locoregional treatment on survival in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), and the most accurate method for predicting survival after LDLT in patients who received pre-transplant locoregional treatment.Methods:From December 2003 to December 2012, 234 patients underwent LDLT for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at our transplant center. We retrospectively reviewed 86 patients newly diagnosed with HCC and who received pre-transplant locoregional treatments at our hospital.Results:Of the 33 patients with HCC initially beyond the Milan criteria, 12 experienced successful down-staging after locoregional treatments, and the 5-year recurrence-free survival was 81.8%, which was comparable to those in patients with HCC initially within the Milan criteria. A bad responder according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) [HR, 4.874 (1.059-22.442), p = 0.042], and increased AFP levels [HR 4.002 (1.540-10.397), p = 0.004] during pre-transplant locoregional treatments were independent risk factors for HCC recurrence after LDLT in multivariate analysis.Conclusions:Liver transplantation may be considered after successful down-staging in patients with HCC initially beyond the Milan criteria. The mRECIST and serum AFP level changes are better selection criteria for LDLT in patients who have received locoregional treatments.
