The cohort for this study comprised 318 cases of hepatitis and 731 cases of cirrhosis, as well as 796 HCC patients. Using 11.62ng/mL as a cut-off value, the positive rate of AFP test among serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive HCC patients was significantly higher than that in those HBsAg negative HCC patients (79.55% vs 56.49%, P
