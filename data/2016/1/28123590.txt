Bovine lactoferricin P13 (LfcinB-P13) is a peptide derived from LfcinB. In the present study, the effect of LfcinB-P13 on the human liver cancer cell line SMMC7721 was investigated in vitro and in vivo. The results of the present study indicate that LfcinB-P13 significantly decreased SMMC7721 cell viability in vitro (P=0.032 vs. untreated cells), while exhibiting low cytotoxicity in the wild-type liver cell line L02. In addition, the rate of apoptosis in SMMC7721 cells was significantly increased following treatment with 40 and 60 Âµg/ml LfcinB-P13 (P=0.0053 vs. the control group), which was associated with an increase in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activation of caspase-3 and -9. Furthermore, ROS chelation led to the suppression of LfcinB-P13-mediated caspase-3 and -9 activation in SMMC7721 cells. LfcinB-P13 was demonstrated to markedly inhibit tumor growth in an SMMC7721-xenograft nude mouse model. The results of the present study indicate that LfcinB-P13 is a novel candidate therapeutic agent for the treatment of liver cancer.
