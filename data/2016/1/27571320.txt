Background:There is global variation in the onset of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The objective of the current study was to investigate the impact of country of birth on age at the time of HCC diagnosis in the United States.Methods:Incident HCC cases diagnosed between 2000 and 2012 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program 18 registry were included. Factors associated with very early onset (age at diagnosis Results:A total of 59,907 patients were included. The median age at the time of diagnosis of HCC was 62 years and 76% of the patients were male. Of the 75% of patients for whom information regarding birth country was available, 29% were foreign born. In multivariate logistic regression, birth in West Africa (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 16.3; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 9.2-27.9 [PConclusions:Birth country was found to be independently associated with age at the time of HCC diagnosis in the United States. Birth in Africa (except for North Africa) and Oceania was strongly associated with very early-onset HCC. These findings have implications for the design of comprehensive HCC surveillance programs in the United States. Cancer 2016. © 2016 American Cancer Society.
