The 9th International Liver Cancer Association Annual Conference was held from 4th to 6th September 2015 in Paris, France, and attracted a record breaking 900 participants from 51 different countries and 386 submitted abstracts from scientists around the globe. The congress provided a comprehensive overview of current developments in primary liver cancers (i.e., hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma) and covered a broad range of topics from basic science to clinical studies. Following the success of immunotherapies in recent years, a preconference workshop on immunopathogenesis and immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma also took place. This report will provide a subjective summary of selected abstracts presented at the conference.
