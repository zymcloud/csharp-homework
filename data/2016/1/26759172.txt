Background:The global burden of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV co-infection is enormous. The risk of developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer is associated with HBV DNA levels. The main objective of the study was to determine proportion of Hepatitis B viremia in ART-naïve and ART-experienced co-infected Ghanaian patients and factors associated with HBV viremia after at least 36 weeks of lamivudine with or without tenofovir containing ART.Methods:Hepatitis B and HIV co-infected patients who were ART-naïve or had received at least 9 months of lamivudine-containing ART were enrolled in a cross-sectional study at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital. Demographic and clinical data were collected and samples obtained for Hepatitis B serology, liver function tests and HBV DNA. Factors associated with viremia were determined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.Results:Of 3108 HIV-infected patients screened, 257 (8.3%) were HBsAg-positive, of which 235 enrolled. Overall, 152 (64.7%) were ART-experienced and 83 (35.3%) were ART-naïve. Eighty-nine-percent of ART-naïve and 42.1% of ART-experienced patients had HBV DNA > 20 IU/mL. In multivariate analysis of all patients, being ART-naïve (OR 10.1, 95% CI 4.6-21.9) and elevated ALT (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.8-7.9) were associated with Hepatitis B viremia. In treatment experienced patients, elevated ALT (OR 4.8 CI 2.0-12.1) and male sex (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.0-4.2) were associated with Hepatitis B viremia.Conclusions:Majority of ART-naïve (89%) and 42% of ART-experienced patients had detectable hepatitis B viremia > 20 IU/mL. An abnormal serum ALT was significantly associated with hepatitis B viremia in HBV and HIV co-infected patients irrespective of treatment status. Baseline and on-treatment ALT may be a useful non-invasive predictor of Hepatitis B viremia in resource-constrained countries in sub-Saharan Africa where infection is endemic and viral load tests are not widely available.
