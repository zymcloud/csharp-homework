Hepatocellular carcinoma is an aggressive cancer with poor prognosis. Fibroblast growth factor 19, a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, is a ligand for fibroblast growth factor receptor 4. Moreover, it plays a crucial role in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. ASP5878 is a novel inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor receptors 1, 2, 3, and 4 that is under development. It inhibits fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 kinase activity with an IC50 of 3.5 nmol/L. ASP5878 potently suppressed the growth of the fibroblast growth factor 19-expressing hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines Hep3B2.1-7, HuH-7, and JHH-7. In the Hep3B2.1-7 cell line, ASP5878 inhibited the phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 and its downstream signaling molecules as well as induced apoptosis. Oral administration of ASP5878 at 3 mg/kg induced sustained tumor regression in a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model using Hep3B2.1-7. In HuH-7, an orthotopic xenograft mouse model, ASP5878 induced complete tumor regression and dramatically extended the survival of the mice. These results suggest that ASP5878 is a potentially effective therapeutic agent for hepatocellular carcinoma patients with tumors expressing fibroblast growth factor 19.
