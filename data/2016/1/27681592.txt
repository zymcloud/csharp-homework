The mRECIST and dermatologic adverse events (AEs) can be used to assess the patient response to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and/or sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we aimed to combine the two criteria to stratify the prognosis in patients with unresectable HCC receiving TACE plus sorafenib (TACE-S). In total, 176 consecutive HCC patients treated with TACE-S were enrolled. CT scans and laboratory tests were conducted pretreatment (at baseline, 5-7 days before the TACE-S) and post-treatment (at 1, 2 and 3 months). The radiological response was assessed according to mRECIST. Sorafenib-related AEs were recorded every 2 weeks after oral administration, and patients with dermatologic AEs of Grade 2 or more were defined as dermatologic responders. The earliest time at which mRECIST and dermatologic responses correlated with survival was 2 months after therapy. The mRECIST-dermatologic AE combination assessment stratified patients into three different prognoses; responders on both assessments exhibited the longest median overall survival (OS), followed by responders on one assessment and non-responders on both assessments (30.5, 17.4 and 8.3 months, respectively; p
