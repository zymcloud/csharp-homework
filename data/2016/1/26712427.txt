Background:Evaluating a change in the screening rate for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is critical for understanding screening implementation, and whether targeted population groups are receiving proper screening. This study examined recent nationwide changes in HCC screening use among hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected populations after the introduction of the Korean National Cancer Screening Program and predictors of screening adherence.Methods:We analyzed 165 and 276 participants â‰¥40 years of age who were hepatitis B surface antigen-positive from 2001 (14,936 participants) to 2010-2011 (9159 participants) Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, respectively. Demographic data, socioeconomic factors, and HCC screening use were collected by means of self-reported questionnaires.Results:The rate of HCC screening within the previous 2 years increased significantly from 17.5% in 2001 to 40.3% in 2010-2011 (P Conclusions:This study showed a substantial increase in HCC screening in high-risk HBV-infected subjects from 2001 to 2010-2011. However, the HCC screening participation rate remained suboptimal despite the introduction of the nationwide screening program. Efforts should be made to identify high-risk individuals and increase attendance at HCC screening events among high-risk groups.
