MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs. More than 2500 mature miRNAs are detected in plants, animals and several types of viruses. Hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, does not encode viral miRNA. However, HCV infection alters the expression of host miRNAs, either in cell culture or in patients with liver disease progression, such as liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In turn, host miRNAs regulate HCV life cycle through directly binding to HCV RNAs or indirectly targeting cellular mRNAs. Increasing evidence demonstrates that miRNAs are one of the centered factors in the interaction network between virus and host. The competitive viral and host RNA hypothesis proposes a latent cross-regulation pattern between host mRNAs and HCV RNAs. High loads of HCV RNA sequester and de-repress host miRNAs from their normal host targets and thus disturb host gene expression, indicating a means of adaptation for HCV to establish a persistent infection. Some special miRNAs are closely correlated with liver-specific disease progression and the changed levels of miRNAs are even higher sensitivity and specificity than those of traditional proteins. Therefore, some of them can serve as novel diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers in HCV-infected patients with liver diseases. They are also attractive therapeutic targets for development of new anti-HCV agents.
