Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the second most common primary hepatic malignancy after hepatocellular carcinoma. Complete surgical resection remains the only potentially curative option for patients with ICC. However, until now, early diagnosis with potential surgical intervention has been the exception rather than the rule with only 30% of patients qualifying for attempted surgical cure. Many patients are unresectable because of disease stage, anatomic conditions, medical comorbidities, and small future remnant liver. Interventional radiology procedures are available for these types of patients with intra-arterial therapies and/or ablative treatments both for curative and for palliative treatment. The goals of interventional therapy are to control local tumor growth, to relieve symptoms, and to improve and preserve quality of life. The choice of treatment depends largely on tumor extent and patient performance. No randomized studies exist to compare treatments. The present review describes the current evidence of the interventional treatments in the management of the ICC. Moreover, interventional procedures available to increase the future liver reserve before surgery were analyzed.
