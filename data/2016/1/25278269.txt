Background:The reversion-inducing-cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs (RECK) gene is a transformation suppressor gene that can negatively regulate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and inhibit tumor invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. So, the aim of this study was to analyze the effect of RECK gene rs 11788747 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) susceptibility and its relation to various clinical and laboratory data of the patients.Methods:This is a case-control study including 200 HCC patients and 200 healthy controls. RECK rs 11788747 genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).Results:RECK rs 11788747 A/G and G/G genotypes frequencies were significantly higher in HCC patients compared to the healthy controls. The HCC patients possessing at least one polymorphic G allele were significantly at a higher risk of developing lymph nodes involvement and distant metastasis.Conclusion:This study revealed the role of RECK rs 11788747 SNP in HCC in Egyptian patients, which consequently might be used as a prognostic tool and could be added to its therapeutic strategies.
