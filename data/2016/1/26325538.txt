Backgrounds & aims:To assess the relationship existing between hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and the occurrence of post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) grade B/C after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and persistent worsening of liver function.Methods:Data from 70 consecutive prospectively enrolled HCC patients undergoing resection were collected and analysed. PHLF grade B/C was defined by the International Study Group of Liver Surgery recommendations. The appearance of unresolved decompensation was also analysed.Results:Postoperative and 90-day mortality were null. The median HVPG value was 9mmHg (range: 4-18) and the median Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 8 (range: 6-14); 34 patients had an HVPG ⩾10mmHg (48.6%). Forty-nine patients had an uneventful (Grade A) postoperative course, including 17 with an HVPG ⩾10mmHg (24.2% of 70 patients). Grade B complications occurred in 20 patients (3 with an HVPG Conclusions:The hepatic venous pressure gradient can be used before surgery to stratify the risk of PHLF but the proposed cut-off of 10mmHg excludes approximately one-quarter of the patients who would benefit from surgery without short to mid-term postoperative sequelae.
