Purpose:The aim of this study was to evaluate whether hepatic arterial infusion concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) could improve overall survival (OS) in patients with locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (LAHCC).Materials and methods:Two databases were reviewed from Yonsei Cancer Center (YCC) and Korean Liver Cancer Study Group (KLCSG) nationwide multi-center hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cohort. The CCRT group included 106 patients, with stage III-IV, Child-Pugh classification A, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, who underwent definitive CCRT as the initial treatment at YCC. We used propensity score matching to adjust for seven clinical factors, including age, tumor size, TNM stage by the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan, T stage, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system, etiology of HCC, and portal vein invasion, which all differed significantly in the two databases. From the KLCSG cohort enrolled at 32 institutions, 106 patients for the non-CCRT group were defined.Results:After propensity score matching, all patient characteristics were balanced between the two groups. The CCRT group had better OS (median, 11.4) than the non-CCRT group (6.6 months, p=0.02). In multivariate analyses for all patients, CCRT (hazard ratio [HR], 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11 to 1.97; p=0.007), tumor size (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.12; p Conclusion:CCRT showed better OS for LAHCC patients. In LAHCC patients with a good performance and normal liver function, CCRT could be a feasible treatment option. All of these findings need to be validated in prospective clinical trials.
