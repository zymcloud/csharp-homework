Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its causal factors of hepatic insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes are rapidly growing worldwide. Developing new therapeutic methods for these conditions requires a comprehensive understanding between hepatic lipid metabolism and IR. Sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1c (SREBP-1c) and carbohydrate responsive-element binding protein (ChREBP) are the major regulators of fatty acid synthase (FASN), a key enzyme of de novo fatty acid synthesis. They are induced by insulin, which directly binds to the sterol regulatory elements (SRE) or carbohydrate-responsive elements (ChORE) of the FASN promoter to induce its expression. The insulin pathway involved in NAFLD has well studied, but the role of histone modification in NAFLD is just beginning to be investigated, and there is minimal data regarding its involvement. In the current study, we investigated histone modifications in FASN under insulin stimulation. H3K4 hypertrimethylation and H3, H4 hyperacetylation in the FASN promoter was found in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes following insulin stimulation. We also found that insulin treatment induced the transcription factor SREBP-1c, ChREBP and could accelerate FASN expression by enhancing SREBP-1c, SRE, and ChREBP ChORE binding and inducing H3, H4 hyperacetylation at SRE, ChORE, or transcription start site (TSS) regions of the FASN promoter in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) and primary hepatocytes. Finally, histone acetylation could influence FASN expression by impairing SREBP-1c SRE and ChREBP ChORE binding.
