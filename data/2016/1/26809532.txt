A 71-year-old man was referred to our hospital for treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma of the lungs, with multiple bone metastases, cT1bN0M1b, harboring an EGFR mutation [exon 19 deletion]). Gefitinib was administered as daily oral doses of 250 mg. After 18 days, gefitinib was discontinued because of hepatotoxicity (Grade 3). Forty days later, afatinib was administered as daily oral doses of 40 mg. Within 1 year, the primary tumor and bone metastases achieved a partial response without hepatotoxicity. We suggest that afatinib is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with hepatotoxicity under gefitinib treatment.
