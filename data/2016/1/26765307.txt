According to the results of retrieving PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, this study summarized distributions of two commonly mutated alleles (C282Y and H63D) and genotypes in HFE gene, and considered odds ratios (ORs) as well as its 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) as effective variables of the included study itself and after summarizing. In terms of allele, compared with individual carrying wild type (WT) allele, individual carrying C282Y allele was more likely to suffer from liver cancer, with OR and P value of 1.58 (95% CI 1.10-2.27) and 0.01, respectively; no significantly increased risk of liver cancer was found in individual carrying H63D allele, with OR and P value of 1.12 (95% CI 0.89-1.47) and 0.35, respectively. From a perspective of genotype, in comparison with individual carrying WT/WT genotype, risk of individual carried with C282Y/C282Y homozygote genotype suffering from liver cancer increased significantly, with OR and P value of 5.10 (95% CI 2.58-10.09) and less than 0.00001, respectively. Furthermore, OR and P value of individual carrying C282Y/WT heterozygous genotype were 1.28 (95% CI 1.01-1.63) and 0.04 severally; and individual carried with H63D/H63D homozygote genotype was found without obviously increased liver cancer risk, with OR and P value of 1.04 (95% CI 0.63-1.71) and 0.89. Moreover, OR and P value of individual carrying H63D/H63D homozygote genotype or H63D/WT heterozygous genotype were 1.19 (95% CI 0.99-1.37) and 0.07, respectively. Meta analysis revealed that individual carrying C282Y/C282Y homozygote genotype had 5.10 times of liver cancer risk than individual carrying WT/WT genotype, while no significantly increased liver cancer risk was found in individual carrying H63D/H63D homozygote genotype or carrying C282Y/WT and H63D/WT heterozygous genotype.
