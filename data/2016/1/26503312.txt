Background and objective:N-acetylcysteine has been used to treat a variety of lung diseases, where is it thought to have an antioxidant effect. In a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study, the effect of N-acetylcysteine on systemic inflammation and oxidative damage was examined in patients undergoing lung resection, a human model of acute lung injury.Methods:Eligible adults were randomized to receive preoperative infusion of N-acetylcysteine (240 mg/kg over 12 h) or placebo. Plasma thiols, interleukin-6, 8-isoprostane, ischaemia-modified albumin, red blood cell glutathione and exhaled breath condensate pH were measured pre- and post-operatively as markers of local and systemic inflammation and oxidative stress.Results:Patients undergoing lung resection and one-lung ventilation exhibited significant postoperative inflammation and oxidative damage. Postoperative plasma thiol concentration was significantly higher in the N-acetylcysteine-treated group. However, there was no significant difference in any of the measured biomarkers of inflammation or oxidative damage, or in clinical outcomes, between N-acetylcysteine and placebo groups.Conclusion:Preoperative administration of N-acetylcysteine did not attenuate postoperative systemic or pulmonary inflammation or oxidative damage after lung resection.Clinical trial registration:NCT00655928 at ClinicalTrials.gov.
