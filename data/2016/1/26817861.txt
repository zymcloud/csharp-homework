To date, studies of the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have either focused on specific individual miRNAs and a small number of suspected targets or simply reported a list of differentially expressed miRNAs based on expression profiling. Here, we seek a more in-depth understanding of the roles of miRNAs and their targets in HCC by integrating the miRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiles of tumorous and adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues of 100 HCC patients. We assessed the levels of 829 mature miRNAs, of which 32 were significantly differentially expressed. Statistical analysis indicates that six of these miRNAs regulate a significant proportion of their in silico predicted target mRNAs. Three of these miRNAs (miR-26a, miR-122, and miR-130a) were down-regulated in HCC, and their up-regulated gene targets are primarily associated with aberrant cell proliferation that involves DNA replication, transcription and nucleotide metabolism. The other three miRNAs (miR-21, miR-93, and miR-221) were up-regulated in HCC, and their down-regulated gene targets are primarily involved in metabolism and immune system processes. We further found evidence for a coordinated miRNA-induced regulation of important cellular processes, a finding to be considered when designing therapeutic applications based on miRNAs.
