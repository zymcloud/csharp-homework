Hepatic angiomyolipoma is a rare neoplasm that can be difficult to diagnose in cases of ecoguide biopsy. We studied 4 cases of female patients with a mean age of 51 years. None of the patients presented specific abdominal symptoms, or other tumour masses detected by chance. One of them had relevant personal history: Renal cell carcinoma. This same patient was diagnosed with a contralateral renal angiomyolipoma. None of the patients showed evidence of tuberous sclerosis. Three tumours have been diagnosed by biopsy and only in one patient was decided to completely remove the tumour surgically. None of the patients had evidence of recurrence of disease or an increase in tumour size over an average period of 45 months. Histologically, the tumours have been sub classified into angiomyolipomas epithelioid. In 50% of the cases, extramedullary haematopoiesis was observed. The first diagnostic impression using imaging methods included: Focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and metastasis. By immunohistochemistry, it has been demonstrated that all tumours expressing melanocytic markers (HMB45 and Melan A) and markers of smooth muscle cells (smooth muscle actin). The diagnosis of these tumours is increasing due to programmes for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with liver cirrhosis. It must be taken into account their broad spectrum of morphological diversity to avoid incorrect diagnosis of a malignant neoplasm.
