Purpose:Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the treatment of choice for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The absence of an early response to TACE might indicate alternative therapeutic strategies early in the course of the disease, thus improving outcomes. Therefore, our purpose was to identify the relationship between treatment response after two sessions of TACE and the time to the development of extrahepatic metastasis and overall survival.Methods:In total, 108 treatment-naÃ¯ve intermediate-stage HCC patients who received at least two consecutive sessions of TACE as the first-line treatment were analyzed.Results:The median follow-up duration was 28.5 months. Extrahepatic metastasis developed in 32 patients (29.6%). Patient age >60 years (P = 0.027), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) >200 ng/ml (P = 0.039), and objective response after two TACE treatments (P = 0.001) were the predictive factors for time to the development of metastasis. The median survival time for the patients who achieved objective response after two sessions of TACE was 45.9 and 14.4 months for the patients who failed to achieve objective response (P = 0.0001). Objective response after two TACE treatments (P = 0.0001) and the occurrence of extrahepatic metastasis (P = 0.002) were associated with overall survival.Conclusions:Early objective tumor response after two sessions of TACE was associated with prolonged time to metastasis and improved survival. Therefore, surveillance for metastasis should be performed more frequently when an objective response is not obtained after two sessions of TACE and in younger intermediate-stage HCC patients with high AFP levels.
