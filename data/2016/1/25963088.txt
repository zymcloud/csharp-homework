Background/aims:Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and colorectal neoplasms (CRNs) share risk factors. We aimed to investigate whether the CRN risk is increased in ESCC patients.Methods:ESCC patients who underwent a colonoscopy within 1 year of diagnosis were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were matched 13 by age, gender, and body mass index to asymptomatic controls. CRN was defined as the histological confirmation of adenoma or adenocarcinoma. Advanced CRN was defined as any of the following ≥3 adenomas, high-grade dysplasia, villous features, tumor ≥1 cm, or adenocarcinoma. The risk factors for both CRN and advanced CRN were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:Sixty ESCC patients were compared with 180 controls. The ESCC group had significantly higher numbers of CRNs (odds ratio [OR], 2.311; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.265 to 4.220; p=0.006) and advanced CRNs (OR, 2.317; 95% CI, 1.185 to 4.530; p=0.013). Significant risk factors for both CRN and advanced CRN by multivariate analysis included ESCC (OR, 2.157, 95% CI, 1.106 to 4.070, p=0.024; and OR, 2.157, 95% CI, 1.045 to 4.454, p=0.038, respectively) and older age (OR, 1.068, 95% CI, 1.032 to 1.106, p<0.001; and OR, 1.065, 95% CI, 1.024 to 1.109, p=0.002, respectively).Conclusions:The rates of CRN and advanced CRN are significantly increased in ESCC. Colonoscopy should be considered at ESCC diagnosis.
