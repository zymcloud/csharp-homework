Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks as the fifth most common malignancy worldwide. Early detection of HCC is difficult due to the lack of reliable markers. We aimed to assess the diagnostic role of annexin A2 (ANXA2) and follistatin as serum markers for HCC patients. This study included 50 patients with confirmed diagnosis of HCC, 30 patients with chronic liver disease, and 20 normal persons. Subjects performed thorough assessment and laboratory investigations. Serum levels of alpha fetoprotein (AFP), annexin A2, and follistatin were measured using ELISA technique. Annexin A2 significantly increased in the sera of HCC patients (median, 69.6 ng/ml) compared to chronic liver disease patients (median, 16.8 ng/ml) and control group (median, 9.5 ng/ml) (p
