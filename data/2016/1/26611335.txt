Background:Mortality and incidence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) parallel the geographical distribution of hepatitis B and C viruses among the general population, however genetic factors modulate individual cancer risk.Aims:ABO blood type, as a genetic marker, has previously been associated with the risk of several malignancies; we aimed to evaluate whether an association exists with HCC.Methods:This is a retrospective case-control study based on ABO distribution in 194 patients with HCC, compared with 215 decompensated cirrhotics without HCC listed for liver transplantation, and 90,322 healthy blood donors.Results:In patients with HCC, prevalence of blood type O was 35%, vs. 44% in cirrhotics (OR: 0.67, 95% CI 0.45-0.99; p=0.046) and 45% in blood donors (OR: 0.65, 95% CI 0.48-0.88; p=0.004).Conclusions:ABO blood type non-O is associated with higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, compared to cirrhotics without HCC and healthy subjects.
