Purpose:To assess whether blood pressure changes in the downstream vascular compartment are greater with transarterial chemoembolization than transarterial radioembolization (TARE) when using an anti-reflux catheter.Materials and methods:The Surefire Infusion System (Surefire Medical, Inc, Westminster, Colorado) was used for lobar and sublobar administration in 51 drug-eluting embolic transarterial chemoembolization and 55 TARE procedures (22 with resin microspheres [TARE/resin] and 33 with glass microspheres [TARE/glass]). Of patients receiving transarterial chemoembolization and TARE/glass, 97% had hepatocellular carcinomas; 87% of patients receiving TARE/resin had metastases. The absolute (mm Hg) and relative (%) changes in the systemic-hepatic arterial pressure difference (SHAPD) were calculated from simultaneous blood pressure measurements obtained from the femoral artery vascular sheath and the antireflux catheter before, after, and, when feasible, during transarterial chemoembolization or TARE.Results:Transarterial chemoembolization was associated with a significant reduction in SHAPD compared with TARE (13 mm Hg ± 1.7 vs -4.3 mm Hg ± 1.5; P Conclusions:Hepatic arterial pressures in the treated vascular compartment increased more after transarterial chemoembolization than after TARE, suggesting that transarterial chemoembolization resulted in more embolic obstruction of the targeted vascular compartment than TARE.
