A 59-year-old previously healthy man with a 50-pack-year smoking history presented with rib pain 1 month after a mechanical fall. Physical examination revealed a 1.5 cm right cervical lymph node and a 0.9 × 0.9 cm scalp nodule. The patient had only noticed the scalp lesion a month prior to presentation. Chest X-ray revealed a 5.8 × 5.0 cm left infrahilar mass. CT angiography demonstrated extensive metastatic mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy as well as hepatic, right adrenal and brain lesions. Pathology from fine-needle aspiration of cervical lymph nodes and punch biopsy of the scalp lesion were consistent with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) metastasis. The patient underwent brain stereotactic radiosurgery and palliative radiation therapy. Unfortunately, he passed away 4 months after diagnosis. Malignancy (primary or secondary) should be considered by clinicians in the work up of patients with new skin lesions, particularly in those at high risk of cancer.
