MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play essential roles in regulating the activity of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, thereby contributing to the suppression of invasion and metastasis. In this study, using gain and loss of function assays, we demonstrated that miR-302b was frequently down-regulated in clinical HCC specimens, as compared with 15 corresponding adjacent normal tissues. Overexpression of miR-302b suppressed HCC cell invasion and metastasis. Regulation of NF-κB and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 expression by miR-302b was mediated via AKT2 in SMMC-7721 cells. Silencing AKT2 produced effects similar to those of miR-302b overexpression, which included inhibiting SMMC-7721 cell invasion and metastasis and dereasing NF-κB and MMP-2 expression. Furthermore, overexpression of AKT2 attenuated the effects of miR-302b overexpression. Taken together, our findings indicate that miR-302b inhibits SMMC-7721 cell invasion and metastasis by targeting AKT2, suggesting that miR-302b might represent a potential therapeutic target for HCC intervention.
