Background:Management options for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) metastatic to the liver include surgical, ablative, cytotoxic, and radioisotope approaches. One potential local treatment option includes selective internal radiotherapy utilizing yttrium-90 ((90)Y) microspheres. (90)Y has also been used in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and tumors metastatic to the liver. It appears to be well tolerated; however, there is no randomized controlled trial reporting long-term toxicities. Previous retrospective reports have described biliary damage as a potential complication of therapy with (90)Y and chemoembolization; however, the long-term sequelae of (90)Y treatment are poorly understood.Case presentation:We present the case of a 65-year-old Caucasian woman who suffered biliary damage following (90)Y administration for metastatic pNETs and subsequently developed cirrhosis. Given the timeline of her various treatments and the lack of any other identifiable etiology for her cirrhosis, we believe this to be a potential long-term complication of (90)Y therapy.Conclusion:This case provides pathologic confirmation of cirrhosis as a potential long-term sequela of (90)Y treatment. This long-term risk needs to be considered when sequencing therapy for patients with neuroendocrine tumors who have a good prognosis. There are now several other systemic and ablative treatment options available to these patients, and long-term complications must be considered during treatment.
