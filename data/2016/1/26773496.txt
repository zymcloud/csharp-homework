Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a key regulator of differentiation of melanocytes and retinal pigment epithelial cells, but it also has functions in non-pigment cells. MITF consists of multiple isoforms, including widely expressed MITF-A and MITF-H. In the present study, we explored the potential role played by the Hedgehog signaling on MITF expression in two common types of primary liver cancer, using human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, the KKU-100 and HuCCT1, along with the HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. Importantly, cholangiocarcinoma is characterized by the activated Hedgehog signaling. Here we show that MITF-A mRNA is predominantly expressed in all three human liver cancer cell lines examined. Moreover, cyclopamine, an inhibitor of the Hedgehog signalling, increased the expression levels of MITF proteins in HuCCT1 and HepG2 cells, but not in KKU-100 cells, suggesting that MITF expression may be down-regulated in some liver cancer cases.
