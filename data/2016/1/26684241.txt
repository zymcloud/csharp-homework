Metastasis is one of the causes of cancer death. Functions and mechanisms of microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis are largely unknown. Here, a miRNA microarray analysis was performed in MHCC-97L, MHCC-97H and HCC-LM3 cells with gradually increasing metastatic potential to disclose crucial miRNAs involved in HCC metastasis. miR-192 expression decreased and negatively correlated with vascular invasion in HCC specimens. Gain and loss of function studies revealed that miR-192 significantly suppressed metastasis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Solute carrier family 39 member 6 (SLC39A6) was identified as a direct and functional target of miR-192. In addition, SLC39A6 negatively correlated with miR-192 in HCC samples and promoted HCC cell migration and invasion. Moreover, miR-192 decreased SLC39A6 expression, subsequently downregulating SNAIL and upregulating E-cadherin expression. Suppression of migration and invasion caused by miR-192 overexpression was alleviated by exogenous Snail expression. Intriguingly, lower miR-192 expression and higher SLC39A6 expression significantly contributed to poorer outcomes in HCC patients. Multivariate analysis indicated that miR-192 was an independent and significant predictor of HCC patient overall survival. In conclusion, we newly determined that miR-192 targeted the SLC39A6/SNAIL pathway to reduce tumor metastasis in HCC cells. This axis provided insights into the mechanism underlying miRNA regulation of HCC metastasis and a novel therapeutic target for HCC treatment.
