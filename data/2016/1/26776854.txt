Background:This study aims to assess if radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has any oncological superiority over transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) on post-hepatectomy recurrence.Methodology:From 2002 to 2011, 60.15% of 823 patients developed recurrence after hepatectomy for Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 102 patients with recurrence underwent RFA (n = 42) or TACE (n = 60) for tumor size ≤5 cm and number of lesion ≤3 when tumors were not resectable or transplantable. Those with renal impairment, portal vein thrombosis and poor liver reserve were excluded. Primary outcome was overall survival, which was determined using log-rank test and Kaplan Meier plots performed. Categorical data were analyzed using Chi-square test and continuous variable were analyzed using Mann-U Whitney test.Results:Demographics and primary tumor characteristics were similar in both groups (p > 0.05). Overall survival after initial hepatectomy and salvage treatment for recurrence was similar (p > 0.05) in both groups with 5-year OS after salvage treatment for RFA and TACE at 24.1% and 25.7%, respectively. For patients with second recurrence after salvage treatment, an interchangeable treatment strategy of RFA and TACE conferred a better survival outcome than a stand-alone treatment with RFA or TACE (p Conclusions:RFA and TACE may be equally effective for intrahepatic recurrence after hepatectomy when tumor size is ≤5 cm and ≤3 lesion when re-resection or salvage transplantation is not considered feasible.
