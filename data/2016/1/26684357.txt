Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type IB (BMPRIB) is one osteogenesis factor, which function in breast cancer has been rarely explored until recently. In the clinical study presented here, involving a cohort of 368 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patients, we identified that patients with low expression of BMPRIB exhibited poor prognosis, especially in the luminal B subtype. We also provided the first piece of evidence that low level of BMPRIB was a promoting factor for breast cancer patients to develop bone metastasis, but not lung, liver or brain. The first of its kind, we reported that patients with high expression of BMPRIB exhibited favorable prognosis by a retrospective analysis consisting of 168 patients treated with TE (taxane and anthracycline) regimens. And the patients with high expression of BMPRIB were more sensitive to TE regimens in the detection of 32 paired pre-neoadjuvant and post-neoadjuvant specimens. Overall, our study concluded that low expression of BMPRIB indicated poor prognosis of breast cancer and was insensitive to taxane-anthracycline chemotherapy. Our findings also lay a foundation to help clinicians improve identification of patients for TE regimens by BMPRIB in the era of precision medicine.
