Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a global health issue that increases the risk of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in infected patients. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a disease endemic mostly to the developed countries. It is associated with high cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, diabetes mellitus as well as cancer. In this manuscript, we systematically review the published data on the relationship between MetS and CHB infection. Multiple studies have described highly variable correlations between CHB on one hand and MetS, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and dyslipidemia on the other. No association between CHB and diabetes mellitus or atherosclerosis has been described as of now. The presence of MetS in patients infected with hepatitis B virus increases the risk of fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Appropriate lifestyle, but also pharmacological interventions are needed to prevent the development of these complications.
