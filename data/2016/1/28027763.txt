Purpose:To evaluate a simplified Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) algorithm to improve interreader agreement while maintaining diagnostic performance for HCC.Materials and methods:MRI scans of 84 cirrhotic patients with 104 distinct liver observations were retrospectively selected to equivocally match each of the LI-RADS grades (LR1-5) using histopathology and imaging follow up as standard of reference. Four independent radiologists categorized all observations as benign (LR1-2) or potentially malignant (LR3-5) and determined LI-RADS based imaging features including observation size, arterial phase hyperenhancement, washout, capsule appearance and threshold growth for LR3-5 observations and timed their readouts. LR3-5 observations were categorized according to the LI-RADS v2014 algorithm and according to a modified LI-RADS (mLI-RADS) version. Diagnostic performance and Interreader agreement were determined for LI-RADS and mLI-RADS using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and Fleiss' and Cohen's Kappa analysis respectively.Results:ROC analysis revealed equal diagnostic performance for LI-RADS and mLI-RADS (area under the ROC curve=0.91). Interreader agreement was higher using mLI-RADS as compared to current LI-RADS showing an improved overall (κ=0.53±0.04 vs. 0.45±0.04), and pair-wise agreement between most readers (κ range 0.44-0.62 vs. 0.35-0.60) at a reduced median evaluation time (51 vs. 62s per observation, pConclusion:Focusing on observation size and washout criteria using a modified, stepwise LI-RADS decision tree for LR3-5 observations results in higher interobserver reliability and faster categorization while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.
