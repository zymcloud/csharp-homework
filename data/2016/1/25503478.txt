Background:A partially covered self-expandable metallic stent (PCSEMS) is of proven benefit in palliation of unresectable or inoperable malignant gastric outlet obstruction. However, its use in patients with benign anastomotic stricture after laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG) is not well established.Methods:Patients who between May 2007 and June 2012 underwent PCSEMS placement for management of benign gastrointestinal obstruction after LAG were included in this retrospective analysis. The primary outcomes were the technical success and clinical success of the PCSEMS. The secondary outcomes were procedure-related complications and PCSEMS dysfunction.Results:Eleven patients (six women, five men, mean age 53.5 years, range 15-76 years) underwent successful placement of a PCSEMS for management of benign anastomotic strictures after LAG and were followed-up for a mean of 20.6 months (range 7.9-55.6 months). The mean gastric outlet obstruction scoring system (GOOSS) score was 0.36 before PCSEMS placement and 1.55 (p = 0.010) 24-48 h after PCSEMS placement. All of the patients were able to tolerate a solid diet (GOOSS score 3) after 1 week. There were no major or minor procedure-related complications. Stent dysfunction occurred in four patients (three distal migrations, one proximal migration), and stent removal was successful in all of the remaining patients after a mean of 2.0 months (1.1-3.0 months). Obstructive symptoms recurred in two patients (one after proximal migration, one after stent removal) and were treated successfully with PCSEMS reinsertion and balloon dilation.Conclusions:A PCSEMS may be a feasible and effective option for management of benign anastomotic strictures after LAG which could avoid secondary surgery.
