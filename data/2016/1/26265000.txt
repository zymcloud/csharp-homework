Aim:To investigate the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:All eligible studies were collected from PubMed, the Cochrane Libraries and Embase. The evaluation indices included overall survival (OS) rate, recurrence-free survival rate, local tumor progression rate and major complications. All statistical analysis was performed by RevMan version 5.2 software.Results:There were 21 studies with 3073 patients included in this meta-analysis. The RFA monotherapy was associated with higher 3- and 5-year OS rates (OR3-year = 2.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.34-4.05; OR5-year = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.48-2.85) compared with TACE alone. The combination of RFA and TACE was associated with higher 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates (OR1-year = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.28-2.96; OR3-year = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.19-2.04; OR5-year = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.13-2.07) compared with RFA alone.Conclusion:The combination of TACE with RFA could obviously improve the short- and long-term survival rates and significantly provide a better prognosis for patients with intermediate-size HCC. RFA was associated with a higher long-term OS rate than that of TACE-treated patients with HCC.
