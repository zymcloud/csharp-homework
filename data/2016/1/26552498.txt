Purpose:To evaluate the impact of previous liver resection on the safety of resin microsphere radioembolization (RE).Materials and methods:A single-center retrospective review was performed of 22 patients who underwent resin microsphere RE after liver resection during the period 2009-2014. Prescribed patient dose using the body surface area (BSA) model and a theoretical dose calculated from the actual liver volume on imaging were recorded. Patient and treatment characteristics were analyzed for factors that contributed to toxicity.Results:In 13 patients, 20 grade 1-3 toxicities were identified. No differences in toxicity were seen based on extent of prior hepatic resection or whether whole-liver treatments were performed (P = .2). The measured liver volume based on cross-sectional imaging correlated poorly with the expected liver volume based on BSA (r = 0.43). After adjusting for the patients' measured liver volume on cross-sectional imaging, five patients were determined to be relatively overdosed and seven patients were determined to be relatively underdosed by the BSA method. Despite these differences, no association was found with patient toxicities and either an overestimation or an underestimation of liver volume (P = .4).Conclusion:Previous hepatic resection does not adversely alter the safety profile of yttrium-90 RE. BSA poorly predicts expected liver volume in this population. However, standard BSA-based dosing and whole-liver remnant treatments do not increase hepatotoxicity.
