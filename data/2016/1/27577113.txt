Objective:We analyzed contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) features of histologically proved small (≤20 mm) liver metastases, in comparison to small (≤20 mm) hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), to define the differentiate diagnoses value of CEUS in clinical practice.Material and methods:Eighty-two cases of small (≤20 mm) liver metastases and 84 cases of small (≤20 mm) HCC were retrospectively reviewed. All patients had CEUS images. Two radiologists assessed CEUS enhancement pattern and time of enhancement in consensus. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v.19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The χ2 test and the independent sample t-test were used to compare the differences.Results:Comparing to small HCCs, rapid rim-like hyper-enhancement in arterial phase (56.1% in liver metastases vs. 2.3% in HCCs, p Conclusions:CEUS imaging enhancement findings reliably offer typical signs of small liver metastases, differentiate effectively with small HCCs. CEUS can help to improve the diagnostic confidence of small liver metastases.
