Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a growing concern all over the world. With the number of patients rising exponentially with each passing day, HCC is a problem that needs immediate attention. Currently, available treatment strategies focus on controlling the damage after the development of HCC. The options available from chemo- and radio-embolization to surgical resection and transplantation are not efficacious as required due to the complex nature of the disease. Liver regeneration and tissue healing are the subject of great interest today. Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is a cytokine with the ability to regenerate and therefore reverse the injuries caused by a wide range of agents. IL-22 acts via STAT molecule and controls the activity of a wide variety of cell survival and proliferation genes. Experimental data has given a positive insight into the role of IL-22 in inhibition of viral and alcohol-induced hepatocellular carcinoma. A further insight into the nature of IL-22 and the factors that can be manipulated in controlling the activity of IL-22 can help to counter the menace caused by the devastating effects of HCC.
