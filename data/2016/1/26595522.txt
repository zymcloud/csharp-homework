Poor prognosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) involves HBV X protein (HBx)-induced tumor progression. HBx also contributes to chemo-resistance via inducing the expressions of anti-apoptosis and multiple drug resistance genes. However, the impact of HBx expression on the therapeutic efficacy of various receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors remains unknown. In this study, our data showed that HBx overexpression did not alter the cellular sensitivity of HCC cell lines to sorafenib but unexpectedly enhanced the cell death induced by EGFR family inhibitors, including gefitinib, erlotinib, and lapatinib due to ErbB3 up-regulation. Mechanistically, HBx transcriptionally up-regulates ErbB3 expression in a NF-ÎºB dependent manner. In addition, HBx also physically interacts with ErbB2 and ErbB3 proteins and enhances the formation of ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimeric complex. The cell viability of HBx-overexpressing cells was decreased by silencing ErbB3 expression, further revealing the pivotal role of ErbB3 in HBx-mediated cell survival. Our data suggest that HBx shifts the oncogenic addiction of HCC cells to ErbB2/ErbB3 signaling pathway via inducing ErbB3 expression and thereby enhances their sensitivity to EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitors.
