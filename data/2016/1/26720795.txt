In this study, five kinds of reduction-degradable polyamide amine-g-polyethylene glycol/polyarginine (PAA-g-PEG/PArg) micelles with different proportions of hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments were synthesized as novel drug delivery vehicles. Polyarginine not only acted as a hydrophilic segment but also possessed a cell-penetrating function to carry out a rapid transduction into target cells. Polyamide amine-g-polyethylene glycol (PAA-g-PEG) was prepared for comparison. The characterization and antitumor effect of the DOX-incorporated PAA-g-PEG/PArg cationic polymeric micelles were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The cytotoxicity experiments demonstrated that the PAA-g-PEG/PArg micelles have good biocompatibility. Compared with DOX-incorporated PAA-g-PEG micelles, the DOX-incorporated PAA-g-PEG/PArg micelles were more efficiently internalized into human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells and more rapidly released DOX into the cytoplasm to inhibit cell proliferation. In the 4T1-bearing nude mouse tumor models, the DOX-incorporated PAA-g-PEG/PArg micelles could efficiently accumulate in the tumor site and had a longer accumulation time and more significant aggregation concentration than those of PAA-g-PEG micelles. Meanwhile, it excellently inhibited the solid tumor growth and extended the survival period of the tumor-bearing Balb/c mice. These results could be attributed to their appropriate nanosize and the cell-penetrating peculiarity of polyarginine as a surface layer. The PAA-g-PEG/PArg polymeric micelles as a safe and high efficiency drug delivery system were expected to be a promising delivery carrier that targeted hydrophobic chemotherapy drugs to tumors and significantly enhanced antitumor effects.
