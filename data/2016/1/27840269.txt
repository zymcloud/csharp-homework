Oncovirus-associated malignancies are potentially preventable diseases with major public health significance. Human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) may be associated with oncogenesis or symptomatic illnesses in immunocompromised patients, but the site of viral shedding of most recently discovered HPyVs remains obscure. Using real-time PCR assay using specific primers targeting the HPyV6 large tumor antigen gene, we detected a phylogenetically distinct HPyV6 which was highly prevalent in the bile samples of patients with malignant biliary obstruction (18.8%) and acute gallstone cholangitis (5.5%). The prevalence rate and mean viral load of this HPyV6 were highest in the cholangiocarcinoma subgroup (27.6% and 2.41 Ã— 104copies/ml). These findings were confirmed with another real-time PCR assay using specific primers targeting the HPyV6 viral capsid protein 2 gene. These bile HPyV6 strains may represent a novel clade of HPyV6 as they formed a distinct cluster from the other HPyV6s and exhibited >2% differences in amino acid sequences in their major proteins. While HPyV6 was unlikely the cause of the patients' acute symptoms and liver dysfunction, the virus may be related to immunosuppression in patients with malignancy and/or important in the oncogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma in patients without coinfection with other oncogenic microbes. Further studies to ascertain a causative role of HPyV6 in cholangiocarcinoma should be conducted.
