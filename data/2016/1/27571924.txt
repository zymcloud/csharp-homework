Background:While transfusion and iron chelation therapy for thalassemia major (TM) has improved dramatically in recent years, the consequences of this improvement (current rates of survival and TM-related complications) remain unknown.Methods:This nationwide population-based cohort study analyzed 2007-2011 data obtained from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database.Results:After excluding those patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, we enrolled 454 patients with TM who received transfusion and chelation therapy (median age, 17.2 years). Among these patients, the mortality rate was 2.9% in 2007, 2.3% in 2008, 2.9% in 2009, 2.6% in 2010, and 0.7% in 2011. Heart was the most common target organ of TM-related complications. There were 80 patients (17.6%) with arrhythmia and 86 patients (18.9%) with congestive heart failure. Dysfunction of endocrine organs was common, and the most common endocrinopathy was hypogonadism (23.1%), followed by diabetes (21.2%). There were 75 patients (16.5%) with liver cirrhosis and 79 patients (17.4%) with osteoporosis.Conclusions:Adequate red blood cell transfusion and iron chelation is available to all patients with TM in Taiwan under the universal health insurance system, and has resulted in reduction of TM-related mortality to very low levels. As these patients get older, early detection of complications and adequate intervention are important to quality-of-life improvement.
