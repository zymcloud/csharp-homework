Short-hairpin RNA of frizzled-2 (shRNA-Fz2) is known to suppress the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells; however, its effect on HCC cell motility is unknown. In this study, suppression of HCC cell motility by shRNA-Fz2 was analyzed, and introduction of shRNA-Fz2 into HCC cells was facilitated with ultrasound (US) irradiation generated from a diagnostic US device, which was enhanced by the contrast-enhanced US reagent Sonazoid. The HCC cell lines HLF and PLC/PRF/5 that were transfected with shRNA-Fz2 were plated to form monolayers, following which the cell monolayers were scratched with a sterile razor. After 48 h, the cells were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and the distance between the growing edge of the cell layer and the scratch lines was measured. Total RNA from the cells was isolated and subjected to real-time quantitative PCR to quantify matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression at 48 h after transfection of shRNA-Fz2. Starch-iodide method was applied to analyze the generation of H2O2 following US irradiation with the addition of Sonazoid in the liquid, and cell proliferation was analyzed 72 h later. The distances between the growing edge of the cell layer and the scratch lines and MMP9 expression levels were significantly decreased with transfection of shRNA-Fz2 (P
