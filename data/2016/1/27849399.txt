There have been no therapies available for patients who experience disease progression after sorafenib treatment. Regorafenib inhibits multiple kinases involved in tumor proliferation and neoangiogenesis, which has produced a survival benefit in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after sorafenib failure. Other active candidate agents are c-Met inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Areas covered: This paper presents an updated summary of the preclinical and clinical experience with regorafenib, c-Met inhibitors (tivantinib, cabozantinib and tepotinib), and a checkpoint inhibitor (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) in HCC. The reported data were obtained from abstracts of international conferences and journal articles published up to August 2016 and found in a PubMed search. Expert opinion: Based on favorable data from preclinical and clinical trials, regorafenib, c-Met inhibitor, and checkpoint inhibitors are promising agents for HCC after sorafenib failure. However, further efforts to maximize the survival benefit and minimize adverse events of these drugs in the treatment of HCC are still necessary. Additionally, searching for predictors of good responders could allow these new drugs to be applied in personalized treatments of HCC.
