Aim:To investigate ANXA5 overexpression on in vitro and in vivo malignancies of murine Hca-P cells.Materials & methods:Hca-P with low lymph node metastasis (LNM) potential was used as cell model. TEM, CCK-8 and Boyden transwell assays were performed for in vitro Hca-P behaviors. Hca-P-transplanted mouse model was established for in vivo experiment.Results:ANXA5-overexpressing monoclonal Anxa5-Hca-P-1, Anxa5-Hca-P-2 and Anxa5-Hca-P-3 cells were obtained. ANXA5 upregulation alters the proliferation, morphology and rough endoplasmic reticulum of Hca-P cells, enhances in vitro migration and invasions of Hca-P, promotes in vivo malignant degree and LNM rate of Anxa5-Hca-P-3-transplanted mice.Conclusion:As a potential indicator for malignancy and lymphatic metastasis, ANXA5 overexpression increases in vitro migration and invasion of Hca-P cell, promotes in vivo malignancy, LNM rate and level of Hca-P-transplanted mice.
