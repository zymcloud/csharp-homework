In-silico attempt was made to identify the key hub genes which get differentially expressed in biliary stricture and hepatic carcinoma. Gene expression data, GSE34166, was downloaded from the GEO database, which contains 10 biliary stricture samples (4 benign control and 6 malignant carcinoma), for screening of key hub genes associated with the disease. R packages scripts were identified 85 differentially expressed genes. Further these genes were uploaded in WebGestalt database and identified nine key genes. Using STRING database and Gephi software, the protein-protein interaction networks were constructed and also studied gene ontology through WebGestalt. Finally, we identified four key genes (CXCR4, ADH1C, ABCB1 and ADH1A) are associated with liver carcinoma and further cross-validated with Liverome, Protein Atlas database and bibliography. In addition, transcription factors and their binding sites also studied. These identified hub genes and their transcription factors are the probable potential targets for possible future drug design.
