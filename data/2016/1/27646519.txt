Purpose:Patients with breast cancer liver metastasis have a poor prognosis. Local therapy for liver metastasis increases survival. The purpose of this pilot prospective study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of doxorubicin drug-eluting beads chemoembolization for liver-dominant breast cancer metastasis (LdBM) refractory to chemotherapy.Materials and methods:All patients with LdBM refractory to of two or more lines of systemic chemotherapy were screened. Two chemoembolizations at 1-month intervals were scheduled for each patient. Tumor responses were evaluated by MRI every 3 months until progression or death. Adverse events were recorded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.02) 1 month after each chemoembolization. All patients were free from systemic treatment until progression. Patients with hormone-positive receptors and/or HER-positive disease status continued their targeted therapy.Results:Out of 23 patients enrolled (mean age: 57.5 ± 11.5 years), 17 completed two chemoembolizations and six underwent only one because of severe adverse events. At 3-month follow-up, the disease control rate was 83 %. The median progression-free survival from the first chemoembolization was 8 months, and the median overall survival was 17 months. Nineteen patients remained free from any systemic chemotherapy for a mean of 209 ± 92 days until progression. Eight grade 3 (asthenia n = 3, anemia n = 2, thrombocythemia n = 2, liver toxicity n = 1) (Rev 1 Comment 1) occurred after the first procedure. No patient died directly due to the procedure.Conclusion:While chemoembolization with doxorubicin eluding beads for refractory LdBM leads to an 83 % disease control rate, it also causes severe side effects that need to be adequately managed.
