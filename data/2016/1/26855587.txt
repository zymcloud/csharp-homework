Background:CNTN1, a member of the CNTN family of neural cell-recognition molecules, is involved in tumor invasion and metastasis. Although the expression of CNTN1 has been reported in several human malignancies, the expression of CNTN1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its correlation with prognosis remain unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of CNTN1 and determine the clinicopathological parameters and prognostic value of CNTN1 in HCC patients.Materials and methods:Quantitative real-time polymerase chain-reaction and Western blotting assays were performed to assess messenger RNA and protein levels of CNTN1 in 20 matched HCC specimens. The clinical and prognostic significance of CNTN1 in 90 cases of HCC was determined by immunohistochemistry.Results:CNTN1 expression was higher in HCC compared to the expression found in adjacent tissues at both messenger RNA and protein levels (PConclusion:Our results suggest that CNTN1 could play an important role in HCC and serve as an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for OS and DFS and a potential therapeutic target for HCC.
