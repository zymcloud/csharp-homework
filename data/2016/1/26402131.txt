Purpose:Although intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the second most common primary hepatic malignancy after hepatocellular carcinoma, there are limited data available on PET/CT imaging in ICC. This retrospective study analyzed the role of PET/CT imaging in the evaluation of ICC.Methods:FDG PET/CT findings were reviewed in 65 patients with histologically confirmed ICC. PET/CT was evaluated based on visual interpretation and the semiquantitative index of SUVmax and tumor-to-normal liver tissue ratio (TNR), which were consequently further analyzed and correlated with tumor localization, differentiation, size, and serum levels of tumor markers. Forty-five cases also underwent abdominal MRI examinations.Results:Nineteen patients had hilar ICC, whereas 46 patients had peripheral ICC. Sixty cases of ICC showed elevated FDG uptake with an average SUVmax of 8.3 ± 4.7 and TNR of 3.1 ± 1.7. Five cases located in the hilum were false negative on PET/CT imaging. Compared with hilar ICC, SUVmax and TNR of peripheral ICC were significantly higher (P Conclusions:Combination of FDG PET/CT and abdominal MRI might improve the diagnostic accuracy for ICC.
