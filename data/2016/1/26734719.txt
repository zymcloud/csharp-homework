Background/aims:Liver transplantation is an important treatment option for end-stage liver disease. Since liver transplantation is not performed in Iceland, patients are sent abroad for this procedure. The aim of this study was to investigate indications and results of liver transplantations for Icelandic patients.Materials and methods:The study was retrospective and included all patients in Iceland who had undergone liver transplantation from the first transplantation in 1984 to the end of 2012. Information was gathered from medical records. The study period was divided into three subperiods in order to evaluate changes in frequency of transplantation and survival.Results:During the period, 45 liver transplantations, thereof five retransplantations, were performed. Of 40 patients 16 were males, 18 females, mean age 40 years. There were six children, 2 girls and 4 boys with an age range of 0.4-12 years. Number of transplantation per million inhabitants increased significantly (2.40 during 1984-1996; 5.18 during 1997-2006 and 8.90 during 2007-2013; pConclusions:The number of liver transplantations has increased significantly in recent years. Survival has improved and is comparable to survival in countries where liver transplantations are performed.
