Non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH) is an uncommon but serious complication of malignancy. Patients with NICTH may appear unwell due to the underlying tumor, particularly when the mechanism of hypoglycemia is extensive tumor burden in the liver. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is reported to be the second most common cause of NICTH. The therapeutic strategies used in treating NICTH involve reduction of the tumor mass or tumor load, and palliative treatment of symptoms if curative attempts fail. In the present study we report the successful control of hypoglycemia using systemic chemotherapy in an advanced HCC patient who presented with refractory NICTH.
