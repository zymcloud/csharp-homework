Metabonomics has recently been widely used to discover the pathogenesis and find potential metabolic markers with high sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, it develops new diagnosis and treatment methods, increases early phase diagnosis rates of certain diseases and provides a new basis for targeted therapy. This review mainly analyzes the research progress of the metabonomics of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatic diseases, hoping to discover some potential metabolic markers for identification of HBV-related hepatic diseases from other etiologies and for HBV-related hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. This can contribute to early discovery, diagnosis and treatment, eventually increasing the survival rate of HBV-related hepatic diseases.
