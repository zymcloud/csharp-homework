Objective:To evaluate the long-term protection efficacy of neonatal hepatitis B vaccination on chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in adults.Methods:From January to October, 2013, a cross-sectional study was conducted among the participants from Qidong Hepatitis B Intervention Study (QHBIS), who were selected through stratified random sampling. The detections of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, HBeAg, and anti-HBe were conducted and ultrasonography on liver, gallbladder and spleen was performed for them. The positive rates of each serologic markers, the prevalence of active CHB and liver fibrosis and cirrhosis were calculated, the gender specific differences between vaccination group and control group were compared with Chi-square test.Results:A total of 4 421 participants aged (25.59±1.84) years in vaccination group and 3 880 participants aged (26.61±2.24) years in control group were surveyed. The positive rates of HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, HBeAg and anti-HBe were 2.38%, 37.73%, 3.78%, 0.57% and 2.15% in vaccination group, and 9.02%, 29.41%, 16.83%, 2.73% and 8.87% in control group, respectively, the differences between two groups were statistically significant (all P<0.05). The prevalence of active CHB and liver fibrosis and cirrhosis were 0.45% and 0.16% in vaccination group, 1.29% and 0.39% in control group, the differences between two groups were statistically significant (P<0.05). The active CHB prevalence was lower in females than in males in both vaccination group and control group (P<0.05). The liver fibrosis and cirrhosis prevalence was lower in females than in males in control group (P<0.05); whereas, no statistical significant difference in liver fibrosis & cirrhosis prevalence between males and females was found in vaccination group (P>0.05).Conclusions:Protection conferred by neonatal hepatitis B vaccination could last to marrying age. The gender specific difference in protection efficacy needs further study.
