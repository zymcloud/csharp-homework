PET using fluorine-18 fluorocholine ((18)F-fluorocholine) may detect malignancies that involve altered choline metabolism. While (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT has shown greater sensitivity for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than (18)F-fluoro-D-deoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT, it is not known whether it can also detect intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), a less common form of primary liver cancer. Clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic data from 5 patients with ICC and 23 patients with HCC from a diagnostic trial of liver (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT imaging were analyzed to preliminarily evaluate (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT for ICC. Imaging was correlated with whole-genome expression profiling to identify molecular pathways associated with tumor phenotypes. On PET/CT, all ICC tumors demonstrated low (18)F-fluorocholine uptake with a significantly lower tumor to mean background uptake ratio than HCC tumors (0.69 vs. 1.64, p
