The indication of liver transplantation (LT) for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is expanding. However, portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) has been still accepted as an absolute contraindication. We experienced an unexpectedly good prognosis in selected patients. Therefore, we tried to identify the prognostic factors after LT for HCC with major PVTT. Among 282 patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for HCC from January 2009 to December 2013, 11 (3.9%) patients with major PVTT that was preoperatively diagnosed were investigated. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates were 63.6%, 45.5%, and 45.5%, respectively, and all recurrent cases showed intrahepatic and extrahepatic recurrence. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 72.7%, 63.6%, and 63.6%, respectively, and 2 patients with delayed recurrence survived approximately 5 years after LT.
