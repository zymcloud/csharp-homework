Background:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a common primary liver malignancy, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death. The HCC risk increases with the severity of liver inflammation, and the clinical course of HCV infection depends on a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The former includes interleukin (IL)-6, while the latter includes IL-10. However, the exact pathogenic mechanisms underlying IL-6 and IL-10 effects remain unclear.Methods:The present study evaluated 174 chronic HCV Tunisian patients. Polymorphisms of IL-6 (rs1880242, rs1474847, rs2069840, rs1800797, rs1800796, rs2069845, rs2069827, rs1474348, rs1800795), and IL-10 (rs1800896, rs1800871, rs1800872, rs1554286, rs1878672, rs1518111) were determined by real-time PCR.Results:Notable differences between chronic HCV-infected patients and HCC patients were observed for the three IL-10 SNPs; rs1800871 (-819T/C), rs1800872 (-592A/C), and rs1878672. Carriage of IL-6 rs1800796 G/G genotype, IL-6 rs1474358 C-allele, and IL-6 rs1800797 A-allele was more frequent in chronic HCV-infected patients than in HCC patients. On the other hand, IL-6 rs1474358 GG genotype had a favourable factor for HCC establishment.Conclusion:IL-10 and IL-6 SNPs markedly influence the clinical outcomes of HCV infection. These SNPs could be used as biomarkers for early detection and molecular therapy for preventing HCC, and prognostic factors for predicting the clinical outcomes of HCC.
