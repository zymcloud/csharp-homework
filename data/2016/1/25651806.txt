As the world's population becomes older, the burden of hepatitis B virus in elderly has to be considered. The liver changes with aging and its function is eventually altered. The prevalence of hepatitis B virus is paradoxically more important in elderly in areas having vaccination programs, because of a loosening of the prevention in older patients. Some differences in hepatitis B presentation must be enhanced in elderly: lower spontaneous hepatitis B surface antigen clearance after a recent contamination, major risk of cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. Acute hepatitis B seems to be more often symptomatic, with a great risk of chronicity. Hepatocarcinoma linked to hepatitis B virus has a higher prevalence and a different presentation in elderly. Its treatment is the same as in younger people but is less often possible. Liver transplantation is contraindicated after 70 years old. Hepatitis B treatment panel is the same as in younger people (pegylated interferon, nucleoside or nucleotide agents). It gives identical results with no particular adverse events if the precautions for use are followed. Vaccination is less efficient, as in immunocompromised patients, and needs specific protocols.
