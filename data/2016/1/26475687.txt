Cell metastasis, especially the process of invasion and migration, is considered as the main cause for the high mortality rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which has become the sixth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer death. In this present study, we aimed to exploit the effects of perillyl alcohol on cell invasion and migration and the underlying molecular mechanisms in HCC. According to the transwell assays, cell invasiveness and migratory capacity were markedly higher in hepatoma cells (HepG2, SMMC-7721 and MHCC97H) than those in normal liver cells (HL-7702), and then significantly suppressed by perillyl alcohol treatment (P
