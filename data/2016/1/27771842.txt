Objective:We investigated the characteristic findings of regenerative nodules (RNs) for differentiating early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from high-grade dysplastic nodules (HGDNs) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA; EOB-MRI) and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in patients with chronic liver disease.Subjects and methods:Pathologically confirmed lesions (100 early HCCs, 7 HGDNs, and 20 RNs with a maximum diameter of more than 1 cm and mean maximal diameters of 15.5, 15.1, and 14.8 mm, respectively) were enrolled in this retrospective study. The signal intensities of these lesions during the hepatobiliary phase of EOB-MRI were investigated, and findings characteristic of RNs using this modality were also evaluated using CEUS.Results:Ninety-eight of the 100 early HCCs that were hypo-intense (n = 95), iso-intense (n = 2), or hyper-intense (n = 1) and the seven HGDNs that were hypo-intense (n = 6) or hyper-intense (n = 1) during the hepatobiliary phase of EOB-MRI exhibited centripetal vessels during the arterial dominant phase of CEUS, although one early HCC that was hypo-intense exhibited both centrifugal and centripetal vessels. Eighteen of the 20 RNs and one early HCC that were hyper-intense with a small central hypo-intensity and the remaining two RNs that were hyper-intense on EOB-MRI exhibited centrifugal vessels during the arterial dominant phase of CEUS. The small central hypo-intense area corresponded to central vascular structures in the lesion, such as the hepatic artery and portal vein running from the center to the periphery, when viewed using CEUS.Conclusion:Central vascular structures may be a characteristic finding of RNs when observed during the hepatobiliary phase of EOB-MRI and the arterial dominant phase of CEUS.
