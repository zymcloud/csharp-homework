Epidemiological studies implicate environmental risk factors and epigenetic alterations in the multistage process of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. However, associations between environmental factors and DNA methylation of tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) in HCC development remain ambiguous. Understanding how possible interactions influence risk may provide insights into the complexity of hepato-carcinogenesis. For this study, blood samples were collected from HCC patients (n=90) and healthy volunteers (n=99) from Xiamen (China) and data for selected environmental risk factors [e.g., benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), hepatitis B or C virus (HBV or HCV) infection, smoking and alcohol consumption] were recorded; factors identified as significantly higher (P
