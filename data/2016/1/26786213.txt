Background:Trabectedin is an antineoplastic agent used for patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS) who fail standard-of-care treatment. Real-world data of its performance is scarce. This study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of trabectedin for patients with advanced STS who were treated at a high-volume sarcoma center.Methods:A retrospective chart review was performed on 77 patients treated with trabectedin (24 h infusion q3w) between 01/2005 and 05/2014. Data regarding safety, objective radiological response, progression-free and overall survival were analyzed.Results:Median age at treatment onset was 52y [interquartile range (IQR): 45-61y]. Tumors included leiomyosarcoma (41.6%), liposarcoma (18.2%), and synovial sarcoma (13%). Trabectedin was provided as â‰¥ third-line chemotherapy in 71.4%. Median number of cycles was 2 (range: 1-17). Dose reduction and treatment delays occurred in 19.5 and 40.3%, respectively. Toxicities occurred in 78%, primarily for neutropenia or elevated liver enzymes. Two patients died secondary to trabectedin-induced rhabdomyolysis. Treatment was discontinued because of disease progression (84.7%), toxicity (10%), and patient preference (5%). Partial response or stable disease occurred in 14.1 and 33.8%, respectively, while 52.1% developed progressive disease. Median progression-free survival was 1.3 m (IQR: 0.7-3.5 m) and was significantly higher in patients lacking severe toxicities or progressive disease. Median overall survival was 6.7 m (IQR: 2.3-12.7 m) and was significantly higher in patients with leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma relative to other histologies.Conclusions:Trabectedin has an acceptable safety profile as an anti-tumor agent. Our data further suggest there may be some benefit in using trabectedin particularly in patients with leiomyo- or liposarcoma who failed standard-of-care agents.
