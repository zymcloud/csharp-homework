Background:There is no consensus on the safe resection margin in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Surgeons decide the extent of resection according to residual liver function and tumor location. We investigated the influence of resection margin on early recurrence with respect to gross tumor type and expression of cytokeratin 19 (CK19).Methods:We divided the patients into two groups based on the classification of The Korean Liver Cancer Study group as follows: group 1 included expanding and vaguely nodular types whereas group 2 included nodular with perinodular extension, multinodular confluent, and infiltrative types. We classified the resection margin as narrow (0.1-0.9 cm) or wide (greater than 1 cm). We compared clinicopathological features and CK19 positivity between the groups.Results:Group 2 had a higher prevalence of gross portal vein invasion, microscopic portal vein invasion, microvessel invasion, satellite nodules, intrahepatic metastasis, multicentric occurrence, and positivity for CK19. Group 1 showed no difference in recurrence according to the resection margin; however, group 2 showed a higher recurrence rate in patients with a narrow resection margin compared with those with a wide resection margin (P = 0.047). Patients in group 2 with CK19 positivity showed a higher prevalence of microvessel invasion than those without CK19 (P = 0.026).Conclusions:Although our study has the limitation of a small number of cases, the data suggest that patients with hepatocellular carcinoma of expanding and vaguely nodular gross types may safely undergo surgical resection with a narrow resection margin and a low risk of early recurrence.
