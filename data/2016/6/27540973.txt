Aims:The study aimed to investigate the quantitative expression of NANOG, p38 α , NCF2, ELF and TGF-β genes in patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma, adenoma and normal colonic tissue and their correlation with SIRT-1 protein level expression.Method:This study enrolled one hundred sixty seven patients; group A: 87 patients with colonoscopic findings of no adenoma or adenocarcinoma and group B: 80 patients with colorectal mass. Consecutive colonoscopic examinations were conducted, and tissue samples were taken from the colonic lesions/masses. Total RNA was isolated and mRNA expression level of NANOG, mitogen activated p38α , Neutrophil Cytosol Factor 2 (NCF2), Embryonic Liver Fodrin (ELF) and Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-β) genes were quantified by qRT-PCR. Sirt-1 protein expression level was assessed by quantitative western blot.Results:There were significantly high level of mRNA transcripts expression of the genes studied in patients with adenocarcinoma and adenoma compared with normal tissue (P value < 0.01), NANOG, NCF2, ELF and TGF-β at a cut of > 0.314, > 0.392, 0.349 and 0.333 respectively showed sensitivity (96.5%, 98.8%, 95.3%, 98.8%) and specificity of (95.3%, 92.6%, 89.5%, 93.8%) respectively in diagnosing colonic adenocarcinoma. Sirt-1 protein level was significantly highly expressed in colorectal adenocarcinoma compared to normal and adenoma colonic tissue and positively correlated with NANOG.Conclusion:Over expression of NANOG, p38α , NCF2, ELF and TGF-β genes in both cases of adenocarcinoma and adenoma could have a diagnostic value. SIRT-1 and NANOG are high correlated biological markers for diagnosis and prognosis follow up in patients with adenocarcinoma.
