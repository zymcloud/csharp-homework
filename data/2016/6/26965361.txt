Purpose:To elucidate trends in transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) use and outcomes over the course of a decade, including predictors of inpatient mortality and extended length of hospital stay.Materials and methods:The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was interrogated for the most recent 10 years available: 2003-2012. TIPS procedures and associated diagnoses were identified via International Classification of Diseases (version 9) codes, with the latter categorized into primary diagnoses in a hierarchy of disease severity. Linear regression analysis was used to determine trends of TIPS use and outcomes over time. Independent predictors of mortality and extended length of stay were determined by logistic regression.Results:A total of 55,145 TIPS procedures were captured during the study period. Annual procedural volume did not change significantly (5,979 in 2003, 5,880 in 2012). The majority of TIPSs were created for ascites and/or varices (84%). Inpatient mortality (12.5% in 2003, 10.6% in 2012; P 80 y, black race), and sequelae of advanced cirrhosis (comorbid hepatocellular carcinoma, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, encephalopathy, and coagulopathy).Conclusions:National TIPS inpatient mortality has decreased since 2003 while procedural volume has not changed. Postprocedural outcome is a function of patient demographic and socioeconomic factors and associated diagnoses. Independent predictors of poor outcome identified in this large national population study may aid clinicians in better assessing preprocedural risk.
