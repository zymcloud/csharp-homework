Sulfation has been reported to be a major pathway for the metabolism and inactivation of rotigotine in vivo. The current study aimed to identify the human cytosolic sulfotransferase (SULT) enzyme(s) capable of mediating the sulfation of rotigotine. Of the 13 known human SULTs examined, 6 of them (SULT1A1, 1A2, 1A3, 1B1, 1C4, 1E1) displayed significant sulfating activities toward rotigotine. pH dependence and kinetic parameters of the sulfation of rotigotine by relevant human SULTs were determined. Of the 6 human organ samples tested, small intestine and liver cytosols displayed considerably higher rotigotine-sulfating activity than did brain, lung, and kidney. Moreover, sulfation of rotigotine was shown to occur in HepG2 human hepatoma cells and Caco-2 human colon adenocarcinoma cells under metabolic conditions. Collectively, the results obtained provided a molecular basis underlying the previous finding of the excretion of sulfated rotigotine by patients undergoing treatment with rotigotine.
