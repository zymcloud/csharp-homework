Background:Skeletal muscle depletion predicts poor prognosis of patients with certain cancers. However, the correlation between low skeletal muscle index (SMI) and the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well understood.Methods:To determine their influence on prognosis, skeletal muscle index (SMI) and visceral fat area (VFA) were measured using computed tomography at the level of the third lumbar vertebra of 195 patients who underwent primary hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We defined sarcopenia using cutoff values for SMI as 43.75 cm(2)/m(2) and 41.10 cm(2)/m(2) for males and females, respectively.Results:Sarcopenia was present in 89 of 195 (45.6%) patients and correlated significantly (P Conclusions:Low-SMI was an independent adverse prognostic factor for CRR in patients with BMI â‰¥22. Therefore, preventing muscle wasting may improve the CRR of patients with HCC.
