Introduction:Nucleos(t)ide analogs and interferon-based compounds are currently approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Although these treatments are effective in suppressing viral replication, it is unable to completely eradicate the virus from the host. Therefore, CHB patients are at a life-long risk of developing complications, including hepatocellular carcinoma.Areas covered:Drugs targeting novel sites of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication cycle and the host immune response in development are discussed. As current available drugs only target a small segment of the HBV life cycle, the development of new agents targeting different sites is an important step in eradicating HBV. The host immunological response is also vital in viral clearance. Newer agents in development include immunomodulatory agents and therapeutic vaccines.Expert opinion:For any chance of eradication, a combination of drugs targeting both the host factors and different sites of the viral life cycle will be required. Two key components to achieving this goal include the removal of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) together with restoration of the immune control against HBV.
