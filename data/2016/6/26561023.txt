Previous studies have identified gaps in hepatitis B care. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the delivery of care among a national cohort of US veterans with chronic hepatitis B infection and examine risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Veterans Health Administration Corporate Data Warehouse from 1999 to 2013 to evaluate (1) care delivery and (2) clinical outcomes such as hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic decompensation, and mortality among US veterans with hepatitis B. Incidence rates with 95% confidence intervals were calculated and Cox regression models were used to evaluate clinical outcomes. We identified 21,419 veterans with a positive hepatitis B surface antigen, and 97% of patients had alanine aminotransferase and 44% had hepatitis B virus DNA testing; hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis B e antibody were tested Conclusion:We observed a low prevalence of recommended laboratory testing, antiviral therapy initiation, and liver imaging among a national cohort of veterans with hepatitis B infection; antiviral therapy and liver imaging were independently associated with decreased mortality.
