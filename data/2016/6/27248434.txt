Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in the Western world. It is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes and represents a spectrum of histological abnormalities ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can further progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver failure. To gain insight into the pathogenesis and evaluate treatment options, mouse models of NAFLD/NASH are of utmost importance. There is a high phenotypical variety in the available mouse models, however, models that truly display the full spectrum of histopathological and metabolic features associated with human NASH are rare. In this review, we summarize the most important NAFLD/NASH mouse models that have been developed over the years and briefly highlight the pros and cons. Also, we illustrate the preclinical research in which these models have been used. Â© 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
