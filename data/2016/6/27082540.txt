Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been ranked the second leading cause of cancer‑associated mortality in China and the third leading cause of cancer‑associated mortality worldwide. A number of previous studies investigating SLC44A5 have revealed important biological insight and disease‑specific functions. Therefore, the present study investigated the expression of SLC44A5 in HCC tissues and cell lines, and assessed the effect of SLC44A5 on the viability, cell cycle, apoptosis and invasion of HCC cell lines. The mRNA expression of SLC44A5 in 35 HCC tissues was significantly higher compared with that in 35 normal tissues. The protein expression of SLC44A5 was notably high in MHCC‑97H and SMMC‑7721 cells compared with that in four other HCC cell lines. Knockdown of SLC44A5 using short hairpin RNA inhibited cell viability and arrested the cells in G1 of the cell cycle by reducing the expression of cell cycle markers, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cyclin‑dependent kinase 2 in MHCC‑97H and SMMC‑7721 cells. Furthermore, SLC44A5 knockdown cells also exhibited cell apoptosis by reducing the expression levels of apoptosis markers, caspase‑3 and caspase‑9 in MHCC‑97H and SMMC‑7721 cells, and suppressed invasion. The present results suggested that SLC44A5 is involved in HCC carcinogenesis and progression in HCC, indicating that SLC44A5 may be a molecular target in cancer therapy.
