Background:The different outcomes of deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) and living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are currently being debated. We aimed to retrospectively compare the outcomes following LDLT and DDLT and to analyse the factors influencing this.Methods:We compared the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates of HCC patients after LDLT (n=389) and DDLT (n=6471) from 81 centres over a 10-year period. OS and DFS rates were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method. And univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regressions were performed on the entire cohort to identify predictors.Results:Of 6860 patients, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 86.79%, 70.16%, and 66.31% after LDLT, respectively, and 74.2%, 54.21%, and 46.97% after DDLT, respectively (PConclusions:With regards to OS and DFS, there were no disadvantages to LDLT as compared with DDLT; tumour morphology and biology may affect the prognosis of LT.
