The altered expression of some microRNAs (miRNAs) is observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the genetic polymorphisms in the precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) in aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-related HCC have not yet been investigated. A hospital-based case-control study, including 1,706 HCC cases and 2,270 controls without any liver diseases or tumors, was conducted in a high AFB1 exposure area of China to assess the relationship between 48 polymorphisms in the pre-miRNAs and AFB1-related HCC risk and prognosis. Among 48 polymorphisms, only rs28599926 (in the miRNA 1268a) affected HCC risk. Compared with the homozygote of rs28599926C alleles (rs28599926-CC), the genotypes of rs28599926 T alleles (namely rs28599926-CT or -TT) increased HCC risk (odds ratio [OR]: 1.63 and 5.52, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.40-1.90 and 4.27-7.14, respectively). Significant interactive effects between risk genotypes and AFB1 exposure status were also observed in the joint effects analysis. This polymorphism was associated not only with larger tumor size, higher portal vein tumor risk, and tumor dedifferentiation, but also with higher AFB1 adducts levels and increasing the mutation risk of TP53 gene. Furthermore, rs28599926 modified the tumor recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.86, 95% CI: 2.36-3.43) and overall survival (HR: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.86-2.41) of cases. Additionally, one target of miR-1268a was show to be the ADAMTS4 mRNA and rs28599926 polymorphism might modify ADAMTS4 expression. These findings indicate that polymorphisms in the pre-miRNAs may be risk and prognostic biomarkers of AFB1-related HCC, and rs28599926 in miR-1268a is such a potential candidate.
