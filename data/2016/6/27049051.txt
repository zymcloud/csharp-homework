Chronic infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is at risk of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and remains one of the major public health problems worldwide. It is a major barrier of persistence HBV cccDNA under current antiviral therapy as novel strategies of disrupting HBV cccDNA is pressing. The (CRISPR)/Cas9 system is presently emerging in gene editing and we also apply it for targeting and deleting the conserved regions of HBV genome. Two homologous sequences of HBV S and X genes were carried with CRISPR/Cas9 endonuclease to build pCas9 constructs, which may mediate anti-HBV effects of in vitro and in vivo systems in this study. The results showed the better anti-HBV productions by pCas9-2 and without significant differences in between Huh7 and HepG2 cells. CRISPR/Cas9 direct cleavage and mutagenesis were further analyzed of in vitro system. In the M-TgHBV mouse model of HBV, injection of pCas9 constructs by hydrodynamics decreased HBsAg of sera and liver HBcAg. In conclusion, this designed CRISPR/Cas9 system can induce anti-HBV effects and potentially consider as a novel therapeutic agent against chronic HBV infection.
