Sorafenib is currently the only targeted therapy available for advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cutaneous adverse events associated with sorafenib treatment include hand-foot skin reaction, but there has been no report of drug reaction (or rash) with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. Here, we report a case of 72-year-old man with HCC and alcoholic liver cirrhosis who developed skin eruptions, fever, eosinophilia, and deteriorated hepatic and renal function under sorafenib treatment. He has since successfully recovered with conservative care.
