Aim:Besides surgical treatment, systematic chemotherapy plays a crucial role in HCC treatment, especially for patients with advanced HCC. However, none of the single-drug-treatment strategies have shown significant survival benefit due to a high incidence rate of chemoresistance. This study was designed to observe the effect of small interfering of RNA (SiRNA) targeting multidrug resistance-related protein 1-4 (MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, and MRP4) in modulating drug resistance of HepG2/ADM and SMMC7721/ADM cells.Methods:HepG2/Adriamycin (ADM) and SMMC7721/ADM cell lines were developed by exposing parental cells to stepwise increasing concentrations of ADM. MTT assay was used to determine drug sensitivity and half inhibitory concentration (IC50) of drugs was calculated. Flow cytometry was employed to analyze cell cycle distribution. MRP1-4 mRNA expression levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR). Expression of proteins was analyzed by Western blot. The growth curve was draw and the cell apoptosis was also observed. Animal experiment was used to compare the cell growth.Results:MTT assay showed that the values of IC50 and RI of HepG2/ADM and SMMC7721/ADM decreased after siRNA treatment in HepG2/ADM cells and SMMC7721/ADM cells. QRT-PCR analysis demonstrated the MRP1-4 mRNA expression decreased significantly in HepG2/ADM cells and SMMC7721/ADM cells after siRNA transfection. In addition, compared with parental cells, MRP1-4 protein expressions apparently decreased in SMMC7721/ADM and HepG2/ADM cells. Flow cytometry showed significantly elevated apoptosis rate following MRP1-4 siRNA transfection. Animal experiment suggested that silencing MRP1-4 gene in vivo inhibited tumor growth.Conclusion:Inhibition of MRP1-4 by small interfering RNA enhanced and selectively restored sensitivity of hepatoma cells to drugs. MRP1-4 siRNA might represent a new therapeutic option for HCC.
