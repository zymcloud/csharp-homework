Background:Mannose-binding lectin 2 (MBL2) plays a key role in the host immune response, but whether it is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not clear. The present study aimed to identify the association between MBL2 gene polymorphisms and HCC in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis in the Chinese population.Methods:A single-nucleotide polymorphism of MBL2, rs11003123, was genotyped and analyzed in a case-control study of HBV-related cirrhotic patients with HCC (n=77) and without HCC (n=40).Results:We found that Child-Pugh profiles, model for end-stage liver disease score, and the incidence of encephalopathy were all higher in the non-HCC group (PConclusion:MBL2 rs11003123 polymorphism may be a marker for the risk of HCC occurrence in patients with HBV-related cirrhosis in the Chinese population.
