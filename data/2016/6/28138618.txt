Background:Little is known about whether hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroconversion (SC) contributes to any survival benefits for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:All patients with hepatitis B-related HCC and HBsAg seroclearance between 1989 and 2013 were identified. Case- and control-groups were matched according to their stage of disease and mode of treatment. Baseline demographics, liver function, and overall survivals (OS) were compared between these two groups.Results:Thirty-nine HCC cases with HBsAg SC were identified, and 312 non-seroconversion (NSC) HCC cases were matched. Forty-eight percent of patients had curative resections, 14% were treated with ablation and 38% were for palliation. Age of patients in SC group was older than those in NSC group (P=0.026). Although there was significantly better liver function in SC vs. NSC groups in terms of bilirubin (P=0.027), albumin (P=0.003), AST (P=0.001) and ALT (P<0.001), there was no overall difference in Child-Pugh grade among the two groups. In regarding tumour pathology, SC commonly presented with solitary tumour nodule as compared to multiple nodules in NSC (P=0.027), and was also frequently associated with a normal background liver parenchyma (P<0.001). Although no survival benefit was confirmed in log-rank analysis between SC and NSC, the absolute 5-year survival of SC group was better in resection (72.2% vs. 55.3%), ablation (83.3% vs. 57.4%) and palliation (24.4% vs. 14.4%).Conclusions:HCC patients with HBsAg SC are associated with a better background liver parenchyma and function, and might contribute to an improved long-term survival.
