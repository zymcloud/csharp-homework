Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma have a very short life expectancy if they receive no surgical intervention. A relatively new surgical technique termed "Associating Liver Partition and Portal Vein Ligation for Staged Hepatectomy" (ALPPS) has been employed for inducing rapid hypertrophy of the future liver remnant for patients waiting for hepatectomy. As portal vein embolization may not result in satisfactory hypertrophy before tumor progression occurs, ALPPS can be an alternative for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Herein we describe an ALPPS procedure with tumor thrombectomy for a patient who had a small left liver lobe and a large hepatocellular carcinoma involving the whole right liver lobe and the middle hepatic vein and extending into the inferior vena cava. In the first-stage operation, the right portal vein was controlled and divided with a Hemolock. The right hepatic artery was well protected. Hepatic transection was performed with a 1-cm margin from the tumor. The middle hepatic vein trunk was preserved. Ten days afterwards, there was significant hypertrophy of the left lateral section of the liver, and the second-stage operation was conducted. Extended right hepatectomy and tumor thrombectomy were performed under sternotomy and total vascular exclusion. The patient had good recovery and was free of disease 10 months after the operation. ALPPS may be a good treatment option even for patients with advanced disease if carried out at high-volume centers.
