Background:This study uses healthcare consumption to compare the health status of beneficiaries of the French national health insurance general scheme between individuals living in French overseas territories (FOT) and those living in metropolitan France.Methods:Data were extracted from the French national health insurance database (Sniiram) for 2012, using algorithms, 56 groups of diseases and 27 groups of hospital activity were isolated. Standardized morbidity ratio for age and sex (SMR) were used to compare FOT to mainland France.Results:Compared with mainland France, people living in the four FOT had high SMR for diabetes care (Guadeloupe 1.9; Martinique 1.7; Guyane 1.9; La Réunion 2.3), dialysis (2.7; 2.4; 3.8; 4.4), stroke (1.2; 1.1; 2.0; 1.5), and hospitalization for infectious diseases (1.9; 2.5; 2.4; 1.4) and obstetrics (1.4; 1.2; 1.9; 1.2). Care for inflammatory bowel disease or cancer were less frequent except for prostate in Martinique and Guadeloupe (2.3). People living in Martinique, Guadeloupe and la Reunion had more frequently care for psychotic disorders (2.0; 1.7; 1.2), dementia (1.1; 1.3; 11), epileptic seizures (1.4; 1.4; 16) and hospitalizations for burns (2.6; 1.7; 2.9). In la Reunion, people had more frequently coronary syndrome (1.3), cardiac heart failure (1.6), chronic respiratory diseases except cystic fibrosis (1.5), drug addiction (1.4) and hospitalizations for cardiovascular catheterization (1.4) and toxicology, poisoning, alcohol (1.7). Other differences were observed by gender: HIV infection, peripheral arterial disease, some chronic inflammatory disease (lupus) were more frequent in women living in Martinique or Guadeloupe, compared to women from mainland France and psychotic disorders for men. From la Reunion, men had more frequently liver and pancreatic diseases and hospitalisation for toxicology, poisoning, alcohol than men from mainland France.Conclusion:This study highlights the utility of administrative database to compare and follow population health status considering healthcare use. Specific Public Health policies are justified for FOT, taking into account the specific context of each FOT, the necessity of prevention initiatives and screening to reduce the frequency of the chronic diseases.
