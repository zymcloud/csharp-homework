Introduction:Recurrence patterns after curative intent gastrectomy for T1-2N0 gastric adenocarcinoma are poorly defined. We sought to assess timing, patterns, and risk factors for recurrence in patients treated at two high-volume gastric cancer centers in the United States and China.Methods:Between 1995 and 2011, 1,058 patients underwent curative intent gastrectomy. Recurrences were classified as locoregional, distant, or peritoneal. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors for recurrence.Results:Overall, 7% (76) of our 1,058 patients from the United States (n = 414) and China (n = 644) recurred. Liver (43%) was the most common site of recurrence in both countries (US: 24%, China: 52%), followed by peritoneum (16%), lymph nodes (10%), and anastomosis (8%). Median time to recurrence was 23 months (US: 30 months, China: 23 months), which decreased with increasing T-stage (T1a: 27 months, T1b: 24 months, T2: 22 months). Tumor size (P = 0.001), depth of invasion (P = 0.010), histological type (P = 0.022) and lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.001) were independently associated with recurrence.Conclusion:Patients infrequently recur following curative intent gastrectomy for T1-2N0 gastric adenocarcinoma. Almost all recurrences occur between six months and 3 years post-operatively, most frequently in distant anatomic locations; selective followup during this time period is recommended. J. Surg.
