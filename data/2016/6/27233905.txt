Ginseng's major active components, ginsenosides, have been known to show anti-cancer, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory activities. Ultrasonication processed Panax ginseng berry extract (UGB) contains various ginsenosides. The components are different from Panax ginseng berry extract (GBE). This study was aimed to investigate the cytotoxic mechanism of UGB in HepG2 cells, human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. HepG2 cells were treated with UGB (0, 10, 20 Î¼g/ml). Cell growth and cellular apoptosis were evaluated by MTT assay and Annexin V/Pi staining, respectively. Intracellular Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were also determined by 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA) staining. The expressions of Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3, the apoptotic markers, were evaluated by Western Blot. UGB dose-dependently inhibited cell growth and induced apoptotic cell death. Intracellular ROS levels were increased. UGB increased the expression of the cleaved form of caspase-3. Furthermore, UGB induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells through Bax activation and Bcl-2 inhibition. In conclusion, UGB induced apoptosis through an intrinsic pathway in HepG2 cells suggesting that UGB might play a role as a novel substance for anti-cancer effect.
