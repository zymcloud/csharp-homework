Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects as many as 185 million people globally, many of whom are chronically infected and progress over time to cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and eventually death without a liver transplant. In the United States, HCV genotype 1 constitutes about 75% of all infections. While interferon and ribavirin therapy was the cornerstone of treatment for many years, interferon-free treatments have become the standard of care with the emergence of new direct-acting agents, resulting in more effective treatment, shorter duration of therapy, better tolerability, lower pill burden, and ultimately better adherence. This review will summarize the evidence for the currently available combination therapies as well as emerging therapies in phase 3 trials for treatment of HCV genotype 1.
