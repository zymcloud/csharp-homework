Hepatocellular carcinoma progression is thought to be driven by cancer stem cells (CSCs). No clinical trial has, as yet, shown convincing long-term disease free survival results for the majority of patients in HCC. So it is important to discover new anti-cancer agents. In our study, we chose sophocarpine, which is derived from the foxtail-like sophora herb, for its efficacy to inhibit HCC including CSCs and potential mechanism study. Our results show that sophocarpine could not only reduce HCC cell viability, eliminate HCC and reverse hepatoma cells malignant phenotype, but also reduce the ratio of CSCs and inhibit the sphere formation of CSCs in vitro. In vivo, sophocarpine significantly displayed antitumor effects in subcutaneous xenograft HCC models and orthotopic transplantation tumor models. Further studies showed that sophocarpine could exert anti-tumor effects partly via downregulating the activity of the cancer stem cell related pathways and inhibiting EMT induced by TGF-Î².
