The goal of this study was to evaluate the single-centre experience with hepatectomy for liver metastases from cervical cancer (CCLM). Fifteen patients who underwent such surgery at the Fundeni Clinical Hospital between January 2002 and April 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Liver lesions diagnosed at more than 6 months from cervical cancer diagnosis were classified as metachronous lesions, while lesions occurring within the first 6 months were considered synchronous lesions. Two patients were diagnosed with synchronous CCLM, while the other 13 patients had metachronous. Early postoperative death occurred in a single patient with metachronous liver metastases and pelvic recurrence, but this was not related to liver surgery. The median overall survival for the entire cohort was 18 months from the time of liver resection; patients with metachronous lesions had an improved outcome when compared to those with synchronous lesions. In patients with metachronous liver metastases, prognostic factors associated with an improved outcome were the general biological status of the patient, grade of tumoural differentiation and absence of other abdomino-pelvic recurrences. In multivariate analysis, only the grade of differentiation was statistically significant. In conclusion, hepatic resection for liver metastases from cervical cancer can be performed safely, may prove effective, and should be part of the multimodal treatment.
