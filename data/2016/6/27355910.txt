Objectives:A number of new hepatitis C virus (HCV) medications have become available in the United States, but little is known about how these treatments have been adopted into practice and their financial burden on patients. The aim of this study was to examine whether the introduction of new HCV medications was associated with changes in treatment rates and out-of-pocket (OOP) costs.Study design:Retrospective analysis of administrative claims data from Optum Labs Data Warehouse.Methods:We performed a retrospective analysis using a large, US commercial insurance database to identify 56,116 adults with chronic HCV between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014. Logistic regression was performed to calculate patients' predicted probability of being treated before and after the new medications became available.Results:A total of 5436 (9.7%) of patients with HCV received treatment during an average of 1.8 years of follow-up. In the last quarter of 2014, 0.1% of patients with HCV received interferon/ribavirin as the primary treatment; no one received boceprevir or telaprevir, 1.1% received sofosbuvir combined with simeprevir, 1.4% received sofosbuvir or simeprevir alone, and 2.0% received ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. The introduction of new medications was significantly associated with an increased treatment rate, from 5.4% to 6.8% (P < .001). The increase was high among elderly patients and patients with liver transplant, liver cancer, and liver disease or cirrhosis. The median OOP costs of patients receiving new regimens were relatively low ($112-$340), but great variations existed.Conclusions:At the end of 2014, patients were almost exclusively using new therapies, which was associated with increased treatment rate, especially among patients who may need urgent treatment but are intolerant or ineligible for interferon-based regimens.
