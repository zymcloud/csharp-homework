Wilson disease is caused by the accumulation of copper in the liver, brain or other organs, due to the mutation in ATP7B gene, which encodes protein that helps in excretion of copper in the bile canaliculus. Clinical presentation varies from asymptomatic elevation of transaminases to cirrhosis with decompensation. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a known complication of cirrhosis, but a rare occurrence in Wilson disease. We present a case of neurological Wilson disease, who later developed decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
