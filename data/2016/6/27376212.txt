A45-year previously known hypertensive lady presented with 2-year history of upper abdominal pain, heaviness, and weight loss. Her radiological assessment suggested the possibility of hepatoma or liver metastases. Considering her age, overall good health and absence of cirrhosis, a liver biopsy was taken which showed hepatic epithelioidhaemangioendothelioma (HEHE), a rare and unusual intermediate grade vascular tumor which can easily be confused with hepatoma or metastatic liver disease. To the best of their knowledge, the authors are most probably reporting the first ever case of HEHE from Pakistan with special emphasis on its clinical presentations, clinico-radiological diagnostic clues, and the management options in the light of the limited retrospective studies.
