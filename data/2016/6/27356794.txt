Objective:To compare the therapeutic effect of portal vein stenting and endovascular implantation of iodine-125 seeds strand followed by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization combined with or without sorafenib in patients for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with main portal vein tumor thrombus (MPVTT).Methods:A total of 53 patients with HCC complicated by MPVTT who received portal vein stenting and endovascular implantation of iodine-125 seeds strand followed by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization combined without (group A, n=38) or with (group B, n=15) sorafenib in Affiliated Yancheng Hospital of Southeast University Medical College during January 2010 and August 2015 were analyzed retropectively.Overal survival, progress free survival and procedure-related adverse event were compared between the two groups.Results:The technical success rate was 100% for placement of (125)I seeds strand and stent in the obstructed main portal vein.No serious procedure-related adverse events occurred. Median survival time of group A and B were 12.1 and 14.8 months, respectively (P=0.037). Additionally, Median progress free survival time of group A and B were 2.8 and 4.0 months, respectively (P=0.002).Conclusions:Endovascular implantation of iodine-125 seeds strand and portal vein stenting followed by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization combined with sorafenib could improve the survival time, the progress free survival time of patients with HCC complicated by MPVTT.
