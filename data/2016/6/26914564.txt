Diagnosis of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is sometimes challenging, especially when extrahepatic disease is present. Here, we report on a 49-year-old woman with a history of HCC who was referred to our institution with suspicion of tumor recurrence for further workup. Combined F-choline PET/CT revealed a soft tissue mass at the right thoracic wall highly consistent with HCC.
