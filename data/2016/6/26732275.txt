Background:Infiltrating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by a difficult diagnosis, dismal prognosis, and limited therapeutic options. We describe long-term results of percutaneous treatment of infiltrative HCC, i.e., multibipolar radiofrequency ablation (mbpRFA) and percutaneous intra-arterial ethanol injection (PIAEI).Methods:All cirrhotic patients with localized (up to two segments) infiltrating HCC treated by mbpRFA or PIAEI between 2002 and 2012 were included. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox univariate followed by multivariate analyses.Results:Fifty-one patients were considered eligible for mbpRFA (n = 20) or PIAEI (n = 31). Cirrhosis etiologies were alcohol (67 %), hepatitis C (33 %), hepatitis B (16 %), and/or NASH (16 %). HCC were multinodular in 31 % of cases, with a median main tumor size of 60 mm (range 30-200) and macrovascular invasion in 59 % of cases. The median serum level of alphafetoprotein was 125 ng/ml (range 2-215,000). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 58 %, mainly postablation syndrome (31 %), and one death (2 %). Median overall survival was 18.3 months, with 63, 35, 20, and 12 % survival at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively. Baseline serum bilirubin >normal [hazard ratio (HR) 2.98; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.38-6.50; P = 0.0057] and tumor burden >70 mm (HR 1.02; 95 % CI 1.003-1.04; P = 0.0221) were associated with poorer overall survival. The radiological response using mRECIST criteria and an alphafetoprotein decrease 1 month post-procedure was associated with increased overall survival (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.024, respectively).Discussion:Despite its overall poor prognosis, localized infiltrating HCC can be safely treated using percutaneous approaches, with potential survival benefits for these difficult-to-treat patients.
