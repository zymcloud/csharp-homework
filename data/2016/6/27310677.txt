Chronic Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infections can progresses to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The HBV covalently-closed circular DNA cccDNA is a key to HBV persistence, and its degradation can be induced by the cellular deaminase APOBEC3. This study aimed to measure the distribution of intrahepatic cccDNA levels and evaluate the association between levels of cccDNA and APOBEC3 in HCC patients. Among 49 HCC patients, 35 matched cancerous and contiguous noncancerous liver tissues had detectable cccDNA, and the median intrahepatic cccDNA in the cancerous tissues (CT) was significantly lower than in the contiguous noncancerous tissues (CNCT) (p = 0.0033). RCA (rolling circle amplification), followed by 3D-PCR identified positive amplification in 27 matched HCC patients. Sequence analysis indicated G to A mutations accumulated to higher levels in CT samples compared to CNCT samples, and the dinucleotide context showed preferred editing in the GpA context. Among 7 APOBEC3 genes, APOBEC3B was the only one up-regulated in cancerous tissues both at the transcriptional and protein levels (p
