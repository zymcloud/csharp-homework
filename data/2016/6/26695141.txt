The deregulation of HGF/c-Met signaling is implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and progress of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the epigenetic mechanisms that HGF/c-Met regulates EMT and metastasis of HCC cells are less explored. In this study, we demonstrated that HCC cells express a high level of SUMO/sentrin-specific protease 1 (Senp1) which is induced by HGF/c-Met signals. Lentivirus-mediated small hairpin RNA (shRNA) transduction results in Senp1 silence in HCC cells. Senp1 silence reduces the HGF-induced proliferation and migration of HCC cells. Senp1 inhibition also induces HCC cell apoptosis and growth arrest. Furthermore, Senp1 knockdown inhibits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, with increase of E-cadherin and ZO-1 expression, decrease of fibronectin and N-cadherin expression. The EMT-related transcription factor Zeb1 was SUMO-modified and decreased in Senp1-silenced HCC cells. These results delineate that senp1 might play an important role in the regulation of HGF-induced invasion and migration of HCC cells.
