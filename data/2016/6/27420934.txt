The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of RUNX3 promoter methylation in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among Asians. For this purpose, we performed a comprehensive search of Chinese and English language scientific literature databases using stringent selection criteria; ultimately, we identified relevant studies that specifically assessed the correlation between RUNX3 promoter methylation and HCC. All data was retrieved and analyzed by two independent investigators using the STATA software (version 12.0). Initially, 132 studies (103 in Chinese, 29 in English) were retrieved; 122 were eliminated through a stepwise filtering process. Finally, 10 studies conducted in Asian populations (5 Chinese, 4 Japanese, 1 Korean) fulfilled all the inclusion criteria of our meta-analysis. The studies included 588 HCC patients (641 cancer tissues; 593 adjacent normal tissues) and 184 healthy controls. We observed that RUNX3 promoter methylation was significantly higher in cancer tissues than in adjacent normal tissues (RR = 6.35, 95%CI = 3.62-11.14, P
