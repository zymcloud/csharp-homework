Background:The aim of this retrospective study was to clarify the difference in behavior and outcome after initial hepatectomy between gastric cancer liver metastases (GCLM) and colorectal cancer liver metastases (CCLM).Methods:Data for patients undergoing curative hepatectomy for liver-only metastases from colorectal cancer (n = 193) and gastric cancer (n = 26) performed at single institution with the same criteria regarding the status of liver metastases were reviewed. Post-hepatectomy recurrence pattern, re-resection for recurrence, and three different endpoints were evaluated.Results:There was no significant difference between the GCLM and the CCLM in the incidence of recurrence (69% vs. 63%, P = 0.553) and recurrence-free survival (median, 15.2 months vs. 16.5 months, P = 0.230) following initial hepatectomy for liver metastases. However, the GCLM had a higher frequency of systemic unresectable recurrences than the CCLM. Time to surgical failure (median, 15.2 months vs. 39.7 months, P = 0.006) and overall survival (median, 20.1 months vs. 66.2 months, P < 0.001) were significantly shorter in the GCLM than in the CCLM.Conclusions:GCLM shows more systemic and aggressive oncological behavior than CCLM after curative hepatectomy even when metastases are confined only to the liver at the time of initial hepatectomy.
