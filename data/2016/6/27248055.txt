Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence has steadily increased in the US over the past 30 years. Our understanding of epigenetic regulation in HCC is still limited, especially the impact of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection on aberrant DNA methylation. We performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in 33 fresh frozen tumor samples, including 10 HBV-HCC, 13 HCV-HCC, and 10 non-infected (NIV-HCC) using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Gene expression profiling was also performed using the Illumina whole-genome DASL HT Assay. Biological influences and gene networks of the differentially-methylated (DM) CpG loci were predicted using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Genome-wide methylation analysis identified 7, 26, and 98 DM loci between HBV-HCC vs. HCV-HCC, HBV-HCC vs. NIV-HCC, and HCV-HCC vs. NIV-HCC, respectively, at P
