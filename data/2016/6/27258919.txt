Objective:To evaluate the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic liver resection in obese patients, we compared the operative outcomes between obese and nonobese patients, also between laparoscopic liver resection and open liver resection of obese and nonobese patients.Materials and methods:A total of 86 patients suffering from liver resection in our department from January 2013 to December 2014 were divided into 3 groups: the obese patients group for laparoscopic liver resection, the nonobese patients group for laparoscopic liver resection and the obese patients group for open liver resection. Characteristics and clinic data of 3 groups were studied.Results:Characteristics of patients and clinic data were equivalent between the 3 groups. The groups were well matched in age, sex distribution, and liver function (P>0.05). There were no significant differences in the operative time, estimated blood loss, time to oral intake, and postoperative hospital stay in the 3 groups. Tumor diameter of laparoscopic liver resection groups in obese patients was smaller than open liver resections groups in obese patients (PConclusions:Obesity should not be seen as a contraindication for laparoscopic liver resection, which is a safe and feasible procedure for obese patients.
