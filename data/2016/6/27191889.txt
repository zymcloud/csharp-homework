The prognostic values of IRF-1 and Ki-67 for liver transplantation (LT) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were investigated, as well as the mechanisms of IRF-1 in tumor suppression. Adult orthotropic liver transplantation cases (N = 127) were involved in the analysis. A significant decreased recurrence free survival (RFS) was found in the Ki-67 positive groups. Ki-67, tumor microemboli, the Milan and UCSF criteria were found to be independent risk factors for RFS. In LT for HCC beyond the Milan criteria, a significant decrease in RFS was found in the IRF-1 negative groups. In SK-Hep1 cells, an increase in apoptosis and decrease in autophagy were observed after IFN-γ stimulation, which was accompanied with increasing IRF-1 levels. When IRF-1 siRNA or a caspase inhibitor were used, reductions in LC3-II were diminished or disappeared after IFN-γ stimulation, suggesting that IFN-γ inhibited autophagy via IRF-1 expression and caspase activation. However, after IRF-1 siRNA was introduced, a reduction in LC3-II was found. Thus basic expression of IRF-1 was also necessary for autophagy. IRF-1 may be used as a potential target for HCC treatment based on its capacity to affect apoptosis and autophagy. Ki-67 shows great promise for the prediction of HCC recurrence in LT and can be used as an aid in the selection of LT candidates.
