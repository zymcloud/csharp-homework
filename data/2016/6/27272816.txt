Background/aim:Liver resection is the best treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Hepatic lymph node metastases are considered as extrahepatic disease and represent an unfavorable prognostic factor. However, extrahepatic disease, when resectable, provides no contraindication for surgical therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of hepatic lymph node involvement in our patients' cohort.Patients and methods:Twenty patients submitted to resection for colorectal liver metastases were studied prospectively. Three areas for lymph node dissection were defined and analyzed separately. Lymph nodes were examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry for Pan-Keratin.Results:In average, 5 lymph nodes were harvested per patient. Macroscopic enlargement was not a definite sign for metastatic involvement. No morbidity or mortality was associated with lymphadenectomy. In our patients' collective, no cases of lymph node metastases occurred.Conclusion:There is no evidence of a survival benefit after lymph node dissection in patients with CRC liver metastases in the literature. Systematic lymphadenectomy can, however, provide a prognostic tool to better plan further treatment.
