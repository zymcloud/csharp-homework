Objective:Cancer stem cells play a major role in developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and they are not well identified in in vivo settings. Also, their occurrence and specificity are not well defined in different pathological stages of the tumor. CD133 is a cancer stem cell specific marker which also lacks to specify all the cancer stem cell population and similarly different markers fails to identify cancer stem cells. To overcome this multi marker helps to identify the cancer stem cells with maximum coverage and aids to understand their expression in different pathological stages of HCC.Materials and methods:In this study, we compared the expression of CD133 along with TBRII and ELF using Immunohistochemistry and western blotting technique that probably helps to reveal the nature of cancer stem cells in different pathological stages of HCC.Results:We initially develop CD133 induced tumorigenicity mice with HCC and compared their tissue morphology using histology. The histological data reveal that as tumor progress, the cell proliferative ability increase together with a large nucleus. The Immunohistochemical data against CD133 shows a prominent increase in their expression as tumor progress, but we found out that the tumor suppressor related proteins, TBRII and ELF shows increased expression in primary tumor stages to prevent tumor initiation, but neither of them shows prominent up-regulation in metastasis stages of the tumor.Conclusions:Our results conclude that the tumor suppressor proteins TBRII and ELF shows elevated expression pattern in the primary stage, but in advance stages its expression gets down-regulated and that fails to control metastasis stage.
