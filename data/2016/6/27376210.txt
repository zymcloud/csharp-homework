Aberrant hepatic arterial anatomy poses a challenge for the surgeon during Whipple procedure. Intraoperative injury to the aberrant vasculature results in hemorrhagic or ischemic complications involving the liver and biliary tree. We report a case of replaced right hepatic artery arising from the superior mesenteric artery in a patient with periampullary carcinoma of the pancreas, undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. The aberrant artery was found to be coursing through the pancreatic parenchyma. This is a rare vascular anomaly. Resection of the arterial segment and end-to-end anastomosis was fashioned. Intrapancreatic course of the replaced right hepatic artery is a rare anomaly and is best managed by preoperative identification on radiology and meticulous intra-operative dissection and preservation. However, for an intrapancreatic course, resection and reconstruction may occasionally be required.
