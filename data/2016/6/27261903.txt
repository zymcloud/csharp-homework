Cirrhosis is less frequent in women than in men, in large part due to the lower prevalence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and alcohol use in women. The most common causes of cirrhosis among women are hepatitis C, autoimmune etiologies, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and alcoholic liver disease. For most chronic liver diseases, the risk of progression to cirrhosis and rates of liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma are lower in women than in men. Pregnancy is very infrequent in women with cirrhosis due to reduced fertility, but when it occurs, requires specialized management.
