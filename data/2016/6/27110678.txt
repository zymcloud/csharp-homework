Background:Liver resection (LR) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the best alternative option for increasing the survival of many patients with intermediate or advanced stages of the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging classification. Mini-invasive approach may play a positive role in treating a tumor rising almost exclusively in a diseased liver.Methods:A prospectively collected database was retrospectively reviewed for 167 consecutive patients who underwent LR between 1999 and 2015.Results:A total of 38 LRs were performed from 1999 to 2009 (Period I), and 129 between 2010 and 2015 (Period II). Laparoscopic procedures increased from 5.3% to 38.1%. Not undergoing laparoscopic LR increased length of stay, and Clavien Grade II or worse complications. Ninety-day mortality decreased from 5.2% to 0%, and morbidity did not differ significantly, despite the fact that the most complex patients were in Period II.Conclusions:Mini-invasive approaches allow to safely expand limits of LR for HCC; in particular, laparoscopic approach favors surgical option even in more complex patients without increase the risk of posthepatic liver failure or other postsurgical complications.
