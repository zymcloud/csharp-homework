Background:Portal vein embolization (PVE) is useful to expand the indications of major hepatectomy; however, its oncologic effects are not fully understood. This study aimed to confirm the efficacy of preoperative PVE for hepatocellular carcinoma patients.Study design:Between 2000 and 2012, five hundred and ten patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing right-side hemihepatectomy were enrolled (PVE group, n = 162 and non-PVE group, n = 348). To equalize background factors, one-to-one propensity case-matched analysis and multivariate analysis were performed. Short- and long-term outcomes were evaluated.Results:Propensity score-matched patients, 148 in each group, were selected. The percentage of resected liver volume on admission was significantly greater in the PVE group (60.5% vs 48.3%; p Conclusions:Even though hepatocellular carcinoma patients who underwent preoperative PVE and right-side hemihepatectomy had a significantly larger resected liver volume on admission, they have a comparable long-term prognosis as patients with up front hepatectomy. In addition, PVE might decrease extrahepatic recurrences.
