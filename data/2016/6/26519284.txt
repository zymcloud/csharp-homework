Background:Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) sometimes resembles autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) in its hepatic histology. However, there is lacking data of a comparison of the characteristics between such DILI and DILI without histological findings like AIH.Methods:We enrolled 62 patients with DILI who were diagnosed using the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method, and performed a liver biopsy. These patients were classified into two groups: DILI with histology like AIH (group A, n = 23) and DILI without such histology (group B, n = 39). Sixteen patients of group A could be further classified into two groups: patients with relapse of the liver injury (group C, n = 8) and without relapse (group D, n = 8), after the recovery of the DILI. We compared the clinical and histological findings between group A and B, and group C versus D.Results:Group A was characterized by an older age (p = 0.043), higher immunoglobulin G level (p = 0.017), positive antinuclear antibody status (p = 0.044), and a higher frequency of complementary alternative medicines and Chinese herbal medicines as the causative drug (p = 0.008). There were no significant differences between group C and D regarding the clinical data and liver histological findings.Conclusions:The clinical characteristics of DILI, which showed histological findings similar to AIH, were revealed. In such patients, a liver biopsy is recommended in order to determine the appropriate treatment strategy. In DILI with histology like AIH patients, long-term follow-up is needed to perceive the relapse.
