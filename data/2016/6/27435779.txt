Objective:To investigate the expression of microRNA-107 (miR-107) and its functional role in hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC).Methods:The gene chip data of HCC obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were used to analyze the expression levels of miR-107 in liver cancer. Twenty-two pairs of fresh surgical specimens of HCC and adjacent tissues and 53 paraffin-embedded specimens of HCC were examined for miR-107 expression by qRT-PCR. The correlation of the expression levels of miR-107 with the clinicopathologic characteristics of the patients were analyzed. The role of miR-107 in regulating the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells were determined by MTT assay in Huh7 cells transfected with a miR-107 mimic or inhibitor.Results:The expression levels of miR-107 were significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues as compared to the adjacent tissues (PConclusion:The expression of miR-107 is up- regulated in HCC tissues and its expression levels are correlated with HCC cell proliferation, suggesting its role as a potential oncogene in liver cancer.
