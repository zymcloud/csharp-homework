Background & aims:Eradication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) by interferon (IFN)-based therapy has been reported to reduce all-cause mortality rates in patients with chronic HCV infection. However, the impact of HCV eradication on non-liver-related mortality including the causes of death has not been sufficiently investigated in patients with chronic HCV infection.Methods:We enrolled 2743 patients with chronic HCV infection. Causes of death, incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and all-cause mortality including non-liver-related diseases, were analysed.Results:Of these 2743 patients, 587 achieved sustained virological response (SVR) (eradication of HCV) by IFN-based therapy (IFN-SVR), 475 did not (without HCV eradication) (IFN-non-SVR), or 1681 did not receive IFN-based therapy (non-IFN patients) (Cohort 1); of these, 309 were selected from IFN-SVR and non-IFN groups using propensity score matching (Cohort 2).The median follow-up duration was 11.4 years. In Cohort 1 patients, mortality rates from non-liver-related diseases were 71.0% (22/31) in IFN-SVR patients, 34.9% (37/106) in IFN-non-SVR patients and 50.0% (248/496) in non-IFN patients respectively. In Cohort 2 patients, mortality rates from non-liver-related diseases were 72.2% (13/18) in IFN-SVR patients and 46.8% (29/62) in non-IFN patients respectively. The eradication of HCV reduced all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR), 0.265; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.058-0.380) including non-liver-related mortality (HR, 0.439; 95% CI, 0.231-0.834) and the incidence of HCC (HR, 0.275; 95% CI, 0.156-0.448).Conclusions:Eradication of HCV reduced not only liver-related mortality but also non-liver-related mortality in patients with chronic HCV.
