Development of portal vein tumor thrombus deteriorates the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, while surgical treatment can offer a promising prognosis for selected patients. However, the possibility of residual lesions in portal vein after conventional thrombectomy is a main risk factor leading to postoperative recurrence. Therefore, ensuring the complete removal of tumor thrombus during operation is critical to improve prognosis. For the first time, we report here one case of hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus in which cystoscope was successfully applied as a substitute of intravascular endoscope to visualize the cavity of the portal vein. The patient was a 61-year-old man with a 7-cm tumor in the right lobe of the liver, with tumor thrombus invading the right branch and adjacent to the conjunction of the portal vein. After removal of the tumor, the Olympus CYF-VA2 cystoscope was used to check the portal vein from the opening stump of the right branch of the portal vein. In this case, residual thrombus tissue was found near the opening stump and the conjunction of the portal vein. The residual lesion was carefully retrieved from the stump after retraction of the cystoscope. The procedure was repeated until no residual lesion was found. The whole duration time of thrombectomy was 22.5 (15 + 7.5) min. The patient was free from recurrence at 8 months after the procedure. Our work indicated that the cystoscope is a suitable substitute, with a proper size and function to check the portal vein system and ensure the curability of thrombectomy. Although well-designed clinic trails are still needed, this procedure may further improve the postoperative prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus.
