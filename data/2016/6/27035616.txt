Background:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is often persistent and gradually advances from chronic hepatitis to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma is the fifth most common neoplasm.Method of study:the Interferon lambda (IFNL) polymorphisms genotypes (rs8099917, rs12979860 and rs12980275) and the presence of mutations in HCV core protein were analyzed in 59 patients with HCC, and also in 50 cirrhotic patients (without HCC).Results:the rs12980275-AG genotype was associated with HCC on age-adjusted analysis (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.03-5.69, P=0.043). Core substitutions R70Q and L91M were mainly found in genotype 1b isolates. Furthermore, a borderline level of statistical significance association was found among the presence of amino acid Glutamine (Q) in the position 70 and IFNL3 genotype AG (P=0.054).Conclusions:the screening of these polymorphisms and functional studies would be useful in clinical practice for identifying groups at high risk of HCC development.
