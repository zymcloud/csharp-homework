Rare hepatic adenomas are associated with synchronous or metachronous fibrolamellar carcinomas. The morphology of these adenomas has not been well described and they have not been subclassifed using the current molecular classification schema. We examined four hepatic adenomas co-occurring with or preceding a diagnosis of fibrolamellar carcinoma in three patients. On histological examination, three of the adenomas showed the typical morphology of HNF1-α inactivated adenomas, whereas one showed a myxoid adenoma morphology. All of the adenomas were negative for PRKACA rearrangements by Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis. All four of the adenomas showed complete loss or significant reduction of liver fatty acid binding protein (LFABP) expression by immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, the fibrolamellar carcinomas in each case also showed loss of LFABP by immunohistochemistry. One of the fibrolamellar carcinomas was negative for PRKACA rearrangements by FISH, whereas the others were positive. To investigate if LFBAP loss is typical of fibrolamellar carcinomas in general, an additional cohort of tumors was studied (n=19). All 19 fibrolamellar carcinomas showed the expected PRKACA rearrangements and immunostains showed loss of LFABP in each case, consistent with HNF1-α inactivation. To validate this observation, mass spectrometry-based proteomics was performed on tumor-normal pairs of six fibrolamellar carcinomas and showed an average 10-fold reduction in LFABP protein levels, compared with matched normal liver tissue. In conclusion, hepatic adenomas co-occurring with fibrolamellar carcinomas show LFABP loss and are negative for PRKACA rearrangements, indicating they are genetically distinct lesions. These data also demonstrate that LFABP loss, which characterizes HNF1-α inactivation, is a consistent feature of fibrolamellar carcinoma, indicating HNF1-α inactivation is an important event in fibrolamellar carcinoma pathogenesis.
