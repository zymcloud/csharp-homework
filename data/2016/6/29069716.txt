Down-regulation of the miRNA miR-338-3p correlates with the invasive ability of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. However, it is currently unclear whether down-regulation of miR-338-3p induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which may be the underlying mechanism governing HCC invasion. Here, we demonstrate that restoration of miR-338-3p expression via transfection of a miR-338-3p mimic reversed EMT and inhibited the motility and invasiveness of HCC cells. Conversely, silencing of endogenous miR-338-3p expression with a miR-338-3p-specific inhibitor induced EMT and enhanced HCC cell motility. Additionally, Snail1 (an upstream regulatory protein of EMT) and Gli1 (a key transcription factor in the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway) expression was up-regulated in cells treated with the miR-338-3p inhibitor and down-regulated by the miR-338-3p mimic. Further analyses demonstrated that miR-338-3p inhibitor-induced EMT in HCC cells was blocked by treatment with a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Snail1, that the SHH signaling pathway was required for both miR-338-3p inhibitor-induced EMT and up-regulation of Snail1, and that miR-338-3p targeted a sequence within the 3'-untranslated region of N-cadherin mRNA. Notably, miR-338-3p expression was significantly down-regulated in HCC samples from patients with metastases and was associated with poor metastasis-free survival rates. Lastly, correlations between the expression levels of miR-338-3p and E-cadherin, Smoothened (SMO), Gli1, Snail1, N-cadherin, and vimentin were confirmed in HCC xenograft tumors and HCC patient specimens. Our findings suggest that miR-338-3p suppresses EMT and metastasis via both inhibition of the SHH/Gli1 pathway and direct binding of N-cadherin. miR-338-3p is a potential therapeutic target for metastatic HCC.
