JARID2 is crucial for maintenance of pluripotency and differentiation of embryonic stem cells. However, little is known about the role of JARID2 in metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study found that JARID2 expression was significantly higher in HCC tissues than that in adjacent non-tumor liver tissues (ANLTs), and its expression level correlated with HCC metastasis. High JARID2 expression was significantly correlated with multiple tumor nodules, high Edmondson-Steiner grade, microvascular invasion, advanced TNM stage and advanced BCLC stage (all P
