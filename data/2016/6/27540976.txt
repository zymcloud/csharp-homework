Background:BTB/POZ domain-containing protein 7 (BTBD7) is recognized as a regulatory gene that regulates epithelial cell dynamics and branching morphogenesis. It is also reported for regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) molecules and involved in the process of invasion and metastasis of lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Slug is a transcriptional factor of EMT which plays a crucial role in the process of primary salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC). However, the role of BTBD7 in SACC and the correlation with Slug have not been identified. This study investigated the expression of BTBD7 and correlation with Slug, as well as the prognostic significance of BTBD7 in SACC.Methods:The expression of BTBD7 and Slug were examined in ACC-LM and ACC-83 cell lines and immunohistochemically in paraffin embedded tissue specimens from 66 primary SACC patients. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the correlation between BTBD7 expression and Slug expression and the prognostic significance of BTBD7 expression.Results:BTBD7 protein expression was initially verified in ACC-LM and ACC-83 cell lines. The positive rate of BTBD7 expression was 62.1% in SACC to 20% in normal salivary tissues comparatively. BTBD7 expression was significantly correlated with Slug expression in SACC (PConclusions:Positive expression of BTBD7 in SACC could play an important role in the development of cancer and may serve as a favorable predictor for diagnosis and poor prognosis of patients.
