Recent evidence indicates that tetraspanin-8 (TSPAN8) promotes tumor progression and metastasis. In this study, we explored the effects of TSPAN8 and the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis using various HCC cell lines, tissues from 149 HCC patients, and animal models of HCC progression. We showed that elevated expression of TSPAN8 promoted HCC invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo, but did not influence HCC cell proliferation in vitro. Increased TSPAN8 expression in human HCC was predictive of poor survival, and multivariate analyses indicated TSPAN8 expression to be an independent predictor for both postoperative overall survival and relapse-free survival. Importantly, TSPAN8 enhanced HCC invasion and metastasis by increasing ADAM12m expression. We therefore conclude that TSPAN8 and ADAM12m may be useful therapeutic targets for the prevention of HCC progression and metastasis.
