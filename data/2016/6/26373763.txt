Objectives:To determine the different imaging features of intrahepatic mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma (IMCC) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Methods:This retrospective study was institutional review board approved and the requirement for informed consent was waived. Patients who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI with histologically confirmed IMCCs (n = 46) or HCCs (n = 58) were included. Imaging features of IMCCs and HCCs on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI including T2- and T1-weighted, diffusion weighted images, dynamic study and hepatobiliary phase (HBP) images were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify relevant differentiating features between IMCCs and HCCs.Results:Multivariate analysis revealed heterogeneous T2 signal intensity and a hypointense rim on the HBP as suggestive findings of IMCCs and the wash-in and "portal wash-out" enhancement pattern as well as focal T1 high signal intensity foci as indicative of HCCs (all, p Conclusions:Combined interpretation of enhancement characteristics including HBP images, morphologic features, and strict application of the "portal wash-out" pattern helped more accurate discrimination of IMCCs from HCCs.Key points:• Analysis of enhancement characteristics helped accurate discrimination of IMCCs from HCCs. • Wash-out should be determined on the PVP of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. • A hypointense rim on the HBP was a significant finding of IMCCs.
