Aim:To determine the genomic changes in hepatitis B virus (HBV) and evaluate their role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients chronically infected with genotype C HBV.Methods:Two hundred and forty chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients were subjected and followed for a median of 105 mo. HCC was diagnosed in accordance with AASLD guidelines. The whole X, S, basal core promoter (BCP), and precore regions of HBV were sequenced using the direct sequencing method.Results:All of the subjects were infected with genotype C HBV. Out of 240 CHB patients, 25 (10%) had C1653T and 33 (14%) had T1753V mutation in X region; 157 (65%) had A1762T/G1764A mutations in BCP region, 50 (21%) had G1896A mutation in precore region and 67 (28%) had pre-S deletions. HCC occurred in 6 patients (3%). The prevalence of T1753V mutation was significantly higher in patients who developed HCC than in those without HCC. The cumulative occurrence rates of HCC were 5% and 19% at 10 and 15 years, respectively, in patients with T1753V mutant, which were significantly higher than 1% and 1% in those with wild type HBV (P Conclusion:The presence of T1753V mutation in HBV X-gene significantly increases the risk of HCC development in patients chronically infected with genotype C HBV.
