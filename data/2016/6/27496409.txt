Background:Prostate cancer is the second most common malignant tumor (13%) among male subjects in Poland. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of prostate cancer in a group of deceased liver donors.Methods:A total of 784 liver procurement attempts from deceased donors were performed in the Department of General, Transplant and Liver Surgery, Medical University of Warsaw, from January 1, 2012, to April 1, 2015; 700 grafts were actually used in a liver transplant. A retrospective analysis was performed based on these data. Among male donors (n = 486 [62%]), there were 30 (6.2%) cases of a frozen biopsy of the prostate performed before making the decision regarding liver graft utilization.Results:In the group of 30 donors who underwent prostate examination, 3 (10%) were diagnosed as having prostate cancer of a moderate invasive stage. In 2 other cases, fresh frozen section suggested prostate cancer; however, this fact was not confirmed in routine section. liver transplantation was not performed in these cases of suspicion of prostate cancer (5 of 30 [17%]) in the frozen biopsy specimens. The difference between groups of donors with prostate cancer and benign pathology of the prostate gland according to prostate-specific antigen serum concentration (P = .578) or age (P = .730) was not statistically significant.Conclusions:Increased prostate-specific antigen serum concentrations without a diagnosis of prostate cancer in histopathologic examinations should not be an independent contraindication for performing organ transplantation. Nevertheless, for recipient safety, even when prostate cancer is only suspected in the frozen biopsy sample, the procured organ should not be used for transplantation.
