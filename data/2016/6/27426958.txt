Background and study aims:The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene -634 G/C (rs2010963) influences the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There have been no studies on the role of VEGF SNP -634 G/C in chronic liver disease (CLD). The aim of the present study was to analyse the correlation between VEGF SNP -634 and the clinical severity of CLD and HCC.Patients and methods:A cross sectional study was conducted on 182 subjects (46 HCC, 39 liver cirrhotic/LC, 38 chronic hepatitis/CH; and 57 healthy subjects). The study was conducted from 2010 to 2014 at the Dr. Sardjito Hospital Yogyakarta, Indonesia. All subjects submitted blood serum for DNA sequencing examination using primer. The clinical data of CLD and HCC were assessed, and sVEGFR-2 was examined in 149 subjects. All data were analysed using STATA programme 11.0.Results:Significant differences were observed in genotypic frequency (GG/GC/CC) between HCC, LC, CH and healthy subjects (p=0.004), but though no significant differences were observed between the G>G and C>G genotypic frequencies (p=0.337). The frequency of genotype GG was significantly higher than genotype GC or CC in HCC and was associated with declining of clinical conditions (pConclusion:Genotype GG of the VEGF SNP -634 is the dominant genotype in severe CLD and HCC. sVEGFR-2 correlates with the disease severity but is not directly associated with the SNP -634 genotype.
