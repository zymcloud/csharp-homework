BACKGROUND Portal vein thrombus (PVT) has been an absolute contraindication for liver transplantation because of technical difficulties and inadequate vessel graft supply. With recent surgical innovations many difficulties have been overcome and PVT is no longer a contraindication to liver transplantation. MATERIAL AND METHODS From June 2000 to December 2014, 72 patients underwent living donor liver transplantation at Kobe University Hospital, with a focus on the high-grade PVT cases and analysis of modified PV reconstruction technique and clinical course. RESULTS Four recipients (5.6%) developed Yerdel classification grade III PVT and 2 recipients (2.8%) developed grade IV PVT. There were no statistically significant differences between the severity of PVT grades by sex (p=0.77), recipient age (p=0.49), model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (p=0.68), graft-recipient weight ratio (GWRW) (p=0.15), graft type of right or left lobe (p=0.55), original liver disease (p=0.09), or intra-operative bleeding (p=0.21). Four grade III recipients were anastomosed with SMV, and 2 grade IV recipients were anastomosed with coronary vein, both of which were interpositioned with vein grafts. Only 1 recipient had died of hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence by 1.5 years after liver transplantation, and all 5 remaining severe PVT recipients survived. Overall 1- and 5-year survival rates for grade 0, I, and II recipients were 78.8% and 62.4%, respectively; 75.0% and 75.0%, respectively, for grade III recipients; and 100% and 100%, respectively, for grade IV recipients (p=0.54). CONCLUSIONS High-grade PVT had comparable survival without the recurrence of PVT after living donor liver transplantation.
