Background:Pathological changes of uterine adnexa are frequently encountered in patients after solid-organ transplantation. The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of malignancies among recipients operated with the diagnosis of adnexal tumor with or without clinical symptoms.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed data from 146 solid-organ recipients who underwent surgery in the First Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Warsaw, in the years 2000 to 2014. Among them, we identified 80 patients of mean age 40.9 Â± 11.1 years with suspected adnexal tumor. Data on symptoms reported by patients were compared with the results of histopathological examination after surgical treatment.Results:Kidney recipients were 76.2% of the group studied (including 5 women after kidney and pancreas transplantation); the remaining 23.75% of patients were liver recipients (including 1 kidney and liver). The majority of patients (71.25%) reported no clinical symptoms. The remaining 28.75% of patients had clinical complaints, with the most common symptom being abdominal pain (in 60% of patients). Analysis of the results of histopathological examination revealed that in both groups, the most often encountered pathological findings were serous cystadenoma (33.3% and 47% of patients, respectively), endometrial cysts (24.6% and 21.7%, respectively), and functional cysts (22.8% and 17.3%, respectively). None of the asymptomatic patients were diagnosed as malignant, whereas 2 cases (both ovarian and fallopian tube cancer) were diagnosed among women who reported clinical symptoms.Conclusions:Observations of patients after organ transplantation indicate a recurring nature of adnexal changes, resulting in qualification for surgical treatment. The survey results suggest that solid-organ recipients with pathology in the uterine adnexa, with non-suspicious ultrasound image and not reporting clinical symptoms, could safely be subjected to clinical observation providing strict supervision.
