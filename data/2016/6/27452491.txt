Surgical management with radical nephrectomy and thrombectomy has often been performed in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with tumor thrombus infiltrating the inferior vena cava (IVC). We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of IVC resection without venous reconstruction in patients with RCC and IVC thrombus at our institution. Eight patients with right RCC underwent radical nephrectomy and IVC resection superior to the level of the renal vein without venous reconstruction from August 2005 to February 2015. Thoracotomy, liver mobilization, and extracorporeal circulation were performed based on the IVC thrombus level. We assessed surgical outcomes, perioperative complications, and survival. At presentation, four patients had level IIIa IVC thrombus, three had level IIIb IVC thrombus, and one had level IV IVC thrombus. Perioperative imaging showed that three of the four patients who underwent neoadjuvant molecular targeting therapy achieved down-staging of the tumor thrombus level. The median operative time was 406 min, and the median estimated blood loss was 3,135 ml. With regard to IVC resectionassociated perioperative complications, one patient needed extracorporeal circulation with IVC ligation and Pringle maneuver owing to low blood pressure. Another patient underwent temporary hemodialysis for 8 days after surgery. There were no perioperative deaths, and none of the patients required permanent hemodialysis. Three patients survived the mean observation period of 25 months, including one patient with no recurrence. Three patients achieved long-term survival of more than 2 years. IVC resection without venous reconstruction may be a feasible option for patients with RCC and IVC tumor thrombus. Further study is needed to determine the most appropriate candidates for this procedure.
