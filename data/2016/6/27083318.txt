Apelin is an endogenous ligand of the apelin receptor (APJ), a seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor. Apelin/APJ system has a wide tissue distribution in the brain as well as in peripheral organs including heart, lung, vessels, and adipose tissue. Apelin/APJ was involved in regulating cardiac and vascular function, heart development, and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. In this article, we summarize the role of apelin/APJ system on lung cancer, gastroesophageal and colonic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, brain cancer, and tumor neoangiogenesis. Apelin/APJ may be a potential anticancer therapeutic target.
