We report a case of a 27-year-old man diagnosed with the infection of HBV delta in the 8th month of life. The treatment complied with evidence-based medical guidelines, comprising neoadiuvant chemotherapy and surgery. Liver transplantation from a deceased donor followed by chemotherapy was performed when the patient was 16 years 9 months of age because of recurrent HCC tumor. The patient qualified for immunosuppressive treatment (rapamycin, tacrolimus), lamivudine, anti-HBs globulin intravascular infusion, and anti-HBV vaccination as a prophylaxis against reinfection with HBV. In conclusion, this case demonstrates the importance of a postoperative follow-up of patients with HCC, even years after liver transplantation.
