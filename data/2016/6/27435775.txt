Objective:To investigate the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on invasiveness of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro.Methods:HepG2.2.15 cells were exposed to different concentrations of AFB1 and DHA plus AFB1. The cell migration and invasion were assessed using wound-healing and Transwell assay, and flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle changes. The ultrastructural changes of the cells were observed by transmission electron microscopy.Results:Compared with the control group, the cells exposed to2 Âµmol/L AFB1 showed obviously enhanced migration and invasion with decreased cell ratio in G1/G1 phase and increased cell ratio in G2/M phase but no changes in S phase cells; transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of multiple nucleoli and significantly increased mitochondria and Golgi apparatus in the exposed cells. Compared with AFB1-exposed cells, the cells treated with DHA and AFB1 showed decreased migration and invasion abilities, and the G1/G1 phase cells increased and G2/M phase cells decreased significantly; ultrastructurally, the cells contained single nucleoli with decreased mitochondria and vacuolization occurred in the cytoplasm.Conclusion:DHA can significantly inhibit AFB1-induced enhancement of cell migration and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro.
