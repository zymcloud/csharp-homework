In this study, we attempted to develop fruit-based functional juice with anti-inflammatory activity for consumers living under heavy air pollution. At first, four different formulations for functional juice prepared by combining 10 kinds of fruits and other ingredients in various ratios were tested for NAD(P)H: quinoneoxidoreductase 1 (NQO1)-inducing activity in mouse hepatoma Hepa1c1c7 cells. The formulation showing the highest NQO1-inducing activity [named detoxification juice (DJ)] was investigated for its anti-inflammatory activity in a co-culture system of human lung carcinoma A549 cell line and a differentiated human monocytic cell line THP-1. DJ significantly reduced the LPS-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Furthermore, DJ administration suppressed the benzo[a]pyreneinduced elevation of plasma cytokine levels of C57BL/6 mice. However, the protective effect of DJ against inflammation in lung and trachea caused by air pollution needs to be assessed through clinical studies.
