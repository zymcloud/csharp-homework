Introduction:The benefit of by laparoscopic resection for lesions located in postero-superior segments is unclear. The present series aimed at comparing intraoperative and post-operative results in patients undergoing either laparoscopic RPS or laparoscopic RH for colorectal liver metastases located in the right postero-superior segments.Methods:From 2000 to 2015, patients who underwent laparoscopic resection of segment 6 and/or 7 (RPS group) were compared with those with right hepatectomy (RH group) in terms of tumour characteristics, surgical treatment, and short-term outcomes.Results:Among the 177 selected patients, 78 (44.1 %) had laparoscopic RPS and 99 (55.9 %) a laparoscopic RH. Among RPS patients, 26 (33.3 %) underwent anatomical resection of either segment 7, 8 or both. Three (3 %) patients undergoing RH died in the post-operative course and none in the RPS group. Sixty-three (35.5 %) patients experienced post-operative complications, including major complications in 24 (13.5 %) patients. Liver failure (17.1 vs. 0 %, p = 000.1), biliary leakage (6.0 vs. 1.2 %, p = 00.1), intra-abdominal collection (19.1 vs. 2.5 %, p = 000.1), and pulmonary complication (16.1 vs. 1.2 %, p = 000.1) were significantly increased in the RH group.Conclusion:The present series suggests that patients who underwent laparoscopic resection of CRLM located in the postero-superior segments developed significantly less complications than patients undergoing formal RH.
