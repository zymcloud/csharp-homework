Aims:Lenvatinib was recently approved for the treatment of radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC). Here, we characterized the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of lenvatinib and identified intrinsic and extrinsic factors that explain interindividual PK variability in humans.Methods:This population PK analysis used pooled data from 15 clinical studies, including eight phase 1 studies in healthy subjects, four phase 1 studies in patients with solid tumours, two phase 2 studies in patients with thyroid cancer and one phase 3 study in patients with RR-DTC.Results:The final pooled dataset included data from 779 subjects receiving 3.2-32 mg oral lenvatinib, mainly once daily as tablets or capsules. Lenvatinib PK was best described by a three-compartment model with linear elimination. Lenvatinib absorption was best described by simultaneous first- and zero-order absorption. The population mean value for lenvatinib apparent clearance (CL/F) was 6.56 l h(-1) [percent coefficient of variation (%CV) 25.5], and was independent of dose and time. The relative bioavailability of lenvatinib in capsule form was 90% vs. tablets (%CV 30.2). The final PK model included significant but marginal effects of body weight (2.8% of CL/F variation), liver-function markers [alkaline phosphatase (-11.7%) and albumin (-6.3%)] and concomitant cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers (+30%) and inhibitors (-7.8%) on lenvatinib CL/F. Lenvatinib PK was unaffected by pH-elevating agents, dose, age, sex, race, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase or bilirubin levels, or renal function.Conclusions:The significant effects of several covariates on lenvatinib PK variability were small in magnitude, and therefore were not considered clinically relevant, or to warrant any dose adjustment.
