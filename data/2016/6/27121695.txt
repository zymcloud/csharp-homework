DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 20 (DDX20), a member of the DEAD box protein family, encodes an RNA helicase. Previous research has revealed that DDX20 may act as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma and as a tumor promoter in breast cancer. These conflicting reports prompted us to explore the role of DDX20 in prostate cancer (PCa). To gain insight into the functions of DDX20 in PCa, we examined DDX20 expression patterns in a PCa tissue microarray with 99 PCa tissue samples. The results of immunohistochemical staining revealed that DDX20 expression is frequently upregulated in PCa tissues compared with that in the adjacent tissues and further clinicopathological analysis showed that the expression level of DDX20 closely correlates with tumor size, TNM stage (positive correlation) and patient prognosis (negative correlation). Both gain‑of- and loss‑of‑function assays were performed in vitro; the overexpression of DDX20 enhanced the proliferation and metastatic potential of cancer cells and this was examined by performing a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, wound healing assay and Transwell migration assay. Furthermore, we found that there is a positive correlation between the expression of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) and DDX20 expression. These findings led us to examine whether DDX20 may exert effects through the NF‑κB pathway. Luciferase reporter assays suggested that DDX20 altered the activity of NF-κB. Taken together, these findings show that DDX20 may promote the progression of PCa through the NF-κB pathway.
