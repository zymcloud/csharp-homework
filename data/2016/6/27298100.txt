Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complex and heterogeneous malignancy, frequently occurs in the setting of a chronically diseased organ, with multiple confounding factors making its management challenging. HCC represents one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality globally with a rising trend of incidence in some of the developed countries, which indicates the need for better surgical and nonsurgical management strategies.Data sources:PubMed database was searched for relevant articles in English on the issue of HCC management.Results:Surgical resection represents a potentially curative option for appropriate candidates with tumors detected at earlier stages and with well-preserved liver function. The long-term outcome of surgery is impaired by a high rate of recurrence. Surgical approaches are being challenged by local ablative therapies such as radiofrequency ablation and microwave ablation in selected patients. Liver transplantation offers potential cure for HCC and also correction of underlying liver disease, and minimizes the risk of recurrence, but is reserved for patients within a set of criteria proposed for a prudent allocation in the shortage of donor organs. Transcatheter locoregional therapies have become the palliative standard allowing local control for intermediate stage patients with noninvasive multinodular or large HCC who are beyond the potentially curative options. The significant survival benefit with the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib for advanced HCC has shifted the direction of research regarding systemic treatment toward molecular therapies targeting the disregulated pathways of hepatocarcinogenesis. Potential benefit is suggested from simultaneous or sequential multimodal therapies, and optimal combinations are being investigated. Despite the striking progress in preclinical studies of HCC immunotherapy and gene therapy, extensive clinical trials are required to achieve successful clinical applications of these innovative approaches.Conclusion:Treatment decisions have become increasingly complex for HCC with the availability of multiple surgical and nonsurgical therapeutic options and require a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach.
