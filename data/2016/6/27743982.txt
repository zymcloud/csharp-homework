Tumour lysis syndrome is an oncological emergency which is usually seen following chemotherapy for rapidly proliferating haematological malignancies. Spontaneous tumour lysis syndrome is rare in solid tumour and even rarer with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Tumour lysis syndrome in the setting of HCC is usually reported as a consequence of therapeutic interventions like sorafenib administration or trans-arterial chemoembolization. We report about a case of a young lady with chronic hepatitis B related HCC who developed spontaneous tumour lysis syndrome and presented with hypocalcemic tetany. We also compare this case with the previously reported cases of spontaneous tumour lysis syndrome in hepatocellular carcinoma.
