Objective: To explore the prognostic factors of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) after radical resection. Methods: From June 2006 to November 2009, preoperative peripheral blood and the clinicopathological data of 208 patients with HCC after curative resection treated in Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, were collected and analyzed, including 173 male and 35 female patients with mean age of 53 years. Univariate analyses were applied by the Kaplan-Meier method, and then, significant clinical factors were used for further multivariate analyses by Cox proportional hazard regression model.The patients were divided into low- lymphocyte-monocyte ratio(MLR) group(MLRâ‰¤1.2) and high-MLR group(MLR>1.2) according to preoperative MLR. Results: The enrolled 208 patients with median overall survival time for 38 months(1.5-82.2 months), median recurrence-free survival time for 36 months(1.0-82.0 months). Univariate analyses revealed alanine aminotransferase, serum albumin, tumor differentiation, tumor size, TNM stage and clinical stages and MLR might affect the prognosis significantly(all P<0.05), and multiple analyses showed that TNM stage and MLR could influence patients with HCC after radical resection of overall survival time and recurrence-free survival time(all P<0.05). The overall survival time(42.1 months) and recurrence-free survival time(38.1 months) of low-MLR group were longer than high-MLR group(32.7 months and 25.3 months)(both P<0.01). Conclusions: MLR might be associated with prognosis of patients with HCC after curative resection was significantly negative correlation.TNM stage and MLR might be used as an independent prognostic factors for the prognosis of patients with HCC after curative resection.
