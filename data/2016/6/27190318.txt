Background:Sub-Saharan African nations have among the highest rates of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection worldwide, but little is known about HBV infection in African-born persons in the United States.Methods:From October 2011 to July 2013, community-based HBV screenings were conducted targeting persons originating from Africa in New York City. Persons were identified as currently HBV infected (HBsAg positive) or exposed (HBcAb positive).Results:Overall, 955 persons were screened for HBV; the median age was 45 years (interquartile range, 35-54 years) and 75.5% were men. Of these, 919 persons had no history of liver disease, of whom 9.6% (n = 88) had current HBV infection and 73.9% (n = 679) had exposure. In logistic regression, older age (odds ratio [OR], 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], .94-.99; P Conclusions:The high burden of HBV infection among African immigrants in the United States underscores a need for continued screening and linkage to care in this at-risk population.
