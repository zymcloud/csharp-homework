Background:We aimed to find out if there is a correlation between Doppler perfusion index (DPI) and platelet- derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF), which is an angiogenic factor with angiopoietic function, in patients with colorectal carcinoma.Methods:50 colorectal carcinoma patients (22 cases with liver metastases, 28 cases without liver metastases) and 50 healthy controls were assessed with Doppler ultrasound as a preoperative evaluation. PD-ECGF expression in postoperative specimens of the 50 cases with colorectal carcinoma was assayed by immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction methods.Results:The mean DPI value was 0.29 ± 0.05 in patients suffering from colon cancer with hepatic metastases and 0.12 ± 0.03 in the healthy control group. The DPI value was significantly higher in patients with liver metastases (p < 0.05). PD-ECGF expression in patients with colorectal liver metastases was significantly higher than that in the group without liver metastases (p < 0.05). A positive correlation was found between DPI value and PD-ECGF expression in patients with liver metastases (p < 0.05).Conclusions:DPI and PD-ECGF may be valuable factors when screening hepatic metastases in patients with colorectal cancer and serve as practical measurements in postoperative follow-up.
