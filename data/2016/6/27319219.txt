A diblock copolymer of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(γ-benzyl L-glutamate) (PBLG), PEG-PBLG, was synthesized via the ring-opening polymerization of γ-benzyl L-glutamate N-carboxyanhydride (BLG-NCA) using allyl-PEG-NH2 as a macroinitiator. After deprotection of the benzyl groups, N,N-diisopropyl ethylenediamine (DIP) was conjugated to poly(L-glutamic acid) (PGA) blocks as side groups. The pendant DIP groups on the PGA blocks greatly enhance the pH-sensitivity of poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly[N-(N',N'-diisopropylaminoethyl) glutamide] [PEG-PGA(DIP)] micelles, and a higher grafting percentage of DIP favors a faster acid-response. In neutral aqueous solution, the PEG-PGA(DIP) can self-assemble into stable micelles featuring an acid-responsive PGA(DIP) core with the encapsulated anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). In an acidic environment, the hydrophobic-hydrophilic transition of the PGA block leads to the gradual expansion and disassembly of these micelles and, consequently, an accelerated release of DOX. Thus, DOX transported by PEG-PGA(DIP) micelles can be entrapped more efficiently into the nuclei of hepatoma Bel 7402 cells.
