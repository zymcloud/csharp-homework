Introduction:Long lasting hepatocytes damage related to HCV infection stimulates liver fibrosis resulting in cirrhosis, hepatic failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Until 2011 the only therapeutic option was 24-48 weeks of pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin (RBV) with efficacy of 40-70%. New generation of direct-acting antivirals (DAA), available from 2014, can be combined and improve efficacy above 90% with 12 weeks of treatment.Areas covered:In this article we describe the first registered all-oral regimen consisting of three DAA - ombitasvir (OBV), paritaprevir (PTV) and dasabuvir (DSV) that became available in EU in 2015 to cure patients infected with HCV genotype 1 and 4. We performed a literature search focusing on efficacy and safety data from Phase 1-3 clinical studies and few real-world data.Expert opinion:OBV/PTV/r±DSV±RBV provided an opportunity to cure almost all patients including cirrhotics and non-responders to previous therapy. This treatment is currently recommended as a first line regimen. However, there is still a need for real-world data. In coming years this medication will probably be replaced with the next DAA generation with improved characteristics such as a shorter treatment duration, improved safety and resistance profile.
