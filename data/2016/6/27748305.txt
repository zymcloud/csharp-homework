Background & objectives:Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection is well known to induce a spectrum of acute and chronic liver diseases. There has been global decline in the prevalence of hepatitis D infection. The aim of the present study was to know the presence of acute HDV infection among hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive cancer patients.Methods:A total of 5043 samples were subjected for routine testing of HBV, HIV and HCV by ELISA method. Further, 150 HbsAg positive samples were tested for HDV IgM detection by ELISA method.Results:Of the 5043 blood samples tested in the laboratory, 150 (2.97%) were positive for HBsAg. HDV IgM was negative in all HbsAg positive samples.Interpretation & conclusions:Acute infection by HDV (IgM detection) was not present in HBsAg positive cancer patients. Further studies on a large number of patients in different regions are required to confirm our preliminary findings.
