Background:Reports on the long-term oncologic outcomes of laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) compared to open liver resection (OLR) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are rare. The aim of this study was to compare the long-term outcomes of LLR and OLR as a treatment for HCC patients.Patients and methods:A total of 125 patients were included in the study (32 patients underwent LLR and 93 underwent OLR). Data were categorized according to operation methods. The primary endpoints were disease-free survival and overall survival. The secondary endpoints were surgical outcomes of LLR for HCC.Results:Capsular invasion was more frequent in the LLR group (P = .001). The median follow-up period was 48 months (1-188 month). There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding mortality and morbidity. Hospitalization days were shorter in the LLR group (P = .042). Disease-free 5-year survival of HCC was 40.9% and 47.2% in the LLR and OLR group, respectively (P = .376). Overall 5-year survival for HCC was 96.4% and 96.7% for the LLR and OLR group, respectively (P = .748).Conclusion:Our long-term analysis on oncologic aspects confirms the safety of LLR compared to OLR in HCC patients.
