Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. The past 50 years have seen rapid developments in HBV testing. Beginning from traditional serologic tests, the availability of sensitive HBV DNA assays allows a thorough understanding of the virology and natural history of chronic HBV infection. Quantification of hepatitis B surface antigen levels reflects the amount and transcriptional activities of covalently closed circular DNA in the liver and may be used to evaluate the stage of disease and guide antiviral therapy. The natural history of chronic HBV infection is also a manifestation of the interaction between the host and the virus, and recent genomic works have shed light on the host-virus relationship and may provide novel tests in the future. This review highlights recent advances in the application of HBV tests in the management of chronic hepatitis B.
