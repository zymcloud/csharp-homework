Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic disease of unknown origin characterized by the formation of non-caseating granulomas. Thoracic involvement is the most common presentation; however, sarcoidosis can involve almost any other organ. To the best of our knowledge there have been only 10 cases of splenic sarcoidosis reported in the English literature, with no reports of sarcoidosis of an accessory spleen. The present study reports a case of isolated sarcoidosis of an accessory spleen in the greater omentum, which was identified postoperatively in a 44-year-old female. Chest X-ray results were normal. Gastric endoscopy demonstrated an ulcer in the antrum, which was confirmed to be a signet-ring cell carcinoma via biopsy. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed mild thickening of the posterior antrum, and a mass in the inferior pole of the left kidney. Intraoperatively, no masses were detected in the liver and spleen. Moreover, no enlarged lymph nodes were detected in the abdominal cavity, pelvic cavity, mesenteric and para-aorta. Following a radical distal gastrectomy and left radical nephrectomy, postoperative pathology demonstrated signet-ring cell carcinoma in the antrum, left renal clear cell cancer and a red lesion measuring 0.5Ã—0.5 cm in the greater omentum, which was similar to the spleen in the splenic cavity and was regarded as an accessory spleen. Following exclusion of fungi and acid-fast bacilli as causative agents, sarcoidosis of the accessory spleen in the greater omentum was confirmed. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on day 8 postoperation. The patient remained alive after two-year follow-up without sarcoidosis and malignant tumor recurrence. The present case demonstrated that, intraoperatively, comprehensive exploration should be conducted to exclude the accessory spleen, which may also suffer from sarcoidosis.
