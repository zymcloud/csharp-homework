Objective:To determine the role of miR-26a-5p in tumor invasion and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We evaluated miR-26a-5p expression in HCC tissues by quantitative PCR and then analyzed its clinical significance using a Cox regression model. Transwell and nude mouse models were used to examine tumor metastasis in vitro and in vivo, respectively. The relationship between miR-26a-5p and epithelial-mesenchymal transition was also investigated by q-PCR and western blot.Results:Strong downregulation of miR-26a-5p was observed in tumor tissues compared to paired adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, patients with low miR-26a-5p expression had a significantly poorer prognosis than those with high expression. The multivariate analysis indicated that miR-26a-5p expression was an independent prognostic indicator. The experimental transwell model and athymic mouse model revealed that miR-26a-5p depressed tumor metastasis in vitro and in vivo, respectively. In addition, the decreased miR-26a-5p level observed in HCC was associated with reduced E-cadherin expression and upregulation of vimentin, which affects the molecular mechanism of EMT.Conclusion:Downregulation of miR-26a-5p promotes tumor metastasis by targeting EMT and influences the prognosis of HCC patients. Therefore, miR-26a-5p has potential as a new biomarker and therapeutic target.
