Aim:To examine the results of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Ireland over a 14-year period.Methods:Cases of HCC receiving OLT between January 1995 and September 2009 in the Irish Liver Transplant Unit were reviewed from a prospectively maintained database. Outcome measures included overall and recurrence free survival, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and tumour pathological features.Results:On explant pathology, 57 patients had HCC. The median follow-up time was 42.7 mo. The overall 1, 3 and 5 years survival was 87.7%, 72.1% and 72.4%. There was no difference in survival when compared to patients undergoing OLT without malignancy. The tumour recurrence rate was 14%. The Milan criteria were exceeded in 32% of cases but this did not predict overall survival or recurrence. On multivariate analysis pre-operative AFP > 100 ng/mL was an independent risk factor for recurrence (RR = 5.2, CI: 1.1-24.3, P = 0.036).Conclusion:Patients undergoing OLT for HCC had excellent survival even when conventional listing criteria were exceeded. Pre-operative AFP predicts recurrence independent of tumour size and its role in selection criteria should be investigated in larger studies.
