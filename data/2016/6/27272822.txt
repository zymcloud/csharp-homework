Background/aim:We aimed to evaluate the effect of body composition on the outcome of living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:We performed LDLT in 153 patients with HCC and divided the patients into two groups based on skeletal muscle mass-to-visceral fat area ratio (SVR), as assessed by computed tomography (CT) measurement, namely a low-SVR group (n=38) and a not-low SVR group (n=112). We compared surgical outcomes between the two groups.Results:A low SVR was significantly correlated with a higher body mass index and male sex. No differences were found between the two groups in terms of other factors. The patients in the low-SVR group had a significantly poorer prognosis than those in the not-low SVR group in terms of recurrence-free (p=0.01) and overall (p=0.03) survival. The results of the multivariate analysis showed low SVR to be an independent and prognostic indicator for patients with HCC who had undergone LDLT.Conclusion:Pre-transplant body composition measured by CT is a major determinant of prognosis in LDLT for HCC in Japan.
