Aquaglyceroporins (AQPs) are a subset of the aquaporin family, and are permeable to water and glycerol. The aim of the present study was to determine the expression and clinical significance of three AQPs, AQP3, 7 and 9 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Fresh HCC and adjacent non‑tumorous liver tissues were collected from 68 patients diagnosed with HCC. The expression levels of AQP3, 7 and 9 were detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis. The association between the expression of AQPs and clinicopathological parameters of HCC were investigated. Compared with non‑tumorous liver tissue, HCC tissues exhibited a significant (P
