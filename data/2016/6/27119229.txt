The role of HIF-2α in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression pattern and role of HIF-2α in HCC patients. Immunohistochemical staining and western blotting analyses were applied to detect the protein level of HIF-2α in 206 paired HCC and peritumoral tissues. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for overall survival and recurrence-free survival in these patients. The function of HIF-2α was studied in HCC cells and in vivo models. We found that the protein levels of HIF-2α in HCC tissues were lower than in peritumoral tissues, and were negatively correlated with tumor size (P
