Ethnopharmacological relevance:Casearia sylvestris (Salicaceae) is found in South America and presents antiulcerogenic, cytotoxic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antihypertensive activities.Aim of the study:To assess the in vivo and ex vivo antitumor action of a fraction with casearins (FC) and its main component - Casearin X-isolated from C. sylvestris leaves.Materials and methods:Firstly, Sarcoma 180 bearing Swiss mice were treated with FC and Cas X for 7 days. Secondly, BALB/c nude animals received hollow fibers with colon carcinoma (HCT-116) or glioblastoma (SF-295) cells and were treated with FC for 4 days. On 5th day, proliferation was determined by MTT assay.Results:FC 10 and 25mg/kg/day i.p. and 50mg/kg/day oral and Cas X 25mg/kg/day i.p. and 50mg/kg/day oral revealed tumor growth inhibition rates of 35.8, 86.2, 53.7, 90.0 and 65.5% and such tumors demonstrated rare mitoses and coagulation necrosis areas. Similarly, FC reduced multiplying of HCT-116 and SF-295 cells when evaluated by the Hollow Fiber Assay (2.5 and 5mg/kg/day i.p. and 25 and 50mg/kg/day oral), with cell growth inhibition rates ranging from 33.3 to 67.4% (p<0.05). Flow cytometry experiments revealed that FC reduced membrane integrity and induced DNA fragmentation and mitochondrial depolarization (p<0.05).Conclusions:FC and Cas X were efficient antitumor substances against murine and human cancer cells and caused reversible morphological changes in liver, kidneys and spleens, emphasizing clerodane diterpenes as an emerging class of anticancer molecules.
