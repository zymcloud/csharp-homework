Aim:This study aimed to compare multipolar radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with monopolar RFA as the major treatment for nodules of hepatocellular carcinoma in the caudate lobe.Methods:This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. Data were reviewed from 101 patients who met the Milan criteria and were treated by multipolar RFA (n = 22) or monopolar RFA (n = 79). After propensity score matching, complications and local tumor progression were compared between the two groups.Results:Before propensity score matching (n = 101), the 2-year relapse-free survival rates for multipolar and monopolar RFA (65.1% vs. 38.8%, respectively; P = 0.064) and the local tumor progression rate (12.5% vs. 14.9%, respectively; P = 0.313) were not significantly different. There were no significant differences between the two RFA techniques by treatment efficacy of transcatheter hepatic arterial embolization, location of tumor, and puncture route. After matching (n = 44), the 2-year relapse-free survival rate for the multipolar and monopolar groups (65.1% vs. 22.7%, respectively; P = 0.004) was significantly different, and the local tumor progression rate (12.5% vs. 22.9%, respectively; P = 0.004) was significantly different. No severe complications occurred in the patients treated by multipolar RFA.Conclusion:Multipolar RFA appears to be a safe and effective method for hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in the caudate lobe.
