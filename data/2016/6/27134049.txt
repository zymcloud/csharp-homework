Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) compose a group of non-protein-coding RNAs - more than 200 nucleotides in length. Recent studies have shown that lncRNAs play important roles in different cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, migration and invasion. Deregulation of lncRNAs has been widely reported in human tumours, in which they are able to function as either oncogenes (on the one hand) or tumour suppressor genes (on the other). Deregulation of CCAT1 (colon cancer-associated transcript-1), an oncogenic lncRNA, has been documented in different types of malignancy, such as gastric cancer, colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. In this regard, enforced expression of CCAT1 exerts potent tumorigenic effects by promoting cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Recent evidence has also shown that CCAT1 may serve as a prognostic cancer biomarker. In this review, we provide an overview of current evidence relating to the role and biological function of CCAT1 in tumour development.
