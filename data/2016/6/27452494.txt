The patient was a 47 year-old female who had autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) with bilateral small renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We performed bilateral partial nephrectomy and radiofrequency ablation to the residual tumor. Pathological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma,Fuhrman grade 3. Sunitinib therapy was started nine months after the operation because multiple liver metastases occurred. Twenty-six months after the operation,she died from rapid progression of liver metastasis.
