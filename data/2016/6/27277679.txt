Our previous study suggested that DJ-1 has a critical role in initiating an inflammatory response, but its role in the liver progenitor cell (LPC) expansion, a process highly dependent on the inflammatory niche, remains elusive. The objective of this study is to determine the role of DJ-1 in LPC expansion. The correlation of DJ-1 expression with LPC markers was examined in the liver of patients with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus (HBV and HCV, respectively) infection, primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), respectively. The role of DJ-1 in LPC expansion and the formation of LPC-associated fibrosis and inflammation was examined in a 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet-induced liver injury murine model. We also determined the ability of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in recruiting macrophages in DJ-1 knockout (KO) mice. The expression levels of DJ-1 were upregulated in the liver of HBV, HCV, PBC and PSC patients and DDC-fed mice. Additionally, DJ-1 expression was positively correlated with LPC proliferation in patients with liver injury and mice with DDC exposure. DJ-1 has no direct effect on LPC proliferation. Reduced activation of HSCs and collagen deposition were observed in DJ-1 KO mice. Furthermore, infiltrated CD11b(+)Gr-1(low) macrophages and pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6, TNF-Î±) were attenuated in DJ-1 KO mice. Mechanistically, we found that HSCs isolated from DJ-1 KO mice had decreased secretion of macrophage-mobilizing chemokines, such as CCL2 and CX3CL1, resulting in impaired macrophage infiltration. DJ-1 positively correlates with LPC expansion during liver injury. DJ-1 deficiency negatively regulates LPC proliferation by impairing the formation of LPC-associated fibrosis and inflammatory niches.
