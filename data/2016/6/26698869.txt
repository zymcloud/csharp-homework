T-complex protein 10A homolog 2 (TCP10L) was previously demonstrated to be a potential tumor suppressor in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, little is known about the molecular mechanism. MAX dimerization protein 1 (MAD1) is a key transcription suppressor that is involved in regulating cell cycle progression and Myc-mediated cell transformation. In this study, we identified MAD1 as a novel TCP10L-interacting protein. The interaction depends on the leucine zipper domain of both TCP10L and MAD1. TCP10L, but not the interaction-deficient TCP10L mutant, synergizes with MAD1 in transcriptional repression, cell cycle G1 arrest and cell growth suppression. Mechanistic exploration further revealed that TCP10L is able to stabilize intracellular MAD1 protein level. Consistently, the MAD1-interaction-deficient TCP10L mutant exerts no effect on stabilizing the MAD1 protein. Taken together, our results strongly indicate that TCP10L stabilizes MAD1 protein level through direct interaction, and they cooperatively regulate cell cycle progression.
