Nowadays, the trend is to perform surgeries with "scarless" incisions. In light of this, the single-port laparoscopic surgery (SPLS) technique is rapidly becoming widespread due to its lack of invasiveness and its cosmetic advantages, as the only entry point is usually hidden in the umbilicus. The interest in "scarless" liver resections did not grow as rapidly as the interest in other scarless surgeries. Hepatopancreatobiliary surgeons are reluctant to operate a malignant lesion through a narrow incision with limited exposure. There are concerns over adverse oncological outcomes for single-port laparoscopic liver resections (SPL-LR) for hepatocellular carcinoma or metastatic colorectal cancer. In addition, getting familiar with using the operating instruments through a narrow incision with limited exposure is very challenging. In this article, we reviewed the published literature to describe history, indications, contraindications, ideal patients for new beginners, technical difficulty, advantages, disadvantages, oncological concern and the future of SPL-LR.
