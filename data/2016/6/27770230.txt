Objectives:To examine the added value of considering smooth hypointense rim in the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI as capsule appearance for diagnosing tumour capsules and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 377 hepatic lesions (330 HCCs, 35 non-HCC malignancies and 12 benign) were included from 345 patients who underwent resection after MRI between January 2008 and December 2011. Two radiologists assessed the presence or absence of conventional capsule appearance and smooth hypointense rim in the HBP, and categorized each hepatic lesion according to the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System. Difference in diagnostic performance was evaluated using the generalized estimating equation method.Results:For identifying capsule, the sensitivity and accuracy of HBP hypointense rim were significantly higher than those of conventional capsule appearance (81.5 % vs. 57.8 % and 76.1 % vs. 59.4 %, respectively; P Conclusions:Regarding smooth hypointense rim in the HBP as capsule appearance could improve the detection of tumour capsule and the diagnosis of HCC.Key points:• Identifying tumour capsule is important for diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). • Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI provides hepatobiliary phase (HBP) images. • Smooth hypointense rim seen in HBP may represent tumour capsule. • Regarding smooth hypointense rim as capsule appearance may improve HCC diagnosis.
