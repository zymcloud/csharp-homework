Background and purpose:To compare the difference of liver sparing and dose escalation between three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and helical tomotherapy (HT) for hepatocellular carcinoma.Patients and methods:Sixteen unresectable HCC patients were enrolled in this study. First, some evaluation factors of 3DCRT, IMRT, and HT plans were calculated with prescription dose at 50 Gy/25 fractions. Then, the doses were increased using HT or IMRT independently until either the plans reached 70 Gy or any normal tissue reached the dose limit according to quantitative analysis of normal tissue effects in the clinic criteria.Results:The conformal index of 3DCRT was lower than that of IMRT (P IMRT > HT (PConclusion:HT may provide significantly better liver sparing and allow more patients to achieve higher prescription dose in HCC radiotherapy.
