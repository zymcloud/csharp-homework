Aims:Pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma are two of the most aggressive types of cancer with limited therapeutic options in stages of advanced disease. Our objective is to assess the safety and feasibility of injecting iron oxide nanoparticles (IONs) via endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guidance, both systemically and locally in the liver and pancreas in order to study new potential therapies for liver and pancreatic tumors.Material and methods:Six domestic pigs were used for our study design, and divided into three groups: two were injected in the portal vein, and other four were subjected to local exposure of IONs in the liver and pancreas, two each. The pigs were on a 7 days follow-up and necropsy was performed with their organs harvested. A 3T MRI scan was also performed.Results:All animals underwent an endoscopic ultrasound fine needle injection (EUS-FNI) procedure without any complications. EUS-FNI procedure had an average time of 5 minutes and 21 seconds and consisted of 2 ml of ION injection. No perforations and no risk of potential bleeding were recorded. Macroscopic changes were observed only after pancreatic EUS-FNI. A significant amount of IONs was observed in the liver after local injection and after vascular EUS-FNI. The imaging results were confirmed by pathological examination with most of the IONs accumulated in Ito-like cells, Kupfer cells, and sinusoids.Conclusions:IONs have been widely studied for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Their injection through EUS-guidance may develop new diagnosis strategies as well as curative or palliative therapies in pancreatic and liver tumors.
