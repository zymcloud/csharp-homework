Background:Treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) with polymerase inhibitors is key to prevent disease flares and progression toward advanced liver disease. Efficacy and tolerability of newer agents has been reported anecdotally in transplant recipients.Methods:In this prospective, observational study, we assessed outcomes of therapy with tenofovir (TDF), entecavir (ETV), and telbivudine (LdT) in 13 heart transplant recipients (HTR) with CHB.Results:Most patients were hepatitis B e antigen negative, had low baseline hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, and normal aminotransferases. Liver biopsy showed a median fibrosis score of 1.5 (range 0-4). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was Conclusions:This study indicates that newer antivirals are effective and safe in HTR with CHB.
