Hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) is a severe inborn error of metabolism, impacting the tyrosine catabolic pathway with a high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using a HT1 murine model, we investigated the changes in profiles of circulating and hepatic miRNAs. The aim was to determine if plasma miRNAs could be used as non-invasive markers of liver damage in HT1 progression. Plasma and liver miRNAome was determined by deep sequencing after HT1 phenotype was induced. Sequencing analysis revealed deregulation of several miRNAs including let-7/miR-98 family, miR-21 and miR-148a, during manifestation of liver pathology. Three miRNAs (miR-98, miR-200b, miR-409) presenting the highest plasmatic variations among miRNAs found in both plasma and liver and with >1000 reads in at least one plasma sample, were further validated by RT-qPCR. Two of these miRNAs have protein targets involved in HT1 and significant changes in their circulating levels are detectable prior an increase in protein expression of alpha-fetoprotein, the current biomarker for HCC diagnosis. Future assessment of these miRNAs in HT1 patients and their association with liver neoplastic lesions might designate these molecules as potential biomarkers for monitoring HT1 damage progression, improving diagnosis for early HCC detection and the design of novel therapeutic targets.
