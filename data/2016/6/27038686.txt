Purpose:To assess validity of albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade as a predictor of survival in patients undergoing transarterial embolization for hepatocellular carcinoma.Materials and methods:Baseline albumin and bilirubin values of 765 consecutive patients treated with conventional transarterial chemoembolization or yttrium-90 ((90)Y) radioembolization at a single institution were used to determine liver function according to ALBI grade. Survival outcomes were stratified by ALBI grade using Kaplan-Meier and stratified by Child-Pugh (C-P) class and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage. Discriminatory ability was assessed by C-index.Results:For 428 patients receiving (90)Y radioembolization, ALBI grade yielded distinct survival curves (P Conclusions:ALBI grade outperforms C-P class at discriminating survival in patients receiving transarterial chemoembolization or (90)Y radioembolization. ALBI grade is also valuable in patients with moderate liver dysfunction and BCLC B disease.
