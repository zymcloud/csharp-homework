Aim:This study aims to report the outcomes following primary liver resection (PLR) in patients with cirrhosis including stratification according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification.Methods:Patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who had PLR between 2000 and 2013 were examined. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and recurrence rate (RR) were analysed. Management after recurrence was reviewed as well as comparison to a series of 116 patients listed directly for liver transplant.Results:Seventy-one patients underwent PLR. Median follow-up was 40 months. The 1-, 3- and 5-year OS and DFS for the series were 77, 69 and 61 % and 69, 39 and 28 % respectively. Overall recurrence was 59 % (44/71) and only 36 % (15/44) of those patients had a further potentially curative procedure. The 1-3-5-year OS and DFS in the BCLC-A (44 patients) were 86, 78 and 68 % and 78, 48 and 44 % respectively. The RR in BCLC-A was 45 % (20 patients) with half (11 patients) suitable for further treatment with curative intent. The 1-3-5-year OS and DFS in the BCLC-B (17 patients) were 81, 74 and 60 % and 58, 29 and 7 % respectively. The overall RR in BCLC-B was 76 % (13 patients).Conclusion:Recurrence following PLR for HCC in patients with cirrhosis is high with only a third of patients suitable for further potentially curative procedures. For patients with BCLC-A (or within Milan criteria), PLR provided a 68 % 5-year OS with 44 % of them free of disease. Surgery can offer satisfactory OS in carefully selected patients in the BCLC-B stage.
