Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) is a system for interpreting and reporting of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the liver in patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). LI-RADS has been developed to address the limitations of prior imaging-based criteria including the lack of established consensus regarding the exact definitions of imaging features, binary categorization (either definite or not definite HCC), and failure to consider non-HCC malignancies. One of the most important goals of LI-RADS is to facilitate clear communication between all the personnel involved in the diagnosis and treatment of HCC, such as radiologists, hepatologists, surgeons, and pathologists. Therefore, clinicians should also be familiar with LI-RADS. This article reviews the LI-RADS diagnostic algorithm, and the definitions and management implications of LI-RADS categories.
