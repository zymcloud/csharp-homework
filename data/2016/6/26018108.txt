Hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) was evaluated for different drugs to treat hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer (CRC). Combination treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, oxaliplatin and irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI) is effective for CRC. A phase II study was conducted to evaluate concomitant HAI administration of oxaliplatin and intravenous leucovorin, 5-FU and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) for patients with inoperable liver metastasis, which had chemotherapy with oxaliplatin (OX) 85 mg/m(2) HAI plus systemic intravenous chemotherapy [leucovorin 200 mg/m(2), 5-FU 2400 mg/m(2) and irinotecan (IRI) 160 mg/m(2) in 48 hours]. We treated 24 patients. Neutropaenia was the most frequent toxicity. The main HAI-related toxicity was pain. Two patients (8%) obtained complete response and 17 patients (70%) partial response, giving an objective response rate of 78%. Median follow-up was 22.8 months, and median overall and disease-free survival times were 29 and 20 months, respectively. Therefore, OX HAI and intravenous FOLFIRI is feasible and effective in patients with metastatic CRC.
