Aim:To investigate whether an elevated preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) can predict poor survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We retrospectively reviewed 526 patients with HCC who underwent surgery between 2004 and 2011.Results:Preoperative NLR ≥ 2.81 was an independent predictor of poor disease-free survival (DFS, P Conclusion:Preoperative NLR ≥ 2.81 may be an indicator of poor DFS and OS in patients with HCC undergoing surgery. Preoperative NLR ≥ 2.81 may be a good complementary indicator of poor OS when elevated AFP levels provide no prognostic information.
