Background:In Sweden, the most common causes of liver cirrhosis are alcohol overconsumption and hepatitis C. However, recent data on the clinical characteristics of Swedish patients with cirrhosis are scarce.Aims:To determine the incidence, clinical presentation, aetiological spectrum and survival rates of liver cirrhosis in Southern Sweden from 2001 to 2011.Methods:We used population-based medical registries to conduct a cohort study of all patients with liver cirrhosis in the southernmost region of Sweden with a population of 1.17 million. Medical records and histopathology data were reviewed. Patients were classified according to aetiology, and clinical parameters were registered. Patients were followed until death or December 2014.Results:A total of 1317 patients with cirrhosis were identified. The crude annual incidence of cirrhosis was estimated at 14.1/100 000. The most common aetiology was alcohol overconsumption with or without additional causes of cirrhosis (58%) followed by HCV alone (13%) and cryptogenic cirrhosis (12%). At diagnosis, ascites occurred in 43%, variceal bleeding in 6% and overt encephalopathy in 4%. The median follow-up was 4.3 years. The total 1-, 5- and 10-year survival rates were 79%, 47% and 27% respectively. Survival rates were better for women than for men. A 10-year cumulative incidence of transplantation was 7.3%. Mortality was worst for alcoholic cirrhosis with concomitant HCV when adjusted for age and gender.Conclusions:Sweden continues to have a low incidence of cirrhosis compared with other European countries. Mortality varies with gender, aetiology and severity at diagnosis. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis with concomitant HCV infection fare worst.
