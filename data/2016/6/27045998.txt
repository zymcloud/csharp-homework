The specific interaction between bile acids and the bile acids transporters provides a promising way for hepatoma-targeted drug delivery. We synthesized an amphipathic polymer containing cholic acid (CA), the main bile acids in body, and prepared CA-functionalized nanoparticles to target hepatoma cells. Poly-[3-(4-vinylbenzonate)-7, 12-dihydroxy-5-cholan-24-oic acid] (PVBCA) was synthesized by introducing methyl cholate onto polyvinyl benzoate polymer backbone, and was characterized by (1)H-NMR, FT-IR, and GFC. PVBCA can be incorporated onto PLGA nanoparticles surface via the emulsion-solvent evaporation procedure, resulting in the nanoparticles carrying CA moieties on their surface. The binding of CA moieties to the bile acids' transporters on the cell membrane enhances the cellular uptake of the nanoparticles significantly. The SMMC-7721 cell uptake of PVBCA-decorated nanoparticles increases with amount of incorporated PVBCA and is 2- to 2.8-fold higher than that of the normal PLGA nanoparticles. By exclusion of specific endocytosis pathways using chemical inhibitors, we found that the uptake mechanism of PVBCA-decorated nanoparticles was mainly attributed to clathrin-and-caveolae-independent endocytosis, which was distinct from that of PLGA nanoparticles. The present study provides a simple and versatile method for hepatoma-targeted delivery of nanoparticles.
