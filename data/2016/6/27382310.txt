Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a kind of chemokine that plays an important role in the development and progression of many human malignancies. Previous studies have uncovered that polymorphisms in IL-8 is associated with the risk of many cancer types, but the results were inconsistent and inconclusive. In the present study, we aimed to explore the roles of IL-8 polymorphisms (rs2227307, rs2227306, +678T/C, rs1126647, and +1633C/T) and cancer risk through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Potential source of heterogeneity was sought out through sensitivity analysis. Desirable data were extracted and registered into databases. Finally, a total of ten publications comprising of 22 case-control studies, including 4,259 cases and 7,006 controls were ultimately eligible for the meta-analysis. No significant association was uncovered for all the five polymorphisms and the overall cancer risk. However, in the stratification analysis by cancer type, a significantly decreased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma was identified for rs2227306 polymorphism (T vs C: odds ratio [OR] =0.721, 95% confidence interval [CI] =0.567-0.916, Pz =0.007; TT vs CC: OR =0.447, 95% CI =0.274-0.728, Pz =0.001; TT vs TC + CC: OR =0.480, 95% CI =0.304-0.760, Pz =0.002). In conclusion, our data shows that rs2227306 polymorphism plays a protective role in hepatocellular carcinoma risk. Future well-designed studies with a larger sample size are warranted to verify our findings.
