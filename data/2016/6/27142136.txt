Accumulated data to date do not entirely explain the; propensity of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) to cause chronic infections in newborns; failure of antiviral agents to resolve infections or precise mechanism whereby HBV causes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Based on the increased numbers of hepatic stem/progenitor cells (HPCs) present within the neonatal liver, the refractoriness of these cells to the effects of interferons and xenobiotics and their ability to undergo malignant transformation, we hypothesize that HBV infection of HPCs could explain these and perhaps other clinical features of chronic HBV.
