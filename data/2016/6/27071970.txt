Background:Numerous genetic contributors to cardiovascular disease risk have been identified through genome-wide association studies; however, identifying the molecular mechanism underlying these associations is not straightforward. The Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial of rosuvastatin users identified a sub-genome-wide association of rs6924995, a single-nucleotide polymorphism â‰ˆ10 kb downstream of myosin regulatory light chain interacting protein (MYLIP, aka IDOL and inducible degrader of low-density lipoprotein receptor [LDLR]), with LDL cholesterol statin response. Interestingly, although this signal was initially attributed to MYLIP, rs6924995 lies within RP1-13D10.2, an uncharacterized long noncoding RNA.Methods and results:Using simvastatin and sham incubated lymphoblastoid cell lines from participants of the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) simvastatin clinical trial, we found that statin-induced change in RP1-13D10.2 levels differed between cell lines from the tails of the white and black low-density lipoprotein cholesterol response distributions, whereas no difference in MYLIP was observed. RP1-13D10.2 overexpression in Huh7 and HepG2 increased LDLR transcript levels, increased LDL uptake, and decreased media levels of apolipoprotein B. In addition, we found a trend of slight differences in the effects of RP1-13D10.2 overexpression on LDLR transcript levels between hepatoma cells transfected with the rs6924995 A versus G allele and a suggestion of an association between rs6924995 and RP1-10D13.2 expression levels in the CAP lymphoblastoid cell lines. Finally, RP1-13D10.2 expression levels seem to be sterol regulated, consistent with its potential role as a novel lipid regulator.Conclusions:RP1-13D10.2 is a long noncoding RNA that regulates LDLR and may contribute to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol response to statin treatment. These findings highlight the potential role of noncoding RNAs as determinants of interindividual variation in drug response.
