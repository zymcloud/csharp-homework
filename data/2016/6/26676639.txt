Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) has been suggested as a potential diagnostic biomarker for early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its prognostic significance in HCC remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the expression and significance of PCNA in HCC and then analyzed the role of PCNA in clinical outcomes. Our findings show that the expression intensity of PCNA is much higher in HCC tissues than that in paracarcinoma tissues and associated with AFP, albumin, tumor number, clinical grade, vascular invasion, and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (all p
