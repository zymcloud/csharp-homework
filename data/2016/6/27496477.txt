Background:Liver transplantation (LT) outcomes for patients with poorly differentiated (G3) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are unsatisfactory. The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes in patients with poorly differentiated HCC undergoing LT.Patients and methods:There were 192 HCC patients after LT in the Department of General, Transplant and Liver Surgery, Medical University of Warsaw, between January 2001 and April 2014. The study group comprised 24 patients with poorly differentiated tumors.Results:Disease-free survival (DFS) for all patients was 49.5% at 5 years. The 5-year DFS for patients who met the Milan criteria (n = 9, 88.9%) was significantly better compared to those who did not (n = 15, 28.0%, P = .025). Multivariable analysis revealed that only the largest tumor diameter (P = .014) and α-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration (P = .001) were independent risk factors for DFS. The optimal cut-off AFP and tumor size that could distinguish patients with the highest risk were ≥500 ng/mL and ≥3.5 cm, respectively. DFS for patients with AFP Conclusions:Outcomes of patients with poorly differentiated HCC treated with LT can be characterized with acceptable survival when applying criteria based on tumor size
