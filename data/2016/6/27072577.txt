Objectives:The optimal surgical resection method for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) that maximizes both safety and long-term outcome has not yet been determined. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes following peeling off versus en bloc resection for PVTT.Methods:From 2005 to 2012, 252 patients with HCC and type I/II PVTT who underwent hepatic resection were divided into two groups according to whether they received en bloc resection (n = 113) or peeling off resection (n = 139). The clinical outcomes were compared before and after propensity score matching.Results:The propensity model matched 113 patients with en bloc resection for further analyses. After matching, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were significantly increased in the en bloc group compared with the peeling off group (p = 0.011 and p = 0.015). A multivariate analysis indicated that en bloc resection independently improved both OS and DFS (HR = 1.471, 95% CI: 1.071-2.018, p = 0.017 and HR = 1.415, 95% CI: 1.068-1.874, P=0.016). The adverse events were not significantly different between the two groups. However, the peeling off group showed a significantly increased recurrence rate of vascular invasion compared with the en bloc group (23.9% vs. 9.7%, p = 0.005). Similar results were also demonstrated prior to the matched analysis.Conclusions:An en bloc resection is safe and confers a survival advantage compared with a peeling off resection in HCC patients with PVTT; thus, en bloc resection should be recommended as a standard treatment for these patients when possible.
