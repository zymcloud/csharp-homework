TRAIL is a tumor-selective apoptosis-inducing cytokine playing a vital role in the surveillance and elimination of some tumor cells. However, some tumors are resistant to TRAIL treatment. Proteasome inhibitor MG132 exhibits anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties in many tumors. In this study, we demonstrated that proteasome inhibitor MG132 in vitro and in vivo potentiates TRAIL-induced apoptosis in gallbladder carcinoma GBC-SD cells. MG132 was able to inhibit the proliferation of GBC-SD cells and induce apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. The induction of apoptosis by proteasome inhibitor MG132 was mainly through the extrinsic apoptotic pathways of caspase activation such as caspase-8, caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. In addition, this process was also dependent on the upregulation of death receptor 5 (DR5), which promoted TRAIL-induced apoptosis in GBC-SD cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that MG132 possesses anti-gallbladder cancer potential that correlate with regulation of DR5-dependent pathway, and suggest that MG132 may be a promising agent for sensitizing GBC-SD cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
