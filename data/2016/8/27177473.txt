Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is currently still a major cause of cancer-related deaths. Identifying early metastatic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for HCC is of great importance. Emerging evidence suggest that epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) play important roles in tumor metastasis and recurrence. Understanding molecular mechanisms that regulate the EMT process is crucial for improving HCC. In this study, we find Ficolin-2 (FCN2) plays an essential role in metastasis and EMT of HCC. FCN2 expression is downregulated in HCC cells and tissues. Low level of FCN2 in HCCs is correlated with aggressive metastatic features, and would be a prognostic factor for overall disease-free survival of HCC patients. Ectopic expression of FCN2 markedly inhibits HCC cells migration, invasion as well as EMT in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, TGF-β is found contribute to the function of FCN2 in suppressing metastasis and EMT of HCC. Collectively, our data suggest that FCN2 may have prognostic value in HCC metastasis. Additionally, the FCN2/ TGF-β/EMT axis identified in this study provides novel insight into the mechanisms of HCC metastasis, which may facilitate the development of new therapeutics against HCC.
