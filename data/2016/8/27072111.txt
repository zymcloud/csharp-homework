Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors, which is causing the second leading cancer-related death worldwide. With the significant advances of high-throughput protein analysis techniques, the proteomics offered an extremely useful and versatile analytical platform for biomedical researches. In recent years, different proteomic strategies have been widely applied in the various aspects of HCC studies, ranging from screening the early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to in-depth investigating the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this review, we would like to systematically summarize the current applications of proteomics in hepatocellular carcinoma study, and discuss the challenges of applying proteomics in study clinical samples, as well as discuss the possible application of proteomics in precision medicine.Biological significance:In this review, we have systematically summarized the current applications of proteomics in hepatocellular carcinoma study, ranging from screening biomarkers to in-depth investigating the underlying molecular mechanisms. In addition, we have discussed the challenges of applying proteomics in study clinical samples, as well as the possible applications of proteomics in precision medicine. We believe that this review would help readers to be better familiar with the recent progresses of clinical proteomics, especially in the field of hepatocellular carcinoma research.
