Purpose:To define correlations between the pathological grades of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) derived using breath-holding diffusion-weighted imaging (BH-DWI).Methods:We retrospectively evaluated 94 patients (105 lesions) with pathologically proved HCC who underwent hepatic DWI on a 3.0-T MR platform. HCCs were divided into five groups: well-differentiated (n = 10), well-to-moderately differentiated (n = 11), moderately differentiated (n = 51), moderately to poorly differentiated (n = 20), and poorly differentiated (n = 13) groups. The ADCs of carcinomas across different histological grades were compared by one-way analysis of variance. Spearman's rank correlation test was used to analyze correlations between the degree of histopathological differentiation and ADC. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction.Results:The BH technique yielded ADC values that differed significantly by the extent of differentiation (F = 8.392, p Conclusion:ADC values obtained with BH-DWI may be of importance to non-invasively predict HCC tumor differentiation, and the extent of histological HCC differentiation was inversely correlated with ADC values.
