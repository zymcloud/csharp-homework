In this study, an impaired natural killer (NK) cell cytolytic activity in 135 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients parallel to a reduced expression level of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 in NK cells of HCC patients has been revealed. Ectopic expression of miR-486-5p, a direct upstream regulator of IGF-1, restored the endogenous level of IGF-1 in NK cells of HCC patients, thus augmenting its cytolytic activity against Huh7 cells in an opposite manner to the IGF-1 siRNAs. Unorthodoxly, over-expression of miR-486-5p in target hepatocytes resulted in the repression of IGF-1, suppression of Huh7 cells proliferation and viability in a similar pattern to the IGF-1 siRNAs. Therefore, this study highlights a potential role of IGF-1 in modulating cytolytic potential of NK cells of HCC patients. miR-486-5p acts in a cell-specific manner, differentially modulating IGF-1 expression in NK cells and their target hepatocytes with a contemporary inhibitory impact on HCC progression.
