Background:Small hepatocellular carcinoma (sHCC) is a unique variant of HCC that is characterized by small tumor size (maximum tumor diameter â‰¤3 cm) and favorable long-term outcomes. The present study aimed to define clinicopathologic factors that predict survival in patients with sHCC.Methods:The study population consisted of 335 patients who underwent hepatectomy for solitary sHCC between December 1998 and 2010. Prognostic factors were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models.Results:The 5-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 77.7% and 59.9%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that tumor size and vascular invasion had prognostic significance within this relatively selected cohort (P Conclusions:Tumor size and vascular invasion are feasible and useful prognostic factors for sHCC. The proposed prognostic model, based on tumor size and vascular invasion, is informative in predicting survival in sHCC patients undergoing hepatectomy.
