Background:Four tumor markers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), glypican-3 (GPC3), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP), are closely associated with tumor invasion and patient's survival. This study estimated the predictability of preoperative tumor marker levels along with pathological parameters on HCC recurrence after hepatectomy.Methods:A total of 140 patients with HCC who underwent hepatectomy between January 2012 and August 2012 were enrolled. The demographics, clinical and follow-up data were collected and analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with macroscopic vascular invasion (MaVI+) and those without MaVI (MaVI-). The predictive value of tumor markers and clinical parameters were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis.Results:In all patients, tumor size (>8 cm) and MaVI were closely related to HCC recurrence after hepatectomy. For MaVI+ patients, VEGF (>900 pg/mL) was a significant predictor for recurrence (RR=2.421; 95% CI: 1.272-4.606; P=0.007). The 1- and 2-year tumor-free survival rates for MaVI+ patients with VEGF ≤900 pg/mL versus for those with VEGF >900 pg/mL were 51.5% and 17.6% versus 19.0% and 4.8% (P445 mAu/mL and tumor size >8 cm were two independent risk factors for tumor recurrence (RR=2.307, 95% CI: 1.132-4.703, P=0.021; RR=3.150, 95% CI: 1.392-7.127, P=0.006; respectively). The 1- and 2-year tumor-free survival rates for the patients with DCP ≤445 mAu/mL and those with DCP >445 mAu/mL were 90.4% and 70.7% versus 73.2% and 50.5% respectively (P=0.048). The 1- and 2-year tumor-free survival rates for the patients with tumor size ≤8 cm and >8 cm were 83.2% and 62.1% versus 50.0% and 30.0%, respectively (P=0.003).Conclusions:The MaVI+ patients with VEGF ≤900 pg/mL had a relatively high tumor-free survival than those with VEGF >900 pg/mL. In the MaVI- patients, DCP >445 mAu/mL and tumor size >8 cm were predictive factors for postoperative recurrence.
