Therapeutic strategy in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) is based on histological characteristics of the primary tumor (PT), even in case of metastatic disease. Our aim was to compare the tumor grade between PT and their liver metastases (LM) in patients with enteropancreatic NETs. Forty-one patients treated for sporadic NETs (10 pancreatic, 31 intestinal) were included. All presented synchronous (35) or metachronous (6) LM. Tumor grade was evaluated for PT and LM according to the WHO classification, using Ki-67 labeling and mitotic count (MC) evaluated with or without phospho-histone H3 (PPH3). Tumor grade differed between primary and metastatic tumor in 16/41 patients (39 %), with an increase of grade in 13 of them (32 %). The median Ki-67, MC, and PPH3 in metastases were statistically higher than in PT (p = 0.0002, 0.02, and 0.01). In 17 of 65 cases tested with PPH3 (26 %), this antibody was more efficient in assessing the grade compared to the usual MC, and in 2/65 cases compared to the Ki-67. A better correlation was observed between Ki-67 and PPH3 (p = 0.0001) than between Ki-67 and MC without immunohistochemistry. There is a significant difference in tumor grade between primary and metastatic NETs, underlining the necessity of a systematic biopsy on LM for patient management. Moreover, PPH3 appears to be a powerful antibody to assess the MC and the tumor grade much more accurately when associated with Ki-67.
