Background/aims:Evaluation of liver fibrosis in patients infected with hepatitis C virus is highly useful for the diagnosis of the disease as well as therapeutic decision. Our aim was to develop and validate a simple noninvasive score for liver fibrosis staging in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients and compare its performance against three published simple noninvasive indexes.Materials and methods:CHC patients were divided into two groups: an estimated group (n=70) and a validated group (n=52). Liver fibrosis was tested in biopsies using the Metavair score system. CD4 and CD8 count/percentage were assayed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis.Results:The multivariate discriminant analysis selects a function on the basis of absolute values of five biochemical markers: immune fibrosis index (IFI); score=3.07+3.06×CD4/CD8+0.02×α-fetoprotein (U/l)-0.07×alanine aminotransferase ratio-0.005×platelet count (10/l)-1.4×albumin (g/dl). The IFI score produced areas under curve of 0.949, 0.947, and 0.806 for differentiation of all patient categories [significant fibrosis (F2-F4), advanced fibrosis (F3-F4), and cirrhosis (F4)].Conclusion:The IFI score, a novel noninvasive test, can be used easily for the prediction of liver fibrosis stage in CHC patients. Our score was more efficient than aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index, fibrosis index, and fibroQ and more suitable for use in Egyptian hepatitis C virus patients.
