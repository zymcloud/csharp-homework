Quercetin is a natural flavonoid, which has been shown to have anti hepatitis C virus (HCV) properties. However, the exact mechanisms whereby quercetin impacts the HCV life cycle are not fully understood. We assessed the effect of quercetin on different steps of the HCV life cycle in Huh-7.5 cells and primary human hepatocytes (PHH) infected with HCVcc. In both cell types, quercetin significantly decreased i) the viral genome replication; ii) the production of infectious HCV particles and iii) the specific infectivity of the newly produced viral particles (by 85% and 92%, Huh7.5 and PHH respectively). In addition, when applied directly on HCV particles, quercetin reduced their infectivity by 65%, suggesting that it affects the virion integrity. Interestingly, the HCV-induced up-regulation of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) and the typical localization of the HCV core protein to the surface of lipid droplets, known to be mediated by DGAT, were both prevented by quercetin. In conclusion, quercetin appears to have direct and host-mediated antiviral effects against HCV.
