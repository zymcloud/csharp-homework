Background:It has been reported that deregulation or dysfunction of microRNAs (miRNAs) plays an essential part in the hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the contribution and mechanism of microRNA-30a-5p (miR-30a-5p) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains largely unknown. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the clinicopathological role of miR-30a-5p in HCC tissues and explore its potential pathways in this study.Methods:The expression of miR-30a-5p was measured in 95 HCC and adjacent noncancer tissues by real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The relationship between miR-30a-5p expression levels and clinicopathological parameters was also analyzed. Furthermore, the potential target genes of miR-30a-5p were collected via online prediction and literature searching. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were used to identify the possible function of miR-30a-5p in HCC.Results:Compared with adjacent noncancer tissues (2.23±0.77), expression level of miR-30a-5p was significantly lower in HCC tissues (1.26±0.66, PConclusion:In conclusion, this study clarifies that the downregulation of miRNA-30a-5p might play a vital part in the incidence and progression of HCC via targeting various prospective genes and pathways. Future validation is required to further explore the prospective molecular mechanism of miR-30a-5p in HCC.
