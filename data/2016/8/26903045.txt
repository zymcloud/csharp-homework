Background:Repeat hepatectomy (re-hepatectomy) is an effective treatment for patients with intrahepatic recurrence following liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Objective:This study aimed to develop nomograms for predicting prognosis after re-hepatectomy.Methods:The data of 635 patients who underwent re-hepatectomy for recurrent HCC at the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital between 2004 and 2010 were prospectively collected. Multivariable Cox regression analyses based on data obtained before and after re-hepatectomy were performed to select independent predictors of recurrence to death survival (RTDS) which were incorporated into the pre- or post-re-hepatectomy nomograms. Discrimination and calibration of the nomograms were measured using the concordance index (C-index), Kaplan-Meier curves, and calibration plots.Results:The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 96.9, 74.8, and 47.8 %, respectively, and the corresponding RTDS rates were 75.8, 45.7, and 37.6 %, respectively. Tumor size and number at the initial and recurrent stages, time to recurrence from the initial hepatectomy, hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid level and microvascular invasion were selected into the two nomograms. The C-indexes for predicting RTDS were 0.72 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.74] and 0.77 (95 % CI 0.74-0.80) for the pre- or post-re-hepatectomy nomograms, respectively. The calibration curves for the probability of 5-year RTDS after re-hepatectomy showed optimal agreement between the prediction shown in the nomograms and the actual observations. Both nomograms were able to accurately stratify patients into four distinct incremental prognostic subgroups.Conclusion:The proposed nomograms have shown accurate RTDS prediction for patients with intrahepatic recurrent HCC.
