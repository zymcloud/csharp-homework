Purpose:Thermal ablation has emerged as a mainstay therapy for primary and metastatic liver malignancy. Percutaneous thermal ablation is usually performed under CT and/or ultrasound guidance. CT guidance frequently utilizes iodinated contrast for tumor targeting, with additional radiation and contrast required at the end of the procedure to ensure satisfactory ablation margins. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is an imaging technique utilizing microbubble contrast agents to demonstrate blood flow and tissue perfusion. In this study, we performed a retrospective review to assess the utility of CEUS in the immediate post ablation detection of residual tumor.Methods:Sixty-four ablations were retrospectively reviewed. 6/64 ablations (9.4%) had residual tumor on the first follow-up imaging after thermal ablation. There were two groups of patients. Group 1 underwent standard protocol thermal ablation with CT and/or ultrasound guidance. Group 2 not only had thermal ablation with a protocol identical to group 1, but also had CEUS assessment at the conclusion of the procedure to ensure satisfactory ablation zone.Results:The residual tumor rate in group 1 was 16.7% and the residual tumor rate in group 2 was 0%. The difference between the groups was statistically significant with a p value of 0.023. The results suggest that using CEUS assessment immediately after the ablation procedure reduces the rate of residual tumor after thermal ablation.Conclusion:CEUS evaluation at the end of an ablation procedure is a powerful technique providing critical information to the treating interventional radiologist, without additional nephrotoxic contrast or ionizing radiation.
