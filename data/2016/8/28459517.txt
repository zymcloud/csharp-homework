Objective:To research the anti-cancer mechanism of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Fanbaicao (Herba Potentillae Discoloris) oil in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2.Methods:Gas chromatography was used to analyze the components of Fanbaicao (Herba Potentillae Discoloris). We tested the inhibitory effect of Fanbaicao (Herba Potentillae Discoloris) oil on the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 in vitro using 3-(4, 5-Dimet hylt hiazol-2-yl)-2,5-dip henyltetrazolium bromide assays. Fluorescence activating cell sorter analysis was used to examine the levels of apoptosis, and western blot and immunofluorescence were used to detect the expression of p21, p-p21 and CDK4 proteins.Results:Fanbaicao (Herba Potentillae Discoloris) oil contains 45 ingredients, and L-ascorbic acid 2, 6-bispalmitate was the main component and accounted for 44.96% of total drive-off peak area. Other components included (Z)-14-met hyl-8-exadecenal- acetal (8.56%), phytol (7.74%) and lauric acid (6.31% ). Fanbaicao (Herba Potentillae Discoloris) oil treatment reduced the proliferation of HepG2 cells and the half growth inhibition concentration (IC50) was 2.03 mg/mL. Furthermore, we also observed significantly increased HepG2 cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Fanbaicao (Herba Potentillae Discoloris) oil significantly increased the expression of p21 and p-p21 and significantly decreased the expression of CDK4 in HepG2 cells compared with controls (P < 0.01).Conclusion:Our results showed that Fanbaicao (Herba Potentillae Discoloris) oil has anti-cancer activities in HepG2 cells, which is probably related to the upregulation of p21 and p-p21 and downregulation of CDK4 expression.
