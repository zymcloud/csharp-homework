Objective:This meta-analysis aims to analyze the usefulness of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) for post-treatment responses evaluation of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) management.Methods:Literature retrieval in three databases PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library was conducted up to September 2015, with pre-defined criteria. The technical success rate, local tumour recurrence and local tumour progression were the measurement indexes. Cochran's Q test and I(2) were used for heterogeneity detection. Subgroup analyses were performed for complete ablation rate stratified by study designs, contrast agents and post-operative testing time points. Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata(Â®) 12.0 software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).Results:12 studies consisting of 772 patients were included in this study. The CEUS-evaluated success rate of RFA for HCCs was 91%. The proportion of ablative margin Conclusion:The meta-analysis showed that the CEUS-evaluated success rate of RFA for HCCs was 91%. The local tumour recurrence rate and local tumour progression rate were 4% and 8%, respectively.Advances in knowledge:Using meta-analysis, the study provided more reliable assessment of usefulness of CEUS, which could provide guidelines for HCC treatment.
