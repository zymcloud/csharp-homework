Purpose:Few series describe the clinical spectrum of Fusobacterium spp. infections. Among them, fewer discuss F. nucleatum, even though there are many clinical cases.Methods:We performed a retrospective study over 8 years (from 2007 to 2014) in Limoges University Hospital, France, to assess clinical and bacteriological aspects of infections due to F. nucleatum.Results:Eighty-one patients with F. nucleatum positive cultures were included in this study, irrespective of sample origin. Abscesses (n = 43), bacteraemia (n = 18) and bone infections (n = 8) were the most common types of infections, Abscesses were found in various organs (mostly skin, brain, pleura, liver). Co-morbidities were found in 38 patients (47 %) with neoplasia, diabetes, and alcoholism and history of smoking. There were more neoplasms in patients with bacteraemia than in patients with abscesses (p = 0.007). In 51 cases (65.4 %), infection was polymicrobial, either during bacteraemia or abscesses. Main associations were with Streptococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and/or Prevotella spp. The sources of infection, when found, were either dental or gastrointestinal. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, clindamycin and metronidazole.Conclusions:Infections involving F. nucleatum are uncommon and potentially severe, with many abscesses requiring surgery. Bacteraemia was mainly associated with co-morbidities such as cancer. Polymicrobial infections were very common and there is probably interaction and/or synergy between F. nucleatum and some other commensal bacteria to cause infections and abscesses.
