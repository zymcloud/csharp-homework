Background:Little is known about the importance of liver fibrosis and fatty liver in HIV-monoinfected individuals without hepatitis virus co-infection, particularly among the Asian population.Aim:To evaluate prevalence and risk factors for liver fibrosis and fatty liver in Asian HIV-monoinfected individuals.Methods:Eighty asymptomatic HIV-monoinfected individuals (tested negative for HBV/HCV) were compared with 160 matched HIV-uninfected healthy controls. Transient elastography and proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1) H-MRS) were performed to measure liver stiffness and hepatic steatosis respectively. Blood samples were analysed for metabolic profiles and markers of steatohepatitis (e.g. cytokeratin-18).Results:All HIV-infected individuals (mean ± s.d. age 54 ± 11 years, male 93%, Chinese 94%; diagnosis median duration 8 (IQR 4-13 years) were stable on anti-retrovirals (PI-based 58.7%, NNRTI-based 25.0% integrase-inhibitors 16.3%); diabetes, dyslipidaemia, and metabolic syndrome were common. Fatty liver disease was detected in 28.7%. There was significantly higher degree of liver stiffness [4.9 (IQR 4.1-6.2) kPa vs. 4.2 (IQR 3.6-5.0) kPa, P Conclusions:HIV-monoinfected patients are at risk for liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. HIV-related mechanisms and fatty liver disease may play important roles. Screening and intervention to prevent severe outcomes should be considered.
