Background:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the health problems with great burden on the liver that may end with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this work was to assess serum vitamin D level in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease children.Methods:This cross sectional case control study involved 47 patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease selected while recruiting the pediatric hepatology clinics. Their ages ranged from 5-15 years and were compared with 23 healthy age and sex matched children. All involved patients were subjected to careful history taking, clinical examination and for patients and control, anthropometric measures for body mass index (BMI) calculation (plotted on WHO percentile growth charts), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), bilirubin (total and direct), serum albumin, creatinine, triglycerides, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL),low density lipoprotein (LDL), fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin (for calculation of insulin resistance), C reactive protein and serum vitamin D all were assayed. NAFLD was detected by ultrasonography and graded as absent, mild, moderate and severe.Results:Ninety-three percent of NAFLD patients were obese. Significant differences were found between patients and control regarding AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, total and direct bilirubin, serum albumin, creatinine, triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and serum vitamin D levels. Significant negative correlation was found between serum vitamin D level and grades of steatosis.Conclusions:Serum vitamin D level decreases in children with NAFLD. This low serum vitamin D level is associated with higher stages of steatosis but not with BMI.
