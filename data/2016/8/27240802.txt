G2 and S phase-expressed-1 (GTSE1) was recently reported to upregulate in several types of human cancer, based on negatively regulate p53 expression. However, its expression and functional roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown. In this study, GTSE1 was observed to be highly expressed in HCC specimens and cell lines both at messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. Furthermore, high GTSE1 expression was positively associated with tumor size, venous invasion, advanced tumor stage, and short overall survival. Moreover, we generated stable GTSE1 knockdown HCC cell lines to explore the effects of GTSE1 silencing on the growth and invasion of HCC in vitro. In determining the pathway through which GTSE1 regulated cell proliferation and invasion, GTSE1 silencing was found to inhibit AKT phosphorylation and downregulated cell cycle-related protein. In addition, GTSE1 downregulation decreased the growth of xenografts. In conclusion, these results indicated for the first time that overexpression of GTSE1 was involved in the progress of HCC, enhancing proliferation and promoting cell invasion in HCC cells.
