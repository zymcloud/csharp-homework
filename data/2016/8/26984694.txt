Introduction:Prior enterobiliary manipulation confers a high risk for liver abscess formation after hepatic ablation. We aimed to determine if prophylactic antibiotics could prevent post-ablation abscess in patients with a history of hepaticojejunostomy.Materials and methods:This single-institution retrospective study identified 262 patients who underwent 307 percutaneous liver ablation sessions between January 2010 and August 2014. Twelve (4.6 %) patients with prior hepaticojejunostomy were included in this analysis. Ten (83> %) had received an aggressive prophylactic antibiotic regimen consisting of levofloxacin, metronidazole, neomycin, and erythromycin base. Two (16.6 %) had received other antibiotic regimens. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings were used to identify abscess formation and antibiotic-related side effects.Results:Twelve ablation sessions were performed during the period studied. During a mean follow-up period of 440 days (range, 77-1784 days), post-ablation abscesses had developed in 2 (16.6 %) patients, who both received the alternative antibiotic regimens. None of the 10 patients who received the aggressive prophylactic antibiotic regimen developed liver abscess. One of the 10 patients who received the aggressive prophylactic antibiotic regimen developed grade 2 antibiotic-related diarrhea and arthralgia.Conclusion:An aggressive regimen of prophylactic antibiotics may be effective in preventing liver abscess formation after liver ablation in patients with prior hepaticojejunostomy.
