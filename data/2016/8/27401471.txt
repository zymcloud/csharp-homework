Sorafenib is the only drug that demonstrates a survival benefit for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the therapeutic effect of sorafenib is limited, so development of a more effective treatment method and second-line treatments is needed. Since the advent of sorafenib, clinical studies have been conducted with a variety of drugs and treatment methods, mainly with molecular targeted therapy, but almost all trials have ended in failure. The reasons for the difficulty in the development of a novel drug or treatment method include the diversity of mechanisms in the carcinogenesis and development of HCC, as well as the presence of background liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Trials with immune-checkpoint inhibitors, which have an entirely different anti-tumor mechanism from that of molecular targeted drugs or cytotoxic drugs, have recently begun. Based on the results to date, clinical trials are now being conducted with enriched target subjects. In the future, providing more individualized treatment approaches for patients with advanced HCC will be essential.
