Objectives:To analyze the outcome of patients with ampullary cancer who had undergone curative surgery followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy and to identify the prognostic factors for these patientsMethods:: Between January 1991 and August 2006, 71 patients with ampullary cancer underwent curative resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. There were 38 males and 33 females, and median age was 56 years (range, 28 to 77 y). Postoperative radiotherapy was delivered to tumor bed and regional lymph nodes up to 40 to 50 Gy at 2 Gy/fraction; 67 patients also received intravenous 5-fluorouracil as a radiosensitizer. Median follow-up duration was 72 months for survivors.Results:There were 5 isolated locoregional recurrences, 20 isolated distant metastases, and 11 combined locoregional and distant relapses. The 5-year locoregional relapse-free and overall survival rates were 76.2% and 64.5%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, nodal ratio and histologic differentiation were significant prognostic factors for overall survival (P=0.0382 and 0.0331, respectively).Conclusions:Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy after curative resection can achieve a long-term survival rate in patients with ampullary cancer. Nodal ratio and histologic differentiation are independent prognostic factors for these patients.
