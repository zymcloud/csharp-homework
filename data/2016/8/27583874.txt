This prospective cohort study aimed to elucidate the clinical outcome and its related factors of chronic hepatitis C in a hepatitis B-dominant Asian region.From January 2007 to October 2012, 382 patients with chronic hepatitis C without liver cirrhosis were prospectively enrolled at 6 university hospitals, and regularly followed until Apr 2014 to identify the development of liver cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and overall survival.During the median follow-up of 39.0 months (range 18.0-81.0 months), liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and HCC developed in 42 patients (11.0%), 4 patients (1.0%), and 12 patients (3.1%), respectively. The cumulative probability of development of cirrhosis at 3 years and at 5 years was 9.6% and 16.7%, respectively. That of HCC at 3 and 5 years was 1.6% and 4.5%, respectively. The 3-year and 5-year overall survival rate was 99.7% and 96.0%, respectively. Pegylated interferon-based antiviral therapy was undertaken in 237 patients (62.0%) with a sustained virologic response (SVR) rate of 74.3%. The factors related to the overall clinical outcomes were age â‰¥55 years (HR 2.924, P = 0.016), platelet counts
