Background and aim:Vitamin D is implicated in the etiology of several neoplastic diseases, but its relationship with colorectal cancer survival is still unclear. Aim of this study was to determine whether vitamin D levels influence survival outcomes in colorectal cancer liver metastases patients treated with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation.Methods:We measured 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in 143 patients with 215 colorectal liver metastases who underwent radiofrequency ablation between 1999 and 2011 at our institution. The influence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels on overall survival and time to recurrence was evaluated in univariate and multivariate Cox analyses.Results:Median age was 68 years (range 41-85), and median number of nodules was 2 (1-3) with a median maximum diameter of 26 mm (10-48). Median survival was 44 months (36-62), and survival rate was 91.4%, 46.5%, and 42.2% at 1, 4, and 5 years in the whole cohort. Median survival was 65 months (52-74) if 25-hydroxyvitamin D >20 ng/mL and 34 months (24-41) if ≤20 ng/mL (P < 0.001). In the whole cohort, median time to recurrence was 34 months (26-47), 50 months (36-62) in the case of 25-hydroxyvitamin D >20 ng/mL and 24 months (20-32) if ≤20 ng/mL (P < 0.001). Nodule size and 25-hydroxyvitamin D resulted as significant predictors of both overall survival and time to recurrence in multivariate analysis.Conclusions:Our study provides support for the use of 25-hydroxyvitamin D as a new predictor of outcome for colorectal liver metastases patients.
