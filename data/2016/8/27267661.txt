Matrix metalloproteinases are a family of zinc endopeptidases with proteolytic activity against the extracellular matrix components. In particular, two members of this family named Gelatinase A and B, as amply documented in the literature, play a key role in the process of tumor growth/metastasis in breast and hepatocellular carcinoma. Their activity is regulated by Tissue Inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 and -2, which are the physiological inhibitor of Gelatinases A and B respectively. The aim of this review is to determine the current understanding of the clinical and prognostic role of Metalloproteinases-2 and -9 and their inhibitors in the course of breast cancer and liver diseases. Forty-one articles were selected from PubMed by entering the following keywords: liver diseases, breast cancer, MMP-2, TIMP-2; all articles were read and notes were made regarding the number of enrolled patients, pathology, measures, results and these data were used to write this review. Over-expression of both gelatinases is associated with the relapse of disease, metastasis, shorter overall survival in breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma and invasion and progression to tumors in chronic liver diseases, and MMPs/TIMPs ratio could be useful in the follow-up of these patients.
