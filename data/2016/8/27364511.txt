Background:The FIB-4 index is a simple formula for predicting the degree of liver fibrosis. This study aimed to examine the relationship between the preoperative FIB-4 index and liver fibrosis in non-tumor regions of surgical specimens and to investigate whether the FIB-4 index is a useful predictor for long-term outcomes experienced by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after curative resection.Methods:This study retrospectively analyzed 493 HCC patients treated with curative resection. The utility of the FIB-4 index as a predictor of advanced liver fibrosis (F3 or F4) was assessed. The cutoff value for the FIB-4 index was determined using a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and the impact of the FIB-4 index on overall and recurrence-free survival after surgery was evaluated.Results:Advanced liver fibrosis was found in 236 patients (47.9 %). The FIB-4 index was significantly higher for the patients with advanced liver fibrosis than for those without this condition (P Conclusions:The study showed the FIB4-index to be a predictor of background liver fibrosis and long-term outcomes for HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy as their initial treatment.
