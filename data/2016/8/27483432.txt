Sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) is a major mitochondrial NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase and plays a key role in the progression and development of human cancers. Although the prognostic and clinicopathological features of SIRT3 expression in various cancers have been investigated by different research groups, however, inconsistent and opposing results can be observed. In this study, we therefore performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the significance of SIRT3 expression in various cancers. Systematic literature searching was performed in PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Data up to November 2015. Total effect analyses and subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between SIRT3 expression and overall survival, cancer/non-cancer tissues, lymph node metastasis, pathological differentiation, tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, tumor size, and gender, in various cancer patients. Hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to clarify the risk or hazard association. A total of 14 studies comprising 2165 cancer patients were included to assess the association between SIRT3 immunohistochemical expression and overall survival or clinicopathological characteristics. SIRT3 expression was significantly associated with overall survival in gastric cancer (HR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.43-0.89, P = 0.009) and hepatocellular carcinoma patients (HR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.42-0.74, P
