Emodin is an active ingredient derived from root and rhizome of Rheum palmatum L and many studies have reported that it exhibits anticancer effects in a number of human tumors. However, there is little information demonstrating the possible effects of emodin on the proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we show that emodin may inhibit the proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner and induced apoptosis of cells in a concentration-dependent manner after treatment for 24 h. Moreover, we further discovered that the possible molecular mechanisms involved may relate to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathways. Emodin may induce the phosphorylation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 while mildly suppressed the expression of p-c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (p-JNK). However, emodin did not affect the expression of the total (t)-ERK, t-p38 or t-JNK. Furthermore, emodin also suppressed the activation of p-AKT, but not the t-AKT. In vivo, we found that emodin suppressed tumor growth in experimental mice without an obvious change in body weight, which may work through the antiproliferation and apoptosis inducing effects. Moreover, emodin improves the liver and kidney function in mice, revealing that emodin may improve the life quality of the mice with implanted tumors. In conclusion, the above findings indicate that emodin may be a potentially effective and safe drug to induce apoptosis of HCC.
