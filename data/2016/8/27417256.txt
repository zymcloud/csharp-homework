Lariciresinol (LA) is a traditional Chinese medicine possessing anticancer activity, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. The present study explored the effects of LA on human HepG2 cells and the underlying mechanism. Our data indicated that LA inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in S phase, subsequently resulting in apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Using a proteomics approach, eight differentially expressed proteins were identified. Among them, three proteins, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, UDP-glucose 4-epimerase, and annexin A1, were upregulated, while the other five proteins, heat shock protein 27, haptoglobin, tropomodulin-2, tubulin alpha-1A chain, and brain acid soluble protein 1, were downregulated; all of these proteins are involved in cell proliferation, metabolism, cytoskeletal organization, and movement. Network analysis of these proteins suggested that the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC) plays an important role in the mechanism of LA. Western blotting confirmed downregulation of heat shock protein 27 and upregulation of ubiquitin and UBC expression levels in LA-treated cells, consistent with the results of two-dimensional electrophoresis and a STRING software-based analysis. Overall, LA is a multi-target compound with anti-cancer effects potentially related to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This study will increase our understanding of the anticancer mechanisms of LA.
