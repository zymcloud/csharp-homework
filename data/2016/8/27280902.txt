Primary liver carcinosarcoma is a very rare, malignant neoplasm that is concomitantly composed of a mixture of sarcomatous and carcinomatous elements. In the present study, an initial staging FDG PET/CT showed intense FDG uptake in a patient with liver carcinosarcoma composed of hepatocellular carcinoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Two months after surgical resection, a restaging PET/CT showed rapid progression of the disease with abdominal and lung metastases, indicating aggressive feature of the disease. The case shows the importance to repeat a restaging PET/CT at early time after surgery for a patient with liver carcinosarcoma to monitor disease progression.
