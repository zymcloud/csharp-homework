Tazarotene-induced gene 3 (TIG3) was first characterized in tazarotene-treated human keratinocytes and identified as a retinoic acid responder gene, an important mediator of antitumor effects by retinoids. In this study, we aim to investigate the inhibitory effect of TIG3 on the growth of liver cancer and explore its underlying mechanism. Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Hep3B cells were transfected with plasmid GV141 carrying full-length TIG3 complementary DNA (cDNA). The effects of TIG3 on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration were determined in vitro. The suppressor effect of TIG3 on tumor growth was evaluated in vivo in a nude mouse HCC model. We observed that TIG3 expression is decreased in the Hep3B cell line as well as primary HCC tumors, and TIG3 expression inversely correlates with Ki-67 expression. Overexpression of TIG3 suppresses tumor growth in HCC both in vitro and in vivo via ERK1/2 inhibition by promoting apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation and migration. These findings identify TIG3 as an attractive therapeutic target for HCC.
