Prolyl hydroxylase 2 is a key regulator of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha protein, and has previously been implicated as a tumor suppressor in various cancers. However, the function of prolyl hydroxylase 2 in liver cancer has yet to be elucidated. Characterization of prolyl hydroxylase 2 function and related mechanisms in liver cancer may enable the development of targeted therapy. Here we found that prolyl hydroxylase 2 overexpression in human hepatocellular carcinoma cancer cell lines inhibited cell proliferation, while prolyl hydroxylase 2 knockdown enhanced cell proliferation. Further analyses revealed that the prolyl hydroxylase 2-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation was due to a cell cycle arrest at the G1/S transition. Moreover, the block in cell cycle was facilitated by negative regulation of cyclin D1, a process dependent on the hydroxylase activity of prolyl hydroxylase 2. Using an in vivo xenograft mouse model, we found that the overexpression of prolyl hydroxylase 2 led to a reduction in tumor size. Evaluation of paired human liver cancer patient samples revealed that prolyl hydroxylase 2 protein levels were significantly reduced in 6 of the 10 cancer tissues as compared to their respective normal tissue controls. Furthermore, elevated expression of prolyl hydroxylase 2 was associated with significantly prolonged survival in patients with liver cancer. These results suggest that prolyl hydroxylase 2 plays an important tumor suppressive role in liver cancer and may prove to be of prognostic and therapeutic value.
