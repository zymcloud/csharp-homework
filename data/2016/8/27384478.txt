Background and aim:The meta-analysis aimed to quantify and summarize the contribution of serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA load in the carcinogenesis and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Results:Nine independent studies with a total of 1162 cases and 9365 participants on risk of HCC and seventeen studies with 1342 cases and 2891 participants on recurrence of HCC were finally included. The non-liner dose-response association between HBV DNA level and HCC risk was observed, with P value equal to 0.02 for linear test. Compared with 2 log10copies/ml HBV DNA level carriers, the summary relative risk of HCC were 1.65(95% CI: 0.94-2.92) for 4.5 log10copies/ml, 2.20(95% CI: 1.00-4.85) for 5.5 log10copies/ml, 3.06(95% CI: 1.11-8.44) for 6.5 log10copies/ml. Moreover, individuals with high viral load (HBV DNA levels > 105copies/ml) presented significant association with increased risk of HCC recurrence, with the pooled RR of 1.69 (95% CI: 1.49-1.92).Materials and methods:Pertinent studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase and ISI Web of science databases up to January 2016 and by reviewing the references of retrieved articles. The dose-response meta-analysis was precisely performed to calculate the summary relative risks (RRs) by quantizing the association between HBV load and risk of HCC. Besides, the contribution of HBV load on recurrence of HCC was further clarified by general meta-analysis.Conclusions:These findings indicated a non-linear dose-response relationship between serum HBV DNA level and risk of HCC, and confirmed the significant contribution of serum HBV DNA level in the prognosis of HCC.
