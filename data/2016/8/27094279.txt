Sediments are the ultimate sink for many toxic organic contaminants released into aquatic environment. The present study evaluated the toxicity effect of 13 surface sediment samples from Huangpu River and Suzhou River, East China using two-hybrid yeast bioassays for estrogenic and thyroidal effects and H4IIE rat hepatoma cell bioassay for ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity. Toxicity was expressed as 17β-estradiol equivalent (E2-EQ), 3,3',5-triiodothyronine equivalent (T3-EQ), and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) equivalent (TEQ). At the same time, the causality between the observed EROD activity and concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was examined. The results showed that the total estrogenic effects in sediments ranged from 0.06 to 1.21 μg E2-EQ kg(-1) dry weight (dw), the thyroidal effects ranged from 4.68 to 69.9 μg T3-EQ kg(-1) dw, and significantly positive correlations were found between lgT3-EQs and lgE2-EQs. The AhR agonist effects varied from 26.5 to 148.3 ng TEQ kg(-1) dw. Chemical analysis-derived TEQs contributed by PAHs ranged from 13.8 to 66.0 ng kg(-1) dw accounting for 27.2-109.9 % with mean of 48.9 % of TEQbio, indicating that PAHs made important contributions to the EROD effects of sediment extracts from the two rivers. The present study would provide meaningful information for further analysis and risk evaluation for organic pollutants in Huangpu River and Suzhou River.
