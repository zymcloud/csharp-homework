Purpose:Oesophageal cancer is a highly aggressive disease with about 50% of patients presenting with advanced or metastatic disease at initial diagnosis. In this study we assessed combined microwave ablation (MWA) and systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of liver metastases arising from oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).Materials and methods:Between February 2009 and June 2014, OSCC patients who underwent percutaneous MWA + concurrent systemic chemotherapy and systemic chemotherapy alone for liver metastases were enrolled in this study. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were recorded and compared between groups.Results:In total 15 patients with 25 liver metastases who underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous MWA and chemotherapy were enrolled in this study. Technical success was achieved in 96% (24/25) of metastatic liver tumours. No major or minor complications associated with MWA procedures were observed. The median OS and PFS from initial MWA were 13 months and 4 months. The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-year OS rates after MWA were 53.3%, 26.7%, 13.3%, and 13.3%, respectively. The 1- and 2-year PFS rates after MWA were 26.7% and 13.3%. The OS and PFS of the MWA + systemic chemotherapy group were superior than those of patients who received systemic chemotherapy alone (P = 0.011 and 0.030, respectively).Conclusions:Combined MWA with systemic chemotherapy is a feasible, safe and effective treatment for liver metastases from OSCC.
