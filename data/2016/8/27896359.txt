Hepatitis C virus (HCV) represents one of the most common aetiologies of chronic liver disease and causes a major global health burden. Globally an estimated 80 million people are chronically infected, but the majority of whom is still undiagnosed. Prior to the discovery of the virus in 1989 a significant number of patients were exposed and consecutively infected with HCV via contaminated transfusions, as it is a blood-borne disease. Chronic HCV infection pursues a progressive course that ultimately results in the development of cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), if left untreated. The efficiency and tolerability of therapeutical approaches improved considerably with the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAA). The majority of patients treated with the recommended DAA combinations can be cured, which is reflected in achievement of sustained virological response (SVR). This review is intended to provide guidance in the management of patients with chronic hepatitis C, including recommendations for adequate screening, diagnostic procedures, clinical care, treatment and follow-up strategies.
