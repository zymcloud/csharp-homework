Background and objectives:High rates of recurrence have been observed after curative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The main aim of this study was to establish the influence of adjuvant transarterial radioembolization-based I-131 lipiodol on survival and recurrence.Methods:Between 2004 and 2010, 38 patients were treated with adjuvant I-131 lipiodol therapy, at a dosage of 2220 MBq, within 4 months after surgery. This treated cohort was compared to a control cohort consisting of 42 consecutive patients operated prior to the time the I-131 lipiodol treatment became available.Results:Recurrence-free survival in the control and in the I-131 lipiodol cohort was 12.6 and 18.7 months, respectively (HR = 1.871, p = 0.025). At 2 and 5 years, the cumulative incidence of a first recurrence or death was, respectively, 50 % and 61 % in the treated cohort versus 69 % and 74 % in the control cohort. Median overall survival was 55 and 29 months, respectively (p = 0.051). Among patients with a recurrence at 2 years, more patients had already experienced such recurrence at 1 year in the control cohort (70 % vs 33 %, p = 0.014).Conclusions:Adjuvant I-131 lipiodol improves disease-free survival in patients with HCC.
