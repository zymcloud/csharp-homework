Liver metastasis is the primary cause of death for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. To investigate the prognostic value of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) on colorectal liver metastases, quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (quantitative RT-PCR) was performed on 15 lncRNAs in 51 stage IV CRC with liver metastases and 57 stage I/II CRC specimens. The expression levels of four lncRNAs (GAS5, H19, MEG3 and Yiya) were significantly different between liver metastases and primary tumors of stage IV CRC patients. Furthermore, the high expression levels of GAS5 and Yiya were significantly associated with future occurrence of liver metastases in early stage CRC patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the high expression levels of GAS5 or Yiya were correlated with poor prognosis of early stage CRC patients (p = 0.0206 and 0.0005 for GAS5 and Yiya, respectively). Yiya expression was proved to be an independent prognostic indicator of colorectal liver metastases in a multivariate analysis (relative risk = 10.7; p < 0.0001). Our study revealed that GAS5 and Yiya were promising prognostic biomarkers of liver metastases for early stage CRC patients.
