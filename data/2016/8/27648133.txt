This study aimed to investigate the transdifferentiation of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) into cancer-associated mesenchymal stem cells (CA-MSCs) after incubation with condition medium (CM) from liver cancer HepG-2 cells, and the biobehaviors (proliferation and migration) of these CA-MSCs were further evaluated. The supernatant of HepG-2 cells was collected and mixed with equal volume of low glucose DMEM. The resultant medium was used to treat hUCMSCs for 48 h. The expression of CA-MSCs related proteins and miR-221 was detected in cells. The supernatant of induced hUCMSCs was mixed with equal volume of high glucose DMEM, and the resultant medium was used treat HepG-2 cells for 48 h and the proliferation and migration of HepG-2 cells were evaluated. Moreover, HepG-2 cells were co-cultured with hUCMSCs and then the proliferation and migration of HepG-2 cells were assessed. After incubation with the supernatant from HepG-2 cells, hUCMSCs showed significantly elevated expression of vimentin, fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and miR-221. The supernatant of induced hUCMSCs was able to significantly increase the proliferation and migration of HepG-2 cells. Following co-culture, the proliferation and migration of HepG-2 cells increased dramatically. These findings suggest that the supernatant of HepG-2 cells is able to induce the phenotype of CA-MSCs and the supernatant of CA-MSCs may promote the proliferation and migration of HepG-2 cells. These findings provide experimental evidence for the cellular remodeling in tumor microenvironment and the safety of clinical use of hUCMSCs.
