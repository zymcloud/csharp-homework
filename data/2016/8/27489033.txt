Mounting evidence supports a potent inhibitory role of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in tumor carcinogenesis, angiogenesis and metastasis. This meta-analysis was designed to examine the association of three promoter polymorphisms (-592C > A, -819C > T and -1082G > A) in IL-10 gene with the risk for colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Qualification assessment and data collection were completed by two authors independently. The random-effects model using the DerSimonian and Laird method was fitted by the STATA software. Twenty-five articles involving 5933 cases and 9724 controls were meta-analyzed. Overall comparisons of the mutant alleles (-592A, -819T and -1082A) of three promoter polymorphisms with alternative wild alleles failed to reveal any statistical significance for both colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (P > 0.05), and the likelihood of heterogeneity was low (I(2) A polymorphism, a significant risk for colorectal cancer was identified when analysis was restricted to East Asians (odds ratio or OR = 1.41, 95% confidence interval or CI: 1.18-1.68, P A polymorphism in IL-10 gene might be a susceptibility locus for colorectal cancer in East Asians.
