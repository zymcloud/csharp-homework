Aim:The aim of this study was to evaluate the pathological response of locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative concurrent two-drug chemotherapy and intensified radiation therapy (RT) with concomitant boost.Patients and methods:Patients with T4 tumor or local recurrence were included. A trial based on two-stage Simon's design was planned. RT was performed with 3D-conformal technique. The dose to the mesorectum and pelvic lymph nodes was 45 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction). A concomitant boost was delivered to Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) 2 cm margin to a total dose of 55 Gy (2.2 Gy/fraction). The following concurrent chemotherapy was administered: Raltitrexed (3 mg/m(2)) and oxaliplatin (130 mg/m(2)) on days 1, 17, and 35 of RT. Pathological response was evaluated according to the Mandard classification. Toxicities were scored according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 scale.Results:Eighteen patients (median age=64.5 years) were enrolled. The median follow-up was 22 months (range=2-36 months). After chemoradiation treatment, 16 patients underwent surgical resection (seven anterior resections and nine abdominal-perineal amputation); two patients did not undergo surgery due to early metastatic progression or refusal. R0 resection was achieved in all patients who underwent surgery. Five patients had pathological complete response [27.7%; 95% confidence interval (CI)=9.7-53.5%] and two patients showed only microscopic residual disease (11.1%; 95% CI=0.1-34.7%). Mandard grades 1 and 2 were detected in seven patients (38.9%; 95% CI=17.3-64.3%). Acute grade 3 or more toxicity was found in eight patients (44.4%; 95% CI=21.5-69.2%): one leucopenia-neutropenia, one liver, one skin and five cases of gastrointestinal toxicities. No patient had local tumor recurrence. One-, 2- and 3-year cumulative disease-free survival were 93.8%. One-, 2- and 3-year cumulative overall survival were 92.3%.Conclusion:Concurrent chemoradiation with concomitant boost in patients with advanced rectal cancer allows complete or near-complete pathological response in more than 38% of patients. However, severe acute toxicity was reported in more than one-third of patients.
