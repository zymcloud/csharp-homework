Purpose:To evaluate the microvascular distribution of lipiodol-ethanol, the histological change of the tumor lesion, and the status of tumor involution over time in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following transarterial ethanol ablation (TEA), in lesions that showed CT evidence of complete tumor response.Materials and methods:Patients with unresectable HCC were treated (183 patients, 242 lesions) with TEA using lipiodol-ethanol mixture (LEM) mixed in 2:1 ratio by volume and followed with CT at 3-month intervals for a median of 14.1 months. Liver tumors (n = 131) that showed CT evidence of complete tumor response, defined as the absence of any enhancing tumor throughout the follow-up period, were included. The surgical specimens of five patients who subsequently received partial hepatectomy were available for histological assessment. The microvascular distribution of LEM and the degree of tumor necrosis were analyzed. Tumor involution over time was assessed with CT in lesions that showed complete response.Results:Lipid stain revealed lipiodol infiltration throughout arterioles, intratumoral sinusoidal spaces, tumor capsule, and peritumoral portal venules. Complete tumor necrosis (100 %) occurred in all 5 surgical specimens. The median (IQR) percentage tumor volume compared to baseline volumes at 12, 36, and 60 months was 32 % (23.5-52.5 %), 22 % (8-31 %), and 13.5 % (6-21.5 %), respectively.Conclusion:Intrahepatic HCC lesion that showed CT evidence of complete tumor response following TEA is associated with histological evidence of LEM infiltration throughout the intratumoral and peritumoral vasculature and complete tumor necrosis, as well as sustained reduction in tumor volume over time.
