Purpose To assess the long-term outcome in 108 consecutive patients treated with no-touch multibipolar radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that met the Milan criteria. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the ethical review board, and the need to obtain informed consent was waived. Between November 1, 2006, and December 31, 2011, 132 HCC tumors (diameter, 10-45 mm; 39 tumors â‰¥ 30 mm) in 108 consecutive patients (106 with cirrhosis) that met Milan criteria were treated with no-touch multibipolar RFA, which consisted of activating, in bipolar mode, three or four electrodes inserted just beyond the tumor margins. Follow-up was performed every 3 months for 2 years and every 6 months thereafter with computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging. Survival probabilities were computed by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Predictive factors of tumor progression and overall survival were assessed by using the Cox proportional hazard model. Results No technical failure occurred, and complete ablation was achieved for all the nodules. After a median of 40.5 months (range, 2-84 months) of follow-up, 3- and 5-year local and overall tumor progression-free survival were 96%, 94%, 52%, and 32%, respectively. Neither tumor diameter greater than 30 mm nor location abutting a large vessel were associated with local tumor progression. Tumor diameter greater than 30 mm was the only parameter predictive of overall tumor progression (P = .0036). Independent factors associated with shorter overall survival were Child-Pugh class B disease, age greater than 65 years, and platelet count of less than 150 g/L (P
