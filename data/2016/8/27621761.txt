Recurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is very high even after curative surgery, and no postoperative therapies have been definitively shown to prevent HCC recurrence. Sorafenib is proved to be effective for advanced HCC by two large randomized controlled trials in 2008 and 2009. Therefore it stands to reason to expect that adjuvant sorafenib may improve post-surgery outcomes of patients with HCC. However, many questions still exist about the value of sorafenib for patients with HCC after surgery or transarterial chemoembolization. In this editorial, we complehensively reviewed the safety and efficacy of adjuvant sorafenib for patients with hepatocellar carcinoma after surgery or transarterial chemoembolization. We emphasized the positive and negative role of sorafenib.
