The transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) is a key regulator of lipogenesis and insulin sensitivity, and is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Here, we assessed the impact of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SREBF-1c on NAFLD susceptibility and associated metabolic phenotypes in a Han Chinese population. Four common SNPs (rs62064119, rs2297508, rs11868035 and rs13306741) in the SREBP-1c gene were selected and genotyped in 593 patients with NAFLD and 593 healthy controls. Unconditional logistic regression was performed to assess the risk of NAFLD by determining odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). No significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies of these four SNPs were found between the NAFLD population and the controls (all P > 0.05). In addition, we did not find any association between the SREBF-1c SNPs and the clinical and biochemical parameters, such as body mass index, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein-and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol or systolic and diastolic blood pressure, except that the rs2297508 C-allele or rs11868035 G-allele showed significant associations with lower triglyceride levels in control subjects (P < 0.01). Our findings suggested that the four polymorphisms in SREBF-1c gene are not associated with risk of NAFLD in the Chinese Han population.
