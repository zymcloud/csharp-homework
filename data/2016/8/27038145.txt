The purpose of our study was to test the hypothesis that sorafenib-related dermatologic adverse events (AEs) as an early biomarker can predict the long-term outcomes following the combination therapy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus sorafenib (TACE-S). The intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma patients who received either TACE-S or TACE-alone treatment were consecutively included into analysis. In the TACE-S group, patients with â‰¥ grade 2 dermatologic AEs within the first month of sorafenib initiation were defined as responders; whereas those with
biomarker; dermatologic adverse events; hepatocellular carcinoma; sorafenib; transarterial chemoembolization.
