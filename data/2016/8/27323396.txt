It still must be confirmed whether the newly developed Hong Kong Liver Cancer Staging (HKLC) system can effectively stratify patients with multiple tumors and identify patients who could obtain a survival benefit with radical resection. In this study, we retrospectively compared survival rates of surgery versus transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma patients with multiple tumors by using the propensity score method. In addition, the prognostic roles of tumor size, number and thrombus status together with other covariates on postoperative survival were analyzed by multivariate analysis. In matched cohorts, surgical treatment could significantly reduce patient mortality in patients within or outside HKLC criteria (odds ratio (OR) = 0.5, P 5 cm was an independent risk factor of postoperative survival (OR = 1.7, P
