Objective:The aim of this study is to investigate the inhibition of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells by indole-3-carbinol in vitro and in vivo.Method:The human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE2 was treated in different concentrations 0,100,200,300 Î¼mol/L of indole-3-carbinol. Then we detected cell proliferation after 0,24,48 and 72 h, apoptosis after 48 h and the levels of PI3K/Akt pathway-related proteins in vitro. The BALB/c nude mice were divided into three groups: prevention group, treatment group and control group. In vivo, the nude mice in every group were inoculated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells CNE2, and mice in prevention and treatment groups were given feed containing 0.5% indole-3-carbinol. We investigated the tumoricidal effect of I3C in nude mice , and eight weeks later, the PI3K/Akt pathway-related proteins expressions in tumors from nude mice of each group were detected.Result:With the indole-3-carbinol concentration increased, cell proliferation decreased and apoptosis increased significantly.The levels of PI3K/Akt pathway-related proteins were decreased.In animal experiments, the prevention and treatment group developed smaller tumors, and the expression of PI3K/Akt pathway-related proteins in prevention and treatment groups PI3K/Akt pathway also reduced, compared to control group. Meanwhile, nearly no changes of heart, liver and kidney tissues in all groups were seen in HE staining.Conclusion:Indole-3-carbinol inhibited the growth of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells and induced apoptosis effectively in vivo and in vitro. The mechanism might be that indole-3-carbinol could suppress PI3K/Akt pathway.
