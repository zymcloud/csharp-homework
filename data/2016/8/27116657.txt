Goals and background:Spontaneous rupture is a rare complication of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Treatment options consist of transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE), hepatic resection, and conservative therapy. The best approach is under debate.Study:This study presents a review of clinical data of patients with a ruptured HCC admitted to a European tertiary care center.Results:Eleven patients were included; six (55%) had underlying cirrhosis. The majority of patients (73%) had no previous history of HCC. Spontaneous HCC rupture was diagnosed using abdominal computed tomography with or without a diagnostic paracentesis. Computed tomography showed one or two tumors in eight (73%) patients; the other patients had multiple tumors or diffuse infiltrative HCC. Seven (64%) patients were initially treated by TAE and one (9%) patient underwent hepatic resection. The remaining three (27%) patients, all of whom had liver cirrhosis, received conservative therapy. Two patients initially treated by TAE underwent a delayed resection and ultimately received systemic therapy. Overall, at the end of the follow-up period, three patients were still alive at 84, 991, and 1026 days after the initial presentation. Eight (73%) patients had died after a median of 88 days (range 7-417). One year after presentation, none of the conservatively treated patients was alive compared with three out of seven (43%) patients treated with TAE with or without delayed resection.Conclusion:Patients with a spontaneously ruptured HCC have a poor prognosis. In selected patients, however, prolonged survival is possible using TAE as initial therapy with or without a delayed resection and systemic therapy.
