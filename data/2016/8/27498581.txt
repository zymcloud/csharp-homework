Background:The oncogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not clear. The current methods of the pertinent studies are not precise and sensitive. The present study was to use liver cancer cell line to explore the bio-compatibility and cytotoxicity of ternary quantum dots (QDs) probe and to evaluate the possible application of QDs in HCC.Methods:CuInS2-ZnS-AFP fluorescence probe was designed and synthesized to label the liver cancer cell HepG2. The cytotoxicity of CuInS2-ZnS-AFP probe was evaluated by MTT experiments and flow cytometry.Results:The labeling experiments indicated that CuInS2-ZnS QDs conjugated with AFP antibody could enter HepG2 cells effectively and emit intensive yellow fluorescence by ultraviolet excitation without changing cellular morphology. Toxicity tests suggested that the cytotoxicity of CuInS2-ZnS-AFP probe was significantly lower than that of CdTe-ZnS-AFP probe (t test, F=0.8, T=-69.326, P20%) groups (PConclusion:CuInS2-ZnS-AFP QDs probe had better bio-compatibility and lower cytotoxicity compared with CdTe-ZnS-AFP probe, and could be used for imaging the living cells in vitro.
