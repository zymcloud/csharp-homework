The number of cases with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are on the increase. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical effect and relevant mechanism of combined sorafenib and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of the early small HCC. A total of 120 cases of patients with small HCC that presented during the period of May 2007 to June 2010 were selected and divided into the surgery (n=60) and RF (n=60) groups according to the treatment method employed. The surgery group was treated with a laparotomy resection and the RF group was treated with combined sorafenib and RFA, and a comparative analysis was made between the two groups with regard to recurrence rates, adverse reactions, and survival rates. After treatment of 1 month, the radical effective rate of the surgery and RF groups was 100%. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound images of the patients in the RF group were taken. During the 5-year follow-up, the tumor recurrence rate in the surgery group was 18.3%, significantly lower than that in the RF group where the tumor recurrence rate was 38.3% (P
