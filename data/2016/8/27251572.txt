Resection of a tumor located in the paracaval portion of the liver, without sacrificing other parts of the liver, is surgically challenging. Here, we describe using a laparoscopic caudal approach for a small hepatocellular carcinoma located in the paracaval portion. It is the first case using the laparoscopic caudal approach to be reported in the literature. Compared with the conventional approaches, this procedure can minimize both surgical invasiveness and the volume of liver parenchyma to be resected. In addition, the laparoscopic view is suitable for this procedure. The laparoscopic caudal approach can be a safe procedure with minimal invasiveness for a small paracaval tumor, particularly in patients with liver cirrhosis.
