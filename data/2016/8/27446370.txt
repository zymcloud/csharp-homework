Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastases in the mediastinum are rare, particularly under the arch of the aorta. The present study describes the case of a 30-year-old male patient who presented with back pain and hoarseness for 2 months due to lymph node metastasis of HCC. The patient had undergone right hepatic lobectomy for HCC 2 years prior and received transarterial chemoembolization 4 times following resection. A computed tomography scan revealed enlarged lymph nodes under the arch of the aorta that appeared to have invaded the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, causing the hoarseness. Percutaneous aspiration biopsy of the enlarged, right supraclavicular lymph node identified malignant cells consistent with HCC. Radiation administered as a therapy to treat for the metastatic lymph nodes did not diminish the tumor but relieved the symptoms.
