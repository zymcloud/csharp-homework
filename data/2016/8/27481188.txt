Background:Previous works suggested that neutralizing intratumoral lactic acidosis combined with glucose deprivation may deliver an effective approach to control tumor. We did a pilot clinical investigation, including a nonrandomized (57 patients with large HCC) and a randomized controlled (20 patients with large HCC) study.Methods:The patients were treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with or without bicarbonate local infusion into tumor.Results:In the nonrandomized controlled study, geometric mean of viable tumor residues (VTR) in TACE with bicarbonate was 6.4-fold lower than that in TACE without bicarbonate (7.1% [95% CI: 4.6%–10.9%] vs 45.6% [28.9%–72.0%]; pConclusions:Bicarbonate markedly enhances the anticancer activity of TACE.Funding:Funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China.Clinical trial number:ChiCTR-IOR-14005319.
