Objectives:The primary aim of this study was to determine whether specific preoperative clinical characteristics were associated with low-volume transfusion in liver transplant recipients. Low-volume transfusion was defined as transfusion of Materials and methods:Data were retrieved by retrospective chart review of 266 patients who received a liver transplant at the Mayo Clinic (Jacksonville, FL, USA). The primary outcome was low-volume transfusion. Associations of preoperative information with low-volume transfusion were explored using single-variable and multivariable logistic regression models; missing data were imputed with the sample median for continuous data and the most frequent category for categorical variables.Results:Low-volume transfusion occurred in 23% of first-time liver transplant recipients (62/266 patients; 95% confidence interval, 18%-29%). History of hepatitis C virus infection (P = .048), history of hepatocellular carcinoma (P = .050), short cold ischemia time (P = .006), and low international normalized ratio (P = .002) were independently associated with low-volume transfusion during liver transplant in a multivariable logistic regression model.Conclusions:Multiple studies have shown increased morbidity and mortality after orthotopic liver transplant when more than 6 U of packed red blood cells are administered within 24 hours of surgical incision. A method to identify low-volume transfusion candidates could help predict patient outcomes, decrease blood handling, and reduce costs. If patients with low-volume transfusion could be identified, fewer blood products would need to be prepared in advance. Although elevated preoperative coagulation parameters decrease the probability of low-volume transfusion, a definitive profile of a low-volume transfusion liver transplant recipient was not established.
