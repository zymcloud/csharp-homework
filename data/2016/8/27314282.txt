Aberrant expression of CDKN3 may be involved in carcinogenesis of liver cancer. The effect of CDKN3 on tumorigenesis and the molecular mechanisms involved have not been fully elucidated. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect CDKN3 expression levels in tumor tissues. CDKN3 siRNA was used to knockdown CDKN3 in QGY7701 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Colony formation assay was used to measure the clonogenic capacity of the tumor cells. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Logistic regression was performed to analyze the association between CDKN3 expression level and the HCC clinical pathology index. The CDKN3 expression level was significantly decreased in HCC tumor tissues compared with normal liver tissue and liver cirrhosis tissue. Additionally, CDKN3 expression was negativelyâ€‘associated with the pathological stage of the tumor. Inhibition of CKDN3 promoted the clonogenic capacity and chemotherapeutic tolerance in HCC tissues compared with controls. Knockdown of CDKN3 resulted in downregulation of p53 and p21 protein levels, whereas, AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 expression was upregulated. Thus, CDKN3 expression may reduce the survival of tumor cells and alter the sensitivity to therapeutic agents via the AKT/P53/P21 signaling pathway. Therefore, CDKN3 may be involved in tumor differentiation and self-renewal.
