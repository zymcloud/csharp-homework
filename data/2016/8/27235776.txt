Objective:To examine whether dynamic 3D contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is superior to 2D imaging in revealing vascularization of focal liver lesions (FLLs).Methods:Dynamic 2D and 3D CEUS were used to assess the vascularity of FLLs in 83 patients. The two analyses were carried out sequentially following a bolus intravenous injection of SonoVue contrast agent, one injection of 1.5-2mL was given for each part of the study (one for the 2D and another for the 3D). Due to the large data volume for 3D analysis, only the arterial phase (20-25s) was recorded and analyzed. The data were analyzed by two independent analysts.Results:The current study included a total of 83 patients with FLL. The diagnosis was established based on histopathology, Computed Tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Among the 83 cases, 61 were hepatocellular carcinomas (include 10 metastasis, 51 HCCs), and the remaining 22 were benign lesions: hemangiomas (n=15), focal nodular hyperplasias (n=4), and inflammatory lesions (n=3). The overall analysis showed similar patterns of enhancement between the 2D and 3D CEUS in the following features: morphological characteristics, and spatial relationships. In comparison to 2D imaging, 3D CEUS reveal more details of the boundary and feeding arteries of the lesions, as well as distorted features of supply vessels of hepatocellular carcinomas.Conclusions:Dynamic 3D-CEUS is superior to 2D-CEUS in displaying the spatial relationship of FLLs and their vascularity patterns, and simultaneous imaging of FLL perfusion and anatomic features.
