Purpose:To determine safety and efficacy of yttrium-90 ((90)Y) transarterial radioembolization (TARE) in patients who have undergone chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma.Materials and methods:A retrospective study identified 40 patients (median age 61 y; range, 44-84 y) who underwent (90)Y mapping angiography and had undergone ≥ one prior chemoembolizations. There were 4 (10%) patients in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A, 7 (17.5%) in stage B, and 29 (72.5%) in stage C; 28 (70%) were Child-Pugh class A and 12 (30%) were class B. Median tumor diameter was 4.2 cm (range, 1-11.6 cm). The most common indications for changing to TARE were tumor progression (35/40; 86%) and development of portal vein thrombus (15/40; 37.5%).Results:Of 40 patients, 29 (72.5%) underwent TARE; the most common reasons for not undergoing TARE were attenuated hepatic arteries (5/11), high pulmonary shunt (4/11), and poor arterial flow (2/11). Patients who underwent ≤ 4 chemoembolizations to the TARE target tended to be more likely to undergo TARE after mapping than patients who had > 4 chemoembolizations (P = .056). Most common grade ≥ 3 toxicities were fatigue (9/29; 31%) and biochemical alterations (bilirubin [3/29; 10.3%], albumin [4/29; 13.8%], aspartate aminotransferase [5/29; 17.2%]). Of 27 patients treated with TARE with follow-up, responses were 11 (41%) complete response, 5 (19%) partial response, 2 (7%) stable disease, and 9 (33%) progressive disease. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 90 days and 257 days.Conclusions:TARE is safe and effective salvage therapy in patients after chemoembolization. In patients who have undergone > 4 chemoembolizations to the (90)Y target, feasibility of TARE tends to be decreased.
