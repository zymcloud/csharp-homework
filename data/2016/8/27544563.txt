Urothelial carcinoma is the 2nd most common cancer of the urinary tract and accounts for the majority of cases of bladder cancer. Metastases are not infrequently encountered, increasing with disease stage and are most commonly seen in the bones and lungs. Many other sites have been described including the omentum, liver, and ovaries. An extremely rare site of metastatic disease however is within the vagina. Here we present a case of a probable vaginal 'drop metastasis' from previously treated urothelial carcinoma in the ureter and bladder.
