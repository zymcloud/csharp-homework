Objectives:The use of induction therapy in liver transplant is debatable. We aimed to compare clinical outcomes of different induction protocols in liver transplant recipients.Materials and methods:This was a retrospective cohort analyses using the University of Washington Transplant Database from January 2005 to May 2012 for adult (â‰¥ 18 y old) primary liver transplant patients. All patients received induction therapy. Maintenance immunosuppressive agents were tacrolimus or tacrolimus-mycophenolate mofetil. Primary endpoints were acute cellular rejection, patient survival, and graft survival. In patients with chronic hepatitis C, the degree of histologic inflammation or fibrosis at 1 year was assessed. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to evaluate variables associated with both patient and graft survival.Results:We identified 595 patients: 322 patients received rabbit antithymocyte globulin and 273 received interleukin 2 receptor blocker. Acute cellular rejection was higher in patients who received interleukin 2 receptor blocker than in patients who received rabbit antithymocyte globulin (27% vs 18%; P Conclusions:Rabbit antithymocyte globulin is associated with lower rejection rate and improved patient and graft survival in liver transplant. Type of therapy affects the degree of histologic hepatitis C virus recurrence.
