Aim:Recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is observed frequently, even after curative treatments. The aim of this study is to elucidate the risk factors for recurrence of HCC after radiofrequency ablation (RFA), focusing on the carcinogenic potential of the liver assessed by α-fetoprotein (AFP).Methods:We enrolled 357 consecutive patients who underwent complete ablation by RFA for primary HCC (≤3 cm, ≤3 tumors) and analyzed the correlation between 17 critical parameters, including AFP and HCC recurrence.Results:Recurrence was observed in 236 patients during a mean observation period of 54.3 months. Multivariate analysis revealed that multiple tumors (risk ratio [RR] = 1.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27-2.26, P 10 ng/mL, RR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.09-1.94, P 40 mAU/mL, RR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.13-2.02, P Conclusion:AFP less than 5 ng/mL after curative RFA was an important predictor of a better prognosis and was considered to indicate the low carcinogenic potential of the non-cancerous liver.
