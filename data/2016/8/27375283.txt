Background:One to 5 years of therapy of chronic hepatitis B with oral nucleoside analogues result in significant clinical improvements, but effects of more prolonged therapy are not well defined.Aim:To describe outcomes of chronic hepatitis B with long-term lamivudine therapy.Methods:Forty-two patients with chronic hepatitis B treated with lamivudine were followed for 3.2-19.5 (median = 16.1) years. Therapy was switched to other agents (n = 16) if patients developed lamivudine resistance and relapse of disease.Results:Among 22 HBeAg-positive patients, 17 (77%) became HBeAg negative, of whom 5 (23%) subsequently cleared HBsAg. Among 20 HBeAg-negative patients, 10 (50%) cleared HBsAg. The time to HBsAg clearance ranged from 0.9 to 16.8 (median = 9.3) years. Lamivudine resistance arose in 24 patients (57%) of whom 6 (25%) lost HBsAg. HBsAg clearance was not always accompanied by seroconversion; anti-HBs appearing concurrently in only five patients (33%). Nevertheless, HBsAg loss allowed for stopping therapy in all patients, none re-developing HBsAg or suffering relapse; all having normal alanine aminotransferase levels and no (n = 13) or unquantifiable HBV DNA levels (n = 2) when last seen. In contrast, seven of 27 patients (26%) who remained HBsAg-positive died of liver disease or liver cancer or underwent liver transplantation, all of whom had cirrhosis.Conclusions:Long-term viral suppression with nucleoside analogues leads to HBsAg loss in a substantial proportion of patients, particularly if HBeAg-negative. Serious outcomes during the first 10-20 years of treatment occur largely among patients with pre-existing cirrhosis who do not clear HBsAg with therapy.
