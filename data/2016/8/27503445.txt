Background:Hepatitis B virus is one of the most causative agents of human liver disease, including acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The disease is a great health problem worldwide, with estimated of 350 million chronically infected people.Objective:The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B virus in Tefera Hailu Memorial Hospital (THMH) for the last three years (2013, 2014, 2015) by using secondary data.Method:A three year retrospective record review was conducted from March 01/2015-July 30/2015. All registered data for hepatitis B virus serological screening of the specified period were included. The data were collected by predesigned data collection sheet. The sample size was calculated by simple statistical estimation to be 149 for each year.Result:Of 482 subjects, 215 (44.60 %) were females and 267 (55.40 %) were males. The overall prevalence of HBV was 102 (21.16 %). The positivity rate was 69 (14.31 %) in the age group between 15 and 45. There was a decrease in the prevalence of HBV from 2012 up to 2014.Conclusion:The seroprevalence of HBsAg was higher in males than in females and the yearly prevalence decreases from 2012-2014. But HBV infection is still a public health problem in Ethiopia. Therefore intensification of health education concerning modes of transmission and prevention of HBV, early case finding and treatment is recommended to reduce the spread of the disease.
