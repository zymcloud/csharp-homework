Purpose:The aim of this prospective study was to examine the diagnostic value of dual-energy CT (DECT) in the assessment of response of HCC after radioembolisation (RE).Material and methods:40 HCC patients with 82 measurable target lesions were included in this study. At baseline and follow-up examination target lesions were evaluated with (IU), AASLD and Choi measurement criteria. Disease control was defined as the sum of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), progression disease (PD) and stable disease (SD).Results:With Choi and IU more patients were considered than PR and less than PD and SD. According to AASLD more patients were measured as SD and PD than PR. 26/40 patients were classified as PR with IU. In contrast measurements with AASLD in only 8/26 patients were also classified as PR. 6/12 SD patients measured with IU were measured as PD with AASLD. 4/26 patients classified with IU as PR were described as SD with CHOI, 10/14 SD patients measured with CHOI were SD according to IU, the other 4 patients were PR with IU. 2/4 PD patients according to CHOI were SD with IU.Conclusion:More patients by IU were classified as SD versus PD and PR versus SD. We attribute this to the more detailed consideration of the HU differences between the virtual native and contrast-enhanced series generated by DECT. Iodine uptake (IU) in HCC measured and visualized with DECT is a promising imaging method for the assessment of treatment response after radioembolisations.Key points:-dual energy CT of hypervascular tumors such as HCC allows to quantify contrast enhancement without native imaging. -this can be used to evaluate the therapy response after Radioembolization.
