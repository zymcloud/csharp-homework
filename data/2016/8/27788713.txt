The disease spectrum of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes non-alcoholic simple fatty liver (NAFL) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), as well as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, with the most serious type being NASH. The morbidity of NAFLD is seeing an increase year by year in the world, and it is a common cause of chronic hepatic disease and lacks effective treatment. The pathogenesis of NASH is still unknown, and the "two-hit" hypothesis was used to explain the mechanism of NASH. Recent research has found that cholesterol metabolism is closely related to the pathogenesis and severity of NASH. The validity of the "two-hit" hypothesis has been recently challenged, which gives rise to "multi-parallel hit" hypothesis. Cholesterol affects membrane fluidity and membrane protein function through genetic factors, and it can also induce unfolded protein response, and generate toxic oxysterol. Free cholesterol can activate hepatic Kupffer and stellate cells to produce inflammatory cytokines and collagen. The formation of cholesterol crystallization and crown-like structures can damage liver cells and activate Kupffer cells. The above processes can all aggravate liver damage, thus accelerating the development and making the clinical manifestations of NASH even worse. In the present review we summarize the association between cholesterol metabolism and pathogenesis of NASH.
