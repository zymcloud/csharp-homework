Background:Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG) is a rare B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder with frequent extranodal presentation and involvement of the respiratory system. The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics, pathologic findings, and treatment outcomes of LYG in a single tertiary institution.Methods:This is a retrospective review of series of cases of LYG diagnosed at Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) between 2000 and 2011. We describe clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and treatment outcomes.Results:We identified 11 cases of biopsy-proven LYG at our institution. All patients presented with lung involvement by LYG. Nine patients were treated with rituximab-based chemotherapy. The overall response rate was 63.6% (complete response rate, 36.44%). Extra-pulmonary involvement was common (central nervous system, kidney, adrenal glands, testicles, and liver). The median overall survival and progression-free survival were 23 and 12.2 months, respectively.Conclusions:LYG is a rare B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder with involvement if the respiratory system. The presentation is heterogeneous, and response to therapy is variable. Although it is considered a poor prognosis disease, long-term survivors in remission have been described.
