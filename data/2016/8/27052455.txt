Purpose:The purpose of the study is to compare the MR-imaging features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) capsule appearance on gadoxetic acid and gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging, using imaging-based presumptive diagnosis of HCC as the reference standard.Methods:Gadoxetic acid and gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging of 51 patients with 71 HCCs were retrospectively reviewed. Three readers graded in consensus, using a five-point scale, the presence (score 4-5) of capsule appearance on images obtained during T1-weighted GRE portal venous phase (PVP), 3-min phase, and hepatobiliary phase (HBP). The Fisher's exact test and the t student unpaired test were performed.Results:A hyperintense capsule appearance was present either on PVP or 3-min phase in 11/46 and in 24/25 HCCs imaged with gadoxetic acid and gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging, respectively (24% vs. 96% p Conclusions:A capsule appearance was more frequently seen on gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging when compared to gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging.
