Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor used as a first-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but it has shown modest to low response rates. The characteristic tumour hypoxia of advanced HCC maybe a major factor underlying hypoxia-mediated treatment failure. Thus, it is urgent to elucidate the mechanisms of hypoxia-mediated sorafenib resistance in HCC. In this study, we found that hypoxia induced the nuclear translocation of Yes associate-Protein (YAP) and the subsequent transactivation of target genes that promote cell survival and escape apoptosis, thereby leading to sorafenib resistance. Statins, the inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, could ameliorate hypoxia-induced nuclear translocation of YAP and suppress mRNA levels of YAP target genes both in vivo and in vitro. Combined treatment of statins with sorafenib greatly rescued the loss of anti-proliferative effects of sorafenib under hypoxia and improved the inhibitory effects on HepG2 xenograft tumour growth, accompanied by enhanced apoptosis as evidenced by the increased sub-G1 population and PARP cleavage. The expression levels of YAP and its target genes were highly correlated with poor prognosis and predicted a high risk of HCC patients. These findings collectively suggest that statins utilization maybe a promising new strategy to counteract hypoxia-mediated resistance to sorafenib in HCC patients.
