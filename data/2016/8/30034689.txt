Similar to the reversible epigenetic modifications on DNA, dynamic RNA modifications were recently considered to constitute another realm for biological regulation in the form of "RNA epigenetics". 5-Methylcytosine (5-mC) has long been known to be present in RNA from all three kingdoms of life. However, the functions of 5-mC in RNA have not been fully understood, especially for the RNA demethylation mechanism. The discovery of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) in RNA together with our recently reported 5-formylcytosine (5-foC) in RNA indicated that 5-mC in RNA may undergo the same cytosine oxidation demethylation pathway with generating intermediates 5-hmC, 5-foC, and 5-carboxylcytosine (5-caC) by ten-eleven translocation (Tet) proteins as that in DNA. However, endogenous 5-caC in RNA has not been observed so far. In the current study, we established a method using chemical labeling coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis for the sensitive and simultaneous determination of the oxidative products of 5-mC. Our results demonstrated that the detection sensitivities of 5-mC, 5-hmC, 5-foC and 5-caC in RNA increased by 70-313 folds upon 2-bromo-1-(4-diethylaminophenyl)-ethanone (BDEPE) labeling. Using this method, we discovered the existence of 5-caC in the RNA of mammals. In addition, we found the 5-mC occurs in all RNA species including mRNA, 28S rRNA, 18S rRNA and small RNA (
