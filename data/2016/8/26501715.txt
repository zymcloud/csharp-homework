Objective:To determine whether autotransfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) salvaged during liver transplantation is associated with the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Background:Blood salvage is widely used during liver transplantation to reinfuse salvaged autologous RBCs and reduce allogeneic transfusion. However, the reintroduction of cancer cells via autotransfusion is a major concern in HCC patients.Methods:Among 397 patients who underwent living-donor liver transplantation for HCC, 97 of 114 recipients without intraoperative autotransfusion were matched with 222 of 283 recipients with intraoperative autotransfusion with unfixed matching ratio using the propensity score based on age, sex, allogeneic transfusion, immunosuppression, tumor biology, and others. Competing risks Cox regression was used to compare HCC recurrence risk of the 2 paired groups.Results:Recipients in autotransfusion group received 1177 Â± 1318 mL of salvaged RBCs during surgery. A leukocyte depletion filter was used for all autotransfused RBCs. Cumulative HCC recurrence rate at 1, 2, and 5 years after transplantation were 10.4% (5.3%-17.6%), 19.1% (11.6%-28.0%), and 24.1% (15.2%-34.0%) for nonautotransfusion group and 10.8% (7.2%-15.4%), 14.9% (10.5%-20.0%), and 20.3% (14.9%-26.4%) for autotransfusion group, respectively. Autotransfusion versus nonautotransfusion group was not significantly different in overall recurrence [hazard ratio (HR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-1.53, P = 0.579] and intrahepatic recurrence (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.36-1.56) or extrahepatic recurrence (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.49-2.04).Conclusions:We found no evidence of a significant impact of autotransfusion on posttransplant HCC recurrence. Thus, salvaged and filtered RBCs could be used in HCC patients undergoing liver transplantation with potential benefits from avoiding allogeneic RBCs transfusion and its complications.
