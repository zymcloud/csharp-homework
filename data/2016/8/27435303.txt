Background & aims:Intravenous fat emulsions are associated with liver disease and there is some evidence that the administration of intravenous fish oil (FO) may be useful in reversing it. The aim of our study was to assess whether there are differences in the changes of liver function tests (LFTs) in hospitalized adult patients with parenteral nutrition (PN) with FO and vegetal lipids vs patients without FO. The secondary aim was to study the relationship between impaired LFT and FO.Methods:This was a 4-year, propensity score-matched analysis including patients aged ≥18 years treated with PN for ≥10 days. The exclusion criteria were previous liver disease, biliary disorders or pancreatic cancer, and altered initial LFT values. Patients were classified into 2 groups: FO cohort (patients who received FO - in addition to vegetal oil - after the first week of PN) and the vegetal oil cohort (patients who received only vegetal oil). A propensity score matched cohort design was developed. Univariate analyses were used to study the changes in LFTs. To evaluate whether LFT alterations vary with FO administration, four stepwise multiple linear regression models were conducted.Results:52 patients were included, 52% men, median 66 (55-75) years and 69 kg (61.7-78.8), with 18.5 (14-31.8) days of PN treatment. Maximum FO supplementation was 23%. During the first week with PN (none of the groups receiving FO), gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (AP) and total bilirubin (BIL) increased significantly. Comparing LFT values at seven days of PN with at the end of PN treatment, the univariate analysis showed a better response for the FO group. The group without FO showed a significant increase for GGT and AP. In multivariate models, the percentage of FO administered was associated with a decrease in GGT, B = -0.33 [CI 95% = -0.54/-0.12], in AP, B = -0.12 [CI 95% = -0.20/-0.03] and ALT, B = -0.12 [CI 95% = -0.21/-0.024].Conclusions:Lipid composition plays a significant role in LFT alteration associated with PN, and FO intravenous lipid emulsions (ILEs) minimize disturbance of LFTs in hospitalized adult patients.
