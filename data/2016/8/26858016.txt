Background & aims:The rising prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM) among hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients contributes to concurrent nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We aim to evaluate the impact of concurrent obesity or DM on waitlist survival and probability of liver transplantation (LT) among adults with chronic HCV awaiting LT.Methods:Using 2003-2013 United Network for Organ Sharing data, we evaluated the impact of obesity and DM among adults with chronic HCV awaiting LT: non-obese, non-DM vs. obese, non-DM (obese) vs. non-obese, DM (DM) vs. obese and DM. Overall, LT waitlist survival and probability of receiving LT were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate logistic regression models.Results:From 2003-2013, there were 43 478 new LT waitlist registrants with chronic HCV (21.0% with HCC, 79% without HCC). Obesity was associated with lower probability of receiving LT (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.85-0.97; P Conclusion:Among adults with chronic HCV awaiting LT in the US, obesity is associated with lower probability of receiving LT, but did not impact waitlist survival. DM among chronic HCV patients did not impact waitlist survival or probability of LT.
