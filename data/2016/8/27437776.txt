Hydrogen sulfide-releasing oleanolic acid (HS-OA) is an emerging novel class of compounds and consists of an oleanolic acid (OA) and a H2S-releasing moiety. Although it exhibits improved anti-inflammatory activity, its potency in human cancers has not been understood yet. In this study, we examined the effects of HS-OA on the growth of liver cancer cell lines and the underlying mechanisms.HS-OA inhibited the growth of all four cancer cell lines studied, with potencies of 10- to 30-fold greater than that of its counterpart (OA). HS-OA induced significant apoptosis and decreased viability, clonogenic activity and migration of Hep G2 cells. Further studies showed that HS-OA resulted in the reduction of YAP expression and its downstream targets, CTGF and CYR 61, thus promoting cell apoptosis. In addition, HS-OA caused a decrease of 14-3-3γ expression, which led to Bad translocation to the mitochondria, ΔΨm loss, cytochrome c release, caspase activation and a recovery of 14-3-3γ reversed these effects induced by HS-OA.These findings indicate that YAP and 14-3-3γ are involved in HS-OA's effects on liver cancer cells and identifying HS-OA as a potential new drug candidate for cancer therapy.
