Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common human malignancies around the world. The poor prognosis and high recurrence rate of HCC are largely the result of the high frequencies of intrahepatic and extrahepatic metastases. However, the treatment of metastasis is very limited. Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) technology has been recognized as a promising technology for drug and gene delivery in vivo and in vitro. Long noncoding RNA activated by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β; lncRNA-ATB) was recently identified, which was upregulated in HCC metastases and associated with poor prognosis of HCC patients. In this study, we used microbubbles for UTMD-mediated siRNA transfection to silence lncRNA-ATB expression. We found that UTMD-mediated siRNA transfection significantly inhibited lncRNA-ATB expression and ZEB1 and ZEB2 expression and suppressed cell migration and invasion. We also demonstrated that transfecting siRNA against lncRNA-ATB by using UTMD was more efficient than that by using lipidosome. UTMD-mediated siRNA transfection against lncRNA-ATB may be a promising therapy for HCC metastasis.
