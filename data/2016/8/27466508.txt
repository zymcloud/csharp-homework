Background/aim:Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) has been suggested to reduce the risk of cancer progression in both preclinical and clinical studies but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly explored. The aim of the study was to investigate the anti-metastatic role of enoxaparin, a clinically-used LMWH, in a murine model of colon cancer and to explore its underlying mechanisms.Materials and methods:Using a reproducible mouse model of colon carcinomas, we assessed the capacity of enoxaparin, a LMWH, to affect tumor metastasis of colon carcinoma cell lines in mice.Results:The hepatic growth of colon carcinoma metastases was strongly inhibited by enoxaparin compared to (Ctrl) group (p=0.001). This effect was associated to an inhibition of heparanase mRNA expression and protein production both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, enoxaparin inhibited the liver and serum production of interferon gamma (IfnÎ³)-inducible chemokine receptor ligands. Overexpression of heparanase prompted proliferation, migration and growth of colon carcinoma in vitro and in vivo to a point that was not affected by enoxaparin in vivo anymore.Conclusion:Enoxaparin decreased liver metastases in a mouse model of colon carcinoma. These results suggest that enoxaparin may benefit patients with cancer and deserves further laboratory and clinical investigations.
