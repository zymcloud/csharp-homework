A 55-year female presented with left breast lump. Her sonomammography was unremarkable. Core biopsy showed it to be metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Biphasic computerized tomography (CT) of liver confirmed presence of primary liver masses while CTchest showed involvement of left anterior chest wall, rather than primary breast mass. F18-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography CT(PET-CT) imaging confirmed primary liver tumor with bony metastases.
