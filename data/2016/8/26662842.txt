Aim:To retrospectively evaluate the detectability of tumor recurrence with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after superselective conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (cTACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The detectability of tumor recurrence with CT and gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI obtained within 30 days (mean, 16.9 ± 10.1) were compared in 38 patients with recurrent HCC after superselective cTACE. Tumor recurrence was divided into local and distant recurrence. Local recurrence was also divided into intratumoral and peritumoral recurrence.Results:Tumor recurrence (maximum diameter, 19.7 ± 10.1 mm) was demonstrated by images 12.4 ± 11.7 months after cTACE. CT could depict 16 (76.2%) of 21 intratumoral recurrences in 12 patients and 14 (53.8%) of 26 peritumoral recurrences in 11, as well as 39 (55.7%) of 70 distant recurrences in 15 (75%) of 20 patients. Arterial phase MRI could depict 20 (95.2%) of 21 intratumoral recurrences in 14 patients and all 26 (100%) peritumoral recurrences in 21, as well as 60 (85.7%) distant recurrences in all 20 (100%) patients. The detectability of tumor recurrence with MRI was significantly higher than that with CT (P = 0.00549). On MRI, pseudolesions were observed in five (13.2%) patients and artifacts in the arterial phase in five (13.2%). Regarding the diagnostic performance, CT was superior to MRI in two (5.3%) patients and MRI was superior to CT in 19 (50%). They were almost equal in 17 (44.7%).Conclusion:The detectability of tumor recurrence after superselective cTACE with gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI was superior to that of CT.
