Purpose:Every year, almost one million individuals are diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide and more than 690,000 patients die of it. At present, most therapeutic anti-HCC agents are not effective, which is due to the appearance of chemo-resistance and/or toxic side effects. Therefore, it is imperative to find novel more effective anti-HCC agents. Here, we evaluated the effect of giganteaside D (GD), an oleanolic acid saponin from P. scabiosaefolia, on the growth and apoptosis of HCC cells.Methods and results:Using MTT and clonogenic assays, we found that GD exhibited a significant growth inhibitory effect on the HCC-derived cell lines HepG2 and Bel-7402. In addition, we found that GD induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in these HCC-derived cells, as indicated by a decreased mitochondrial potential, activation of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3, cleavage of PARP and release of Cytochrome C from the mitochondria. Besides, we found that GD stimulated the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that blockage of ROS attenuated the GD-induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Additionally, we found that GD treatment led to a decrease in phosphorylated Erk (p-Erk) and triggered the generation of p-JNK, both components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Inhibition of Erk or JNK by specific inhibitors or siRNAs augmented or attenuated the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of GD.Conclusions:From our results we conclude that GD can induce ROS-mediated apoptosis in HCC-derived cells through the MAPK pathway. This observation may open up avenues to explore the future use of GD as a HCC chemotherapeutic agent.
