Objectives:There are few data regarding the clinical and serologic features of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection among Hispanics in the United States. The aims of this study were to compare and contrast clinical characteristics of Hispanic and Asian CHB patients.Methods:Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected from Hispanic and Asian CHB patients seen between January 2013 and May 2014 at Los Angeles County Hepatitis Clinic.Results:A total of 55 Hispanic and 342 Asian CHB patients were identified. Almost all were foreign-born. Compared with Asians, Hispanics were more likely to report heterosexual transmission (P2000 IU/mL compared with 54% of Asians (P=0.004).Significantly more Asian HBeAg-negative/anti-HBe-positive CHB patients had high HBV DNA levels (>2000 IU/mL) with elevated ALT compared with Hispanic patients (P=0.04). Compared with Asians, Hispanic CHB patients were more likely to have elevated ALT and low HBV DNA levels (P=0.001). Among CHB patients who received antiviral therapy, response was comparable among Hispanics and Asians. There were no Hispanic CHB patients who experienced spontaneous reactivation or developed hepatocellular carcinoma.Conclusions:There were important differences in the clinical, demographic, and serologic characteristics between Hispanic and Asian CHB. Response rate to antiviral therapy was comparable. Further studies of Hispanic CHB patients in the United States are warranted.
