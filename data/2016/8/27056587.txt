In this work, paclitaxel-encapsulated polymeric depots were prepared and characterized as drug delivery system for cancer chemotherapy against hepatocellular carcinoma. Effects of different parameters, including drug-loading content, polymer concentration and depot weight on depot formation, percentage of sustained-release taxol and drug release profile were evaluated. Paclitaxel-loaded depots were successfully formed at the polymer concentration above 25% w/v. For all formulations, paclitaxel could be encapsulated with very high percentage of sustained-release taxol (>90%). The release rate of paclitaxel from depots could be controlled by the amount of drug-loading content, polymer concentration and depot weight. Cytotoxicity against liver cancer cell line, HepG2, was evaluated by medium extraction method. Paclitaxel releasing from depots showed cytotoxic effect against HepG2 at different incubation times, whereas blank depots exhibited no cytotoxicity.
