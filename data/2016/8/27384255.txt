A tumor is a complicated system, and tumor cells are typically heterogeneous in many aspects. Polymeric drug delivery nanocarriers sensitive to a single type of biosignals may not release cargos effectively in all tumor cells, leading to low therapeutic efficacy. To address the challenges, here, we demonstrated a pH/reduction dual-sensitive charge-conversional polymeric prodrug strategy for efficient codelivery. Reduction-sensitive disulfide group and acid-labile anticancer drug (demethylcantharidin, DMC)-conjugated Î²-carboxylic amide group were repeatedly and regularly introduced into copolymer chain simultaneously via facile CuAAC click polymerization. The obtained multifunctional polymeric prodrug P(DMC), mPEG-b-poly(disulfide-alt-demethylcantharidin)-b-mPEG was further utilized for DOX encapsulation. Under tumor tissue/cell microenvironments (pH 6.5 and 10 mM GSH), the DOX-loaded polymeric prodrug nanoparticles (P(DMC)@DOX NPs) performed surface negative-to-positive charge conversion and accelerated/sufficient release of DMC and DOX. The remarkably enhanced cellular internalization and cytotoxicity in vitro, especially against DOX-resistant SMMC-7721 cells, were demonstrated. P(DMC)@DOX NPs in vivo also exhibited higher tumor accumulation and improved antitumor efficiency compared to P(SA)@DOX NPs with one drug and without charge-conversion ability. The desired multifunctional polymeric prodrug strategy brings a new opportunity for cancer chemotherapy.
