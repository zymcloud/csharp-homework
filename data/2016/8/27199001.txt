Introduction:Lymphocytes are an integral part of lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI). Both LMR and PNI which reflect body's inflammatory and nutritional status can be obtained from routine blood and biochemical test conveniently. Little evidence concerning the prognostic value of LMR and PNI in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients has been published. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of LMR and PNI in hepatitis B virals (HBV)-associated HCC patients who underwent curative hepatectomy.Methods:Between January 2008 and June 2013, 450 surgically treated HCC patients were retrospectively analyzed. Clinicopathological parameters, LMR and PNI were collected and compared. The multivariate analysis was performed to indentify independent prognostic factors. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were also compared.Results:Tumor size, vascular invasion, alpha fetoprotein level, LMR and PNI were independent prognostic factors for OS. Tumor number, tumor size, vascular invasion, LMR and PNI were independent prognostic factors for RFS. Either a high LMR or PNI could predict favorable OS and RFS in surgically treated HCC patients and vice versa.Conclusions:Both LMR and PNI were significant independent predictors that can predict survival outcomes in HBV-associated HCC patients who received curative hepatectomy.
