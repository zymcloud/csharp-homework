Background:The utilisation of interventional ablation procedures in the context of bridging and downstaging plans for hepatocellular carcinomas before liver transplantation is increasing. The aim of the present study was to summarise current data for the application of bridging and downstaging procedures before liver transplantation.Methods:The present study is based on an extensive investigation of the literature in PubMed. RESULTS of controlled trials, cohort studies, meta-analyses and reviews were included.Results:Recommendations for the usage of bridging procedures for hepatocellular carcinomas within the Milan criteria and an expected waiting time of more than 6 months until transplantation depend on the size of the lesions and have a low level of evidence. After successful downstaging of hepatocellular carcinomas beyond the Milan criteria into the range of the Milan criteria liver transplantation is recommended with a low level of evidence, as well.Conclusion:Randomised controlled trials, clearly proving the success of bridging and downstaging procedures, are not available at the time and are not awaited for ethical reasons. Due to the uncomplicated application and low risk for therapy-associated complications, interventional procedures for bridging and downstaging are accepted and recommended.
