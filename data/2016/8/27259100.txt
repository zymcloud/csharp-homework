Background and aims:The survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is heterogeneous. We aim to develop and validate a simple prognostic model to estimate survival for HCC patients (MESH score).Methods:A total of 3182 patients were randomised into derivation and validation cohort. Multivariate analysis was used to identify independent predictors of survival in the derivation cohort. The validation cohort was employed to examine the prognostic capabilities.Results:The MESH score allocated 1 point for each of the following parameters: large tumour (beyond Milan criteria), presence of vascular invasion or metastasis, Child-Turcotte-Pugh score ≥6, performance status ≥2, serum alpha-fetoprotein level ≥20 ng/ml, and serum alkaline phosphatase ≥200 IU/L, with a maximal of 6 points. In the validation cohort, significant survival differences were found across all MESH scores from 0 to 6 (all p Conclusions:This newly proposed simple and accurate survival model provides enhanced prognostic accuracy for HCC. The MESH system is a useful supplement to the BCLC and HKLC classification schemes in refining treatment strategies.
