Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver malignancy and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Accurate detection and differential diagnosis of early HCC can significantly improve patient survival. Currently, detection of HCC in clinical practice is performed by diagnostic imaging techniques and determination of serum biomarkers, most notably α-fetoprotein (AFP), fucosylated AFP and des-γ-carboxyprothrombin. However, these methods display limitations in sensitivity and specificity, especially with respect to early stages of HCC. Recently, high-throughput technologies have elucidated many new pathways involved in hepatocarcinogenesis and have led to the discovery of a plethora of novel, non-invasive serum biomarkers. In particular, the combination of AFP with these new candidate molecules has yielded promising results. In this review, we aimed at recapitulating the most recent (2013-2015) developments in HCC biomarker research. We compared promising novel diagnostic serum protein biomarkers, such as annexin A2, the soluble form of the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl and thioredoxin, as well as their combinations with AFP. High diagnostic performance (area under the curve >0.75) as shown by threshold-independent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was a prerequisite for inclusion in this review. In addition, we discuss the role and potential of microRNAs in HCC diagnosis and associated methodological challenges.
