Purpose:To assess the correlation between each of intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) metrics in renal parenchyma with renal function, in a cohort of patients with chronic liver disease.Materials and methods:Thirty patients with liver disease underwent abdominal MRI at 1.5T, including a coronal respiratory-triggered IVIM-DWI sequence and a coronal 3D FLASH DCE-MRI acquisition. Diffusion signals in the renal cortex and medulla were fitted to the IVIM model to estimate the diffusion coefficient (D), pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*), and perfusion fraction (PF). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was calculated using all b-values. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR), cortical and medullary renal plasma flow (RPF), mean transit times (MTT) of vascular and tubular compartments and the whole kidney, were calculated from DCE-MRI data by fitting to a three-compartment model. The estimated GFR (eGFR) was calculated from serum creatinine measured 30 ± 27 days of MRI.Results:ADC, PF, and RPF were significantly higher in renal cortex vs. medulla (P < 10(-5) ). DCE-MRI GFR significantly correlated with, but underestimated, eGFR (Spearman's r/P = 0.49/0.01). IVIM-DWI parameters were not significantly correlated with eGFR. DCE-MRI GFR correlated weakly with D (cortex, r/P = 0.3/0.03; medulla r/P = 0.27/0.05) and ADC (cortex r/P = 0.28/0.04; medulla r/P = 0.34/0.01). Weak correlations were observed for pooled cortical and medullar RPF with PF (r/P = 0.32/10(-3) ) and with ADC (r/P = 0.29/0.0025). Significant negative correlations were observed for vascular MTT with cortical D* (r/P = -0.38/0.004) and D*×PF (r/P = -0.34/0.01).Conclusion:The weak correlations between renal IVIM and DCE-MRI perfusion parameters imply that these functional measures could be complementary.
