Purpose:Pelvic bone metastases are difficult to treat because of complex pelvic bone anatomy and the proximity of normal organs. The adequacy of radiation dose and field coverage was evaluated.Patients and methods:We analyzed 146 cases of pelvic bone metastases from HCC treated with radiotherapy (RT). Bone metastases were confirmed using CT/MRI. Subjective pain response was assessed using the visual analogue scale, and treatment-related toxicity with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0. Local failure free survival (LFFS) and overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:The local control rate was 80.1% and the pain control rate was 68.5%. Compartmental target volume (CTV), encompassing the whole compartment of the involved bone, was found to be a significant factor (1-year LFFS, 78% vs. 50%; p=0.001). Sites of metastasis were categorized as either upper or lower pelvic bone; both categories showed improved local control with CTV. Metastatic lesions that received more than 50 Gy of EQD2 showed more partial response in pain after RT (58% vs. 79%; p=0.007). No patient showed toxicity higher than Grade IV.Conclusion:Compartmental RT targeted to the involved bone was associated with improved local control and LFFS. High-dose radiation was associated with an improved treatment response.
