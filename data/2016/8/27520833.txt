Background:Variable degrees of differentiation in hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)under Edmondson-Steiner grading system has been proven to be an independent prognostic indicator for HCC. Up till now, there has been no effective radiological method that can reveal the degree of differentiation in HCC before surgery. This paper aims to evaluate the use of Gd-EOB-DTPA-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging combined with T1 mapping for the diagnosis of HCC and assessing its degree of differentiation.Methods:Forty-four patients with 53 pathologically proven HCC had undergone Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced MRI with T1 mapping before surgery. Out of the 53 lesions,13 were grade I, 27 were gradeII, and 13 were grade III. The T1 values of each lesion were measured before and at 20 min after Gd-EOB-DTPA administration (T1p and T1e). The absolute reduction in T1 value (T1d) and the percentage reduction (T1d %) were calculated. The one-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation were used for comparisons between the T1 mapping values.Results:The T1d and T1d % of grade I, II and III of HCC was 660.5 ± 422.8ms、295.0 ± 99.6ms、276.2 ± 95.0ms and 54.0 ± 12.2 %、31.5 ± 6.9 %、27.7 ± 6.7 % respectively. The differences between grade Iand II, grade Iand III were statistically significant (p Conclusions:T1 mapping before and after Gd-EOB-DTPA administration can predict degree of differentiation in HCC.
