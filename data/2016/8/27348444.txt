Introduction:Single nucleotide polymorphism in miRNAs can alter its expression, thus can lead to the development of cancers. Numerous studies have explored the association between MIR-149 gene rs2292832 polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk, but the results remains inconsistent. So, we performed this pooled analyses in order to get a precise result.Evidence acquisition:Odds ratios (OR) with 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI), calculated by STATA software, was used to determine whether MIR-149 gene rs2292832 polymorphism contributes to the risk of HCC. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on Medline (mainly PubMed), Cochrane Library database, Web of science and the China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) up to March 22, 2016.Evidence synthesis:A total of 19 studies including 8201 cases and 9294 controls were included in this meta-analysis. Four of 20 studies related to the HCC risk. When all the eligible studies were pooled into this meta-analysis, a signiﬁcant association between MIR-149 gene rs2292832 polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma risk was found, while no association was found between this gene polymorphism and overall cancer risk.Conclusions:Our meta-analysis supports that the MIR-149 gene rs2292832 polymorphism contributed to the risk of HCC from currently available evidence. However, a study with a larger sample size is needed to further evaluate gene-environment interaction on MIR-149 gene rs2292832 polymorphism and HCC risk.
