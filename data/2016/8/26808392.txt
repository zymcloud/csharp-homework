Purpose:To evaluate the effectiveness of contrast-enhanced susceptibility-weighted imaging with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO-enhanced SWI) in the assessment of intratumoral vascularity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Orthotopic xenograft HCC nude mouse models were established first and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were performed on a 1.5T MR scanner 28 days later. Three groups of mice, 10 in each, were imaged using unenhanced and USPIO-enhanced SWI at doses of 4, 8, and 12 mg Fe/kg. Intratumoral susceptibility signal intensity (ITSS) was scored. ITSS-to-tumor contrast-to-noise ratio (ITSST-CNR) was measured. These measurements were compared between unenhanced and USPIO-enhanced SWI at each dose and differences in the measurements between different dose groups were estimated. Correlation between ITSS and tumor microvessel density (MVD) was analyzed.Results:Compared with unenhanced SWI, significantly higher ITSS was identified on USPIO-enhanced SWI at doses of 8 mg Fe/kg (Z = -2.000, P = 0.046) and 12 mg Fe/kg (Z = -2.333, P = 0.020). Significantly higher ITSST-CNR was found on USPIO-enhanced SWI than that on unenhanced SWI (P Conclusion:USPIO-enhanced SWI at a dose of 8 mg Fe/kg greatly improves the detection of intratumoral vascularity in a xenograft HCC model.
