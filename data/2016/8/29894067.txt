Relapses of ovarian cancer have poor prognosis, overall survival (OS) after recurrence depends on patient's performance status, his- tological cell type, size and number of the relapse, and duration of the platinum-free interval. Pelvis, peritoneum, pleural effusion, liver, lung, lymph nodes, and central nervous system are the most frequent sites of relapse. The standard treatment for ovarian cancer is a com- bination of surgery and chemotherapy. This retrospective study aimed to describe incidence, characteristics, outcomes and prognostic factors of patients with ovarian cancer underwent radiotherapy.Results:In 47 with ovarian cancer underwent radiotherapy. Treatment modalities were radiotherapy 8- 56 Gy. After optimal treatment the authors observed complete remission in seven patients, and progression and/or metastases in 40 patients. The present study confirmed that patients with low advancement stage had better prognoses than patients with advanced disease, as confirmed by OS rates in groups TI vs. T3 (p = 0.066) and T3 vs. T4 (p = 0.066). What was in- teresting was that the disease-free survival (DFS) in the group of patients with T3 cancer was longer than in the group of patients with TI cancer. Time to marker progression (Ca 125) was longer in groups with FIGO Stage I vs. II and I vs. III (p = 0.01 6,p = 0.044), while the time to progression in FIGO Stage II cancer patients was shorter than in FIGO Stage III cancer patients. An interesting result was also obtained in the analysis of 36-month survival where a larger number of patients without the disease symptoms had T3 Stage cancer. New prospective studies, designed to include the aspects of target volumes, total doses and fraction doses, together with the use of state of the art planning techniques, and therapeutic instrumentation are required.
