Liver and biliary tract cancers are highly aggressive, are heterogeneous in their phenotypic traits, and result in clinical outcomes that are difficult to manage. Cancers have subpopulations of cells termed "cancer stem cells" (CSCs) that share common intrinsic signaling pathways for self-renewal and differentiation with normal stem cells. These CSCs likely have the potential to evolve over time and to give rise to new genetically and functionally diverse subclones by accumulating genetic mutations. Extrinsic signaling from the tumor microenvironment, including the CSC niche, has been implicated in tumor initiation/progression and heterogeneity through dynamic crosstalk. CSCs have become recognized as pivotal sources of tumor initiation/progression, relapse/metastasis, and chemoresistance.Conclusion:The origins of CSCs are hypothesized to derive from the transformation of normal stem/progenitors and/or from the reprogramming of adult cells that converts them to stem/progenitor traits; however, the precise mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated.
