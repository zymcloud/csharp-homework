Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the fastest rising causes of cancer-related deaths in the United States, with disparities observed in cancer incidence and survival between ethnic groups. This report provides updated analyses on race-specific disparities in US HCC trends.Methods:This large, population-based cohort study was conducted using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry data from 2003 to 2011 to investigate race-specific disparities in HCC incidence and survival. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards models.Results:From 2003 to 2011, Asians had the highest HCC incidence, followed by blacks, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites. During the same period, Hispanics had the greatest increase in HCC incidence (+35.8%), whereas Asians experienced a 5.5% decrease. Although patients aged ≥65 years had the highest HCC incidence among all racial/ethnic groups, the higher HCC incidence in Asians was observed only for patients ages Conclusions:Asians were the only group to demonstrate a declining HCC incidence in the form of a shift from advanced HCC to more localized HCC. These findings most likely reflect improved screening and surveillance efforts for this group. Cancer 2016;122:2512-23. © 2016 American Cancer Society.
