Objectives:We investigated the frequencies and factors associated with the presence of extra-hepatic feeding arteries (EHFAs) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using intra-arterial CT aortography images.Methods:A total of 173 patients with HCC who underwent transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in our institution between January 2013 and March 2015 were enrolled. The types of EHFAs were evaluated by CT aortography images using an apparatus that combines multidetector-row computed tomography and angiography system. In addition, factors associated with the presence of EHFAs were determined.Results:EHFAs were present in 22 (12.7%) patients with HCC. EHFAs most frequently branched from the right inferior phrenic artery (n=19), while others branched from the right adrenal artery (n=2), right renal artery (n=2), right internal thoracic artery (n=2), branches of the superior mesenteric artery (n=1), and an unknown artery from the aorta (n=1). Factors significantly associated with the presence of EHFAs in multivariate analysis were tumor size≥30mm (odds ratio (OR), 5.233 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.507-17.413]; p=0.009) and number of prior TACE treatments≥3 (OR, 6.847 [95% CI, 1.928-24.311]; p=0.003).Conclusions:EHFAs of HCC were assessed with CT aortography images. Repeat TACE treatments and large tumor size were risk factors for the presence of EHFAs.
