Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major worldwide problem, which involves approximately 170 million people. High morbidity of patients is caused by chronic infection, which leads to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and other HCV-related diseases. The sustained virological response (SVR) has been markedly improved to be >90% by the current standard interferon (IFN)-free treatment regimens with a combination of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) targeting the viral NS3 protease, NS5A multi-function protein and NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, compared with 50-70% of SVR rates achieved by the previous standard IFN-based treatment regimens with or without an NS3 protease inhibitor. However, the emergence of DAA-resistant HCV strains and the limited access to the DAAs due to their high cost could be major concerns. Also, the long-term prognosis of patients treated with DAAs, such as the possible development of hepatocellular carcinoma, still needs to be further evaluated. Natural resources are considered to be good candidates to develop anti-HCV agents. Here, we summarize anti-HCV compounds obtained from natural resources, including medicinal plant extracts, their isolated compounds and some of their derivatives that possess high antiviral potency against HCV.
