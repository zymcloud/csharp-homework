This study was to explore the association between gene variants and p21 expression and investigate the TP53-independent p21 regulation in hepatitis B virus (HBV) related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients from Guangxi by genome-wide association study. 426 HBV-related HCC patients were enrolled. Results showed that, after quality control, a total of 21,643 SNPs were identified in 107 p21 positive and 298 p21 negative patients. The variants of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; rs2227983 and rs6950826) and spectrin repeat containing, nuclear envelope 2 (SYNE2; rs8010699, rs4027405 and rs1890908) were associated with p21 expression. Moreover the haplotype block (rs2227983 and rs6950826, r(2) = 0.378) in EGFR and the haplotype block in SYNE2 (rs8010699 was in strong LD with rs4027405 and rs1890908 (r(2) = 0.91 and 0.70, respectively)) were identified, and the haplotype A-G of EGFR and haplotype G-A-A of SYNE2 were significantly associated with p21 expression (P
