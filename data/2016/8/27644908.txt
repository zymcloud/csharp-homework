Technical developments allowed stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to deliver effective doses of irradiation with high precision in a small number of fractions. This paper reviews the role of SBRT for liver metastases, hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, paying special attention to patient eligibility and treatment outcomes regarding local control, toxicity and quality of life. As well as discussing specific issues of these different tumors, such as the presence of underlying liver cirrhosis and the impact on toxicity, it outlines the limitations of SBRT and future areas of development and research.
