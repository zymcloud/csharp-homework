Phytochemical study of the methanolic root extract of Flueggea virosa allowed for the characterization of 18 non-alkaloid terpenoids. Their structures have skeletons composed of six rearranged ent-podocarpanes, 11 ent-podocarpanes, and a 3,4-seco-30-nor-friedelane. These were characterized based on 2D NMR, IR, UV, and MS spectroscopic analysis and their absolute configurations were determined by single-crystal X-ray studies, as well as by (1)H NMR spectroscopic analysis for the corresponding chiral derivatives. The isolates were evaluated for therapeutic potential against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection to human hepatoma Huh7.5 cells.
