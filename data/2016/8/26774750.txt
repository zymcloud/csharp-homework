Background:Obstructive Jaundice (OJ) is associated with a significant risk of developing acute renal failure (ARF). The involvement of oxidative stress in the development of cholestasis has been demonstrated in different experimental models. However, its role in the morbidity of human cholestasis is far to be elucidated. The aim of the study was the evaluation of oxidative stress markers in blood from patients with OJ and its relation to complications and benign/malignant evolution of cholestasis.Methods:A prospective cross-sectional study of 105 patients with OJ and 34 control subjects were included. Several markers of liver function and oxidative stress, such as lipoperoxides (LPO), as well as reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were assessed.Results:The patients with OJ showed a marked increase in plasma levels of LPO, SOD and GSH, while GSH-Px levels were decreased. The increase in lipid peroxidation products and the depletion of SOD activity in blood were also related to renal dysfunction. The highest level of LPO was associated with malignant etiology of the disease. The logistic regression analysis showed that the age of the patient and the levels of LPO in blood were predictors of renal dysfunction in OJ patients.Conclusions:This study demonstrates a correlation between oxidative stress and renal dysfunction patients with OJ.
