The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR), which is expressed mainly in hepatocytes, is downregulated in poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we investigated the role of ASGR1 in HCC metastasis as well as the possible underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that ASGR1 was downregulated in HCC tissue compared with adjacent non-tumorous liver tissue and that lower ASGR1 expression was associated with higher TNM stage and poorer prognosis in HCC patients. ASGR1 overexpression inhibited hepatoma cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo, while ASGR1 knockdown had the opposite effects. Furthermore, ASGR1 interacted directly with human longevity assurance homolog 2 of yeast LAG1 (LASS2). Knockdown of LASS2 attenuated the inhibitory effects of ASGR1 on hepatoma cell migration and invasion in vitro. ASGR1 decreased V-ATPase activity in hepatoma cells, and this was reversed by LASS2 knockdown. Finally, HCC patients with low LASS2 levels had poor prognosis, while those with high ASGR1 and LASS2 levels had better prognosis. Thus, ASGR1 may act as a potential metastasis suppressor in HCC, and the combination of ASGR1 and LASS2 may help predict the prognosis of HCC patients.
