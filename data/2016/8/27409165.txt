Maspin is a tumor suppressor that stimulates apoptosis and inhibits metastasis in various cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our previous study has demonstrated that HBx induced microRNA-7, 103, 107, and 21 expressions to suppress maspin expression, leading to metastasis, chemoresistance, and poor prognosis in HCC patients. However, it remains unclear how HBx elicits these microRNA expressions. HBx has been known to induce aberrant activation and nuclear translocation of inhibitor-κB kinase-α (IKKα) to promote HCC progression. In this study, our data further revealed that nuclear IKKα expression was inversely correlated with maspin expression in HBV-associated patients. Nuclear IKKα but not IKKβ reduced maspin protein and mRNA expression, and inhibition of IKKα reverses HBx-mediated maspin downregulation and chemoresistance. In response to HBx overexpression, nuclear IKKα was further demonstrated to induce the gene expressions of microRNA-7, -103, -107, and -21 by directly targeting their promoters, thereby leading to maspin downregulation. These findings indicated nuclear IKKα as a critical regulator for HBx-mediated microRNA induction and maspin suppression, and suggest IKKα as a promising target to improve the therapeutic outcome of HCC patients.
