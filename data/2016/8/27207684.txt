Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) is a chemical broadly used in animal models as a hepatocarcinogen, reported to also cause pulmonary neoplasms in mice. The original objective was to evaluate the impact of a Western diet with or without 10% broccoli on DEN-induced on liver cancer. We administered DEN (45 mg/kg) intraperitoneally to young adult male B6C3F1 mice by 6 weekly injections and evaluated liver cancer 6 months after the DEN treatments. Here, we report unexpected primary tumorigenesis in nasal epithelium, independent of dietary treatment. More than 50% of DEN-treated B6C3F1 mice developed nasal neoplasm-related lesions, not reported previously in the literature. Only one of these neoplasms was visible externally prior to postmortem examination. Intraperitoneal DEN treatment used as a model for liver cancer can have a carcinogenic effect on the nasal epithelium in B6C3F1 mice, which should be carefully monitored in future liver cancer studies.
