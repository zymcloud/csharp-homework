The NOTCH signalling pathway is one of the key molecular pathways of embryonic development and adult tissues homeostasis in mammals. Mammals have four NOTCH receptors and various ligands that modulate their activity. Many cell disorders, whose genesis involves the NOTCH signalling pathway, have been discovered, including cancer. The mechanisms by which these receptors and their ligands affect liver cell transformation are not yet well understood, and they seem to behave as both oncogenes and tumour-suppressor proteins. In this review, we discuss the published data regarding the role of these proteins in the development of hepatoblastoma, cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma malignancies. The alteration of the NOTCH signalling pathway may be one of the main drivers of hepatic neoplastic growth. However, this signalling pathway might also modulate the development of specific liver tumour features. The complexity of the function of NOTCH receptors and their ligands may be due to their interactions with many other cell signalling pathways. Furthermore, the different levels of expression and activation of these receptors could be a reason for their distinct and sometimes contradictory effects.
