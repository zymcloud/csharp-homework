Background:NAFLD impacts patient reported outcomes (PROs). Our aim was to assess the impact of NAFLD on patients' HRQOL.Methods:National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2011 data were used to identify adult patients with NAFLD [Fatty Liver Index (FLI) > 60 in absence of other liver disease and excessive alcohol >20 g/day for men, >10 g/day for women]. Patients with other chronic diseases (ex. HIV, cancer, end-stage kidney disease) were excluded. Subjects without any of these conditions were healthy controls. HCV RNA (+) patients were HCV-controls. All patients completed NHANES HRQOL-4 questionnaire. Linear regression determined the association between NAFLD and HRQOL components adjusting for age, gender, race, and BMI.Results:Participants with complete data were included (n = 9661); 3333 NAFLD (age 51 years and BMI 34 kg/m(2)); 346 HCV+ (age 49 years; BMI 27 kg/m(2)) and 5982 healthy controls (age 48 years and BMI 26 kg/m(2)). The proportion of subjects rating their health as "fair" or "poor" in descending order were HCV controls (30 %) NAFLD (20 %) and healthy controls (10 %) (p < 0.001). HRQOL-4 components scores 2-4 were lowest for HCV, followed by NAFLD and then healthy controls (p-values p = 0.011 to < .0001). After adjustment for age, gender, race, and BMI, NAFLD patients were 18-20 % more likely to report days when their physical health wasn't good or were unable to perform daily activities as a result (p < .0001).Conclusions:NAFLD causes impairment of HRQOL. As NAFLD is becoming the most important cause of CLD, its clinical and PRO impact must be assessed.
