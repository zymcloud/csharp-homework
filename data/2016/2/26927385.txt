Objective:To investigate the clinicopathological significance of ezrin and SIX1 overexpression in alpha fetoprotein (AFP)-negative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The EnVision immunohistochemical method was used to detect the protein expression of ezrin and SIX1 in the tumor tissues and corresponding adjacent normal liver tissues from 50 AFP-negative HCC patients. The correlations between the overexpression of ezrin and SIX1 and the prognosis of the patients with HCC were analyzed by Chi-square test and Spearman analysis.Results:The positive rates of ezrin and SIX1 protein expression in AFP-negative HCC tissues were 68.0% (34/50) and 60.0% (30/50), respectively, and they were significantly higher than the expression rates [38.0% (19/50) and 26.0% (13/50)] in adjacent normal liver tissues. Chi-square test showed that the expression of both ezrin and SIX1 proteins were related to TNM stage and lymphovascular infiltration, and Spearman analysis revealed a positive correlation between ezrin and SIX1 expression in AFP-negative HCC.Conclusion:Both Ezrin and SIX1 proteins are highly expressed in AFP-negative HCC, and significantly related with the TNM stage and lymphovascular infiltration of patients with AFP-negative HCC. In addition, there is a positive correlation between ezrin and SIX1 expression in AFP-negative HCC.
