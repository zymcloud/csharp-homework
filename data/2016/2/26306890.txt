Background:The lung is the most common site of extrahepatic metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance and long-term outcomes of pulmonary metastasectomy for HCC, especially in patients with multiple nodules or repeated pulmonary recurrence.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 19 patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy for HCC at our institution from 1993 to 2013.Results:No in-hospital mortality occurred. The 19 patients included 14 men. The median age was 61 (range 20-76) years. Eight patients (42 %) had single pulmonary metastatic lesions, whereas 4 (21 %) had >10 lesions. Median follow-up after pulmonary metastasectomy was 23.1 (6.3-230) months. Twelve patients died, and the cause of death was HCC progression in nine. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival rates after pulmonary metastasectomy were 89, 48, 48, and 21 %, respectively. Seven patients developed pulmonary recurrence after initial pulmonary metastasectomy. Five of the seven underwent repeat metastasectomy, with a median survival time of 65 months, and 2- and 3-year survival rates of 100 and 67 %, respectively. The 2- and 3-year survival rates in the four patients with >10 pulmonary nodules were 75 and 50 %, respectively.Conclusions:Surgical resection is a safe and effective treatment in selected patients with pulmonary metastasis from HCC, even in those with multiple nodules. Repeated locoregional therapy for lung recurrence might help to improve survival in these patients.
