Objective:To explore the clinical and pathological factors influencing the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)(≤5 cm) after hepatectomy.Methods:Two hundreds and nineteen cases with HCC(≤5 cm) undergoing hepatectomy in Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences between December 2003 and July 2013 were collected. The alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level, tumor number, tumor size (diameter), liver cirrhosis, vascular invasion, capsular invasion, differentiation, surgical methods, resection margin, the way of treatments, the situation of recurrence and time to recurrence were analyzed. Log-rank test and the stepwise Cox proportional-hazards models were used to compare the prognosis, respectively.Results:The 1-, 3-, 5- and 10- year overall survival rates were 95.9%, 85.3%, 67.8% and 53.3% respectively in all patients.Single factor analysis indicated that vascular invasion, capsular invasion, tumor size, hepatic vascular occult, liver cirrhosis, tumor differentiation, AFP, the way of treatments, the situation of recurrence and time to recurrence can affect the prognosis significantly (all PConclusion:The prognosis of patients with HCC(≤5 cm) underwent hepatectomy are affected by multi-factors, such as AFP, tumor differentiation, liver cirrhosis, capsular invasion, tumor size and the situation of recurrence and time to recurrence.
