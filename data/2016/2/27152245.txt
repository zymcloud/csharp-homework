Colonic hepatic tumor overexpressed gene (ch-TOG), a member of the highly conserved XMAP215 family of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), plays a crucial role in bipolar mitotic spindle assembly. Here, we performed proof-of-principle studies targeting ch-TOG for the development of HCC and further compared its prognostic significance with the clinicopathologic features of HCC. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure the expression level of ch-TOG mRNA in 207 cases of paired HCC and adjacent noncancerous liver tissues (ANLT). Additionally, immunohistochemistry was employed to identify ch-TOG protein in 71 HCC tissues. All HCC patients were divided into two groups according to the expression level of ch-TOG. Cumulative progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the prognostic value of ch-TOG was further evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Our studies suggested that ch-TOG is overexpressed in HCC tissues compared with ANLT. The ch-TOG level was correlated with other prognostic factors, including the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (p = 0.030), median size (p = 0.008), clinical tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (p = 0.002), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level (p = 0.030). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that increased ch-TOG was associated with reduced PFS (p = 0.002) and OS (p = 0.004). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis identified ch-TOG as an independent prognostic factor for the PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.479, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.028-2.127, p = 0.035) and OS (HR = 1.609, 95% CI = 1.114-2.325, p = 0.011) of the HCC patients. Increased ch-TOG represents a powerful marker for predicting poorer prognosis in the clinical management of HCC, and may serve as a potential molecular target for HCC therapies in the future.
