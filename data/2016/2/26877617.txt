Aim:To evaluate the feasibility and survival outcomes of a liver-first approach.Methods:Between January 2009 and April 2013, 18 synchronous colorectal liver metastases (sCRLMs) patients with a planned liver-first approach in the Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery Department I of the Beijing Cancer Hospital were enrolled in this study. Clinical data, surgical outcomes, morbidity and mortality rates were collected. The feasibility and long-term outcomes of the approach were retrospectively analyzed.Results:Sixteen patients (88.9%) completed the treatment protocol for primary and liver tumors. The main reason for treatment failure was liver disease recurrence. The 1 and 3 year overall survival rates were 94.4% and 44.8%, respectively. The median survival time was 30 mo. The postoperative morbidity and mortality were 22.2% and 0%, respectively, following a hepatic resection, and were 18.8% and 0%, respectively, after a colorectal surgery.Conclusion:The liver-first approach appeared to be feasible and safe. It can be performed with a comparable mortality and morbidity to the traditional treatment paradigm. This approach might offer a curative opportunity for sCRLM patients with a high liver disease burden.
