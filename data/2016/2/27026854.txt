To clarify the hemodynamic changes under balloon occlusion of the hepatic artery and to identify predictors of the short-term therapeutic effect (TE) after balloon-occluded transcatheter arterial chemoembolization using miriplatin (B-TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Tumor variables and angiographic data were collected for 35 nodules (29 patients) with a B-TACE for HCC. Lesions were classified into three groups based on the balloon-occluded CT hepatic arteriography (BO-CTHA) results: Group A, presence of corona enhancement; Group B, absence of corona enhancement; Group C, decreased perfusion or perfusion defect compared to standard CTHA. Objective response was defined as TE3/4, and poor TE as TE1/2, evaluated by response evaluation criteria in cancer of the liver at 1-4 months after the procedure. Univariate analysis revealed that proximal level of balloon occlusion, intratumoral lower CT values immediately after treatment and BO-CTHA findings were significantly correlated with poor TE (p = 0.034, 0.037, and 0.003, respectively). Multivariate logistic analysis identified the Group C as a significant factor associated with the worse short term TE (odds ratio 8.34; 95 % confidence interval 1.49-68.8). Partial or complete perfusion defect on BO-CTHA was an independent factor associated with poor therapeutic effect.
