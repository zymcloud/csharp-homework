Objective:Haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) plays important roles in cytoprotection and tumour growth. Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a deadly malignancy with very poor prognosis. The role of HO-1 in tumour progression in CCA up to now has been relatively unexplored, thus, its possible therapeutic implications in CCA have been investigated here.Materials and methods:HO-1 expression in tumour tissues from 50 CCA patients was determined by immunohistochemical analysis and its association with survival time was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Its role in CCA cells in vitro was evaluated by transwell and wound healing assays and suppression of HO-1 expression by siRNA. Effects of HO-1 inhibition on gemicitabine (GEM)-mediated tumour suppression was evaluated in nude mice xenografted with CCA cells.Results:HO-1 expression was inversely associated with median overall survival time. Hazard ratio of patients with high HO-1 expression was 2.42 (95% CI: 1.16-5.08) with reference to low expression and HO-1 knock-down expression inhibited transwell cell migration. Suppression of HO-1 by Zn-protoporphyrin (ZnPP) enhanced cytotoxicity to GEM in CCA cells, validated in CCA xenografts. Treatment with GEM and ZnPP almost completely arrested tumour growth, whereas treatment with only a single reagent, retarded it. Tumour inhibition was associated with reduction in expression of Ki-67 and microvascular density, and enhanced p53 and p21 immunohistochemical staining.Conclusion:High HO-1 expression was associated with poor prognosis of CCA. Synergistic role of HO-1 inhibition in chemotherapy of CCA is a promising insight for treatment of this tumour and warrants further investigation.
