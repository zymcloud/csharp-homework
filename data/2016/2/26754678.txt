Purpose:Portal vein tumor thrombosis is a critical complication in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This prospective multicenter trial assessed the efficacy of hepatic arterial infusion chemoembolization therapy with cisplatin suspended in lipiodol combined with 5-fluorouracil for HCC patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis.Methods:We enrolled 52 HCC patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis. They received hepatic arterial infusion chemoembolization therapy with cisplatin suspension in lipiodol and 5-fluorouracil. The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), while the secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), tumor response rate, safety, and tolerability. Independent factors for survival were also evaluated.Results:The median PFS and OS were 8.6 and 27.0 months, respectively. Ten patients showed complete response, while 29 had partial response (response rate, 75.0 %). The median survival time of 10 patients with complete response and 29 with partial response was 32 months, while that of 15 patients with partial response who later showed disappearance of HCC following additional therapies was 50 months. Multivariate analysis identified response to treatment and disappearance of viable HCC as independent predictors of survival. The treatment was well tolerated, and the only encountered Grade 3 toxicities were thrombocytopenia and hyperbilirubinemia.Conclusions:Hepatic arterial infusion chemoembolization therapy with cisplatin suspension in lipiodol combined with 5-fluorouracil is effective treatment for unresectable HCC with portal vein tumor thrombosis.
