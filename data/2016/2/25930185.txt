Background:Metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is commonly treated with palliative chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to review the feasibility of metastasectomy for metachronous pulmonary and hepatic metastases from NPC.Methods:We present 6 patients who developed metachronous metastases from NPC (4 patients with pulmonary metastases and 2 patients with hepatic metastases) and underwent curative resection.Results:Four patients are still alive with no recurrence of NPC after metastasectomy. Two patients died with postoperative survival periods of 57 and 70 months and recurrence-free intervals of 14 and 39 months, respectively.Conclusion:Metastasectomy is a feasible option for the treatment of metachronous and resectable oligometastatic NPC to the lung and liver. Application of appropriate selection criteria would be required.
