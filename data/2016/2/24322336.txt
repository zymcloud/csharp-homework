Objectives:To date, no second-line chemotherapy regimen for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has been established. This clinical trial aimed to assess the optimum dose of docetaxel plus nedaplatin (cis-diammine-glycolate platinum) as second-line chemotherapy.Methods:Patients with metastatic or recurrent esophageal SCC after treatment with cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil received docetaxel (50 or 60 mg/m) plus nedaplatin (70 mg/m²) on day 1 every 4 weeks. The recommended dose was based on dose-limiting toxicities defined during the first cycle.Results:From February 2009 to November 2011, 9 patients were enrolled in the study. Their median age was 62 years (range, 58 to 72 y). Six patients had undergone radiotherapy and 4 had undergone surgical resection of primary lesions. Dose-limiting toxicities were observed in 2 patients at dose level 1 (60 mg/m² docetaxel, 70 mg/m² nedaplatin) but not at dose level 0 (50 mg/m² docetaxel, 70 mg/m nedaplatin). Thus, the maximum tolerated dose was established at dose level 1. No severe nonhematological toxicity was observed. No patient achieved complete response, but 2 (22%; 95% confidence interval, 0%-49%) achieved partial response and 3 had stable disease. Median progression-free and overall survival times were 2.1 and 9.5 months, respectively.Conclusions:Docetaxel plus nedaplatin chemotherapy seems to be a safe and feasible second-line regimen for the treatment of esophageal SCC. We recommend the administration of 50 mg/m² docetaxel (day 1) plus 70 mg/m² nedaplatin (day 1) every 4 weeks in a phase II study.
