Background:Variceal bleeding can be the first manifestation of patients with newly diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and effective treatments deserve to be explored for these patients.Methods:A prospectively collected database of HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy identified 75 patients who presented with variceal bleeding. Among them, 31 patients underwent concomitant Hassab's operation. The clinical variables and outcomes were compared between the Hassab and non-Hassab groups.Results:The postoperative morbidity and 90-days mortality were 44.0% and 6.7% respectively. Variceal re-bleeding and tumor recurrence occurred in 28.8% and 52.1% of surviving patients after surgery, and the 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 87.7, 66.8, and 50.3%. There were no significant differences in morbidity, mortality and postoperative recurrence between the Hassab and non-Hassab groups. However, patients in the Hassab group had significantly higher 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates (P = 0.038), and significantly lower rate of re-bleeding (13.3% vs. 39.5%, P = 0.014) than those in the non-Hassab group. On multivariable analysis, concomitant Hassab's operation was independently predicted longer overall survival.Conclusion:Liver resection could safely be performed in selected patients with HCC who presented with variceal bleeding, and concomitant Hassab's operation may improve long-term prognosis for these patients.
