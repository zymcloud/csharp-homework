Background:This study assessed the prognostic impact of the liver-directed local tumor therapy in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with extrahepatic metastases.Methods:Metastatic HCC patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2013 were identified from the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) database. Propensity-matched analysis was performed considering baseline characteristics (age, gender, race, histology, TNM stage, site of metastases, fibrosis score and alpha fetoprotein).Results:A total of 2529 patients were identified. The median age was 65 years, and 151 patients received liver-directed local treatment (either surgical treatment or local destructive treatment). Both before and after propensity score matching, cancer-specific and overall survival (p Conclusion:This analysis suggests that liver-directed local treatment may play a role -in addition to systemic treatment- in the management of selected patients with metastatic HCC. Further prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm or deny this hypothesis.
