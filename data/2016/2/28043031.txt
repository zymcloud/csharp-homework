Background and aim:Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and liver fibrosis is strongly associated with HCC. Treatment options are limited, and preventive strategies should be developed. An important step in the beginning of liver fibrosis is a strong inflammatory response. 5-HT7 is the last recognized member of the serotonin receptor family and is expressed in both central nerve system and peripheral system and have a lot of functions like learning, memory, smooth muscular relaxation, in the control of circadian rhythms and thermoregulation, pain and migraine, schizophrenia, anxiety, cognitive disturbances, and even inflammation.Methods:We therefore examined the biochemical, histopathological and molecular effects of the 5-HT7 receptor agonist and antagonist on inflammatory liver fibrogenesis in animal models of progressive cirrhosis: a mouse model induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and in Hep3b cells.Results:5-HT7 expression was observed in the liver in vivo and in vitro in CCl4-induced damage. 5-HT7 receptor agonist but not the antagonist reduced liver markers in mice and in Hep3b cells in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced damage. 5-HT7 agonist, but not antagonist, protected liver tissue from oxidative stress in fibrosis. 5-HT7 agonist but not antagonist induces anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrinotic and anti-cytokine features in liver fibrosis in vivo and in vitro.Conclusions:5-HT7 receptors have modulatory function and are an up-and-coming pharmacological target in the inflammatory fibrotic process. 5-HT7 receptor agonist LP-44 showed significant hepatoprotective effects against liver fibrosis, and LP-44 might become a useful therapeutic target for chronic liver inflammation and fibrosis.
