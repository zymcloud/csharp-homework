It is important that patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are diagnosed and treated early to prevent serious complications, such as liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. However, current methods for NASH diagnosis are invasive given that they rely on liver biopsy, making early diagnosis difficult. In this study, we developed novel noninvasive markers for the diagnosis of NASH and NASH-related fibrosis. A total of 132 Japanese patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were included in this study. Blood samples were collected, and 261 biomolecules were quantified in serum. Using cluster and pathway analyses, we identified biomolecule modules connected to biological events that occur with disease progression to NASH. The modules were used as variables for diagnosis, leading to a NASH diagnostic marker associated with two biological events, that is, protective response to hepatic steatosis and hepatitis-causing innate immune response. Regarding the NASH-related fibrosis marker, immunological responses to hepatocyte injury were identified as a biological event. To develop diagnostic markers for NASH and NASH-related fibrosis, specific biomolecules were selected from each biomolecule module. The former marker was obtained by averaging the levels of four biomolecules, whereas the latter was obtained by averaging the levels of two biomolecules. Both markers achieved a diagnostic accuracy of almost 0.9 of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and the latter exhibited equivalent performance in an independent group of 62 prospectively recruited patients.Conclusion:We developed highly accurate markers for the diagnosis of both NASH and NASH-related fibrosis (i.e., FM-NASH index and FM-fibro index, respectively). These markers may be used as an alternative diagnostic tool to liver biopsy.
