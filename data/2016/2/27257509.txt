Introduction:Small cell carcinoma constitutes the most aggressive type of lung cancer, with the greatest propensity for early disseminated disease. Although commonly neglected due to its rarity and the presence of other comorbidities, cases of iris metastasis from small cell lung cancer have been reported in the literature.Case presentation:We present the case of a 76-year-old female. Once diagnosed, the patient already had disseminated disease with metastatic foci found in the spleen, liver, and brain. The patient received six cycles of combination carboplatin/etoposide chemotherapy, followed by cranial irradiation. After an initial response, two months after the completion of cranial irradiation, the patient complained of visual impairment and was referred to an ophthalmologist. A diagnosis of secondary glaucoma was made, caused by metastasis to the left iris.Conclusions:Physicians should be aware of this rare site of metastasis. Early diagnosis is of paramount importance in order to effectively prevent the significant morbidity this condition can cause if left untreated.
