Lactic acid bacteria have been identified to be effective in reducing cholesterol levels. Most of the mechanistic studies were focused on the bile salt deconjugation ability of bile salt hydrolase in lactic acid bacteria. However, the mechanism by which Lactobacillus decreases cholesterol levels has not been thoroughly studied in intact primate cells. 3-Hydroxy-3- methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) is the vital enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. To confirm the effect of probiotic Lactobacillus strains on HMGCR level, in the present study, human hepatoma HepG2 cells were treated with Lactobacillus strains, and then the HMGCR level was illustrated by luciferase reporter assay and RT-PCR. The results showed that the level of HMGCR was suppressed after being treated with the live Lactobacillus strains. These works might set a foundation for the following study of the antihyperlipidemic effects of L. acidophilus, and contribute to the development of functional foods or drugs that benefit patients suffering from hyperlipidemia diseases.
