Background:Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) can be used to screen for biliary tract cancer in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).Aim:To study the influence of benign dominant strictures (DS), superimposed bacterial cholangitis (SBC), smoking status, and inflammatory bowel disease on CEA serum levels.Methods:A retrospective analysis of CEA values in cancer-free PSC patients was performed. We included the maximal CEA value obtained during follow-up and information on the presence of DS and SBC at that time, and we analyzed the CEA values in the presence and absence of DS and SBC. Results are reported as medians with the interquartile range (IQR).Results:The median maximal CEA level, which was 1.8 ng/mL (IQR 1.2-2.9) in the final 270 PSC patients included in the study, was not influenced by the presence of either DS or SBC (P = 0.320). Moreover, in 49 patients, the first CEA value available at the time of DS (1.5 ng/mL; IQR 1.2-2.1) and that at a time without DS (1.6 ng/mL; IQR 1.1-2.3) did not differ significantly (P = 0.397). Lastly, in 24 patients, the median CEA values at a time without SBC (1.8 ng/mL; IQR 1.2-2.5) and at the time of SBC (1.8 ng/mL; IQR 1.0-3.0) were comparable (P = 0.305). Smoking did not influence CEA-based cancer screening.Conclusions:Serum CEA level is not influenced by the presence of DS or SBC and might therefore serve as a favorable parameter for improving cancer screening in PSC patients.
