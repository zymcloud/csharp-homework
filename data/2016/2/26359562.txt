A 26-year-old woman with a 5-year history of metastatic paraganglioma due to hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma syndrome with SDHB mutation, who had failed multiple treatment regimens and had transfusion dependent pancytopenia, presented with progressive liver and bone metastases. She was unable to sleep due to painful skull metastases and had severe weakness in her extremities that limited her mobility and daily activities. She was treated with 2 doses of Ra-dichloride (Xofigo, Ra) and had a dramatic improvement in pain control, mobility, and overall quality of life for 8 weeks, before passing away from pulmonary hemorrhage.
