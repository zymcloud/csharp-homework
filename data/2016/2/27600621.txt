Background:Systemic hemostasis and thrombosis activation has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis. This study aimed to investigate the use of coagulation factors as a novel prediction method for postoperative outcomes after curative gastrectomy in patients with stage II/III gastric cancer (GC).Methods:Overall, 126 patients with stage II/III GC who underwent gastrectomy between May 2003 and February 2016 were eligible for inclusion in the study. We retrospectively evaluated the predictive value of preoperative platelet count and plasma fibrinogen and d-dimer levels, and coagulation score (0: fibrinogen and d-dimer both below upper limits; 1: either fibrinogen or d-dimer over upper limits; 2: both fibrinogen and d-dimer over upper limits) for short- and long-term outcomes.Results:Postoperative complications were significantly more frequent in patients with elevated preoperative d-dimer levels compared with those with normal d-dimer levels (26 vs. 10 %; p = 0.032). The prevalence of postoperative complications showed a stepwise increase in proportion to the coagulation score. Patients with a coagulation score of 2 had significantly larger tumors (p = 0.013) and significantly greater intraoperative blood loss (p = 0.004) than those who scored 0 or 1. Coagulation score showed the highest values distinguished high-risk patients in overall and disease-free survival, and a coagulation score of 2 was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence. Patients with a coagulation score of 2 experienced a significantly higher prevalence of liver metastasis as an initial recurrence than those who scored 0 or 1 (p = 0.019).Conclusions:The coagulation score is a simple and promising predictor for postoperative complications and recurrence after gastrectomy in stage II/III GC patients.
