Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is a human protein encoded by the ICAM-1 gene and is typically expressed on endothelial cells and immune cells. ICAM-1 is associated with episode, growth, invasion, and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the association between ICAM-1 genetic variants and the risk of HCC is undetermined. In this study, we investigated the potential associations of ICAM-1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with susceptibility to HCC and its clinicopathological characteristics. A total of 918 participants, including 613 controls participants and 305 patients with HCC, were selected for the analysis of ICAM-1 SNPs (rs3093030, rs5491, rs281432, and rs5498) by using real-time PCR genotyping. After adjusting for covariants of age, sex, and alcohol consumption, 125 smoker patients with HCC carrying at least one G genotype (AG and GG) in rs5498 were observed to have a higher HCC risk compared with 231 smoker control participants carrying the wild-type allele AA (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 1.713; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.091-2.690; P = 0.019). However, patients who possess at least one polymorphic allele of rs5498 are less prone to develop vascular invasive (AOR, 0.309; 95 % CI, 0.103-0.926; P = 0.036). The results suggest that the genetic polymorphism in ICAM-1 rs5498 SNPs with genotype AG and GG is associated with HCC risk among smokers. Moreover, gene and environment interactions of ICAM-1 rs5498 polymorphisms might alter susceptibility to liver cancer. Therefore, ICAM-1 rs5498 may serve as a marker to predict the vascular invasion risk in smoker patients with HCC.
