Background:Low medication adherence is known to contribute to worse health outcomes in the general population.Aim:We aimed to evaluate the medication regimen and determine the adherence levels among patients with end-stage liver disease.Methods:We measured adherence in patients awaiting liver transplantation at a single center using the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8), with a score Results:Of 181 patients, 33% were female, median age was 62, and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score was 13. The median (IQR) number of medications was 10 (7-13), and the MRCI was 19 (13-27). In total, 54 (30%) were high adherers, and 127 (70%) were low adherers. In total, 42% reported sometimes forgetting to take their medication and 22% reported intermittent adherence within the past 2 weeks. The most common reasons for low adherence were: forgetfulness (27%) and side effects (14%). Compared to high adherence, low adherence was associated with higher number of medications, medication complexity, and diabetes, but lower rates of hepatocellular carcinoma and self-perceived health. In univariable logistic regression, total medication number (OR 1.08), MRCI (OR 1.04), diabetes (OR 2.38), HCC (OR 0.38), and lower self-perceived health (OR 1.37), were statistically significant factors associated with non-adherence. In multivariate analysis, only medication number without supplements (OR 1.14) remained significantly associated with medication non-adherence.Conclusion:A majority of patients awaiting liver transplantation demonstrated low medication adherence. Total number of medications and regimen complexity were strong correlates of low adherence. Our data underscores the need for chronic liver disease management programs to improve medication adherence in this vulnerable population.
