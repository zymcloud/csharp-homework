Alternatively activated macrophages (M2) can secrete chemokines, such as chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17), and are associated with promoting tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed at investigating the potential role of M2 and CCL17 in progression of HCC. The levels of CCL17 expression in 90 HCC samples were characterized by tissue microarray and stratified for the postsurgical survival. MHCC97L cells were co-cultured with classically activated M1, M2 or CCL17-silencing M2(ccl17mute) or treated with conditional medium (CM) from these cells or CCL17 in vitro. The wound healing, invasion, viability and apoptosis of MHCC97L cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo were determined. The stemness of MHCC97L cells was examined by sphere formation, flow cytometry and Western blot. The relative expression levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) factors and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling were determined. Higher levels of intratumoral CCL17 expression were significantly associated with clinical pathological characteristics of HCC and with poorer overall survival rates in HCC patients (P
