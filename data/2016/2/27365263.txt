Background and aims:Endoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a rapidly evolving therapeutic modality for early esophageal squamous cell neoplasias (ESCNs). However, the feasibility of RFA for ESCNs in the setting of esophageal varices has not been reported.Methods:We retrospectively enrolled 8 consecutive patients with cirrhosis (Child-Pugh score ≤6) with early flat-type ESCNs (high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia/intramucosal cancer, and Lugol unstained lesion [USL] length ≥3 cm extending ≥1/2 the circumference) on or adjacent to esophageal varices, for which circumferential RFA was applied as the initial treatment. The primary endpoint was a complete response at 12 months, and the secondary endpoints were adverse events and procedure-related mortality.Results:The mean USL length was 5.3 cm (range, 3-10 cm), and the average length of the treatment area was 7.5 cm (range, 5-12 cm), with an average procedure time of 31.9 min (range, 25-40 min). After circumferential RFA, 3 adverse events were recorded, including 2 intramucosal hematomas and 1 mucosal laceration, all of which spontaneously resolved without further management. No massive bleeding, perforation, stricture, or hepatic failure occurred after the procedure. Six of the 8 patients achieved a complete response after single circumferential RFA, but 2 had residual squamous neoplasias. After additional focal-type RFA treatment, all achieved a complete response at 12 months. No neoplastic progression or recurrence occurred during a median follow-up period of 21.6 months (range, 13-42 months).Conclusions:RFA was associated with good treatment results, no neoplastic progression, and an acceptable adverse event profile for the treatment of early ESCNs in patients with well-compensated cirrhosis and esophageal varices.
