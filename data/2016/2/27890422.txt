Aim:To evaluate the treatment efficacy and potential complications of computed tomography (CT)-guided microwave ablation for primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Data were collected and analysed from 220 HCC patients treated with CT-guided microwave ablation and followed up for 2 years. Independent risk factors for overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) were analysed.Results:Among all cases followed, the cumulative overall survival rates at 1 and 2 years were 95.45% and 89.09%. The cumulative 1- and 2-year PFS rates were 80.90% and 62.73%. For patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) class C (n=60), the cumulative 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 89.09% and 74.54%. In this group, patients with tumour invasion of blood vessels or tumour-related symptoms suffered a worse overall survival compared to those without (p=0.011). No fatal complications were observed. Child-Pugh score (p=0.030) and BCLC class (p=0.012) were independent risk factors for overall survival. The number of tumour nodules was an independent risk factor for reoccurrence.Conclusion:CT-guided percutaneous microwave ablation could be an effective and safe treatment option for HCC patients.
