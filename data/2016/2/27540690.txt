A 65-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to alcohol-related liver cirrhosis had undergone transarterial chemoembolization 11 times. However, treatment for HCC was difficult to continue, due to episodic hepatic encephalopathy. He was referred to our hospital for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, showing a Child-Pugh score of 8 despite medical therapy. Abdominal computed tomography revealed intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunt comprising two shunt tracts from the right posterior portal vein to the inferior vena cava via the right adrenal vein. The larger tract was occluded using an Amplatzer Vascular Plug (AVP) II, and the smaller tract was occluded using an original AVP. The postembolization course was uneventful. Hepatic encephalopathy improved after shunt occlusion and no recurrence had occurred as of one year after the procedure.
