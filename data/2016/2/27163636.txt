Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is a major risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. HCV Core protein has been associated with the modulation of potentially oncogenic cellular processes and E2 protein has been useful in evolutive studies to analyze the diversity of HCV. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate HCV compartmentalization in tumoral, non-tumoral liver tissue and serum and to identify viral mutations potentially involved in carcinogenesis. Samples were obtained from four patients with HCC who underwent liver transplantation. Core and E2 were amplified, cloned and sequenced. Phylogenies and BaTS Test were performed to analyze viral compartmentalization and a signature sequence analysis was conducted by VESPA. The likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies showed a wide degree of compartmentalization in the different patients, ranging from total clustering to a more scattered pattern with small groups. Nevertheless, the association test showed compartmentalization for the three compartments and both viral regions tested in all the patients. Signature amino acid pattern supported the compartmentalization in three of the cases for E2 protein and in two of them for Core. Changes observed in Core included polymorphism R70Q/H previously associated with HCC. In conclusion, evidence of HCV compartmentalization in the liver of HCC patients was provided and further biological characterization of these variants may contribute to the understanding of carcinogenesis mediated by HCV infection.
