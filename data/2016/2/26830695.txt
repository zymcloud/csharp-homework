Purpose:To evaluate the relationship between portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) response and clinical outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with transarterial chemoembolization followed by radiotherapy (TACE-RT).Materials and methods:The study enrolled 329 patients in the training set and 179 patients in the validation set. All patients who were treated with TACE-RT from 2002 to 2008 and satisfied the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. The median follow-up period was 11.7 months (range, 1.6-108.6) in the training set and 11.9 months (range, 1.7-105.1) in the validation set.Results:After TACE-RT, PVTT response was complete or partial in 32 (9.7%) and 134 (40.7%) patients of the training set and in 18 (10.1%) and 96 (53.6%) patients in the validation set, respectively. Failure to obtain PVTT response was significantly related with elevated post-treatment Child-Pugh score (PConclusions:Positive PVTT response was closely associated with favorable clinical outcomes. The PVTT response to TACE-RT reduces metastasis and makes it possible to maintain normal liver function and achieve longer survival.
