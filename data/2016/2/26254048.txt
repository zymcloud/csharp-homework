Purpose:To investigate biological impact of the downregulation of yes-associated protein (YAP) through RNA interference in the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in MHCC97H and MHCC97L.Methods:MHCC97H and MHCC97L cells were transiently transfected by YAP-siRNA. Furthermore, protein expressions and mRNA levels of characteristic markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (E-cadherin, N-cadherin) were examined by Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction, and transwell invasion assay was used to detect changes of invasiveness of MHCC97H and MHCC97L cells.Results:The transfected group with YAP-siRNA in MHCC97H after 72 h by Western blotting showed obviously higher expression of E-cadherin compared with the control group (P 0.05). Moreover, compared with the control group, Transwell invasion assay showed that the number of the transfected groups was significantly decreased in MHCC97H and MHCC97L cell lines (both P 0.05) in these two cell lines, indicating some effects of post-transcriptional regulation mechanism after silencing YAP.Conclusions:YAP expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines MHCC97H and MHCC97L is closely related with the characteristic markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, N-cadherin and E-cadherin expression.
