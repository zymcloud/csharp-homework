Background:Acute pancreatitis is a relatively rare but potentially lethal complication after transarterial chemotherapy. This study aimed to review the complications such as acute pancreatitis after transarterial chemotherapy with or without embolization for hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:A total of 1632 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who had undergone transarterial chemoembolization from January 2000 to February 2014 in a single-center were reviewed retrospectively. We investigated the potential complications of transarterial chemoembolization, such as acute pancreatitis and acute pancreatitis-related complications.Results:Of the 1632 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who had undergone 5434 transarterial chemoembolizations, 1328 were male and 304 female. The median age of these patients was 61 years. Most (79.6%) of the patients suffered from HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. The median tumor size was 5.2 cm. Of the 1632 patients, 145 patients underwent transarterial chemoembolization with doxorubicin eluting bead, making up a total of 538 episodes. The remaining patients underwent transarterial chemoembolization with cisplatin. Seven (0.4%) patients suffered from acute pancreatitis post-chemoembolization. Six patients had chemoembolization with doxorubicin and one had chemoembolization with cisplatin. Patients who received doxorubicin eluting bead had a higher risk of acute pancreatitis [6/145 (4.1%) vs 1/1487 (0.1%), PConclusions:Acute pancreatitis after transarterial chemoembolization could result in serious complications, especially after treatment with doxorubicin eluting bead. Continuation of current treatment with transarterial chemoembolization after acute pancreatitis is feasible providing the initial attack is completely resolved.
