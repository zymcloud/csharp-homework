Fibrosis following injury is a common adaptive response in the liver, which can lead to irreparable and life-threatening cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma without effectual intervention. The molecular mechanisms underlying fibrogenic response in the liver remains poorly understood. Here we report that mice with deficiency in myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A) showed resistance to thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver fibrosis with significantly reduced expression of pro-fibrogenic genes when compared to wild type littermates. Over-expression of MRTF-A enhanced whereas depletion of MRTF-A alleviated pro-fibrogenic transcription induced by TGF-β, a major pro-fibrogenic factor in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Mechanistically, MRTF-A silencing in HSCs impacted the chromatin structure by reducing the deposition of methylated histone H3K4 on the promoters of pro-fibrogenic genes. Further analyses revealed that MRTF-A interacted with and recruited several key epigenetic factors involved in H3K4 methylation, including ASH2, WDR5, and SET1, to the promoters of pro-fibrogenic genes in response to TGF-β treatment. Over-expression of ASH2, WDR5, or SET1 enhanced the transactivation of pro-fibrogenic gene promoters by TGF-β in an MRTF-A-dependent manner. In conclusion, MRTF-A regulates liver fibrosis by epigenetically tuning the TGF-β signaling pathway in HSCs.
