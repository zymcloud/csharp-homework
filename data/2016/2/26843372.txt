Background:Liver disease, one of the most common causes of hospitalization worldwide, is particularly prevalent in Europe. This study aimed to determine the number of hospital discharges and admissions, mortality, premature death and costs associated with liver disease from the perspective of the National Health Service in Portugal.Methods:A descriptive, retrospective analysis of data from 97 hospitals between 2000 and 2008, and mortality data for 2011 collected from the Portuguese National Institute of Statistics. The 9th and 10th revisions of the international classification of diseases were used to establish diagnoses. National data on demographics, average length of stay, in-patient mortality and direct costs associated with hospital admissions and liver transplantation were compared for the most common liver diseases. Mortality and premature death were compared using the potential years of life lost (PYLL) index.Results:The annual mean number of discharges for liver disease was 11,503 between 2000 and 2008. Most cases of liver disease were diagnosed in men (70.4 %) and the prevalence of liver disease peaked in patients aged from 20 to 64 years (60.7 %). Alcoholic cirrhosis was the most frequent liver-disease diagnosis leading to discharge (38.6 %). In addition, alcoholic cirrhosis emerged as the main cost-driver, accounting for â‚¬26,818,930 (42.6 %) of the total cost imposed by liver disease. Overall, chronic hepatic disease was the 10th most common cause of mortality in Portugal in 2011, causing 21.8 deaths per 100,000. Chronic hepatic disease and hepatocellular carcinoma are even more important causes of premature death, ranking third based on PYLL.Conclusion:In 2011, liver disease was the 10th most common cause of death and the third most important cause of premature death in Portugal. Alcohol cirrhosis was the leading cause of liver-related hospital admissions between 2001 and 2008. It appears that liver disease imposes a considerable social and economic burden on Portugal. Our results suggest that educational, legislative and therapeutic interventions to prevent morbidity, mortality and premature death from liver disease are urgently required to minimise the economic and clinical burdens.
