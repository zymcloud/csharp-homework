Purpose:Musashi 2 (MSI2) is reported to be a potential oncoprotein in cases of leukemia and several solid tumors. However, its expression, function, and regulation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cases have yet to be demonstrated. Therefore, in the current study, we investigated the clinical significance and biologic effects of MSI2 expression in PDAC cases and sought to delineate the clinical significance of the newly identified Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4)/MSI2 regulatory pathway.Experimental design:MSI2 expression and its association with multiple clinicopathologic characteristics in human PDAC specimens were analyzed immunohistochemically. The biological functions of MSI2 regarding PDAC cell growth, migration, invasion, and metastasis were studied using gain- and loss-of-function assays both in vitro and in vivo Regulation of MSI2 expression by KLF4 was examined in several cancer cell lines, and the underlying mechanisms were studied using molecular biologic methods.Results:MSI2 expression was markedly increased in both PDAC cell lines and human PDAC specimens, and high MSI2 expression was associated with poor prognosis for PDAC. Forced MSI2 expression promoted PDAC proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and growth and metastasis in vivo, whereas knockdown of MSI2 expression did the opposite. Transcriptional inhibition of MSI2 expression by KLF4 occurred in multiple PDAC cell lines as well as mouse models of PDAC.Conclusions:Lost expression of KLF4, a transcriptional repressor of MSI2 results in overexpression of MSI2 in PDACs, which may be a biomarker for accurate prognosis. A dysregulated KLF4/MSI2 signaling pathway promotes PDAC progression and metastasis. Clin Cancer Res; 23(3); 687-96. ©2016 AACR.
