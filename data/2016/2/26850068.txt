Background:Rebiopsy is highly recommended to identify the mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in advanced lung cancer. Recent advances in multiplex genotyping based on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) provide a strong and non-invasive alternative for detection of the resistance mechanism.Case presentation:Here we report a multiple metastatic NSCLC patient who was detected to have pure EGFR 19 exon deletion (negative for EML4-ALK and ROS1 in both IHC-based and sequencing assay) in the primary lesion and responded to first-line and second-line EGFR-TKI treatments (erlotinib then HY-15772). At 8 months, most lesions remained well controlled except for the liver metastases which presented dramatic progression. Considering the high risk of bleeding in rebiopsy of hepatic lesions, we conducted a multiplex genomic profiling with ctDNA. Results reported coexistence of EGFR mutation and EML4-ALK gene translocation in plasma which heavily indicated that ALK was the primary reason for progression of the liver lesions. This deduction was supported by the repeated response to ALK inhibitors (crizotinib then AP26113) of the hepatic metastases.Conclusions:This is the first report of the existence of ALK rearrangement in metastatic lesions in an EGFR mutated patient. It highlighted the feasibility and advantages of using ctDNA multiplex genotyping in identifying the heterogeneity across lesions and the resistance mechanism of targeted treatments.
