Human enhancer of filamentation 1 (HEF1), a scaffold protein, is highly expressed in a variety of cancer types and is involved cancer cell growth, migration and invasion. The prognostic value of HEF1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between the expression of HEF1, the clinical/pathological parameters and survival in HCC. In the present study, immunohistochemistry was performed to investigate the protein expression of HEF1 in 123 hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and their adjacent normal liver tissues. Spearman's rank correlation, Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression model were used to analyze the data. Overexpression of HEF1 protein was observed in HCC tissue when compared with their adjacent non-malignant liver tissue. High expression of HEF1 correlated with higher advanced tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) stage and vascular invasion (P
