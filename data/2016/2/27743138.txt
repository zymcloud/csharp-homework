Purpose:To propose a novel histopathological classification system for microvascular invasion (MVI) and to establish nomograms to predict postoperative survival and early tumor recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after R0 liver resection.Methods:The clinicopathological and follow-up data of 686 consecutive patients with HCC who underwent R0 liver resection in our hospital between December 2009 and April 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. A classification system was established based on histological characteristics of MVI. Nomograms were then formulated using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model to analyze. The results were validated using bootstrap resampling and a new 225-patient validation cohort operated in May and June 2010 at the same institution.Results:A 4-stratification classification system of MVI was established, which satisfactorily determined the risk of survival and early tumor recurrence. Then, an eight-factor nomogram for survival prediction and a seven-factor nomogram for prediction of early tumor recurrence were established. The concordance indices were 0.78 for the survival-prediction nomogram and 0.72 for the recurrence-prediction nomogram. These indices were both significantly higher than the following three commonly used staging systems: tumor-node-metastasis staging system (seventh edition, 0.67/0.65), Japan Integrated Staging System (0.58/0.58) and Chinese University Prognostic Index (0.52/0.51). The calibration curves showed good agreement between predictions by the nomograms and actual survival outcomes. These results were confirmed in the validation cohort.Conclusions:The novel classification system of MVI and the nomograms enabled more accurate predictions of risk of tumor recurrence and overall survival in patients with HCC after R0 liver resection.
