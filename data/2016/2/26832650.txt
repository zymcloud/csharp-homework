Objectives:The combination of simeprevir (SMV) and sofosbuvir (SOF) was found to be well-tolerated with high sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C in clinical trials. Previous experience with hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy has shown that patient tolerability and treatment efficacy described in controlled clinical trials did not necessarily mirror the "real world" experience. The goal of this study was to define SVR rates in a "real world" analysis and to explore predictors of treatment response with SMV and SOF.Methods:This is a retrospective study examining the "real world" treatment of 170 patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 using the combination of SMV and SOF with or without ribavirin (RBV) for a fixed 12-week duration irrespective of prior interferon therapy, transplant status or fibrosis stage. Differences between SVR cohorts were analyzed by both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol.Results:The vast majority of patients were genotype 1a, 77% were cirrhotic in the non-LT group, and 35% of the entire cohort was African-American. Combination treatment with SMV and SOF in genotype 1 chronic HCV patients achieved an overall SVR rate at 12 weeks after completion of therapy (SVR12) of 78% by ITT and 86% by per protocol (84% in non-liver transplant (LT) patients and 89% in post-LT recipients). The presence of hepatocellular carcinoma was found to be a significant negative predictor of SVR12, whereas an undetectable week eight VL was a significant positive predictor of SVR in the entire cohort.Conclusions:Our data confirm excellent SVR outcomes with favorable safety and tolerability profiles in patients who carry many traditional high-risk features for non-response, including post-LT recipients and patients with advanced liver disease.
