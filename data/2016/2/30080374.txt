Objective:To study the inhibitory effect and the mechanism of solid fermentation powder（ SFP） of Inonotus hispidus on H22 bearing mice.Methods:The H22 transplanted models of mice were established by H22 ascites tumor. 90 mice were divided into nine groups as control,model,cytoxan（ CTX,20 mg / kg） positive control,high-,mid-,low-dose（ 1 000,750,and 500 mg / kg） of corn SFP of Inonotus hispidus,and high-,mid-,low-dose（ 1 000,750,and 500 mg / kg） of sorghum SFP of Inonotus hispidus. On the day after being inoculated with H22 tumor cells, mice were given SFP of Inonotus hispidus once daily for consecutive 11 d. And then the increaseing of the tumor inhibitory rate,body weight,thymus,spleen,and liver indexes were calculated; and the histopathologic changes of tumor of H22 bearing mice were observed. The activities of MDA,SOD and CAT, the contents of GSH-Px in liver homogenates and blood serum,and the number of IL-2,VEGF,and IFN-γ in blood serum were detected.Results:The treatment with SFP of Inonotus hispidus significantly increased the body weight,thymus index,spleen,and liver indexes. The histopathologic study showed that the necrosis in H22 cells was induced,and the hepatic SOD,CAT,GSH-Px activities were increased,the MDA in liver homogenates and blood serum were decreased, the serum levels of IL-2 and IFN-γ were elevated, and the VEGF level was reduced.Conclusion:SFP of Inonotus hispidus have an antitumor effect on H22 bearing mice,and the possible mechanism may be due to its antioxidant activity,improving immunofunction,and antiangiogenetic action.
