Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered to be one of the most common liver pathologies that occur widely among societies with a predominance of the Western dietary pattern. NAFLD may progress from hepatic steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), subsequently leading to cirrhosis and becoming a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus its prevention and therapy play an important role in hepatology. To our knowledge, there is no effective treatment for patients with NAFLD. The aim of this review was to summarize the results of recent alternative treatment studies conducted both on cell cultures and in vivo that concern molecular effects of resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) in the treatment of NAFLD. The precise metabolism, pharmacology, and clinical trials with different concentrations of resveratrol were described. The review also presents a brief summary of other alternative treatment methods of NAFLD and their mechanisms compared with current clinical understanding.
