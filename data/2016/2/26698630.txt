A purposefully-designed anthraquinone-Pholiota squarrosa lectin (PhoSL) hybrid effectively degraded Î±-fetoprotein-L3 (AFP-L3) associated with liver cancer. Degradation was achieved under light irradiation in the absence of any additives and under neutral pH conditions. Moreover, the hybrid effectively exhibited selective photo-cytotoxicity against HuH-7 hepatocarcinoma cells upon photo-irradiation.
