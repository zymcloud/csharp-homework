Background and aim:Methylation of tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI2) gene has been detected in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the clinicopathologcial significance and prognostic value of TFPI2 methylation in HCC remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of TFPI2 methylation in HCC after hepatectomy.Methods:Methylation status of TFPI2 gene was examined in 178 surgical specimens of HCC and 20 normal liver samples using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction.Results:Methylation of TFPI2 gene was detected in 44.9% (80 of 178) of primary HCC samples, 10.7% (19 of 178) of the corresponding non-tumorous liver samples, and 5.0% (1/20) of the normal liver samples. The mRNA concentrations of TFPI2 in primary HCC tissues were significantly lower than those in corresponding non-tumorous liver tissues and those in normal liver tissues. TFPI2 methylation was significantly associated with higher TNM stage. Patients with TFPI2 methylation demonstrated a significantly poorer prognosis than those without TFPI2 methylation for both overall survival and disease-free survival (P Conclusions:Methylation of TFPI2 predicts high risk of advanced tumor stage, early tumor recurrence, and poor prognosis, and it could be a potential prognostic biomarker in patients with HCC after hepatectomy.
