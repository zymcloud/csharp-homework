We observed a sustained viral response (SVR) of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, dasabuvir and ribavirin therapy, for 12 wk, in two cases with compensated liver cirrhosis and fully destroyed early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients were infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b and were previous null responders/relapsers to interferon-alpha/ribavirin (IFN/RBV). There was a rapid suppression of HCV RNA to undetectable levels within the first two treatment weeks. SVR was achieved even after marked reduction of the RBV dose. The treatment was well tolerated. Both subjects experienced worsening of liver disease during therapy, in different patterns: severe, transient, predominantly direct hyperbilirubinemia without cytolysis (case 1) or progressive increase of aminotransferases (grade 4) without severe hyperbilirubinemia (case 2). Adverse events spontaneously resolved. The patients remained in a good clinical condition without hepatic decompensation. There was no re-occurrence of HCC. This is the first report for treatment of HCV cirrhosis after complete HCC destruction.
