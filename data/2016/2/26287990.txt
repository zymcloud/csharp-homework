Aim:We evaluated the performance of automated tumor-feeder detection (AFD) software using cone-beam computed tomography technology in identifying tumor-feeders of extrahepatic collaterals.Methods:AFD was prospectively used in superselective transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or embolization (TAE) of extrahepatic collaterals for 29 hepatocellular carcinomas and one liver metastasis (mean tumor diameter ± standard deviation, 28 ± 15.6 mm) in 25 patients. The detectability of extrahepatic tumor-feeders with non-selective digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and AFD was evaluated and compared using a χ(2) -test. Tumor response of target lesions in each patient at 2-3 months after treatment was evaluated using the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Complications were also evaluated.Results:Of 46 tumor-feeders, non-selective DSA and AFD could identify 26 and 44, respectively (P Conclusion:AFD has a sufficient ability to identify extrahepatic tumor-feeders and may improve the safety and local effects of TACE/TAE of extrahepatic collaterals.
