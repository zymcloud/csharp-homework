Background:The mechanism for hypercoagulability in malignancy is not entirely understood. Although several studies report contrasting finding about the link between elevated plasma levels of the lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and the possible recurrence of venous thromboembolism, we perform a study to evaluate the impact of the Lp(a) in the development of portal vein thromboembolism (PVT) in patients with HCC.Methods:We compared 44 PVT patients with 50 healthy subjects and 50 HCC patients.Results:The comparison between PVT patients and HCC showed in the former the mean value of serum lipoprotein levels was higher than 37.3 mg/dl (p = 0.000). The comparison between PVT versus healthy controls showed that in the former, mean value of serum lipoprotein levels was higher than 75 mg/dl (p = 0.000). The predictive value test of serum lipoprotein(a) on PVT was 0.72 and on HCC was 0.83. The odds ratio of lipoprotein(a) was 9.21 on PVT and 6.33 on HCC.Conclusion:Patients with PVT and HCC showed a statistical significant serum lipoprotein(a) level higher than the subjects with HCC and no PVT or the healthy subject. So we assume a role of lipoprotein(a) as predictor of venous thromboembolism in neoplastic patients.
