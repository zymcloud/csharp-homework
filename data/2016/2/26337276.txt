The poor prognosis, few available treatment options, and multidrug resistance present in hepatocellular carcinoma are major problems, and new early biomarkers are needed to reduce the liver cancer death rate. ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 3 (Abcc3) is overexpressed in different cancers and is associated with multidrug resistance and a carcinogenic stem cell phenotype. We present evidence for the first time that ABCC3 is a potential sanguine biomarker and anticancer target in hepatocellular carcinoma. Abcc3 mRNA expression was elevated in liver nodules and tumors in rat hepatocarcinogenesis model. Accordingly, the ABCC3 protein was preferentially overexpressed within the nodules and tumors during hepatocellular carcinoma progression and was secreted into the bloodstream of rat hepatocarcinogenesis model. The ABCC3 protein was expressed in human hepatoma cells and, importantly, was also present in HepG2- and Huh7-conditioned media. Furthermore, ABCC3 was overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma. This report is the first to describe liver overexpression of Abcc3 during the cancer initiation, promotion, and progression periods in rat hepatocarcinogenesis model and in human hepatocellular carcinoma.
