The present study aimed to evaluate the expression of microRNA-155 (miR-155) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and adjacent normal tissues, and assess its correlation with clinicopathological characteristics of this tumor type. miR-155 expression was detected in 40 HCC tissue samples and 40 samples of adjacent tumor-free tissue using fluorescent reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The association between miR-155 expression, clinicopathological features and 1-year relapse-free survival (RFS) in HCC and adjacent normal tissue samples was analyzed. RT-qPCR results revealed that, in 25 cases (62.5%), miR-155 expression levels were significantly increased in HCC tissues compared with the expression levels observed in pericarcinomatous tissues (P0.05). A positive correlation was observed between late TNM classification of malignant tumor stage and 1-year RFS (P
