Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary cancer of the liver. MicroRNA-497 (miR-497) is known to be downregulated in several types of human cancer; however, the expression, function and underlying mechanisms of miR-497 in HCC remain unclear. Therefore, the present study investigated miR-497 expression in HCC samples and HCC-derived cell lines using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The protein expression of one of the predicted common targets of miR-497, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), was assessed using western blot analyses and immunohistochemistry. The role of miR-497 in regulating the proliferation of HCC-derived cells was also investigated in vitro and in vivo. Of 60 paired specimens from HCC patients, miR-497 was downregulated in 42 cancer specimens compared with adjacent non-cancer tissues. Western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that IGF-1R expression was significantly increased in HCC compared to control tissues. In addition, overexpression of miR-497 was observed to inhibit colony formation and tumor growth in MHCC-97H human HCC cells. Conversely, SMMC-7721 human HCC cells transfected with a miR-497 inhibitor exhibited enhanced colony formation and tumor growth. Finally, IGF-1R protein, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway-associated proteins and cyclin pathway-associated proteins were differentially expressed between miR-497-overexpressing cells and miR-497-silenced cells. These results indicate that miR-497 may be a potentially effective gene therapy target.
