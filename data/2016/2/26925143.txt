Backgrounds/aims:Anatomic resection (AR) is preferred for eradicating portal tributaries in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the extent of resection is influenced by underlying liver disease and tumor location. We compared the surgical outcomes and recurrence pattern between non-anatomic resection (NR) and AR.Methods:From March 2009 to February 2012, 184 patients underwent surgical resection for HCC. Among these, 79 patients who were primarily treated for a single tumor without rupture or macroscopic vascular invasion were enrolled. The patients were divided into 2 groups based on the extent of resection: AR (n=31) or NR (n=48). We compared the clinical characteristics, overall survival, disease-free survival, pattern of recurrence, and biochemical liver functions during the perioperative period between the two groups.Results:The extent of resection had no significant effect on overall or disease-free survival rates. The overall 1- and 3-year survival rates were 97% and 82% in the AR group, and 96% and 89% in the NR group, respectively (p=0.49). In addition, the respective 1- and 3-year disease-free survival rates for the AR and NR groups were 84% and 63%, and 85% and 65%, respectively (p=0.94). On the other hand, the presence of hepatic cirrhosis and a tumor size of >5 cm were significant risk factors for recurrence according to multivariate analysis (pConclusions:Non-anatomic liver resection can be a safe and efficient treatment for patients with a solitary HCC without rupture or gross vascular invasion.
