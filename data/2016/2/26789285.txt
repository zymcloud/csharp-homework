Determinants of hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence posttransplant include hepatic tumor burden, presence of vascular invasion, and serum alpha-fetoprotein level. However, the significance of marked alpha-fetoprotein elevation in cirrhosis, in the absence of a hepatic mass lesion on imaging studies, is unclear and no longer qualifies for a Model for End-Stage Liver disease exception for transplant listing in the United States. We report a case of posttransplant metastatic recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma in a patient with marked elevation of alpha-fetoprotein pretransplant without imaging evidence of primary hepatic tumor before or after transplant or histopathologic evidence of neoplasm in the explant. This report underscores the significance of marked alpha-fetoprotein elevation in the setting of cirrhosis, even in the absence of a liver lesion, as it may identify a subset of patients with microvascular invasion and microscopic tumor cell dissemination placing them at high risk of posttransplant recurrence. Longer follow-up may be considered in these patients pretransplant to optimize outcomes by lowering posttransplant recurrence risk.
