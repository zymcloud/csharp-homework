Background:Breast cancer liver metastases (BCLM) are considered the most lethal compared with other sites of metastases in patients with breast cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the outcome after hepatectomy for BCLM within current multidisciplinary treatment and to develop a clinically useful nomogram to predict survival.Methods:Between January 1985 and December 2012, 139 consecutive female patients underwent liver resection for BCLM at the authors' institution. Clinicopathologic data were collected and analyzed for survival outcome with determination of prognostic factors. A nomogram to predict survival was developed based on a multivariate Cox model. The predictive performance of the model was assessed according to the C-statistic and calibration plots.Results:After a median follow-up period of 55 months, the overall 3- and 5-year survival rates after hepatectomy were respectively 58 and 47 %. The median overall survival period was 56 months, and the median disease-free survival period after surgical resection was 33 months. A single hepatic metastasis, no triple negative tumors, no microscopic vascular invasion, and perioperative hormonal or targeted therapy were related to improved overall survival. The model achieved good discrimination and calibration, with a C-statistic of 0.80.Conclusions:Liver resection for selected patients with breast cancer metastases can provide significant survival benefit. It should be part of a multidisciplinary treatment program in experienced liver surgery centers. The authors' nomogram facilitates personalized assessment of prognosis for these patients.
