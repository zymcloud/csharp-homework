Due to the ability to detect the typical contrast-imaging pattern for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), that is hyperenhancement in the arterial phase and hypoenhancement in the late phase on a cirrhotic background, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) was included in the American diagnostic algorithm for HCC in 2005. However, its role has been questioned because of the possibility of misdiagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. The present review aims to describe the advantages and disadvantages of CEUS applications using SonovueÂ® for HCC. In particular there is focus on the accuracy of CEUS in detecting the typical HCC pattern, the CEUS patterns of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), the risk of misdiagnosis with HCC, the diagnostic use of CEUS in cases of locoregional and systemic treatments, and the evaluation of response to antiangiogenic treatment using dedicated software.
