NY-SAR-35 is a cancer/testis (CT) antigen that was identified by serological analysis of recombinant complementary DNA expression libraries. The gene encoding NY-SAR-35 is located on the Ã— chromosome and is aberrantly expressed in a number of cancer types and germ cells, such as those in the testes, but not in normal tissue. It has been reported that treatment with a demethylating agent induced the expression of NY-SAR-35 in several types of cancer cells. However, the function of NY-SAR-35 in cancer remains undetermined. In present study, the role of NY-SAR-35 in human lung adenocarcinoma (SK-LC-14) and hepatocellular carcinoma (SNU-449) cells was investigated following stable transfection of the NY-SAR-35 gene. NY-SAR-35 was observed to be expressed in the cytoplasm of the cells. In addition, the bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assay and immunofluorescence staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Ki-67 demonstrated that proliferation was increased in cells transfected with NY-SAR-35. In addition, the trypan blue exclusion assay indicated that NY-SAR-35 increased cancer cell viability. Furthermore, NY-SAR-35 increased the migration and invasion of the cells. These results indicate that NY-SAR-35 increases cancer cell viability, proliferation, migration and invasion.
