Data regarding the risk of various liver diseases among different hepatitis viruses in kidney transplantation have not yet been identified.We selected individuals with kidney transplantation (ICD-9-CM V420 or 996.81) from 2000-2009 from the catastrophic illness registry of National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD)as the study cohort. The two end-points in the study included overall death, and post-transplant occurrence of hepatic disease. After adjustment for other risk factors, the risk of mortality was increased in patients with HBV infection (N = 352) and with HCV infection (N = 275) compared to those with neither HBV nor HCV infection (N = 3485). In addition,renal transplant recipients with HBV alone,HCV alone, and both with HBV and HCVinfectionrespectively had an approximately 10-fold hazard ratio (HR) = 9.84, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.61-21.0, 4-fold increased risk (HR = 4.40, 95% CI: 1.85-10.5)and 5-fold increased risk (HR = 4.63, 95% CI: 1.06-20.2)of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)compared to those with neither HBV nor HCV infection. Our findings showed a significant risk of de novo liver disease in recipients with hepatitis virus infection. Based on our findings, we reinforce the importance and impact of hepatitis virus in renal transplantation.
