Aims:Combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma (cHC-CC), which generally has a poor prognosis, comprises hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CC), and diverse components with intermediate features between HCC and CC. Histological subtypes with stem cell (SC) features (the SC subtype) have different clinicopathological significance in cHC-CC. The mutational status may reflect the clinicopathological subgroup of cHC-CC together with the histological subtype.Methods and results:We examined the mutational statuses of KRAS, IDH1 or IDH2 (IDH1/2), ARID1A, the TERT promoter, and TP53, and their relationships with clinicopathological features in 53 patients with cHC-CC. Background liver diseases were hepatitis B (n = 9), hepatitis C (n = 22), alcoholic liver disease (n = 5), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (n = 8), and unknown (n = 9). Mutations in KRAS, IDH1/2, ARID1A, the TERT promoter and TP53 were detected in four (7.5%), six (11.8%) seven (13.2%), 16 (31.3%), and 24 patients (45.3%), respectively. KRAS mutations correlated with higher histological diversity scores and a higher M-factor (P Conclusions:The results of the mutational analysis revealed that cHC-CC has diverse types of mutations, and also that mutations in the TERT promoter and ARID1A may reflect aetiological impact, different histological subtypes, histogenesis, and tumour aggressiveness. These results suggest the potential efficacy of molecular-based subclassification of cHC-CC.
