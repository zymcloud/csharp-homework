Background:Several studies have found that Cathepsin B (CTSB) is up-regulated in many tumor types and facilitates tumor progression. However, the role of CTSB in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression remains unclear. This study was aimed at investigating the expression and role of CTSB in HCC in a large set of samples and cell lines (MHCC-97H and MHCC-97 L), and evaluating the clinical and prognostic significance of CTSB protein in patients with HCC.Methods:The expression of CTSB was examined in HCC tissue and cell lines by Western-blotting, Real-time PCR, and immunohistochemical staining. Wound healing assay and invasion assay were used to verify the effect of CTSB on the migration and invasion ability of HCC cell lines. Tumor formation assay in nude mice was used to analyze the effect of CTSB on the tumorigenicity of HCC cell lines.Results:The status of CTSB protein in carcinoma tissues is much higher than that in paracarcinoma tissues. The overall survival of the patients with high CTSB expression was significantly shorter than the low CTSB expression group. High CTSB expression was significantly correlated with advanced clinical staging, histological grade, and tumor recurrence. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that over-expression of CTSB in MHCC-97 L cells promoted cell invasion and tumor progression ability. Down-regulation of CTSB in MHCC-97H showed the opposite effects. These phenotypic changes caused by CTSB knockdown or over-expression correlated with expression of the matrix metallopeptidase MMP-9. Moreover, multivariate analysis suggested that CTSB expression might be an independent prognostic indicator for the survival of HCC patients after curative surgery.Conclusions:CTSB might be involved in the development and progression of HCC as an oncogene, and thereby may be a valuable prognostic marker for HCC patients.
