Objectives:An ultrasound contrast agent consisting of perfluorobutane microbubbles (Sonazoid; Daiichi Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan) accumulates in Kupffer cells, which thus enables Kupffer imaging. This study aimed to elucidate the association of defect patterns of hepatocellular carcinoma during the Kupffer phase of Sonazoid contrast-enhanced sonography with outcomes after radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Methods:For this study, 226 patients with initial hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma, who could be evaluated by contrast-enhanced sonography with Sonazoid before RFA, were analyzed. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the tumor defect pattern during the Kupffer phase. The irregular-defect group was defined as patients with hepatocellular carcinoma that had a defect with an irregular margin, and the no-irregular-defect group was defined as patients with hepatocellular carcinoma that had either a defect with a smooth margin or no defect. Critical recurrence was defined as more than 3 intrahepatic recurrences, vascular invasion, dissemination, or metastasis.Results:The irregular-defect and no-irregular-defect groups included 86 and 140 patients, respectively, and had cumulative 5-year critical recurrence rates of 49% and 17% (P Conclusions:The defect pattern of hepatocellular carcinoma during the Kupffer phase of Sonazoid contrast-enhanced sonography is associated with critical recurrence and survival after RFA.
