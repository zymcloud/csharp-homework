Purpose:To investigate the outcomes of living donor liver transplantation for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in Child-Pugh A/B patients and the usefulness of our expanded selection criteria, the Kyoto criteria.Methods:A total of 82 recipients with a Child-Pugh class A (n = 27) or B (n = 55) status having either multiple hepatic nodules or solitary tumors â‰¥5 cm in size treated between February 1999 and August 2012 were enrolled in this study.Results:The overall recurrence rate was significantly less for the Child-Pugh B patients than for the Child-Pugh A patients (P = 0.042), while the survival rates did not differ. In the Child-Pugh A and B patients, the survival rate was significantly greater, while the recurrence rate was lower among the patients meeting the Kyoto criteria than those exceeding these criteria (P = 0.006, P = 0.001, P = 0.032 and P Conclusions:Living donor liver transplantation performed within the Kyoto criteria achieves excellent overall survival and recurrence rates, especially for Child-Pugh B patients, even those with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
