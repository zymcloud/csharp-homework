Background:Elevated plasma fibrinogen is associated with tumour progression and poor outcomes in several cancers. The present study investigated the prognostic value of preoperative fibrinogen in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after liver transplantation (LT).Material and methods:We analyzed the preoperative plasma fibrinogen levels of 41 patients who underwent LT for HCC. The cut-off value for elevated level of fibrinogen was determined by using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Cox regression analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between elevated fibrinogen level and HCC recurrence. The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rate after transplantation were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank test.Results:The fibrinogen levels were significantly higher in patients with tumor recurrence (3.31±0.98 g/L) compared with those in patients without recurrence (2.39±0.89 g/L) (PConclusions:Pretransplant elevated fibrinogen levels are associated with tumor recurrence and poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma patients after liver transplantation.
