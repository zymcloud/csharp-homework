Background:While the incidence and mortality of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) continue to increase across the United States (US), disparities may exist relative to treatment modality and survival. The objective of the present study was to determine the factors associated with racial differences in survival among patients with HCC in the US.Methods:The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was used to identify patients with HCC between 1998 and 2012 in the US. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to examine associations between type of therapy and race, while a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was built to determine the effect of race on survival.Results:A total of 58,186 patients with HCC were identified. Over two-thirds of patients were white (n=39,223, 67.4%), while 18.3% were Asian (n=10,665), 13.1% black (n=7,620) and 1.2% native American (n=678). In comparison to other racial groups, Asian patients with HCC tended to be older [white vs. black vs. native American vs. Asian: median age: 63 years, interquartile range (IQR), 55-73 vs. 59 years, IQR, 53-66 vs. 59 years, IQR, 53-69 vs. 64 years, IQR, 55-73, P0.05).Conclusions:Significant racial differences were noted in presentation, treatment and survival among patients with HCC. Further research is necessary to better understand socio-demographic and biological factors driving racial disparities in care. Future policies should aim to improve access to care among racial/ethnic minorities.
