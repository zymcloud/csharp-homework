Background:Secreted frizzled-related protein-1 (SFRP1) is a well-known inhibitor of the wingless type (WNT)-Î²-catenin signaling pathway and its inactivation plays an important role in the development and progression of various types of cancer. However, the clinical significance of SFRP1 expression in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown.Materials and methods:A total of 63 patients with HCC who underwent hepatectomy at our Institution were enrolled in this study. A quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to determine the SFRP1 mRNA expression level in both the tumorous and non-tumorous tissues of HCC. The patients were divided into low and high gene-expression groups based on the SFRP1 gene expression level in their tumor tissues. We analyzed the differences in clinicopathological characteristics between these two groups of patients.Result:The expression level of SFRP1 was significantly lower in tumor tissue than in non-tumor tissue (pConclusion:SFRP1 may play a role in the development and progression of HCC. Therefore, more studies are required to investigate a potential role of SFRP1 in HCC prognosis.
