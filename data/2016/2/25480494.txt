Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a worldwide health problem, with approximately one third of populations have been infected, among which 3-5% of adults and more than 90% of children developed to chronic HBV infection. Host immune factors play essential roles in the outcome of HBV infection. Thus, ineffective immune response against HBV may result in persistent virus replications and liver necroinflammations, then lead to chronic HBV infection, liver cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Cytokine balance was shown to be an important immune characteristic in the development and progression of hepatitis B, as well as in an effective antiviral immunity. Large numbers of cytokines are not only involved in the initiation and regulation of immune responses but also contributing directly or indirectly to the inhibition of virus replication. Besides, cytokines initiate downstream signaling pathway activities by binding to specific receptors expressed on the target cells and play important roles in the responses against viral infections and, therefore, might affect susceptibility to HBV and/or the natural course of the infection. Since cytokines are the primary causes of inflammation and mediates liver injury after HBV infection, we have discussed recent advances on the roles of various cytokines [including T helper type 1 cells (Th1), Th2, Th17, regulatory T cells (Treg)-related cytokines] in different phases of HBV infection and cytokine-related mechanisms for impaired viral control and liver damage during HBV infection. We then focus on experimental therapeutic applications of cytokines to gain a better understanding of this newly emerging aspect of disease pathogenesis.
