Small-cell carcinoma (SmCC) of the endometrium is an extremely rare cancer and has a poor prognosis. Because long-term survival is rare, there is a paucity of data on the advanced disease stages. Thus, a standard treatment has not been established. We describe an extremely rare case of long-term survival in SmCC of the endometrium with liver and brain metastases. We provided multidisciplinary treatment, including brain surgery, subsequent whole-brain radiotherapy, gynecologic surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy (irinotecan hydrochloride+cisplatin). The patient was treated successfully and has survived for more than 12 years with no evidence of the disease. Irinotecan hydrochloride+cisplatin chemotherapy was effective for controlling the liver metastases, and the resection of brain metastases and radiotherapy were effective for the treatment of brain metastases in our case. We reviewed the pertinent literature of advanced SmCC of the endometrium.
