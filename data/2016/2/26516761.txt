The impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is uncertain. This study aimed to assess the outcome of a prospective Spanish nationwide cohort of HIV-infected patients undergoing LT for HCC (2002-2014). These patients were matched (age, gender, year of LT, center, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus infection) with non-HIV-infected controls (1:3 ratio). Patients with incidental HCC were excluded. Seventy-four HIV-infected patients and 222 non-HIV-infected patients were included. All patients had cirrhosis, mostly due to HCV infection (92%). HIV-infected patients were younger (47 versus 51 years) and had undetectable HCV RNA at LT (19% versus 9%) more frequently than non-HIV-infected patients. No significant differences were detected between HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected recipients in the radiological characteristics of HCC at enlisting or in the histopathological findings for HCC in the explanted liver. Survival at 1, 3, and 5 years for HIV-infected versus non-HIV-infected patients was 88% versus 90%, 78% versus 78%, and 67% versus 73% (P = 0.779), respectively. HCV infection (hazard ratio = 7.90, 95% confidence interval 1.07-56.82) and maximum nodule diameter >3 cm in the explanted liver (hazard ratio = 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.02-2.89) were independently associated with mortality in the whole series. HCC recurred in 12 HIV-infected patients (16%) and 32 non-HIV-infected patients (14%), with a probability of 4% versus 5% at 1 year, 18% versus 12% at 3 years, and 20% versus 19% at 5 years (P = 0.904). Microscopic vascular invasion (hazard ratio = 3.40, 95% confidence interval 1.34-8.64) was the only factor independently associated with HCC recurrence.Conclusions:HIV infection had no impact on recurrence of HCC or survival after LT. Our results support the indication of LT in HIV-infected patients with HCC.
