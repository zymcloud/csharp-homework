Purpose:To evaluate the feasibility and midterm results of endovascular treatment of hepatic artery occlusion within 24 hours after living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT).Materials and methods:From January 2012 to June 2014, 189 consecutive patients at a single institution underwent LDLT with right-lobe grafts. Among them, 10 were diagnosed with hepatic artery occlusion within 24 hours after LDLT. All 10 underwent endovascular treatment, including drug-eluting stent placement (n = 2), intraarterial thrombolysis (n = 5), or both (n = 3). Every patient received regular follow-up with multidetector computed tomography (CT). Data on primary technical success, primary and assisted primary patency, and biliary complications were analyzed.Results:Primary technical success was achieved in all 10 cases. Primary patency rates at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months were all 70% (7 of 10), and the respective assisted primary patency rates were all 80% (8 of 10). Bleeding at the anastomotic site developed in 2 failed cases, prompting repeat liver transplantation. All 8 successfully recanalized cases showed hepatic artery patency on CT throughout follow-up (mean, 643.6 d; range, 236-1,081 d). Six of these cases had anastomotic biliary stricture, 4 of which were successfully treated by multisession biliary intervention. One patient had nonanastomotic biliary stricture and died of hepatic failure despite lifelong external drainage.Conclusions:Endovascular treatment could be an alternative therapeutic option for patients with hepatic artery occlusion within 24 hours after LDLT. It could help achieve long-term patency of the hepatic artery, but biliary stricture can potentially occur, and bleeding at the anastomotic site is a serious complication.
