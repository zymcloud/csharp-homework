Objectives:Our study sought to compare the overall survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal venous thrombosis (PVT), treated with either conventional trans-arterial chemoembolization (cTACE) or drug-eluting beads (DEB) TACE.Methods:This retrospective analysis included a total of 133 patients, treated without cross-over and compared head-to-head by means or propensity score weighting. Mortality was compared using survival analysis upon propensity score weighting. Adverse events and liver toxicity grade ≥3 were recorded and reported for each TACE. In order to compare with historical sorafenib studies, a sub-group analysis was performed and included patients who fulfilled the SHARP inclusion criteria.Results:The median overall survival (MOS) of the entire cohort was 4.53 months (95 % CI, 3.63-6.03). MOS was similar across treatment arms, no significant difference between cTACE (N = 95) and DEB-TACE (N = 38) was observed (MOS of 5.0 vs. 3.33 months, respectively; p = 0.157). The most common adverse events after cTACE and DEB- TACE, respectively, were as follows: post-embolization syndrome [N = 57 (30.0 %) and N = 38 (61.3 %)], diarrhea [N = 3 (1.6 %) and N = 3 (4.8 %)], and encephalopathy [N = 11 (5.8 %) and N = 2 (3.2 %)].Conclusion:Our retrospective study could not reveal a difference in toxicity and efficiency between cTACE and DEB-TACE for treatment of advanced stage HCC with PVT.Key points:• Conventional TACE (cTACE) and drug-eluting-beads TACE (DEB-TACE) demonstrated equal safety profiles. • Survival rates after TACE are similar to patients treated with sorafenib. • Child-Pugh class and tumor burden are reliable predictors of survival.
