Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found dysregulated in human disease, especially in cancer. Small nucleolar RNA host gene 3 (SNHG3) is an lncRNA whose potential function and mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely unknown. In the present study, we aimed to determine SNHG3 expression and its clinical significance in HCC. Our results showed that the expression level of SNHG3 was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues compared with paired noncancerous tissues from 51 HCC patients, as determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR; P
