This study aimed to determine the expression of progranulin (PGRN) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in response to interleukin 6 (IL-6), a non-cellular component of the tumor microenvironment, and the molecular mechanism of PGRN oncogenic activity in hepatocarcinogenesis. Levels of IL-6 and PGRN were increased and positively correlated in HCC tissues. IL-6 dose- and time-dependently increased PGRN level in HCC cells. IL-6-driven PGRN expression was at least in part mediated by Erk/C/EBPÎ² signaling, and reduced expression of PGRN impaired IL-6-stimulated proliferation, migration and invasion of HepG2 cells. PGRN activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of p70S6K, 4E-BP1, and Akt-Ser473/FoxO1. Inhibition of mTOR signaling with rapamycin, an mTOR signaling inhibitor, disturbed PGRN- or IL-6-mediated proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells in vitro. Persistent activation of mTOR signaling by knockdown of TSC2 restored PGRN-knockdown-attenuated pro-proliferation effects of IL-6 in HepG2 cells. In addition, rapamycin treatment in vivo in mice slowed tumor growth stimulated by recombinant human PGRN. Our findings provide a better understanding of the biological activities of the IL-6/PGRN/mTOR cascade in the carcinogenesis of HCC, which may suggest a novel target in the treatment of HCC.
