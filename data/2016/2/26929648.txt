Trial registry:Clinicaltrials.gov #NCT01180959.Background:Early clinical studies of bevacizumab and erlotinib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have a tolerable toxicity and a promising clinical outcome. We evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of this combination as a second-line therapy for HCC refractory to sorafenib.Methods:For this single-arm, Phase II study, we recruited patients with Child-Pugh class A or B liver disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2, and advanced HCC that was not amenable to surgical or regional therapies and treatment with sorafenib had failed (disease progressed or patient could not tolerate sorafenib). Patients received 10 mg/kg intravenous bevacizumab every 14 days and 150 mg oral erlotinib daily for 28-day cycles until progression. Tumor response was evaluated every two cycles using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. The primary end point was the 16-week progression-free survival rate. Secondary end points included time to progression and overall survival.Results:A total of 44 patients were enrolled and had a median follow-up time of 33.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23.5 months - not defined). The 16-week progression-free survival rate was 43% (95% CI: 28%-59%), median time to progression was 3.9 months (95% CI: 2.0-8.3 months), and median overall survival duration was 9.9 months (95% CI: 8.3-15.5 months). Grade 3-4 adverse events included fatigue (13%), acne (11%), diarrhea (9%), anemia (7%), and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (7%).Conclusion:Bevacizumab plus erlotinib was tolerable and showed a signal of survival benefit in the second-line setting for patients with advanced HCC. Because standard-of-care options are lacking in this setting, further studies to identify predictors of response to this regimen are warranted.
