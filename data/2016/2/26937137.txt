Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is now the fifth cancer of greatest frequency and the second leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide. Chief amongst the risks of HCC are hepatitis B and C infection, aflatoxin B1 ingestion, alcoholism and obesity. The latter can promote non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), that can lead to the inflammatory form non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and can in turn promote HCC. The mechanisms by which NASH promotes HCC are only beginning to be characterized. Here in this review, we give a summary of the recent findings that describe and associate NAFLD and NASH with the subsequent HCC progression. We will focus our discussion on clinical and genomic associations that describe new risks for NAFLD and NASH promoted HCC. In addition, we will consider novel murine models that clarify some of the mechanisms that drive NASH HCC formation.
