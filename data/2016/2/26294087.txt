Background:Spontaneous tumor rupture (STR) is a life-threatening complication of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Yet, interval partial hepatectomy (PH) is feasible in selected patients after hemostasis for the rupture event. Little is known, however, about the extent of negative prognostic impact STR had on these patients after resection. Our aim was to determine the impact of STR on the oncologic outcome of interval PH for ruptured HCC, and the prognostic value of STR on the current tumor node metastasis (TNM) classification.Study design:From 1989 to 2010, 84 of 364 patients (23%) with STR received staged PH. Clinicopathologic variables associated with STR were identified by logistic regression analysis and ruptured tumor size with prognostic impact was determined by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Comparison of survival curves was performed after stratification by the American Joint Committee on Cancer/TNM, 7th edition.Results:Ruptured HCC had substantially worse survival than nonruptured tumor (5-year overall survival: 22.3% vs 53.4% P 10 cm (area under curve 0.65, P Conclusion:STR affects the outcome of PH for T1-T2 disease or tumor â‰¤10 cm only. Assigning all resectable ruptured tumors to T4 may overestimate the severity of disease.
