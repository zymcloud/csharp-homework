Background:Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) appears to be safe and effective as open liver resection (OLR) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, studies comparing LLR with ORL in elderly patients are limited. The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of LLR versus OLR for HCC in elderly patients.Methods:A retrospective analysis was made comparing laparoscopic (n = 11) and open (n = 18) liver resections in elderly patients performed at the University of Naples "Federico II" between January 2010 and December 2014. Demographic data, operative and postoperative outcomes were analyzed.Results:Demographic and tumor characteristics of laparoscopic and OLRs were similar. There were also no significant differences in operating room time. Patients undergoing OLR had increased rate of minor complications (33 vs. 0%), longer lengths of stay (6 vs. 3 days) and higher blood loss (310 ± 84 vs. 198 ± 34 ml). There were no significant differences in major complication rates or 90-day mortality.Discussion:LLR is safe and feasible as OLR for treatment of HCC in selected elderly patients.
