Background and aim:Multipolar radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is feasible for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for which a large ablative area is planned, and it imposes a light physical burden on patients. Multipolar RFA via the percutaneous approach is performed in the majority of cases, but the efficacy of multipolar RFA with a laparoscopic approach has rarely been studied. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multipolar laparoscopic RFA (LRA) for localized HCC over the short term.Methods:From January 2014 to January 2016, 77 consecutive patients with 130 HCCs treated by multipolar LRA were assessed. One to three bipolar needle applicators were inserted under laparoscopic ultrasonography guidance, regardless of tumor location. We intended to achieve parallel insertions and no-touch ablation as much as possible.Results:The median size of the main tumor was 22 mm (range, 10-42 mm). The median follow-up time was 13.6 months (range, 3.1-24.8 months). In all cases, a sufficient ablative area was obtained as planned, without thermal injury of adjacent organs. During the follow-up period, all patients were alive with no local tumor progression, while intrahepatic recurrence distant from the primary site occurred in 7 patients. The 2-year local tumor progression-free survival rate and overall cancer-free survival rate were 100 and 81.6%, respectively. There were no procedural major complications caused prolonging the hospitalization, and all patients were discharged without subjective symptoms 4-7 days after LRA.Conclusions:Multipolar LRA was efficacious in the treatment of localized HCCs by safely achieving a good ablative area.
