Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy for which chronic hepatitis B infection has been defined as the most common etiologic factor. The most frequent metastatic sites are the lung, bone, lymphatics, and brain. Metastases to the chest wall have been reported rarely. We report a patient with HCC who presented with an isolated metastatic mass on the right chest wall. Metastasis of HCC should be included in the differential diagnosis of rapidly growing lesions in unusual locations, particularly in patients with chronic liver disease and HBsAg-positive patients, even if a primary tumor cannot be radiologically identified.
