The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in pregnancy is rare, and we present the first reported case of a pregnancy complicated by pre-existing advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. We describe the case of a 39-year-old woman in her second pregnancy, with a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. This was discovered in 2013 incidentally following hepato-splenectomy and pancreatectomy for a presumed hepatic adenoma in the context of multiple arterio-venous malformations. Recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma, in conjunction with co-existing pulmonary hypertension was successfully managed in a multi-disciplinary setting, resulting in a spontaneous vaginal delivery of a live female infant with maternal and neonatal survival six months following delivery.
Hepatocellular carcinoma; cancer recurrence; hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia; multi-disciplinary management; pregnancy; pulmonary hypertension.
