MicroRNA‑744 (miR‑744) reportedly plays an oncogenic or tumor‑suppressive role in different human malignancies. Although a previous study demonstrated that miR‑744 significantly inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) proliferation in vitro, the role of miR‑744 in the migration and invasion of HCC cells remains largely unknown. The present study investigated the significance of miR‑744 in HCC tissues and cell lines and evaluated its role and underlying mechanism of action in HCC cells. miR‑744 expression was detected in HCC tissues and cell lines by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR). The effect of miR‑744 on cell proliferation, migration and invasion was determined using Cell Counting Kit‑8, wound‑healing and Matrigel invasion assays, respectively. Targeting gene of miR‑744 in HCC cells was determined by luciferase reporter assay, RT‑qPCR and western blotting. It was revealed that miR‑744 was poorly expressed in HCC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues (P
