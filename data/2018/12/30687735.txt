Background:Previous studies have shown the prognostic value of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the results are not persuasive. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to quantitatively explore the prognostic value of LDH in hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:We searched the Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library for literature published before October 2018 on the prognostic value of LDH in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The combined hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were utilized to assess the prognostic value of LDH in overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and progression-free survival (PFS) of HCC. Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and metaregression were used to explore the source of heterogeneity. Funnel plots with Begg's test and Egger's test were used to detect potential publication biases. Furthermore, combined odds ratios (ORs) were utilized to assess the correlation between LDH and clinicopathological features.Results:A total of 10 nonrandomized controlled studies were included in this meta-analysis. The combined effects of LDH on HCC patients' OS, RFS/DFS, and PFS were HR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.63-2.62, P Conclusions:Preoperative LDH elevation is significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with HCC, which may be a promising factor in assessing the prognosis of patients with HCC.
