Two-scale CFD modeling is used to design and optimize a novel endovascular filtration device for removing toxins from flowing blood. The Chemofilter is temporarily deployed in the venous side of a tumor during the intra-arterial chemotherapy in order to filter excessive chemotherapy drugs such as Doxorubicin from the blood stream. The device chemically binds selective drugs to its surface thus filtering them from blood, after they have had the effect on the tumor and before they reach the heart and other organs. The Chemofilter consists of a porous membrane made of microscale architected materials and is installed on a structure similar to an embolic protection device. Simulations resolving the microscale structure of the device were carried out to determine the permeability of the microcell membrane. The resulting permeability coefficients were then used for macroscale simulations of the flow through the device modeled as a porous material. The microscale simulations indicate that greater number of microcell layers and smaller microcell size result in increased pressure drop across the membrane, while providing larger surface area for drug binding. In the macroscale simulations, the study of idealized prototypes show that the pressure drop can be reduced by increasing the membrane's tip angle and by decreasing the number of membrane's sectors. Such design, however, can conversely affect the overall drug binding. By decreasing the concentration of toxins in the cardiovascular system, the drug dosage can be increased while side effects are reduced, thus improving the effectiveness of treatment.
