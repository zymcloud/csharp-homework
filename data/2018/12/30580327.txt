FoxM1 is an oncoprotein that is significantly overexpressed in many malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma, but its role in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) remains unclear. This study explores the expression of FoxM1 in human ICC, its relationships with clinical outcomes, and its role in the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ICC in vitro and in vivo. The results show that FoxM1 was markedly elevated in tumor tissues versus the paired peritumoral tissues. Overexpression of FoxM1 was correlated with multiple tumor nodules, tumor size > 5 cm, positive lymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stage. Cox analysis revealed that overexpression of FoxM1 is an independent prognostic indicator for both the overall survival and disease-free survival of ICC patients after hepatectomy. Furthermore, up/downregulation of FoxM1 markedly promoted/inhibited ICC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that overexpression of FoxM1 resulted in the dysregulation of multiple signaling pathways in ICC, and selected components of some key signaling pathways such as c-Myc signaling were confirmed in vitro. In addition, overexpression of FoxM1 enhanced MMP-9 and MMP-2 protein expression in ICC cells. In conclusion, FoxM1 promotes ICC progression and is a reliable predictor of poor prognosis in ICC.
