Background:The effectiveness of combination therapy of transarterial chemoembolization and sorafenib for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma are controversial in some studies. This meta-analysis aims to compare efficacy and safety, as well as regional disparities, between transarterial chemoembolization plus sorafenib and transarterial chemotherapy alone for hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:We systematically searched multiple databases to select eligible studies. Studies comparing transarterial chemoembolization plus sorafenib and transarterial chemoembolization alone for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma were included.Results:Thirteen studies including five randomized clinical trials with 2538 patients (1121 in combination therapy group and 1417 in monotherapy group) were selected. The combination therapy significantly improved time to progression (hazard ratio 0.66; 95% confidence interval 0.48-0.89; P = 0.006) and overall survival (hazard ratio 0.57; 95% confidence interval 0.45-0.72; P Conclusions:The combination of transarterial chemoembolizaiton and sorafenib significantly improves outcomes of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma compared with transarterial chemoembolization monotherapy, especially in Asian region.
