MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are part of a complex regulatory network that modulates cellular lipid metabolism. Here, we identify miR-124 as a regulator of triglyceride (TG) metabolism. This study advances our knowledge of the role of miR-124 in human hepatoma cells. Transcriptional profiling of Huh7.5 cells overexpressing miR-124 reveals enrichment for host factors involved in fatty acid oxidation among repressed miRNA targets. In addition, miR-124 down-regulates arylacetamide deacetylase (AADAC) and adipose triglyceride lipase, lipases proposed to mediate breakdown of hepatic TG stores for lipoprotein assembly and mitochondrial Î²-oxidation. Consistent with the inhibition of TG and fatty acid catabolism, miR-124 expression promotes cellular TG accumulation. Interestingly, miR-124 inhibits the production of hepatitis C virus, a virus that hijacks lipid pathways during its life cycle. Antiviral activity of miR-124 is consistent with repression of AADAC, a pro-viral host factor. Overall, our data highlight miR-124 as a novel regulator of TG metabolism in human hepatoma cells.
