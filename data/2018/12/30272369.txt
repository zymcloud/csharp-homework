JIB‑04 is a structurally unique small molecule, known to exhibit anticancer activity and to inhibit the growth of human lung cancer and prostate cancer cell lines. However, the anticancer effect of JIB‑04 against human hepatic carcinoma, and its underlying mechanisms, are still unclear. In the present study, MHCC97H and HepG2 cells were employed to investigate the anticancer effects of JIB‑04 on cell viability and apoptosis. Annexin V/PI staining, a CCK‑8 assay and western blot analysis demonstrated that JIB‑04 induced apoptosis in MHCC97H and HepG2 cells, which was evidenced by the expression of proapoptotic and apoptotic proteins including p53, Bak, Bax, caspase‑3 and caspase‑9. Subsequently, the expression trends of Bcl‑2 and p53 were reversed after co‑treatment with pifithrin‑α (PFT‑α, a p53 inhibitor). The results revealed that JIB‑04 suppressed the cell viability of MHCC97H and HepG2 cells in a concentration‑dependent manner. Meanwhile, it was also demonstrated that JIB‑04 effectively triggered MHCC97H and HepG2 cell apoptosis by downregulating Bcl‑2/Bax expression, and upregulating proapoptotic and apoptotic protein expression via the p53/Bcl2/caspase signaling pathway. JIB‑04 had effects on the inhibition of cell viability and the induction of apoptosis in MHCC97H and HepG2 cells. The underlying mechanism of action of JIB‑04 was associated with the p53/Bcl‑2/caspase signaling pathway. Our findings provide a foundation for understanding the anticancer effect of JIB‑04 on MHCC97H and HepG2 cells, and suggested that JIB‑04 may be a promising therapeutic agent in human liver cancer.
