Two 8-O-4'-type neolignan epimers erythro-guaiacylglycerol-β-coniferyl aldehyde ether (1) and threo-guaiacylglycerol-β-coniferyl aldehyde ether (2) were isolated from the stems of Picrasma quassioides. Further chiral separation gave two pairs of enantiomers 1a/1b and 2a/2b. The cytotoxicity assay against hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B and HepG2 cells was evaluated by MTT assay. The results showed that 1b (IC50 = 45.56 μM) and 2b (IC50 = 39.02 μM) had more cytotoxic effect than its enantiomers 1a (IC50 = 82.66 μM) and 2a (IC50 = 67.97 μM) in Hep3B cells, respectively. Moreover, 1b and 2b could induce more apoptotic cells as well as higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation than 1a and 2a at 50 μM. In addition, a further study on the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways was investigated. The results revealed that all compounds had no significant effect on PI3K/AKT pathway, however, 1b and 2b attenuated the relative levels of p-MEK and p-ERK when compared with 1a and 2a. Taken together, the absolute configurations of guaiacylglycerol-β-coniferyl aldehyde ether had an impact on the inhibitory effect on Hep3B cells. The inactivation of MEK/ERK signaling pathway might contribute to apoptosis induction and ROS generation in 1b- and 2b-treated cells.
