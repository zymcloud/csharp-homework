The present study was designed to investigate the significance of non-structural maintenance of chromosomes (non-SMC) chromosome-associated polypeptide G (NCAPG), a subunit of condensin complex I, in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NCAPG protein expression in human HCC and paracancerous hepatic tissues were examined using immunohistochemistry, and NCAPG mRNA expression in HCC cell lines were quantified using quantitative RT-PCR. Lentivirus-mediated RNA interference was used to silence NCAPG in HCC cells. Cell proliferation was monitored by MTT assay. Cell colony-forming capacity was measured by colony formation assay. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. The results showed that increased protein expression of NCAPG was found in HCC tissues compared with the matched paracancerous hepatic tissues. At the mRNA level, increased expression of NCAPG was found in HCC cells as opposed to the normal hepatocytes. Silencing of NCAPG in BEL-7404 and SMMC-7721 cells led to decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. These changes were associated with increased mRNA expressions of P53, P27, and Bad, but decreased mRNA expression of EGFR, Akt, survivin, and JNK. NCAPG might play an oncogenic role in the development of liver cancer. Further studies to clarify its role and underlying mechanisms in the development of liver cancer are warranted.
