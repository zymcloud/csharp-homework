Background/aim:Switch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF)-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily B member 1 (SMARCB1), also named integrase interactor 1, is one of the core subunit proteins in the SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex encoded at chromosomal position 22q11.2. Complete loss of SMARCB1 expression has been reported in various malignant tumors. Immunohistochemistry has demonstrated that SMARCB1 mutation/inactivation correlates well with loss of nuclear SMARCB1 expression. This study investigated SMARCB1 expression in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and α-fetoprotein (AFP)-producing gastric carcinomas by immunohistochemistry. For comparison, SMARCB1 immunostaining in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) was also performed.Materials and methods:Thirty classical HCCs, 30 ICCs and 10 AFP-producing gastric carcinomas were analyzed.Results:Only one case of HCC had focal labeling of SMARCB1 in the nuclei. Twelve cases of ICC were immunopositive for SMARCB1, with either focal or diffuse reactivity. All AFP-producing gastric carcinomas were immunopositive for SMARCB1 in the nuclei, and the reactivity was consistently diffuse.Conclusion:SMARCB1 is a potential marker for distinguishing metastatic AFP-producing gastric carcinoma from HCC.
