Background:The prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) is very poor. According to most HCC guidelines, sorafenib, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or other non-surgical treatments are recommended as the first-line therapy for these patients. However, selected patients with HCC and PVTT can undergo surgical resection (SR). The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the outcomes of SR with Non-SR for such patients.Methods:The PubMed, Embase, Medline and Cochrane library were searched for studies which compared SR with Non-SR for HCC and PVTT published before December 2017.Results:4810 patients from 7 studies who were enrolled in this meta-analysis were divided into the SR group (n = 2 344, 49%) and the Non-SR group (n = 2 476, 51%). The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for the 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates of the SR group when compared with the Non-SR group, were 0.57 (95% CI 0.48-0.67, P Conclusion:This meta-analysis showed SR resulted in better OS than TACE, or other Non-SR treatments, for patients with HCC and PVTT. SR should be considered in selected patients with resectable HCC and PVTT.
