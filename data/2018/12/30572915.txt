Background:Multi-drug resistance (MDR) is one of the main obstacles for treatment of advanced/recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We have previously identified arsenic trioxide (ATO) as an effective metastasis/angiogenesis inhibitor in HCC. Here, we further found that MDR-HCC cells were more sensitive to ATO.Methods:The MDR-HCC cells were used as experimental models. Biological functions were investigated using cell transfection, polymerase chain reaction, western blot, southwestern blot, immunostaining, immunoprecipitation plus atomic fluorescence spectrometry, and so on.Results:The MDR-HCC cells underwent high oxidative stress condition, and employed adaptive mechanisms for them to survive; while ATO abolished such mechanisms via targeting the 14-3-3η/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) feedback Loop. Briefly, in MDR cells, the increase of ROS activated NF-κB signaling, which transcriptionally activated 14-3-3η. Meanwhile, the activation of NF-κB can be constitutively maintained by 14-3-3η. As a NF-κB inhibitor, ATO transcriptionally inhibited the 14-3-3η mRNA level. Meanwhile, ATO was also validated to directly bind to 14-3-3η, enhancing the degradation of 14-3-3η protein in an ubiquitination-dependent manner. Knockdown of 14-3-3η reduced the ATO-induced reversal extents of drug resistance in MDR cells.Conclusion:14-3-3η/NF-κB feedback loop plays an important role in maintaining the MDR phenotype in HCC. Moreover, via targeting such feedback loop, ATO could be considered as a potential molecular targeted agent for the treatment of HCC.
