This study aimed to compare the sensitivity and accuracy for the detection of small lesions in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and 64-slice computed tomography (CT) enhanced scanning, and to evaluate the necessity to perform MRI in patients diagnosed with HCC by CT.The clinical data from 209 patients with HCC diagnosed prior to surgery in the Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, China were retrospectively analyzed. The 64-slice dynamic contrast-enhanced multi-detector CT (MDCT) and 3.0 T Gd-EOB-DTPA DCE MRI procedures were successively carried out on all patients who were enrolled in a self-controlled study including detection and diagnosis of HCC lesions by MRI and CT, respectively.A total of 243 lesions were detected and both imaging methods could accurately detect lesions of diameter >2 cm.
