Background:Current guidelines do not address the role of age in the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas.Aim:To evaluate whether clinical features and risk for malignancy are affected by patient's age at diagnosis.Methods:In total, 2189 IPMNs, both surgically resected or surveilled, were dichotomized according to a 50-year-old cutoff and compared in terms of pathological features, cumulative risk of developing high-risk stigmata (HRS), overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS).Results:Patients <50 years had more frequent abdominal pain (38.5 vs. 22.4%; p < 0.01) and acute pancreatitis (20.4 vs. 9.3%; p < 0.01) at presentation. Patients ≥50 years old had more multifocal IPMNs (50 vs. 36.9%; p < 0.01), HRS (8.5% vs. 4.3%; p = 0.04) and invasive IPMNs (26.6% vs. 17.3%; p = 0.03) when resected. Moreover, patients ≥50 years old had a significantly higher cumulative risk of developing HRS over time, and a significantly lower OS, but similar DSS when compared with those <50 years old.Conclusions:IPMNs diagnosed in older patients are more likely to progress to HRS despite the fact that cancer-related death is not affected by age. The follow-up schedule should not be adjusted according to age, but one should take into account that IPMNs in younger individuals have more time to progress toward malignancy.
