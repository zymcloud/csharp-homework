Background/aim:Expression of 14-3-3ε is associated with prognostic outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Metallothionein-1 (MT-1) proteins and aldo-keto-reductase family 1 B10 (AKR1B10) are considered potential tumor regulators of HCC. The aim of this study, was to examine the prognostic value of 14-3-3ε, MT-1 and AKR1B10 expression in HCC.Materials and methods:The expression levels of 14-3-3ε, MT-1 and AKR1B10 in HCC cell lines and paraffin-embedded tissues were examined by western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis.Results:14-3-3ε positivity was significantly associated with decreased MT-1 expression in HCC. Patients with decreased MT-1 expression had worse survival rates and a higher risk of metastasis than 14-3-3ε-positive HCC patients with unchanged MT-1 expression. Distinct expression patterns of 14-3-3ε/MT-1/AKR1B10 were significantly associated with the metastatic incidence and survival rates of HCC patients. Patients with negative 14-3-3ε staining in primary tumors had better prognostic outcomes. In contrast, patients with positive 14-3-3ε staining, decreased MT-1 expression and no increase in AKR1B10 expression in primary tumors had the worst overall and disease-free survival rates and the highest metastatic risk.Conclusion:14-3-3ε, AKR1B10, and MT-1 act as potential prognostic biomarkers of HCC.
