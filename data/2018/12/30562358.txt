Compared to the general population, HIV-infected patients are at higher risk of developing non-AIDS-defining cancers. Chronic HCV infection has also been associated with a higher risk than that of the general population of developing cancers other than hepatocarcinoma. Evaluation of the impact of HCV-related factors on non-AIDS-defining and non HCV-liver (NANL) related cancers among HIV/HCV co-infected patients are scarce. The aim of this study was to identify the impact of HIV/HCV clinical characteristics on NANL related cancers in a large cohort of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients followed from 2005 to 2017. Cox proportional hazards models with delayed entry were used to estimate factors associated with NANL related cancer. Among 1391 patients followed for a median of 5 years, 60 patients developed NANL related cancers, yielding an incidence rate of 8.9 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, [6.6-11.1]). By final multivariable analysis, after adjustment for sex, tobacco or alcohol consumption, baseline CD4 cell count and HCV sustained viral response (SVR), age and a longer duration since HIV diagnosis were independently associated with a higher risk of NANL related cancer (aHR for each additional year 1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.14, p<0.0001 and 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.11, p = 0.02, respectively). Duration of HCV infection, cirrhosis, HCV viral load, genotype and SVR were not associated with the occurrence of NANL related cancer. Among HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, age and the duration of HIV infection were the only characteristics found to be associated with the occurrence of NANL related cancer. In contrast, no association was observed with any HCV-related variables.
