Patients having received a liver transplantation (LT) for alcoholic liver disease (ALD) have a high risk of de novo malignancies, especially in the upper aerodigestive tract and lungs due to their smoking and alcohol history. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare a group of patients transplanted for ALD who continue to smoke and who were included in an intensive screening program for tobacco-related cancers implemented at the Grenoble University Hospital and a group of similar patients followed according to usual practice (chest computed tomography [CT] scan every 5 years) at the Edouard Herriot Hospital in Lyon. The intensive screening program consisted of an annual checkup, including a clinical examination by an otorhinolaryngologist, a chest CT scan, and an upper digestive endoscopy. A total of 147 patients were included: 71 patients in Grenoble and 76 patients in Lyon. The cumulative incidence of a first tobacco-related cancer was 12.3% at 3 years, 20.6% at 5 years, 42.6% at 10 years, and 64.0% at 15 years. A curative treatment was possible in 80.0% of the patients in Grenoble versus 57.9% in Lyon (P = 0.068). The rates of curative treatment were 63.6% versus 26.3% (P = 0.062) for lung cancers, 100.0% versus 87.5% (P = 0.498) for lip-mouth-pharynx and larynx cancers, and 66.7% versus 100.0% (P = 1) for esophageal cancers, respectively. In addition, for lung cancers, regardless of study group, 68.7% received a curative treatment when the diagnosis was made by CT scan screening versus 14.3% when it was made because of symptoms (P = 0.008). In conclusion, our study strongly confirms the high rate of tobacco-related de novo malignancies in LT patients for ALD and suggests that the screening of lung cancer by annual chest CT scan could significantly increase the rate of curative treatment.
