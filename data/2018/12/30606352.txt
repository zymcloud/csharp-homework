It has been obscure whether or not noncurative hepatic resection (Hx) has a favorable impact on the clinical course in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study is to clarify the significance of noncurative Hx for advanced HCC. Among 666 consecutive patients undergoing Hx for HCC in our department, 79 patients underwent noncurative Hx. These patients were classified as Group A (presence of macrovascular invasion [MVI]; n = 29), Group B (residual tumors in the remnant liver; n = 37), Group C (residual tumors in the remnant liver with MVI; n = 7), or Group D (residual tumors in the remnant liver with distant metastasis [with or without MVI]; n = 6). The three-year survival rates were 49.6 per cent in Group A, 30.3 per cent in Group B, 14.3 per cent in Group C, and 0.0 per cent in Group D, respectively (Groups A and B vs Group D, P < 0.05). Moreover, the survival rate was significantly higher in patients with ≤3 tumors than in those with ≥4 tumors (P < 0.05), when Group B was divided into subgroups according to the number of residual tumors in the remnant liver. In conclusion, noncurative Hx might be acceptable for advanced HCC with MVI or ≤3 residual tumors in the remnant liver.
