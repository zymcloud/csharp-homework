Aim:To evaluate trends and disparities in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) outcomes among Hispanic patients in the United States with a focus on tumor stage at diagnosis.Methods:We retrospectively evaluated all Hispanic adults (age > 20) with HCC diagnosed from 2004 to 2014 using United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry data. Tumor stage was assessed by SEER-specific staging systems and whether HCC was within Milan criteria at diagnosis. Multivariate logistic regression models evaluated for predictors of HCC within Milan criteria at diagnosis.Results:Overall, Hispanics accounted for 19.8% of all HCC (73.3% men, 60.9% had Medicare or commercial insurance, 33.5% Medicaid, and 5.6% uninsured). Thirty-eight percent of Hispanic HCC patients were within Milan criteria at diagnosis. With latter time periods, significantly more patients were diagnosed with HCC within Milan criteria, and in 2013-2014, 42.6% had HCC within Milan criteria. On multivariate regression, Hispanic males (OR vs females: 0.76, 95%CI: 0.68-0.83, P < 0.001), Hispanics > 65 years (OR vs age < 50: 0.67, 95%CI: 0.58-0.79, P < 0.001), and uninsured patients (OR vs Medicare/commercial: 0.49, 95%CI: 0.40-0.59, P < 0.001) were significantly less likely to have HCC within Milan criteria at diagnosis.Conclusion:While one in five HCC patients in the United States are of Hispanic ethnicity, only 38% were within Milan criteria at time of diagnosis, and thus over 60% were ineligible for liver transplantation, one of the primary curative options for HCC patients. Improved efforts at HCC screening and surveillance are needed among this group to improve early detection.
