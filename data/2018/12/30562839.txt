Background:There is no consensus on the optimal treatment of T1b gallbladder cancer (GBC) due to the lack of evidence and the difficulty of anatomy and pathological standardization.Methods:A total of 272 patients with T1b GBC who underwent surgical resection at 14 centers with specialized hepatobiliary-pancreatic surgeons and pathologists in Korea, Japan, Chile, and the United States were studied. Clinical outcomes including disease-specific survival (DSS) rates according to the types of surgery were analyzed.Results:After excluding patients, the 237 qualifying patients consisted of 90 men and 147 women. Simple cholecystectomy (SC) was performed in 116 patients (48.9%) and extended cholecystectomy (EC) in 121 patients (51.1%). The overall 5-year DSS was 94.6%, and it was similar between SC and EC patients (93.7% vs. 95.5%, P = 0.496). The 5-year DSS was similar between SC and EC patients in America (82.3% vs. 100.0%, P = 0.249) as well as in Asia (98.6% vs. 95.2%, P = 0.690). The 5-year DSS also did not differ according to lymph node metastasis (P = 0.688) or tumor location (P = 0.474).Conclusions:SC showed similar clinical outcomes (including recurrence) and survival outcomes as EC; therefore, EC is not needed for the treatment of T1b GBC.
