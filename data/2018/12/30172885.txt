Background & aims:Chronic Hepatitis C is one of the most important risk factors of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Before reaching these ultimate steps, insulin resistance triggered by hepatitis C virus infection is known to participate in the progression of liver disease. The present study aims to investigate the influence of two functional polymorphisms on SOCS3 mRNA expression and on the outcomes of CHC progression in a North African context.Patients & methods:In this case-control study, 601 Moroccan subjects composed of 200 healthy controls, 101 resolvers and 300 patients with persistent HCV infection including 95 mild chronic hepatitis, 131 Advanced Liver Diseases and 74 HCC were enrolled. They were genotyped for the 4874 A/G (rs4969170) and A + 930- > G (rs4969168) SOCS3 variants using TaqMan SNPs assays. SOCS3 mRNA expression was assessed using Real Time PCR technique.Results:Logistic regression analysis showed that variation at rs4969168 was associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV (P Conclusions:Our results underline the importance of the functional SOCS3 polymorphisms in the modulation of CHC progression and suggest their contribution to HCC development by affecting its mRNA expression and perturbing key metabolic parameters.
