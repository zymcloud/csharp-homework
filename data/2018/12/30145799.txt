Increasing evidence has shown that THZ1, a covalent cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) inhibitor, exhibits therapeutic effects in various tumors. However, the possible effect of THZ1 on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. Our study was to investigate the roles of THZ1 in HCC cells and in subcutaneous HCC model and illustrate the molecular mechanisms. The phosphorylation levels of Ser2, Ser5, and Ser7 within RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) C-terminal domain (CTD) and the expression levels of Ki67, Mcl-1, survivin, XIAP, and p53 in HCC cells under different conditions were examined by Western blot analysis. Cell growth and apoptosis were assessed via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. Tumor volume was assessed in HCC mice with THZ1 or vehicle treatment and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was conducted on excised tumors. THZ1 significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of Ser2, Ser5, and Ser7 within RNAPII-CTD in the dose-dependent and irreversible manner. MTT assay and flow cytometry analysis showed that THZ1 inhibited HCC cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, respectively. Western blot analysis indicated THZ1 significantly upregulated p53 expression and downregulated the expressions of Mcl-1, survivin, XIAP, and Ki67. THZ1 suppressed tumor growth in Hep3B xenografted mice in a time-dependent manner. IHC analysis indicated that tumors in THZ1 group had less Ki67+ cells and more cleaved caspase-3+ cells than those in vehicle group. THZ1 exhibited anti-HCC effects through irreversibly inhibiting CDK7 activity, decreasing RNAPII-CTD phosphorylation, inducing p53 expression and inhibiting antiapoptotic gene expressions, which subsequently induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of HCC cells.
