Nuclear-enriched RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are mainly involved in transcriptional regulation, which is a critical checkpoint to tune gene diversity and expression levels. We analyzed nuclear RBPs in human HCC tissues and matched normal control tissues. Based on the gene expression levels, PTBP3 was identified as top-ranked in the nuclei of HCC cells. HCC cell lines then were transfected with siRNAs or lentiviral vectors. PTBP3 promoted HCC cell proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and qRT-PCR assays verified that PTBP3 protein recruited abundant lnc-NEAT1 splicing variants (NEAT1_1 and NEAT1_2) and pre-miR-612 (precursor of miR-612) in the nucleus. NEAT1_1, NEAT1_2 and miR-612 expression levels were determined by PTBP3. Correlational analyses revealed that PTBP3 was positively correlated with NEAT1, but it was inversely correlated with miR-612 in HCC. The P53/CCND1 and AKT2/EMT pathways were determined by NEAT1 and miR-612 respectively in HCC. The PTBP3high and NEAT1high/miR-612low patients had a shorter overall survival. Therefore, nuclear-enriched RBP, PTBP3, promotes HCC cell malignant growth and metastasis by regulating the balance of splicing variants (NEAT1_1, NEAT1_2 and miR-612) in HCC.
