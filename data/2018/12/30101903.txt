A 79-year-old woman was referred for pancreatic tail cancer with multiple liver metastases. The pancreatic tail tumor was diagnosed as acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) histologically by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. Because of multiple liver metastases, S-1 chemotherapy was administered, resulting in a partial response to chemotherapy one year later. After approximately three years, liver atrophy and esophageal varices developed. We suspected S-1 as the cause of the liver cirrhosis. S-1 cessation minimized ascites and improved the esophageal varices. Although S-1 can potentially treat ACC, we should be watchful for liver cirrhosis caused by its long-term administration.
