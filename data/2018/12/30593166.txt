Rationale:Venous thrombus embolism (VTE) includes deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) which may be an initial symptom for patients with cancer. PE has diverse clinical manifestations and is a rare complication of testicular tumor (TT).Patient concerns:Here, we report a 21-year-old man admitted to our hospital due to syncope.Diagnoses:Clinical examinations upon admission demonstrated PE resulting in syncope. Further, a malignant TT, liver metastasis, and inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis were diagnosed.Interventions:Low molecular heparin was administered immediately after PE was diagnosed.Outcomes:The patient suffered from cardiac arrest on hospitalization.Lessons:Physicians should consider the possibility of TT when a young male patient presents with syncope and is diagnosed with PE that cannot be explained by a common cause. Treatment for TT and PE should be performed as early as possible to improve the prognosis of patients combine with TT and PE.
