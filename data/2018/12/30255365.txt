Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent human malignancy which its drug resistance is increasing world-wide. This project was designed to assess the anti-cancer effects of 4-bromo-2-(((5-chloro-2-hydroxyphenyl) imino) methyl) phenol ([IV(L)] complex) on the HepG2 cell line and also L929 cells, as normal cells. HepG2 and L929 cells were cultured in RPMI culture medium and the survival rates of the cells were determined after 24 and 48 h using MTT assay to find IC50 concentration of vanadium m, [IV(L)] complex. The early apoptosis and necrosis/late apoptosis were determined by means of annexin V/PI apoptosis detection kit. The results revealed that vanadium m, [IV(L)] complex induce early apoptosis higher in HepG2 cell line than L929 cells. The rates of necrosis/late apoptosis were also induced in HepG2 cells more than L929 cells. Based on the results, vanadium m, [IV(L)] complex might be considered as a safe new drug for treatment of HCC with low side effects on control liver cells.
