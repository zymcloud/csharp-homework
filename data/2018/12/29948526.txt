The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rising sharply in the United States and deaths from HCC have increased at the highest rate of all cancers. Though Asians have the highest incidence of HCC of all ethnicities in the US, racial/ethnic minorities, including Asians, have worse survival from HCC. We sought to identify barriers to care in treatment of HCC among affected individuals in the NYC Chinese immigrant community. We held focus groups with Chinese immigrant patients in NYC with HCC. 29 individuals participated in the focus groups. We analyzed focus group data using grounded theory methodology. Barriers to care identified included insurance, money, time, language, residency status, and stigma. The impact of provider bias and culture were also discussed. Knowledge gathering with minority patients with HCC is essential for us to fully comprehend the barriers to healthcare experienced by this community. Future policy and intervention efforts must be founded in this reality.
