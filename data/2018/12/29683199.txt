Objectives:The purpose of this study was to compare Superb Microvascular Imaging (SMI; Toshiba America Medical Systems, Tustin, CA) with conventional color flow Doppler (CFD) and power Doppler (PD) imaging in the liver to distinguish between malignant and benign liver neoplasms.Methods:After Institutional Review Board approval (number 449984-ED), patients undergoing routine pre-radiofrequency ablation planning ultrasound examinations for suspected hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) of less than 2 cm in diameter between January 1, 2015, and July 1, 2016, were prospectively identified. Four readers reviewed the ultrasound images independently for the presence or absence of flow centrally and along the periphery of the lesion.Results:Higher peripheral vessel grades were found on SMI than CFD (P Conclusions:More central and peripheral vessels were found around liver lesions on SMI than on CFD and PD imaging. Although there was significantly more vascularity on the periphery of malignant liver lesions than benign lesions, the overall diagnostic performance based on this criterion alone was relatively low, with an area under the curve of 0.64.
