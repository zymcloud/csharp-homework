Objective:To investigate the effect of danusertib (Danu), an inhibitor of Aurora kinase, on the proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and autophagy of hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells and explore the underlying mechanisms.Methods:MTT assay was used to examine the effect of Danu on the viability of HepG2 cells to determine the IC50 of Danu. The effect of Danu on cell cycle distribution, apoptosis and autophagy were determined using flow cytometry. Western blotting was used to detect the expressions of the proteins related to cell cycle, apoptosis and autophagy. Chloroquine was used to suppress Danuinduced autophagy to test the apoptosis-inducing effect of Danu.Results:Danu significantly inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells with IC50 of 39.4 μmol and 14.4 μmol at 24 h and 48 h, respectively. Danu caused cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase in HepG2 cells and led to polyploidy accumulation via up-regulating the expressions of p53 and p21 and down-regulating the expressions of cyclin B1 and DC2. Danu also caused apoptosis of HepG2 cells through up-regulating the expressions of Bax, Puma, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved PARP and cytochrome C and down-regulating the expressions of Bcl-xl and Bcl-2. Danu induced autophagy via activating AMPK signaling and inhibiting PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTOR axis, and inhibition of Danu-induced autophagy with chloroquine enhanced the pro-apoptotic effect of Danu.Conclusions:Danu inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, apoptosis and cytoprotective autophagy in HepG2 cells.
