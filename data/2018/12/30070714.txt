Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), death, or liver transplantation. NASH has also been associated with impaired health-related quality of life and poses a significant economic burden. Due to the negative clinical and patient-reported outcomes and economic burden of NAFLD, it is necessary to review this disease through the lens of value-based care, in which value is proportional to clinical and quality outcomes and inversely proportional to the costs of delivering these outcomes. I review the components of outcomes measured for patients with NAFLD and NASH and relate them to the value proposition, with the aim to deliver optimal patient-centered care.
