Upon binding to the canonical WNT glycoproteins, Frizzled family receptors (FZDs) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) undergo a series of polymerizations on the cell surface that elicit canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling. The hyperactivation of WNT/β-catenin signaling is the major cause of tumorigenesis, but the mechanism in tumors such as hepatoma remains unclear. Here, we observed that WNT3A manifested the hyperactivity in β-catenin-dependent signaling after binding to FZD's competitive inhibitory molecule secreted Frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2). To understand the mechanism of FZDs in the presence of SFRP2, we explored how FZDs can bind and activate the LRP5/6 signalosome independently of WNT glycoproteins. Our findings further revealed that oligomerizations of FZDs and LRP5/6 can integrate the cytoplasmic protein Dishevelled into the LRP5/6 signalosome, resulting in a robust activation of ligand-independent β-catenin signaling. We propose that besides WNT-bridged FZD-WNT-LRP5/6 protein complexes, the homo- and hetero-oligomerizations of WNT receptors may contribute to the formation of the LRP5/6 signalosome on the cell surface. Of note, we identified four highly expressed FZDs in the hepatoma cell line HepG2, all of which significantly promoted ligand-independent LRP5/β-catenin signaling. As FZDs are ectopically expressed in numerous tumors, our findings may provide a new perspective on tumor pathologies. Furthermore, the results in our study suggest that the composition and stoichiometry of FZDs and LRP5/6 within the LRP5/6 signalosome may tune the selection of bound WNT glycoproteins and configure downstream WNT/β-catenin signaling.
