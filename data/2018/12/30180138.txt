This study aimed to compare the surgical and oncological outcomes of laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) and open liver resection (OLR) for centrally located hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis. Between May 2013 and December 2015, 26 patients underwent pure LLR (14 underwent laparoscopic right anterior sectionectomy and 12 underwent laparoscopic central bisectionectomy). In total, 18 patients in the laparoscopic group and 36 patients in the open group were matched. When the LLR and OLR groups were compared, the operation time was found to be longer in the LLR group. However, LLR was associated with less blood loss, a shorter hospital stay, and earlier time to diet resumption. In this study, we confirmed that LLR for centrally located hepatocellular carcinoma can be safely performed in selected patients with cirrhosis despite a longer operation time.
