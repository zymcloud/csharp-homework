Introduction:We report a case of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and portal hypertension developing in a liver with biliary microhamartomas (von Meyenburg's complex).Case report:The patient was a 55-year-old man who had a past medical history of diffuse multiple liver abscesses. During follow-up examination, a hypovascular nodule measuring 2.1 cm in diameter was incidentally found in segment 8 of the liver. Surgical resection was performed based on a suspected diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. A gastrofiberscopy examination detected characteristic findings of portal hypertensive gastropathy. During the laparotomy, multiple tiny cystic lesions were observed in a diffuse pattern across the liver surface. The liver parenchyma was slightly fibrotic and haemorrhagic. A histopathological examination revealed intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with vascular invasions in von Meyenburg's complex. Multiple biliary adenomas were also observed among the biliary microhamartomas adjacent to the main tumour, suggesting that the malignant transformation of the biliary adenomas might have been responsible for the development of the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The histopathologic examination also revealed sinusoidal dilation and abnormal spacing of the portal tracts and central veins as evidence of portal hypertension.
