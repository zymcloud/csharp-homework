Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a rare spindle cell soft tissue tumor which is rarely encountered in the clinical setting and imaging findings are nonspecific, mainly occurring in the tissue structure of the serosa. However, there is very little report on SFT originating in the kidney in the medical literature. We report a case of SFT with liver metastasis in an adult female and discuss the pathological features as it appears in our case.
