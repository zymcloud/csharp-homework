Hsa-MicroRNA-124a-3p (hsa-miR-124-3p) is involved in tumor progression in certain malignant tumors. However, its function and clinical implication in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not yet been illustrated. In this study, we explored the expression and prognostic value of hsa-miR-124-3p in patients with HCC. Hsa-miR-124-3p expression in HCC was analyzed in silico, which was subsequently confirmed by quantitative PCR in 155 HCC biopsy samples. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival in HCC patients was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used. The in silico results demonstrated that hsa-miR-124-3p was reduced in cell lines and tissues of HCC, and hsa-miR-124-3p expression was lower in HCC tumor samples than in normal liver tissues. Moreover, a decrease in hsa-miR-124-3p expression was closely correlated with tumor diameter (â‰¥ 5 cm) and number of lesions (multiple). Lower hsa-miR-124-3p expression was shown to be correlated with a shorter OS and poor prognosis in HCC. Our findings demonstrate that hsa-miR-124-3p might be a potential target for the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC.
