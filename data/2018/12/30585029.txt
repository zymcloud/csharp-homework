Objective: To analyze the clinical efficacy and safety of (125)I radioactive seed implantation in the treatment of sub-capsular hepatocellular carcinoma (sub-HCC) with sequential radiofrequency ablation and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). Methods: The clinical data of 76 cases with advanced HCC with sub-capsular nodules including 68 males and 8 females, with an average age of (58±9) years, ranging from 33 to 78 years, enrolled in Lishui Central Hospital from January 2010 to December 2016 were collected.The average maximum diameter of tumor is (5.7±2.3) cm, ranging from 3.1 cm to 12.0 cm.The patients were divided into TACE+ RFA group and (125)I + TACE+ RFA group with 38 cases in each group.The overall survival (OS) and progression free survival(PFS) were calculated.The clinical efficiency and adverse events were evaluated. Results: The disease control rate were 84.2%(32/38) in (125)I + TACE+ RFA group and 63.2% (24/38) in TACE+ RFA group, χ(2)=4.34, P= 0.04.The median PFS were 18 months in (125)I + TACE+ RFA group and 11 months in TACE+ RFA group, χ(2)=4.84, P=0.03.The FPS cumulative rate in (125)I + TACE+ RFA group were higher than that in TACE+ RFA group at 6 months (94.7%±3.6% vs 81.3%±6.4%, Z=24.1>2.58, P=0.00), 1 year (89.2%±5.1% vs 40.7%±8.3%, Z=13.3>2.58, P=0.00) and 2 year (55.9%±8.6% vs 29.6%±8.2%, Z=7.2>2.58, P=0.00). The median OS were 42 months in (125)I + TACE+ RFA group and 30 months in TACE+ RFA group, χ(2)=4.76, P=0.029.The survival cumulative rate in (125)I+ TACE+ RFA group were higher than that in TACE+ RFA group at 1 year (92.1%±4.4% vs 83.8%±6.1%, Z=23.5>2.58, P=0.00), 2 year (75.8%±7.0% vs 59.8%±8.4%, Z=12.43>2.58, P=0.00), 3 year (59.0%±8.2% vs 41.7%±8.9%, Z=8.3>2.58, P=0.00), 5 year (34.2%±8.2% vs 18.2%±8.1%, Z=5.5>2.58, P=0.00). In addition, there was no statistical difference in liver function and complications between TACE+ RFA group and (125)I+ TACE+ RFA group. Conclusion: (125)I radioactive seed implantation plus TACE combined with RFA treatment is an effective and safe treatment for sub-capsular hepatocellular carcinoma.
