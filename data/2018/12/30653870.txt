Introduction: One of the most important risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is alcohol consumption: Studies in different populations suggest that the risk of liver disease could be associated with genetic variants of the enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism, such as alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and cytochrome P450 CYP2E1. Objective: To identify and characterize the allelic variants of ADH1B, ADH1C and CYP2E1 genes in Colombian patients with cirrhosis and/or HCC. Materials and methods: We included samples from patients attending the hepatology unit between 2005-2007 and 2014-2016 of a hospital in Medellin. Samples were genotyped using PCR-RFLP. We compared the results with two control groups and the 1000 Genomes Project database. Results: We collected 97 samples from patients with a diagnosis of cirrhosis and/or HCC. The two main risk factors were chronic alcohol consumption (18.6%) and cholangiopathies (17.5%). The most frequent genotypes in the study population were ADH1B*1/1 (82%), ADH1C*1/1 (59%), and CYP2E1*C/C (84%). Conclusions: This first study of polymorphisms in Colombian patients diagnosed with cirrhosis and/or HCC showed genotypes ADH1B*1/1, ADH1C*1/1 and CYP2E1*C/C as the most frequent. We found no significant differences in the genotype frequency between cases and controls. Further studies are necessary to explore the association between polymorphisms and the risk of end-stage liver disease from alcohol consumption.
