Background:To explore the value of parameters of multiphase dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MDCE-MRI) in the qualitative diagnosis of hepatic masses.Methods:Eighty patients with hepatic masses were retrospectively analyzed. All the patients underwent MDCE-MRI at 3.0 T MR before treatment. Mean enhancement time (MET), positive enhancement integral (PEI), a maximum slope of increase (MSI), and a maximum slope of decrease (MSD) were measured.Results:There were significant differences between benign and malignant hepatic masses with respect to MET, PEI, and MSI values. The PEI and MSI values between hemangiomas, hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), cholangiocarcinomas, and metastatic tumors had significant differences. The MSD value between metastatic tumors, HCCs, and hemangiomas were significantly different. The area under the curve (AUC) values of the receiver operator characteristic curves for MET, PEI, and MSI were 0.70, 0.72, and 0.80, respectively. The specificity of MET, PEI, and MSI were all 77%, and the sensitivities of MSI was the highest, of which was 82.40%. Logistic regression analysis showed the regression equation to be P = 1/[1 + e0.008 × 1 + 0.007 × 2-6.707], and taking the Youden index maximum points as a diagnostic point was 0.2946.Conclusion:Some parameters of MDCE-MRI have significant roles in differentiating hepatic masses.
