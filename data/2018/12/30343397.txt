The basic idea behind this study was to discover the association and prevalence of purinoceptors in hepatitis C virus (HCV) and non-HCV hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Immunohistochemistry was performed to study the expression of P2X4 and P2X7 receptors on ex-planted liver tissue samples that were collected from HCC patients. Antibodies specific for the P2X4 and P2X7 receptors were used to target the specific receptors and secondary antibody was used with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) detection system to visualize the color change in case of any positive expression There was a substantial increase in P2X4 receptor expression in HCV induced HCC as compared to non-HCV HCC. Surprisingly, there was no increase in the P2X7 receptor expression in both HCV HCC and non-HCV HCC. We conclude that P2X4 receptor expression was significant in the presence of HCV HCC. This may confirms the potential role of P2X4 receptor in the presence of virus in liver pathology. However insignificant expression of P2X7 receptor may avert our attention towards understanding the role of this receptor in pro-inflammatory and immune responses.
