Context:The metastasis of liver cancer is a major cause of clinical treatment failure, restrain, and control the cancer metastasis is the major strategy of the treatment and prevention of the disease. Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 1 (SATB1) gene was overexpressed in many malignant tumors and considered as a potential target of anticancer drug. This study investigated the mechanism how ganodermanontriol effect the expression of SATB1 and thus inhibits the growth and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Aims:This study explored mainly on the mechanism how ganodermanontriol affects the expression of SATB1 and inhibits proliferation of tumor on human hepatoma cell line HepG2.Settings and design:The cancer cells were treated with ganodermanontriol. The status of the cells was detected by different methods. The mechanism was checked by various methods.Materials and methods:In HepG2 cancer cells treated with various concentrations of ganodermanontriol, the cell proliferation of was detected by MTT assay, cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry; the mRNA of SATB1, Bcl-2, Bax were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the protein level of SATB1, Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase 3 were analyzed by Western blot.Statistical analysis used:Data are presented as the mean Â± standard deviation. The data were analyzed using SPSS 18.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). A one-way analysis of variance test was used to compare the differences among groups.Results:This study showed that ganodermanontriol could significantly reduce the expression level of SATB1.Conclusion:Therefore, downregulate the cascade effect caused by the expression level of Bcl-2 in HCC HepG2 cells.
Ganodermanontriol; human hepatocellular carcinoma; special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 1 gene.
