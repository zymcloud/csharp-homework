The tumor microenvironment (TME) represents a complex interplay between different cellular components, including tumor cells and cancer stem cells (CSCs), with the associated stroma; such interaction promotes tumor immune escape and sustains tumor growth. Several experimental approaches for cancer therapy are focused on TME remodeling, resulting in increased antitumor effects. We previously demonstrated that the hyaluronan synthesis inhibitor 4-methylumbelliferone (4Mu) decreases liver fibrosis and induces antitumor activity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this work, 4Mu, in combination with an adenovirus encoding interleukin-12 genes (AdIL-12), elicited a potent antitumor effect and significantly prolonged animal survival (p +, CD90+, EpCAM+, CD44+, and CD13+ CSC markers within HCC tumors (p < 0.01). Additionally, 4Mu downregulated the expression of the CSC marker CD47+ on HCC cells, promoted phagocytosis by antigen-presenting cells, and, combined with Ad-IL12, elicited a potent cytotoxic-specific T cell response. Finally, animal survival was increased when CD133low HCC cells, generated upon 4Mu treatment, were injected in a metastatic HCC model. In conclusion, the combined strategy ameliorates HCC aggressiveness by targeting CSCs and as a result of the induction of anticancer immunity.
