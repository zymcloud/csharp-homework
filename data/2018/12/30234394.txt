Objective:We had previously proved that insufficient radiofrequency ablation (RFA) could enhance invasiveness and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is mediated by activating β-catenin signaling. Thus, the aim of the present study was to demonstrate whether the combined treatment of interferon-α (IFN-α) and "Songyou Yin" (SYY) minimizes the pro-metastatic effects of insufficient RFA, as well as to explore its underlying mechanism.Methods:Insufficient RFA was performed in an orthotopic nude mice model of HCCLM3 with high metastatic potential. The effects of IFN-α, SYY, and combined IFN-α and SYY were observed in the animal model. Tumor sizes, lung metastasis, and survival time were assessed. Immunochemistry staining, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot were used to examine gene expression related to metastasis and angiogenesis in residual cancer after insufficient RFA.Results:For up to 8 weeks of treatment, the combined therapy significantly decreased the residual cancer sizes, minimized the lung metastasis rate, and prolonged the survival time of nude mice, which might be due to suppression of the EMT via β-catenin signal blockade, in addition to attenuating angiogenesis in residual cancer after insufficient RFA.Conclusion:IFN-α combined with SYY significantly weakened the enhanced metastatic potential of residual cancer after insufficient RFA by attenuating EMT, which is mediated through inhibiting activation of β-catenin. In addition, decreasing angiogenesis of residual cancer might also play a certain role.
