Background:The efficacy and safety of the FOLFIRI (leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) regimen combined with aflibercept has not been studied in the first-line management of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).Patients and methods:In the context of a prospective single-arm trial (NCT02129257), patients with mCRC received standard doses of a maximum of 12 cycles of FOLFIRI combined with aflibercept (4 mg/kg body weight delivered intravenously) every 2 weeks, followed by aflibercept maintenance. Endpoints were 12-month progression-free survival rate, efficacy, and toxicity.Results:Seventy-three fit patients were enrolled onto the study between 2014 and 2016. Median relative dose intensities administered were 0.80 for irinotecan and 1.0 for aflibercept. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (13 patients, 18%), febrile neutropenia (3 patients, 4%), diarrhea (11 patients, 15%), hypertension (19 patients, 26%), proteinuria (8 patients, 11%), infections (8 patients, 11%), and mucositis (6 patients, 8%), with no toxic deaths. The objective response rate was 46.6%, significantly associated with the presence of right-sided primary, synchronous metastases, and a relapse-free interval of < 12 months (odds ratio = 3.00, 2.92, and 3.75 respectively, P â‰¤ .05). Intermediate infiltration by stromal core lymphocytes correlated with progression-free survival (hazard ratio = 0.40, [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.19-0.83], P = .014). At a median follow-up of 24.5 months, 12-month progression-free survival rate was 21.9% (median overall survival 20.9 months [95% CI, 16.6-29], median progression-free survival 8.4 months [95% CI, 7.4-9.3]).Conclusion:The FOLFIRI + aflibercept regimen is active and tolerable; however, it failed to improve historical benchmarks of efficacy in chemonaive patients with mCRC. Preliminary data hint that this regimen has cytoreductive activity in disease with adverse biology.
