Introduction:This study aims to evaluate the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic minor hepatectomy (LMH) in elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 40 consecutive elderly (â‰¥ 70 years) patients were compared with 94 young patients (Results:Comparison between the baseline characteristics of elderly and young HCC patients showed that elderly patients were significantly more likely to have comorbidities, ASA score > 2, non-hepatitis B, previous liver resection and larger tumor size. Comparison between perioperative outcomes demonstrated that elderly patients were significantly more likely to have a longer operation time, increased blood loss, increased need for blood transfusion, longer Pringles duration and longer postoperative stay. Comparison between LMH and OMH in elderly patients demonstrated no significant difference in baseline characteristics except the LMH cohort were significantly more likely to have > 1 comorbidity, higher platelet count and lower median AFP level. Comparison between outcomes before and after PSM demonstrated that LMH was associated with longer operation time, increased blood loss, longer Pringles duration but decreased postoperative pulmonary complications and shorter postoperative stay compared to OMH.Conclusion:LMH is safe and feasible in elderly patients with HCC. However, LMH in elderly patients is associated with poorer perioperative outcomes compared to LMH in young patients. Comparison between LMH and OMH in elderly patients demonstrated advantages in terms of decreased pulmonary complications and shorter length of stay at the expense of increased operation time and blood loss.
