The term, acquired perforating dermatoses (APD), represents a group of skin conditions that develop in adulthood and are characterized by transepidermal elimination of dermal connective tissue. This appears clinically as a papulonodule with a keratotic core. Although APD is typically associated with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and several other conditions causing generalized pruritus, there have been reports in the literature describing an association of APD with select drugs including sorafenib. We present a case of acquired perforating dermatosis in a patient with HIV and hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing treatment with sorafenib.
