Polyphyllin has been reported to exhibit anticancer effects against various types of cancer via the proapoptotic signaling pathway. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the endoplasmic reticulum stress and death receptor signaling pathways in PPI-induced apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. Analysis demonstrated that PPI could significantly inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Investigation into the molecular mechanism of PPI indicated that PPI notably mediated ER stress activation via IRE-1 overexpression and activation of the caspase-12 to protect HepG2 cells against apoptosis. In addition, PPI markedly induced the expression of death receptors signaling pathways-associated factors, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1/TNF-Î± and FAS/FASL. Additionally, suppression of the death receptor signaling pathways with a caspase-8 inhibitor, Z-IETD-FMK, revealed an increase in the death rate and apoptotic rate of HepG2 cells. Collectively, the findings of the present study suggested that the ER stress and death receptor signaling pathways were associated with PPI-induced HepG2 cell apoptosis; however, endoplasmic reticulum stress may serve a protective role in this process. The combination of PPI and Z-IETD-FMK may activate necroptosis, which enhances apoptosis. Therefore, the results of the present study may improve understanding regarding the roles of signaling pathways in PPI regulated apoptosis and contribute to the development of novel therapies for the treatment of HCC.
