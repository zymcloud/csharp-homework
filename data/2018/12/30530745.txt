The GATA zinc-finger transcription factor GATA4 is expressed in a variety of tissues during mouse embryonic development and in adult organs. These include the primitive endoderm of the blastocyst, visceral endoderm of the early post-implantation embryo, as well as lateral plate mesoderm, developing heart, liver, lung and gonads. Here, we generate a novel Gata4 targeted allele used to generate both a Gata4H2B-GFP transcriptional reporter and a Gata4FLAG fusion protein to analyse dynamic expression domains. We demonstrate that the Gata4H2B-GFP transcriptional reporter faithfully recapitulates known sites of Gata4 mRNA expression and correlates with endogenous GATA4 protein levels. This reporter labels nuclei of Gata4 expressing cells and is suitable for time-lapse imaging and single cell analyses. As such, this Gata4H2B-GFP allele will be a useful tool for studying Gata4 expression and transcriptional regulation.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.
