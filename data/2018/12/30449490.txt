Objective:To develop criteria for safe and oncologically satisfying liver resection in case of early hepatocellular carcinoma with a 5-year overall survival (OS) similar to liver transplantation.Summary background data:Liver resection (LR) and liver transplantation (LT) are potentially curative treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma. Generally, LT achieves better OS. Due to organ shortage, however not all patients can receive a LT.Methods:To decide which patients to resect and which to transplant we have developed biological resection criteria (BRC) as a compound out of mGPS (modified Glascow Prognostic Scale) and the Kings-Score (for HCV cirrhosis). These are based on routine clinical values that reflect both liver function and tumor biology/immunology.Results:276 patients were analyzed. Patients undergoing LR within BRC (inBRC) had a significantly better overall (73.6% vs. 35.4%, (p < 0.001)) and disease-free survival (54.7% vs. 17.2%, (p < 0.001)) as compared to patients outside the BRC (outBRC). The predictive value of BRC was independent of tumor burden. In a subgroup analysis outBRC patients had significantly worse outcome after major resection. In LT patients BRC had no predictive value.Conclusions:BRC may be a valuable tool to predict survival after LR for HCC. Patients resected inBRC may achieve comparable survival as LT. LR in outBRC patients are unlikely to be curative. All outBRC patients should be monitored closely for salvage LT.
