Many patients in China have portal hypertension secondary to liver cirrhosis. Splenectomy and devascularization have become an efficacious surgical procedure for portal hypertension, and has been recommended in China as the first choice for the treatment of portal hypertension for a long time. As a result of advances in laparoscopic equipment and techniques, splenectomy and esophagogastric devascularization have been carried out with laparoscope.From January 2012 to December 2017, 453 patients who were diagnosed with portal hypertension and serious gastroesophageal varices received surgical management in our institution. 250 patients chose laparoscopic splenectomy and esophagogastric devascularization and 203 underwent open splenectomy and esophagogastric devascularization.We retrospectively analyzed the perioperative data and follow-up data of these patients. The operation time of laparoscopic group was longer than open group (P ≤ .001). Intraoperative blood loss was less (P ≤ .001), the passing of flatus was earlier (P = .042), and postoperative hospital stay was shorter (P = .001) in the laparoscopic group. During postoperative follow-up of 4 to 75 months, the incidence of esophagogastric variceal rebleeding, encephalopathy, and secondary liver cancer showed no significant differences.Laparoscopic splenectomy and esophagogastric devascularization were safe and more effective than open surgery for portal hypertension and gastroesophageal varices.
