Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), represents more than 85% of liver cancers. The diagnosis of HCC may be delayed due to the absence of early, sensitive and specific biomarkers. This study was conducted to investigate whether the expression of thioredoxin (Trx) and glutaredoxin (Grx) is helpful for HCC diagnosis in an experimental model. Twenty male albino rats were equally divided into two groups (HCC and control). Hepatocarcinogenesis was performed by single intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of 200 mg/kg of diethylnitrosamine (DENA). Two weeks later, 0.05% of phenobarbital (PB) was supplied in the drinking water for other 14 weeks. HCC was diagnosed by measuring serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level and histopathological examination. Our results found that hepatic indices alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), total bilirubin were elevated but decreased total protein level. Lipid peroxidation was elevated through increasing hepatic content of MDA with decreased antioxidant parameters like hepatic SOD, CAT activities and GSH. The current study also found that Trx and Grx tissue genes were overexpressed in HCC group significantly, compared to control group. This study substantiated that increased expression of these enzymes may be predictive of outcomes in HCC.
