Backgroud:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the primary palliative treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it is often accompanied by postoperative pain which hinder patient recovery. This study was to examine whether preemptive parecoxib and sufentanil-based patient controlled analgesia (PCA) could improve the pain management in patients receiving TACE for inoperable HCC.Methods:From June to December 2016, 84 HCC patients undergoing TACE procedure were enrolled. Because of the willingness of the individuals, it is difficult to randomize the patients to different groups. We matched the patients' age, gender and pain scores, and divided the patients into the multimodal group (n = 42) and control group (n = 42). Patients in the multimodal group received 40 mg of parecoxib, 30 min before TACE, followed by 48 h of sufentanil-based PCA. Patients in the control group received a routine analgesic regimen, i.e., 5 mg of dezocine during operation, and 100 mg of tramadol or equivalent intravenous opioid according to patient's complaints and pain intensity. Postoperative pain intensity, percentage of patients as per the pain category, adverse reaction, duration of hospital stay, cost-effectiveness, and patient's satisfaction were all taken into consideration when evaluated.Results:Compared to the control group, the visual analogue scale scores for pain intensity was significantly lower at 2, 4, 6, and 12 h (all P Conclusion:Preemptive parecoxib and sufentanil-based multimodal analgesia regime is a safe, efficient and cost-effective regimen for postoperative pain control in HCC patients undergoing TACE.
