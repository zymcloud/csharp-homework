Objectives:Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard therapy for patients with intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to determine whether combination therapy with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and TACE was superior to TACE monotherapy for intermediate-stage HCC and identify cases in which this technique was the most effective.Materials and methods:We selected patients with intermediate HCC who met the following eligibility criteria: (1) ≥ 20 years of age, (2) receiving initial therapy, (3) ≤7 tumors, and (4) maximum tumor diameter Results:Among the 103 patients, 92 were selected using PSM. The cumulative overall survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years for the TACE + RFA group were 97.4%, 70.4%, and 60.4%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those for the TACE group (92.7%, 55.7%, and 22.8%, respectively, p = .045). The recurrence-free survival rates at 0.5, 1, and 2 years for the TACE + RFA group were 80.0%, 58.6%, and 33.3%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those for the TACE group (34.5%, 8.8%, and 2.9%, respectively, p Conclusions:The addition of RFA to TACE improved cumulative overall and recurrence-free survival in patients with intermediate-stage HCC, especially in patients with AFP
