Background:It remains unclear whether preoperative blood donation is truly beneficial in liver surgery. The aim of this study was to compare surgical outcomes between patients receiving autologous and homologous transfusions during liver resection for biliary tract cancer (BTC).Methods:Patients who underwent hepatectomy for BTC were retrospectively reviewed (2006-2017). Patients who deposited autologous blood and underwent resection without homologous blood transfusion intraoperatively (Autologous group) were compared with non-depositing patients who required homologous transfusion during hepatectomy (Homologous group). Propensity score matching analyses were performed to adjust the data for the baseline characteristics of both groups.Results:During the study period, 359 patients were included in the Autologous group, and 105 patients were in the Homologous group. The postoperative maximum total bilirubin (T-Bil) levels and the incidence of postoperative liver failure were significantly higher in the Homologous group than in the Autologous group. After propensity score matching, postoperative maximum T-Bil levels were significantly higher in the Homologous group, whereas the incidence of postoperative liver failure was comparable between the two groups; between-group differences were not observed for the remaining major complications, hospital stays and mortality.Conclusion:Although autologous blood transfusion may minimize postoperative hyperbilirubinemia, it may not decrease the risk for mortality or morbidities following hepatectomy for BTC.
