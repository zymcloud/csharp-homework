Background:Anisakid nematodes (Anisakis spp. or Pseudoterranova spp.) usually infect gastric or intestinal walls, while they rarely infect in extra-gastrointestinal sites of human body. Generally, Anisakis spp. larvae are highly infected in fish intermediate hosts, whereas Pseudoterranova spp. larvae are very rarely infected. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports which have documented cases of hepatic anisakiasis caused by Pseudoterranova spp. This report describes the first documented case of hepatic anisakiasis due to infection with Pseudoterranova decipiens and clinical features of the hepatic anisakiasis through literature review.Case presentation:The case was a 28-year-old man with prior history of malignancy who was found to have a hepatic mass mimicking metastatic liver tumor. A new low density area of 20 mm in diameter in liver segment 7 was found on follow-up CT. With suspicious diagnosis of metastatic liver cancer, laparoscopic partial hepatectomy was performed. A pathological examination revealed no evidence of malignancy, but showed necrotic granuloma with eosinophil infiltration and the presence of a larva with Y-shaped lateral cords, which are specific to anisakid larvae. The type of larva was identified as Pseudoterranova decipiens sensu lato using PCR of DNA purified from a fixed granuloma embedded in paraffin.Conclusion:The present report is the first to discuss the case of a patient with hepatic anisakiasis caused by Pseudoterranova decipiens. Hepatic anisakiasis is a potential differential diagnosis for hepatic tumors and genetic identification with the PCR method was reliable for obtaining final diagnosis even when the larvae body in the resected specimen collapses with time.
