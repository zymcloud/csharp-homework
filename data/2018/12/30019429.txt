Tumor angiogenesis is one of the hallmarks of cancer as well as an attractive target for cancer therapy. Characterization of novel pathways that act in parallel with the VEGF/VEGFR axis to promote tumor angiogenesis may provide insights into novel anti-angiogenic therapeutic targets. We found that the expression level of Nogo-B is positively correlated with tumor vessel density in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While Nogo-B depletion inhibited tumor angiogenesis, Nogo-B overexpression promoted tumor angiogenesis in a tumor xenograft subcutaneous model of the human HCC cell line. Mechanically, Nogo-B regulates tumor angiogenesis based on its association with integrin αv β3 and activation of focal adhesion kinase. Moreover, Nogo-B antibody successfully abolished the function of Nogo-B in tumor angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that Nogo-B is an important tumor angiogenic factor and blocking Nogo-B selectively inhibits tumor angiogenesis.
