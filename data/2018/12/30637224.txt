Obstructive jaundice in the setting of a hilar mass raises strong suspicion of a cholangiocarcinoma, with diagnosis usually made on imaging. Jaundice, when present in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, is mostly related to underlying liver disease (i.e. cirrhosis) and only rarely to diffuse tumor infiltration of liver parenchyma or hilar invasion. We report here the good outcome of a 67 year-old patient who presented with obstructive jaundice, underwent surgery and was given a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, which was made only at histopathological examination of resected specimen.
