Introduction:Liver transplantation (LT) remains the best treatment option for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patient selection is crucial and debated ever since the emerging of the Milan criteria in 1996. As live-donor LT is being more routinely performed worldwide, numerous new and/or expansions of the original criteria have been suggested to allow more patients to benefit from this superior treatment modality. This study aims to contribute to the ever-growing data in search for better coverage of patients with acceptable outcomes.Methods:Medical recordings of 187 adult patients who underwent LT for HCC in a 6-year period were retrospectively collected. Patients were classified by Milan and University of California, San Francisco, criteria. Survival times as well as tumor, liver disease, and recurrence-related data were recorded for each patient and the outcomes were statistically analyzed.Results:Factors significantly affecting recurrence and survival were histologic differentiation, number and the size of the tumor, and the presence of vascular invasion. Serum alpha-fetoprotein levels did not significantly affect outcomes. Among the patients exceeding both of the criteria, having a total tumor size of less than 160 mm was significantly associated with better outcomes (P = .007).Conclusion:HCC patients having tumors with vascular invasion, poor differentiation, exceeding 6 in number and 160 mm in total diameter demonstrate higher recurrence rates and worse outcomes.
