Background:Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and active or previous hepatitis B virus (HBV) are at risk of HBV reactivation (HBV-R) during direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. Recent reports suggest that HBV-R may even occur several months after completion of DAA therapy. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of HBV-R in patients with resolved HBV after successful DAA therapy during long-term follow-up (FU).Methods:Among 848 patients treated for chronic HCV, all patients with resolved HBV and long-term FU data were eligible for inclusion. Patients were HBV DNA/hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative at the end of therapy (EOT) and were followed for up to 52 weeks thereafter. Patients underwent regular alanine transaminase (ALT) testing, and additional HBV DNA/HBsAg testing was performed at FU week 12, end of FU, and in case of an ALT increase above the upper limit of normal (>ULN).Results:A total of 108 patients were followed up for a mean (range) of 41.5 (24-52) weeks after EOT. None of the patients experienced reverse HBsAg seroconversion or reappearance of HBV DNA. One patient received a liver transplantation; 1 patient was diagnosed with de novo hepatocellular carcinoma, and 2 patients died. Eighteen patients (16.7%) had increased ALT levels (grade 0/1). Of those, the majority were male (72.2%) and significantly more patients had cirrhosis (66.7% vs 36.2%, P = .015) or received ribavirin as part of their treatment regimen (86.7% vs 46.8%, P = .041). None of these were associated with HBV-R.Conclusions:Our results indicate that the risk of HBV-R in patients with resolved HBV treated with DAAs for HCV is low during long-term follow-up.
