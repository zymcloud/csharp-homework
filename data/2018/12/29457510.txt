Purpose:To compare overall local tumour progression (OLTP), defined as the failure of primary ablation or local tumour progression, with single applicator monopolar radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), cluster-RFA and multi-bipolar radiofrequency (mbpRFA) in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ≤ 5 cm abutting large vessels (≥3 mm).Materials and methods:This multicenter, retrospective, per-nodule study was performed from 2007 to 2015. The study was approved by the ethics review board, and informed consent was waived. A total of 160/914 HCC nodules treated by thermal ablation and abutting large vessels (40 per treatment group) treated by monopolar RFA, MWA, cluster-RFA or mbpRFA were matched for tumour size, alpha-feto-protein level and vessel size. OLTP rates were compared by the log-rank test and the multivariate Cox model after matching.Results:No differences were observed in tumour size, vessel size or alpha-feto-protein levels among the three groups (p = 1). The cumulative 4-year OLTP rates following monopolar RFA, cluster-RFA, multi-bipolar RFA and MWA were 50.5%, 16.3%, 16.3% and 44.2%, respectively (p = 0.036). On multivariate Cox regression, vessel size ≥10 mm, monopolar RFA and MWA were independent risk factors of OLTP compared to cluster-RFA or mbpRFA.Conclusion:Multi-applicator RFA provides better local tumour control in HCC abutting large vessels than single-applicator techniques (monopolar RFA or MWA).
