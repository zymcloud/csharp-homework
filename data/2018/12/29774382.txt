Purpose:To determine the diagnostic potential of Material Density (MD) iodine images in dual-energy CT (DECT) for visualization and quantification of arterial phase hyperenhancement and washout in hepatocellular carcinomas compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Materials and methods:The study complied with HIPAA guidelines and was approved by the ethics committee of the institutional review board. Thirty-one patients (23 men, 8 women; age range, 36-87 years) with known or suspected Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) were included. All of them underwent both single-source DECT and MRI within less than 3 months. Late arterial phase and portal venous phase CT imaging was performed with dual energies of 140 and 80 kVp, and virtual monoenergetic images (at 65 keV) and MD-iodine images were generated. We determined the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for HCC in arterial phase and portal venous phase images. In addition, we introduced a new parameter which combines information of CNR in arterial and portal venous phase images into a single ratio (combined CNR). All parameters were assessed on monoenergetic 65 keV images, MD-iodine images, and MRI. Paired t test was used to compare CNR values in Mono-65 keV, MD-iodine, and MR images.Results:CNR was significantly higher in the MD-iodine images in both the arterial (81.87 ± 40.42) and the portal venous phases (33.31 ± 27.86), compared to the Mono-65 keV (6.34 ± 4.23 and 1.89 ± 1.87) and MRI (30.48 ± 25.52 and 8.27 ± 8.36), respectively. Combined CNR assessment from arterial and portal venous phase showed higher contrast ratios for all imaging modalities (Mono-65 keV, 8.73 ± 4.03; MD-iodine, 119.87 ± 52.94; MRI, 34.87 ± 27.34). In addition, highest contrast ratio was achieved in MD-iodine images with combined CNR evaluation (119.87 ± 52.94, P Conclusion:MD-iodine images in DECT allow for a quantitative assessment of contrast enhancement and washout, with improved CNR in hepatocellular carcinoma in comparison to MRI.
