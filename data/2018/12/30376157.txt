Introduction:Hepatic arterial infusion pump (HAIP) therapy for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) is beneficial in selected patients yet wide acceptance in the oncology community is lacking.Methods:A surgeon-led team implemented a HAIP program in 2012. Pumps were placed by laparotomy for CRLM and fluorodeoxyuridine was infused via HAIP every 28 days without systemic chemotherapy supervised by the operating surgeon.Results:Sixty patients were treated with HAIP, either in the adjuvant setting after liver resection or ablation of CRLM in 26 (43%) patients or with the unresectable disease in 34 (57%). Perioperative complications occurred in 19 (32%) and pump-specific complications in 14 (23%) that included intrahepatic biliary stricture in one (2%). Time to liver progression was a median 9.2 months (95% CI, 3.1-15.3 months) in unresectable patients and liver recurrence was a median 24.7 months (2.5-46.9 months) in the adjuvant group. Estimated 3-year overall survival from the time of HAIP placement was 64% in the adjuvant group and 37% in the unresectable group. Sarcopenia was prevalent (48%) and was associated with a worse survival (HR 2.4, 95% CI, 1.1-5.0).Conclusion:A surgeon-led HAIP program may achieve outcomes on par with those of experienced centers and foster strong relationships between surgical and medical oncologists.
