Hepatocellular carcinoma usually metastasizes to regional abdominal lymph nodes. Distant lymph nodal metastases are relatively rare with most common extra abdominal sites being mediastinum and juxtaphrenic regions. Metastasis to internal mammary lymph nodes is extremely rare, and we present a case of hepatocellular carcinoma with histopathologically proven internal mammary lymph nodal metastasis in the absence of regional abdominal lymph nodal metastases.
