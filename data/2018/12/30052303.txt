Background & aims:The development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) has decreased due to potent antiviral agents. However, it remains uncertain whether the risk of HCC will diminish after long-term antiviral therapy in Asia, where CHB is endemic and vertical transmission is common. This study aimed to compare the incidence of HCC within and beyond the first 5 years of entecavir (ETV) in treatment-na√Øve Korean patients with CHB.Methods:We performed a retrospective observational analysis of data from 894 consecutive, adult patients with CHB undergoing ETV treatment at a tertiary referral hospital in Ulsan, Korea from January 1, 2007 through April 31, 2017. We compared the HCC incidence rates per 100 person-years within and beyond the first 5 years. Univariate and multivariate analyses for factors predictive of HCC were performed.Results:The incidence rate of HCC in patients with CHB did not differ statistically when we compared within and beyond the first 5 years of ETV therapy (2.29% vs 1.66% per person-year, P = 0.217). Failure to achieve maintained virological response (MVR) was a major independent risk factor for HCC in patients at a follow-up of Conclusions:The incidence rate of HCC may not change significantly before and after 5 years of ETV therapy in Korean CHB patients. The risk of HCC in Asian CHB patients may remain in the long-term.
