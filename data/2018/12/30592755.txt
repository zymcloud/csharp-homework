Background:Most glycomics studies have focused on understanding disease mechanisms and proposing serum markers for various diseases, yet the influence of ethnic variation on the identified glyco-biomarker remains poorly addressed. This study aimed to investigate the inter-ethnic serum N-glycan variation among US origin control, Japanese, Indian, and Ethiopian healthy volunteers.Methods:Human serum from 54 healthy subjects of various ethnicity and 11 Japanese hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients were included in the study. We employed a comprehensive glycoblotting-assisted MALDI-TOF/MS-based quantitative analysis of serum N-glycome and fluorescence HPLC-based quantification of sialic acid species. Data representing serum N-glycan or sialic acid levels were compared among the ethnic groups using SPSS software.Results:Total of 51 N-glycans released from whole serum glycoproteins could be reproducibly quantified within which 33 glycoforms were detected in all ethnicities. The remaining N-glycans were detected weakly but exclusively either in the Ethiopians (13 glycans) or in all the other ethnic groups (5 glycans). Highest abundance (p Conclusion:The study revealed ethnic-specific differences in healthy human serum N-glycome with highest abundance of most glycoforms in the Ethiopian ethnicity. The results strongly emphasized the need to consider ethnicity matching for accurate glyco-biomarker identification. Further large-scale study employing various ethnic compositions is needed to verify the current result.
