Aim:The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) between 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based continuous infusion chemotherapy and low-dose cisplatin (CDDP) monotherapy in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Patients were grouped according to HAIC regimen (5-FU group, n = 317/CDDP group, n = 66). A two-to-one match was created using propensity score analysis (5-FU group, n = 102/CDDP group, n = 51). After matching, response rate (RR) and adverse events as primary end-points, and survival and progression-free survival as secondary end-points, were analyzed.Results:In the analysis of primary end-points, the RR in the 5-FU group was significantly higher than in the CDDP group (32.4% vs. 15.7%, P = 0.033). In patients with a Child-Pugh (CP) score of 5-7, the RR in the 5-FU group was significantly higher than that in the CDDP group (36.1% vs. 15.4%, P = 0.020). In those with a CP score of 8-9, there was no significant difference in RR between the two groups (15.8% vs. 16.6%, P = 1.000). The reservoir system-related complications were 9.8% in the 5-FU group, and there was no significant difference in the incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events between the two matched groups (P > 0.05). In terms of secondary end-points, the median survival time was 9.1 and 8.7 months for the 5-FU and CDDP groups, respectively (P = 0.4917). Progression-free survival was 3.9 months for the 5-FU group and 4.9 months for the CDDP group (P = 0.4).Conclusions:5-Fluorouracil-based continuous infusion chemotherapy could be suitable for advanced HCC patients with a CP score of 5-7 considering the treatment response.
