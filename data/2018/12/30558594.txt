Background:Laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH) has been identified to be effective and safe for elderly patients (≥70 years). This study aims to assess the short-and long-term outcome of totally laparoscopic liver resection for elderly patients with Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We retrospectively reviewed 93 patients with HCC who underwent LH from August, 2003 to July, 2013 in a single center. Short-term operative and postoperative outcomes together with long-term outcomes, including disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed.Results:A total of 81 patients was finally reviewed, of which 23 patients (28.40%) were grouped to elderly (≥70 years) and 58 patients (71.60%) were divided into younger group (Conclusions:Elderly patients could obtain comparable operative and survival benefits from LH for HCC as younger counterparts. Age may not be a contraindication to laparoscopic liver resection for elderly patients.
