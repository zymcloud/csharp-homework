Background:Histologic microvascular invasion (MVI) substantially worsens the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and can only be diagnosed postoperatively. Preoperative assessment of MVI by imaging has been focused on tumor-related features, while peritumoral imaging features have been indicated elsewhere to be more accurate. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the association between peritumoral imaging features and MVI.Methods:Literature search was performed using the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. Summary results of the association between peritumoral imaging features and MVI were presented as the odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were performed when heterogeneity was detected. Diagnostic accuracy analysis was also conducted for identified features.Results:Ten studies were included in the analysis. Moderate and low heterogeneities were found among the seven studies on peritumoral enhancement and four studies on peritumoral hypointensity on HBP, respectively. Summary results revealed a significant association between MVI and peritumoral enhancement (OR 4.04 [2.23, 7.32], p Conclusion:The two peritumoral imaging features are significantly associated with MVI. The two features highly suggest MVI only when present with a high false negative rate. Promotion of their diagnostic efficiency can be a worthwhile task for future research.
