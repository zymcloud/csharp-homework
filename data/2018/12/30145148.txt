Introduction:Numerous trials have examined the prognostic and predictive value of localization of the primary tumor (LPT) in metastastic colorectal cancer, there is limited information about the predictive value of LPT on different maintenance strategies.Materials and methods:We analyzed progression-free survival (PFS)/overall survival (OS) on maintenance therapy according to LPT and mutational subgroups (BRAF/RAS) in patients from the AIO (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internistische Onkologie) 0207 trial. Following induction, 471 patients were randomized to fluoropyrimidine (FU)/bevacizumab (Bev), Bev, or no treatment. Data on LPT were available in 414 (91%) patients.Results:A total of 291 patients were left-sided (LPTl, 70%), and 123 were right-sided (LPTr, 30%). The median PFS was 3.9 months for LPTr and 5.3 months for LPTl (P = .11; hazard ratio [HR], 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-1.48). There was no predictive impact of LPT on the maintenance strategies. The pairwise comparison of treatment arms showed a better PFS for FU/Bev versus no treatment independent from LPT (left, P < .0001; HR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.73-3.31; right, P = .011; HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.14-2.80). Analysis for OS (429 patients) confirmed the strong prognostic impact of LPT (left vs. right: 24.0 vs. 16.7 months; P < .0001; HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.32-2.06), but also without major interaction between the LPT and maintenance arms. The strong negative prognostic impact of BRAF mutation was confirmed in right-/left-sided metastastic colorectal cancer, reaching significance in LPTl. In patients with RAS mutational status, the negative prognostic impact of the mutation remains, but its effect is stronger in LPTl (P < .0001).Conclusion:The strong prognostic factor of LPT is confirmed undergoing oxaliplatin/FU/Bev induction therapy, whereas there seems to be no major predictive impact of LPT on different maintenance strategies.
