Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) frequently recur despite initial successful surgical resection or local ablation therapy. Diagnostic methods for small HCCs have improved with the introduction of gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Currently, sub-centimeter recurrent nodules showing typical hallmark imaging findings of HCC are frequently detected in patients with a treatment history for HCC. With five typical magnetic resonance findings, including arterial enhancement, washout on portal or transitional phase, high signal intensity on both T2-weighted image and DWI, and low signal intensity on hepatobiliary phase, sub-centimeter recurrent HCC can be diagnosed with high accuracy. Although more information is needed to determine the treatment of choice, local ablation therapy under fusion imaging and/or contrast-enhanced ultrasound guidance or cone-beam computed tomography-guided chemoembolization seem to be promising as they are effective and safe for the management of sub-centimeter recurrent HCCs.
