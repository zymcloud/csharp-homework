Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who are on liver transplant waiting list usually require local treatment to limit any risk of tumour growth. Historically percutaneous radiofrequency ablation or transarterial chemoembolization represented the major therapeutic alternatives. Depending on the size, or the topography of the lesion these two techniques may not be feasible. Radiation therapy under stereotactic conditions has recently emerged in the management of localized hepatocellular carcinoma as an alternative to the focused therapies performed to date. We herein report the case of a 43-year-old patient harbouring a complete histological response on explant after liver stereotactic irradiation and discuss its role in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma before liver transplantation.
