Background and objectives:Spontaneous rupture of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (srHCC) is a life-threatening emergency. We sought to identify the pre-operative predictors of early tumor recurrence/mortality including the role of inflammatory indices after partial hepatectomy for srHCC.Methods:Between 2000-2015, 79 patients with srHCC were identified to have undergone upfront partial hepatectomy following srHCC. Clinicopathologic data were retrospectively analyzed to identify pre-operative predictors of early (Results:Seventy-nine patients were identified to have undergone partial hepatectomy for srHCC. The 1-year mortality and 1-year recurrence rate in our series was 30.3% and 41.8% respectively. On multivariate analyses, free tumor rupture and a tumor size > 10 cm were identified to be independent predictors of early recurrence while an alpha fetoprotein (AFP) > 200 ng/mL was an independent predictor of early mortality. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio > 3 and prognostic nutritional index 180 was a predictor of early mortality on univariate analyses but not multivariate analyses.Conclusions:Tumor size > 10 cm, free tumor rupture, and an AFP > 200 ng/mL were useful predictors in avoiding "futile surgery" in patients with srHCC undergoing a partial hepatectomy. Preoperative inflammatory markers appear to be less useful as predictors of early recurrence/mortality in this cohort of patients.
