Purpose:Gemcitabine is among the standard first-line agents for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. However, as the median survival with gemcitabine monotherapy is 6 months, different combinations are being studied for better, prolonged survival. In this multicenter study, we aimed to compare the results of gemcitabine monotherapy with those of gemcitabine and cisplatin combination therapy as first-line treatments for metastatic pancreatic cancer.Methods:Data of 664 patients diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic cancer between January 2007 and December 2016 from seven oncology centers in Turkey were retrospectively evaluated, and 319 patients with gemcitabine alone (n=138) or gemcitabine and cisplatin combination (n=181) as first-line treatment were included.Results:The median patient age was 62 years (range 42-79), being 60 years (42-75) in the gemcitabine/cisplatin arm and 67 years (52-79) in gemcitabine alone arm. no complete response was observed in either arm, whereas partial response rates were 30.1% in gemcitabine/cisplatin arm and 15.3% in gemcitabine alone arm (p=0.001). median overall survival was 8 months (95% CI:7.7-10.2) and was significantly longer in the gemcitabine/cisplatin arm than in the gemcitabine alone arm (10 vs. 6 months, p=0.004).Conclusion:The cemcitabine and cisplatin combination therapy as first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer yields significantly prolonged survival over gemcitabine monotherapy. In patients with favorable performance conditions, the combination therapy should be preferred.
