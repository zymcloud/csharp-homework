A 76-year-old woman with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) showed elevated serum hepatobiliary enzyme levels, and abdominal imaging studies revealed a hepatic tumor. Her serum alpha-fetoprotein level was 759.5 ng/mL. A pathological examination after hepatectomy confirmed a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An examination of the surrounding liver revealed dilated vessels and thickened endothelial cells without inflammations. HHT patients without other risk factors (like this patient) reportedly have a lower incidence of common cancers, including HCC, in comparison to the unaffected population. One intriguing hypothesis that might explain the hepatocarcinogenesis in this situation is the ischemic liver cirrhosis theory, which suggests that chronic ischemia may cause parenchymal strain and promote inappropriate hepatocyte proliferation.
