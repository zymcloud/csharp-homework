Background and Aims: The poor outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients may be due to not only malignant tumors but also limited liver function. Therefore, as stated in major guidelines, only patients with relatively normal liver function (Child-Pugh A) would be referred for curative hepatectomy. Even so, the postsurgery survival rate of patients is still extremely poor. Direct curative resection may benefit most patients. This study aimed to improve the prognosis predicting accuracy of the Child-Pugh scoring system. Methods: This study included two cohorts: cohort A being composed of 613 HCC patients, with a 23-month median postsurgery follow-up time; and cohort B being composed of 554 tumor-free chronic liver disease patients. Kaplan-Meier test and Cox model were used for survival analysis. Independent-samples t test or one-way ANOVA was used to test the differences between different groups. Results: Serum prealbumin levels were found inversely correlated with worsening of fibrotic scores (r = -0.482, p < 0.001). Lower levels of presurgery prealbumin was an independent factor of poor postsurgery prognosis in Child-Pugh A patients, with a hazard ratio of 0.731 (p = 0.001). By integrating prealbumin together with total bilirubin level, serum albumin concentration and prothrombin time, a modified liver disease prognosis scoring system was developed to define traditional Child-Pugh A HCC patients as Modified Child-Pugh MCP-1, MCP-2 and MCP-3, with median postsurgery overall survival times of 44.00, 28.00 and 11.00 months respectively. Conclusions: Preoperative serum prealbumin is a valuable prognosis predicting biomarker for Child-Pugh A HCC patients who may be under consideration for curative resection. With serum prealbumin included as one of the parameters, the MCP scoring system might improve the postsurgery survival predicting accuracy for HCC patients.
