It has been proven that hepatitis C virus (HCV) eradication after interferon-based treatment can reduce the risk of hepatocarcinogenesis. However, there were some arguments about whether the treatment of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) boosts the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We systematically review this crucial topic by combining all the relevant articles to calculate the pooled HCC density after DAA treatment. Studies reporting the recurrence or occurrence in chronic hepatitis C patients who received DAA regimen were selected from three retrieval library screening. Data on baseline and outcomes were extracted independently by three observers. Primary outcomes were incidence density of HCC. Pooled estimates of HCC occurrence and recurrence rate per 100 person-years (py) were undertaken by random-effects meta-analysis. Sixteen studies with 61334 patients, embracing 20 cohorts, were enrolled in this study and divided into two groups (HCC occurrence and HCC recurrence). In the pooled analysis, HCC developed at a rate of 3.5/100 py [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.4, 5.3] among patients without a history of HCC compared with 17.4/100 py (95% CI: 7.8, 39.0) among patients existed. Furthermore, HCC occurrence rate following DAA-induced sustained virological response (SVR) was 2.1/100 py (95% CI: 1.4, 3.4); however, the rate in patients without SVR was 9.1/100 py (95% CI: 5.4, 15.3). HCV cured after DAA therapy could induce a reduction of 78% in the risk of HCC occurrence compared with non-responders. There is no strong evidence for an increased risk of HCC occurrence or recurrence in patients treated by DAA. There was a significant decline in the incidence of HCC occurrence after SVR.
