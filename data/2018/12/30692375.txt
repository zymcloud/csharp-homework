Here, we reported a case of a 39-year-old woman having rectal cancer with multiple liver metastases who underwent staged laparoscopic resection. She was diagnosed with low rectal cancer and multiple liver metastases; thus, she underwent low anterior resection and diverting colostomy. Following the neoadjuvant chemotherapy, she underwent colostomy closure and subsequent hand-assisted laparoscopic partial hepatectomy using the operative site during the colostomy closure. The postoperative course was uneventful, and adjuvant chemotherapy with CapeOX was performed 3 weeks post-surgery. Minimally invasive surgery was performed using hand-assisted laparoscopy.
