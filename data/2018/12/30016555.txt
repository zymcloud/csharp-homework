Background:Sustained virological response (SVR) rates for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients have drastically improved with the use of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies; however, a small minority of patients still fails to eradicate the virus. We analyzed factors associated with SVR in DAA therapy and the effect of age and liver fibrosis on treatment response.Methods:Nine hundred and eighteen patients with chronic HCV infection were treated with 24 weeks of daclatasvir plus asunaprevir (DCV + ASV) or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir (SOF + LDV), ombitasvir, paritaprevir plus ritonavir (OMB + PTV + r) or sofosbuvir plus ribavirin (SOF + RBV). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with SVR. The effect of age and liver fibrosis on SVR was analyzed.Results:The overall SVR rate was 95.4% (876 of 918 patients), and rates by DAA regimen were 93.4%, 95.7%, 100%, and 95.0% in DCV + ASV-treated, SOF + LDV-treated, OMB + PTV + r-treated, and SOF + RBV-treated patients, respectively. Patients older than 75 years achieved a similar SVR rate with those aged 75 years or younger (96.4% and 94.8%, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified absence of DAA therapy history (odds ratio [OR], 3.868 for presence; P = 0.002) and FIB-4 index of less than 3.25 (OR, 5.042 for â‰¥3.25; P = 0.001) as independent predictors for SVR. SVR rates were significantly lower in patients with FIB4 index of 3.25 or more compared with those with less than 3.25, especially in sofosbuvir-based therapies such as SOF + LDV-treated or SOF + RBV-treated patients.Conclusion:Both older and younger patients respond similarly to DAA therapy. Advanced liver fibrosis affects the virological response to sofosbuvir-based therapy.
