Purpose:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complicated disease with low survival rate due to frequent recurrence and the lack of efficient therapies. For advanced HCC, sorafenib, as the only approved first-line drug for HCC, improves the survival to some extent, but depressingly with severe adverse effects and emerging resistance conditions, which cause a poor prognosis. Ferroptosis is a new recognized way of non-apoptosis-regulated cell death, characterized by the iron-dependent accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides, showing a tremendous promising in the therapy of cancer, especially in HCC. To provide ideas for the diagnosis and treatment of HCC, we summarized the role of ferroptosis in HCC.Methods:The relevant literature from PubMed is reviewed in this article.Results:Interestingly enough, investigators have found sorafenib can induce ferroptosis in HCC. Moreover, recent researches reported increasing pathways and mechanisms related to ferroptosis in HCC such as TP53 and Rb, and strategies to improve sorafenib resistance by targeting ferroptosis. In addition, other drugs were reported to induce ferroptosis in HCC such as erastin and showed good efficacy in vivo and in vitro.Conclusion:In this review, we summarize pathways and mechanisms of ferroptosis in HCC and other digestive system neoplasms such as gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer and point out the trends of ferroptosis in HCC.
