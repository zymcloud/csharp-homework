Background:The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been shown to be predictive of outcomes in various cancers, including neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), and cancer-related treatments, including transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). We hypothesized that NLR could be predictive of response to TACE in patients with metastatic NET.Methods:We reviewed 262 patients who underwent TACE for metastatic NET at a single tertiary medical center from 2000 to 2016. NLR was calculated from blood work drawn 1 d before TACE, as well as 1 d, 1 wk, and 6 mo after treatment.Results:The median post-TACE overall survival (OS) of the entire cohort was 30.1 mo. Median OS of patients with a pre-TACE NLR ≤ 4 was 33.3 mo versus 21.1 mo for patients with a pre-TACE NLR >4 (P = 0.005). At 6 mo, the median OS for patients with post-TACE NLR > pre-TACE NLR was 21.4 mo versus 25.8 mo for patients with post-TACE NLR ≤ pre-TACE NLR (P = 0.007). On multivariate analysis, both pre-TACE NLR and 6-mo post-TACE NLR were independent predictors of survival. NLR values from 1-d and 1-wk post-TACE did not correlate with outcome.Conclusions:An elevated NLR pre-TACE and an NLR that has not returned to its pre-TACE value several months after TACE correlate with outcomes in patients with NET and liver metastases. This value can easily be calculated from laboratory results routinely obtained as part of preprocedural and postprocedural care, potential treatment strategies.
