The present study aimed to identify differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) and mRNAs in hepatitis B virus‑associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of five HCC tissues and paired adjacent non‑tumor tissues were screened to identify the differentially expressed miRNAs and target mRNAs using polymerase chain reaction microarrays. The interaction between differential miRNA and mRNA expression was concurrently analyzed using bioinformatics methods. A total of 32 differentially expressed miRNAs (four upregulated miRNAs and 28 downregulated miRNAs) and 16 differentially expressed mRNAs (11 upregulated mRNAs and five downregulated mRNAs) were identified. Among these, upregulated hsa‑miRNA (miR)‑96‑5p and hsa‑miR‑18b‑5p suppressed their target mRNAs forkhead box O1 and MET transcriptional regulator MACC1 (MACC1). Downregulation of hsa‑miR‑199a‑5p led to upregulation of its target mRNAs, cyclin dependent kinase 4 and insulin like growth factor 2 (IGF2). The high‑level expression of IGF2 mRNA and cyclin E1 mRNA was due to the low‑level expression of hsa‑miR‑145‑5p, hsa‑miR‑181a‑5p, hsa‑miR‑199a‑5p and hsa‑miR‑223a‑3p, and hsa‑miR‑26a‑5p and hsa‑miR‑26b‑5p, respectively. The low‑level expression of coronin 1A mRNA and MACC1 mRNA was due to overexpression of hsa‑miR‑517a‑3p and hsa‑miR‑18a‑5p, and hsa‑miR‑18b‑5p, respectively. Numerous gene ontology terms were associated with oncogenesis. The most enriched pathways targeted by the dysregulated miRNAs and mRNAs were associated with cancer and oncogenesis pathways. The present data suggested that differential miRNA and mRNA expression is present in HCC. Thus, interactions between certain miRNAs and mRNAs may be involved in the pathogenesis of HCC.
