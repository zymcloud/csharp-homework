The poor clinical outcome of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is ascribed to the resistance of HCC cells to traditional treatments and tumor recurrence after curative therapies. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been identified as a small subset of cancer cells which have high capacity for self-renewal, differentiation and tumorigenesis. Recent advances in the field of liver CSCs (LCSCs) have enabled the identification of CSC surface markers and the isolation of CSC subpopulations from HCC cells. Given their central role in cancer initiation, metastasis, recurrence and therapeutic resistance, LCSCs constitute a therapeutic opportunity to achieve cure and prevent relapse of HCC. Thus, it is necessary to develop therapeutic strategies to selectively and efficiently target LCSCs. Small molecular inhibitors targeting the core stemness signaling pathways have been actively pursued and evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies. Other alternative therapeutic strategies include targeting LCSC surface markers, interrupting the CSC microenvironment, and altering the epigenetic state. In this review, we summarize the properties of CSCs in HCC and discuss novel therapeutic strategies that can be used to target LCSCs.
