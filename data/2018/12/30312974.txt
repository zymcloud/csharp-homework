Liver fibrosis is a wound-healing response characterized by the accumulation of extracellular matrix following various liver injuries, which results in the deformation of the normal liver architecture and the development of liver cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that oxidative stress mediates the initiation and progression of liver fibrosis. Overaccumulation of reactive oxygen species disrupts macromolecules, induces necrosis and apoptosis of hepatocytes, stimulates the production of pro-fibrogenic mediators, and directly activates hepatic stellate cells, thereby resulting in liver damage and initiating liver fibrosis. Ameliorating oxidative stress is a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of liver fibrosis. Natural antioxidants have attracted increasing attention in treating liver fibrosis due to their safety and efficacy. In this review, the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis and the role of oxidative stress in liver fibrosis were discussed. Naturally occurring antioxidants that can treat and prevent liver fibrosis were summarized. Advances in clinical trials were also presented. The main purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge from the biological importance of oxidative stress in liver fibrosis to representative antioxidants for treating liver fibrosis. Naturally occurring antioxidants show a potential for further investigations as lead compounds in fighting liver fibrosis.
