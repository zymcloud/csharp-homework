Background:Preoperative strategies to increase the future liver remnant are useful methods to improve resectability rates for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the main strategies used for this purpose.Methods:A systematic review was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and Scielo/LILACS. The procedures included for analysis were portal vein embolization or ligation (PVE/PVL), sequential transarterial embolization and PVE (TACE + PVE), radioembolization (RE) and associated liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS). Perioperative morbidity and mortality, post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF), and survival rates were evaluated.Results:A total of 46 studies were included in the systematic review (1284 patients). Resection rate was higher in TACE + PVE (90%; N = 315) when compared to PVE/PVL (75%; N = 254; P = Conclusion:Preoperative strategies to increase liver volume are effective in achieving resectability of HCC. TACE + PVE is as safe as PVL/PVE providing higher OS. ALPPS is associated with a higher risk of PHLF, major complications, and mortality. RE despite the small experience seems to present similar resection rate and OS as TACE + PVE with higher rate of major complications.
