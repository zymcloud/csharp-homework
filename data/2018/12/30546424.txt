In order to determine the diagnostic efficacy of microRNA (miR)-122-5p and to identify the potential molecular signaling pathways underlying the function of miR-122-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the expression profiles of data collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and literature databases were analyzed, along with any associations between clinicopathological characteristics and the diagnostic value of miR-122-5p in HCC. The intersection of 12 online prediction databases and differentially expressed genes from TCGA and GEO were utilized in order to select the prospective target genes of miR-122-5p in HCC. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and protein-protein interaction network (PPI) analyses were subsequently performed based on the selected target genes. The average expression level of miR-122-5p was decreased in HCC patients compared with controls from TCGA database (P
