Incidental intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is a rare neoplastic lesion in the explant liver specimens with an approximate incidence of 0.7%. The detection of iCCA is associated with poor prognosis in the posttransplant setting. The occurrence of a subcentimetric iCCA is very rare and poses a major diagnostic challenge to the pathologist. This article presents a rare case of subcentimetric iCCA in a young male in the background of advanced stage chronic liver disease resulting from autoimmune hepatitis possibly with chronic cholangiopathy along with the histomorphological differentials.
