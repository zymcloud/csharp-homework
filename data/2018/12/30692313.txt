We report a case of pathologicallycomplete response in ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)treated with transcatheter arterial embolization(TAE). A 56-year-old man presented to our hospital with a hepatic tumor. Enhanced computed tomography(CT)revealed a tumor 65mm in diameter at S7/8 of the liver and the presence of abdominal fluid collection around the tumor. We diagnosed rupture of HCC and selective TAE was subsequentlyperformed. After TAE, the elevated PIVKA- / â…¡ tumor marker level(1,008mAU/mL)decreased to the normal level. Three weeks after TAE, we performed right hepatectomy. The resected specimen revealed that the tumor consisted of necrotic tissue. Viable tumor cells were absent in this tumor. The pathological diagnosis was therefore HCC in which complete response was obtained with TAE.
