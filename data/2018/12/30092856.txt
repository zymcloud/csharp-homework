Inbred mice are the most popular animals used for in vivo liver research. These mice are genetically defined, readily available, less expensive to maintain than larger animals, and enjoy a broad array of commercial reagents for scientific characterization. C57BL/6 mice are the most commonly used strain. However, other strains discussed, including BALB/c, C3H, A/J, and FVB/N, may be better suited to a particular disease model or line of investigation. Understanding the phenotypes of different inbred mouse strains facilitates informed decision making during experimental design. Model systems influenced by strain-dependent phenotype include tissue regeneration, drug-induced liver injury (DILI; e.g., acetaminophen), fibrosis (e.g., carbon tetrachloride, CClâ‚„), Fas-induced apoptosis, cholestasis, alcohol-induced liver disease and cirrhosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis (NAFLD/NASH), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thoughtful consideration of the strengths and weaknesses of each inbred strain in a given model system will lead to more robust data and a clearer understanding of translational relevance to human liver disease.
