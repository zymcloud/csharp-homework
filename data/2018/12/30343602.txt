MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved, noncoding small RNAs that regulate gene expression, and consequently several important functions including early embryo development, cell cycle, programmed cell death, cell differentiation, and metabolism. While there are no effective treatments available against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), some Chinese herbal medicines have been shown to regulate growth, differentiation, invasion, and metastasis of HCC. Many studies have shown that Chinese herbal medicines regulate the expression of miRNAs and this may be associated with their ability to control the development of HCC. In this article, the effects of Chinese herbal medicines on the expression of miRNAs and their functions in the regulation of HCC have been reviewed and discussed. miRNAs such as miRNA-221 and miRNA-222 mediated by Chinese herbal medicines may be good biomarkers and therapeutic targets for HCC.
