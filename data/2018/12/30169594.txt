Accumulating evidence suggests that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays important roles in some malignant tumors. However, the mechanism underlying how lncRNA regulates hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) process remains largely unknown. In this study, we explored the potential role of lncRNA 00607 as a novel tumor suppressor in HCC. In this study, we examined the regulation of lncRNA 00607 by the important inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). We also determined the expression of LINC000607 in 159 HCC tumors and paired adjacent tissues. Effects of LINC000607 in HCC proliferation and apoptosis were examined in vitro in HCC cell lines and in vivo tumor xenografts. Furthermore, we also examine underlying mechanism by which lncRNA 00607 regulates NF-κB p65 and how LIN00607 exerts its tumor suppressor role in HCC. We found that lncRNA 00607 expression level is lower in HCC tumors compared with matched normal liver tissue, and its low expression predicts worse prognosis in HCC. Functionally, lncRNA 00607 overexpression leads to decreased HCC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, enhanced apoptosis and chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity. Mechanistically, lncRNA 00607 inhibits the p65 transcription by binding to the p65 promoter region, therefore contributing to increased p53 levels in HCC. Taken together, the findings of this study show that the TNF-α/IL-6-lncRNA 00607-NF-κB p65/p53 signaling axis represents a novel therapeutic avenue in cancer chemotherapy.
