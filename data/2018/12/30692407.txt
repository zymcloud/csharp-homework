Peritoneal metastasis is relatively rare in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). No consensus has been reached regarding the treatment of this type of metastasis. Herein, we report 3 patients who underwent resection of peritoneal metastasis due to HCC. Case 1: A 48-year-old man underwent hepatectomy twice and radiofrequency ablation(RFA)once for HCC. Eight years after the initial resection, he underwent resection of peritoneal metastasis in the pelvic floor. He is alive with disease 17 months after the last operation. Case 2: A 71-year-old man with a history of percutaneous ablation therapy for HCC 3 times underwent hepatectomy for recurrent HCC. During the laparotomy, a peritoneal metastatic tumor was found near the live tumor, and simultaneous resection of both the tumors was performed. The patient died of recurrent disease 20 months after the last resection. Case 3: A 58-year-old man underwent hepatectomy for HCC and RFA for its recurrence. Peritoneal metastasis that invaded the duodenum was detected 8 years after the hepatectomy. Although the metastatic tumor was resected, he died of the carcinoma 2 months after the resection. We concluded that resection of peritoneal metastasis provides a survival benefit for selected patients with HCC.
