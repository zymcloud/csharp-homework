Background:Splicing factor 3b subunit 4 (SF3B4) is a splicing factor and potential oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, its regulatory mechanism is yet unclear. We aimed to determine the role of SF3B4 in HCC and the underlying mechanism.Methods:To investigate the association between alternative splicing events and miRNAs, putative miRNAs were screened using TargetScan. Expression levels of and prognostic information for SF3B4 and miRNAs were determined based on public genomic data and clinical samples. Then, we examined the possible roles of SF3B4 and miRNA-133b in HCC cells and a xenograft mouse model. Pearson correlation analysis and in vitro experiments verified SF3B4 as a miRNA-133b target. Protein levels of key targets from the SF3B4 signaling pathway were estimated using western blotting.Findings:The expression of SF3B4 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines whereas, the expression of miRNA-133b was downregulated. MiRNA-133b negatively regulated the expression of SF3B4. Effects of SF3B4 overexpression were partially abolished by miRNA-133b mimics, confirming that SF3B4 is a target of miRNA-133b. Moreover, molecules associated with SF3B4, including KLF4, KIP1, and SNAI2, were also modulated by miRNA-133b.Interpretation:SF3B4 plays a crucial role in HCC and is negatively regulated by miRNA-133b. The miRNA-133b/ SF3B4 axis may serve as a new therapeutic target for HCC treatment.
