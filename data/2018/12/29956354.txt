What is known and objective:No studies have evaluated the use of sorafenib with the direct-acting antiviral ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir (OBV/PTV/r+DSV).Case summary:Three hepatitis C virus genotype 1b-infected patients with well-preserved liver function were included in this prospective case series. The patients were taking sorafenib for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and received OBV/PTV/r+DSV for 12 weeks. One patient discontinued sorafenib while concomitant treatment due to grade 2 fatigue and muscular pain. The other two patients reported only grade 1 adverse effects. Sustained virologic response at 24 weeks was achieved, and no tumour recurrences were found.What is new and conclusion:The concurrent use of OBV/PTV/r+DSV with sorafenib was considered safe and effective.
