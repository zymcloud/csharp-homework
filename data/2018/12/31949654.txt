WDR1, an activator of cofilin-mediated actin depolymerization, is involved in various actin-dependent processes of living cells including cell migration and cytokinesis. Recently, several studies have found that WDR1 is dysregulated in several types of cancer and is associated with cancer metastasis. However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. In this study, we found that WDR1 expression was aberrantly upregulated at the mRNA and protein levels in HCC cell lines and HCC tissues. WDR1 overexpression was highly correlated with tumor aggressive phenotypes such as capsulation formation, microvascular invasion (MVI), tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, and was an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for HCC patients after curative surgery. Furthermore, WDR1 overexpression significantly promoted HCC cell migration, invasion and proliferation. In contrast, WDR1 downregulation inhibited HCC cell migration, invasion and proliferation. Conclusion: This study indicates that WDR1 could be used as a new useful prognostic marker and may be a potential therapeutic target for HCC.
