Background:Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ICCs) are primary liver malignancies and are the second most common type of malignancy after hepatocellular carcinoma. ICCs are heterogeneous in clinical features, genotype, and biological behavior, suggesting that ICCs can initiate in different cell lineages.Aim:We investigated intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma RBE cell lines for the markers neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and c-Kit, which possess hepatic progenitor cells properties.Methods:NCAM + c-Kit + cells were tested for hepatic progenitor cell properties including proliferation ability, colony formation, spheroid formation, and invasiveness in NOD/SCID mice. The Agilent Whole Human Genome Microarray Kit was used to evaluate differences in gene expression related to stem cell signaling pathways between NCAM + c-Kit + and NCAM-c-Kit- subset cells. Microarray results were further confirmed by real-time RT-PCR.Results:NCAM + c-Kit + cells showed hepatic progenitor cell-like traits including the abilities to self-renew and differentiate and tumorigenicity in NOD/SCID mice. Differences were observed in the expression of 421 genes related to stem cell signaling pathways (fc ≥ 2 or fc ≤ 0.5), among which 231 genes were upregulated and 190 genes were downregulated.Conclusion:NCAM + c-Kit + subset cells in RBE may have properties of hepatic progenitor cells. NCAM combined with c-Kit may be a valuable marker for isolating and purifying ICC stem/progenitor cells.
