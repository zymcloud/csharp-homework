Aim:Norcantharidin (NCTD) has been used as a clinical antineoplastic drug in China for several years, and diamminedichloroplatinum is a valuable clinical cancer chemotherapy agent. Here, we tried to investigate the effects of NCTD plus diamminedichloroplatinum on hepatic carcinoma in murine.Materials and methods:In vivo and in vitro investigations on anticancer effects of the two drugs were individually made.Result:In vitro, the combination of the two drugs resulted in apparent apoptosis and cell proliferation inhibitions of H22 cancer cells. Meanwhile, their coadministration in vivo produced significant suppressions of tumor growth and cancerometastasis. Further, CD31 immunohistochemistry and matrigel tube formation assay demonstrated that angiogenesis was inhibited by NCTD plus diamminedichloroplatinum in vivo and in vitro, respectively.Conclusion:Based on the findings, we concluded that NCTD plus diamminedichloroplatinum may have an additive anticancer efficacy because the two drugs work in different ways, and thus, their combination had inhibited cancer cell proliferations and tumor angiogenesis more effectively than either of the compounds alone.
Diamminedichloroplatinum; hepatic carcinoma; norcantharidin.
