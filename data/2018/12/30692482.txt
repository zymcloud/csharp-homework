Gemcitabine and cisplatin combination therapy(GC therapy)is now considered a highly effective regimen for patients with unresectable and metastatic biliary tract cancer. We performed GC therapy for 18 patients between January 2014 and April 2018. The median age of the patients was 67.5 years, and 13 patients were men. Fifteen patients had a performance status (PS)score of 0, and 3 patients had a PS score of 1. Nine patients had distal cholangiocarcinoma, 3 had intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 3 had duodenum papilla cancer, and 3 had gallbladder cancer. Fourteen patients showed recurrence after the radical resection, and 9 had liver metastasis. Sixteen patients had over Grade 3 hematological or non-hematological toxicities. The most-common adverse event was neutropenia. None of the patients had Grade 5 adverse events. The response rate was 11.1%, and the disease-control ratio was 66.7%. GC therapy was effective for patients with unresectable and recurrent biliary tract cancer. However, it is necessary to examine the eligibility of patients before treatment.
