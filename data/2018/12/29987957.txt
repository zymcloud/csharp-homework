Drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) is a relative new endovascular treatment based on the use of microspheres to release chemotherapeutic agents within a target lesion with controlled pharmacokinetics. This aspect justifies the immediate success of DEB-TACE, that nowadays represents one of the most used treatments for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. However, there is no consensus about the choice of the best embolotherapy technique. In this review, we describe the available microspheres and report the results of the main comparative studies, to clarify the role of DEB-TACE in the hepatocellular carcinoma management. We underline that there is no evidence about the superiority of DEB-TACE over conventional TACE in terms of efficacy, but there may be some benefits with respect to safety especially with the improvement of new technologies.
