We herein report the case of a woman in her 80s with a recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor that rapidly increased in size during direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment. She suffered from HCC at her initial visit to our department and underwent hepatectomy. Thereafter, she underwent DAA treatment for chronic hepatitis C; however, her alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level rapidly increased, and a liver tumor of > 1 cm in diameter was observed that had not been seen immediately before DAA treatment. She underwent hepatectomy again and moderate to poorly differentiated HCC was diagnosed. The patient's AFP level showed a rapid increase immediately after the start of DAA treatment; however, the increase ceased after the first month, and the influence from the surrounding environment of the tumor was considered to be temporary.
