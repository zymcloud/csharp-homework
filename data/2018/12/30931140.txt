Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) after hepatobiliary surgery is rare but can cause lethal and severe complications. If early diagnosis and recanalization can be achieved, the PVT is expected to be eliminated. A 70-year-old male was diagnosed as having hepatocellular carcinoma occupying the right lobe of the liver. As oligometastatic lung tumors were simultaneously detected on contrast-enhanced CT (CECT), hepatectomy was not indicated. However, the primary tumor was very large, and as large tumor size can be associated with an unfavorable prognosis, and owing to the strong desire of the patient, he underwent right lobe hepatectomy. Jaundice appeared on post-operative Day (POD) 2 and CECT displayed slight intraheptatic bile duct dilation. However, a PVT did not exist at this time. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage was performed and Doppler echo displayed intrahepatic and extrahepatic PVT on post-operative Day 5. Emergent thrombectomy was performed using a Vasplyser PlusTM thrombus aspiration catheter (Johnson & Johnson K.K. Medical Company, Tokyo, Japan) via the ileocolic vein under laparotomy. The mesenteric catheter was placed at the distal point of the residual PVT. Thrombolysis and anticoagulant therapy were performed using heparin and urokinase. In the CECT performed 16 days after the additional operation, the PVT had disappeared and the portal vein was completely recanalized. The mesenteric catheter was removed on the same day and oral anticoagulant therapy was continued. At the time of writing, 14 months have passed with no recurrence of PVT. Early diagnosis of PVT enables treatment with emergent thrombectomy, thrombolysis, and anticoagulant therapy. These treatments result in the improvement of portal vein flow and the complete disappearance of PVT.
