Background:Many centers implement everolimus-based immunosuppression in liver transplant patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to explore the potential impact of early initiated everolimus on tumor recurrence after liver transplantation.Methods:This study included 192 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing liver transplantation among who 64 individuals were prospectively enrolled (2012-2015) and received early initiated everolimus (ie, started between postoperative day 15 to 21), whereas the remaining 128 patients acted as historical controls without everolimus. Propensity score matching was performed to ensure comparability. Multivariate Cox regression and competing risks analysis were used to control for potential confounders.Results:Patients with and without everolimus were comparable in terms of number of nodules (P = 0.37), total tumor diameter (P = 0.44), Milan criteria fulfillment (P = 0.56), and histological differentiation (P = 0.61), but there were increased microvascular invasion rates in the everolimus group (26.5% vs 13.3%; P = 0.026). Tumor recurrence rates were similar with and without everolimus (10.9% vs 9.9% at 36 months respectively; P = 0.18). After controlling for microvascular invasion among other potential confounders, everolimus had no significant impact on tumor recurrence, neither in the multivariate Cox regression (relative risk = 3.23; P = 0.09), nor in the competing risks analysis for tumor recurrence-death (relative risk = 1.02; P = 0.94). Patients receiving everolimus had reduced tacrolimus trough concentrations and lower serum creatinine within the first 18 months postliver transplantation.Conclusion:Everolimus may not be universally prescribed to prevent tumor recurrence in liver transplant patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Future randomized trials should be focused on patients with histological features of increased tumor aggressiveness, in whom the potential benefit would be higher.
