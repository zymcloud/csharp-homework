Purpose:Parametric response mapping (PRM) is a novel image-analysis technique applicable to assess tumor viability and predict intrahepatic recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). However, to date, the prognostic value of PRM for prediction of overall survival in HCC patients undergoing TACE is unclear. The objective of this explorative, single-center study was to identify cut-off values for voxel-specific PRM parameters that predict the post TACE overall survival in HCC patients.Methods:PRM was applied to biphasic CT data obtained at baseline and following 3 TACE treatments of 20 patients with HCC tumors â‰¥ 2 cm. The individual portal venous phases were registered to the arterial phases followed by segmentation of the largest lesion, i.e., the region of interest (ROI). Segmented voxels with their respective arterial and portal venous phase density values were displayed as a scatter plot. Voxel-specific PRM parameters were calculated and compared to patients' survival at 1, 2, and 3 years post treatment to identify the maximal predictive parameters.Results:The hypervascularized tissue portion of the ROI was found to represent an independent predictor of the post TACE overall survival. For this parameter, cut-off values of 3650, 2057, and 2057 voxels, respectively, were determined to be optimal to predict overall survival at 1, 2, and 3 years after TACE. Using these cut points, patients were correctly classified as having died with a sensitivity of 80, 92, and 86% and as still being alive with a specificity of 60, 75, and 83%, respectively. The prognostic accuracy measured by area under the curve (AUC) values ranged from 0.73 to 0.87.Conclusion:PRM may have prognostic value to predict post TACE overall survival in HCC patients.
