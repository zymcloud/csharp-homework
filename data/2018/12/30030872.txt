Aim:The aim of this study is to clarify the value of serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+ -M2BP) for predicting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis C patients who achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) by therapy with interferon-free, direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).Methods:This is a retrospective cohort study that included 567 patients who underwent antiviral therapy with an interferon-free DAA regimen and achieved SVR. Serum WFA+ -M2BP was measured after SVR. Factors predictive of HCC occurrence and recurrence were analyzed in the patients after stratification by previous treatment history of HCC.Results:Among 518 patients who had no history of HCC, 13 developed HCC. Post-SVR WFA+ -M2BP ≥1.75 cut-off index (C.O.I., P < 0.001) and α-fetoprotein (AFP) level ≥6 ng/mL (P = 0.01) were significant predictors of HCC development. Multivariate analysis showed that post-SVR WFA+ -M2BP ≥1.75 C.O.I. was an independent factor significantly associated with the development of HCC (hazard ratio [HR] 6.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.8-19.4; P = 0.003). Among 49 patients who had a previous history of HCC, 22 had recurrence after SVR. Post-SVR AFP ≥6 ng/mL was the only factor associated with recurrence-free survival (HR 3.1; 95% CI, 1.3-7.5; P = 0.01).Conclusions:Post-SVR WFA+ -M2BP is a predictive factor for the development of HCC in patients with no previous HCC history and treated with DAAs. Post-SVR AFP was predictive for HCC recurrence after DAA therapy.
