Background:Sorafenib is an effective clinical drug in therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma, having led to improved prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. However acquired resistance is still being encountered. So, it is urgently to develop alternative strategies to overcome drug resistance. Exosomes can be modified with a variety of molecules, thereby acting as a vehicle for the delivery of therapeutic agents. The GRP78 is overexpressed in Sorafenib resistant cancer cells compared to Sorafenib sensitive cancer cells and thus is able to act as a target for therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma.Results:In this study, we modified BM-MSCs to express the exosomal siGRP78. And we show that siGRP78 modified exosomes combined with Sorafenib is able to target GRP78 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and inhibit the growth and invasion of the cancer cells in vitro. Further, siGRP78 modified exosomes combined with Sorafenib also inhibit the growth and metastasis of the cancer cells in vivo.Conclusions:siGRP78 modified exosomes could sensitize Sorafenib resistant cancer cells to Sorafenib and reverse the drug resistance.
