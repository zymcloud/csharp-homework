Chronic liver inflammation is crucial in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Activation of the inflammasome complex is a key inflammatory process that has been associated with different liver diseases, but its role in HCC development remains largely unexplored. Here we analyzed the impact of different inflammasome components, including absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) and NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), in the development of diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC in mice. Genetic inactivation of AIM2, but not NLRP3, reduces liver damage and HCC development in this model. AIM2 deficiency ameliorates inflammasome activation, liver inflammation and proliferative responses during HCC initiation. We also identified that AIM2 is highly expressed in Kupffer cells, and that AIM2-mediated production of IL-1Î² by these cells is enhanced after DEN-induced liver damage. Our data indicate that AIM2 promotes inflammation during carcinogenic liver injury and that it contributes to genotoxic HCC development in mice, thereby recognizing AIM2 as a potential therapeutic target in this disease.
