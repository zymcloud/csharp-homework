The improved survival of liver transplant recipients (LTRs) has been accompanied by a concomitant rise in long-term liver transplantation complications, including skin cancer. A recent study found that the prevalence of skin cancer among LTRs is 13.5%, a rate equivalent to that observed among kidney transplant recipients. Given the morbidity associated with skin cancer in LTRs, an individualized, multidisciplinary approach to skin cancer prevention that incorporates patient education, encourages consistent use of primary prevention methods, and ensures routine dermatologic screening should be universally adopted in this population. Chemopreventative measures should be considered in LTRs with a high skin cancer burden. Furthermore, additional studies should be performed in order to systematize these recommendations.
