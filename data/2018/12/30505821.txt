Purpose:OncoHepa test is a multigene expression profile test developed for assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis. Multiplication of α-FP, des-γ-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) and tumor volume (TV) gives the α-FP-DCP-volume (ADV) score, which is also developed for assessment of HCC prognosis.Methods:The predictive powers of OncoHepa test and ADV score were validated in 35 patients who underwent curative hepatic resection for naïve solitary HCCs ≤5 cm.Results:Median tumor diameter was 3.0 cm. Tumor recurrence and patient survival rates were 28.6% and 100% at 1 year, 48.6% and 82.9% at 3 years, and 54.3% and 71.4% at 5 years, respectively. The site of first tumor recurrence was the remnant liver in 18, lung in 1, and the peritoneum in 1. All patients with HCC recurrence received locoregional treatment. OncoHepa test showed marginal prognostic significance for tumor recurrence and patient survival. ADV score at 4log also showed marginal prognostic difference with respect to tumor recurrence and patient survival. Combination of these 2 tests resulted in greater prognostic significance for both tumor recurrence (P = 0.046) and patient survival (P = 0.048).Conclusion:Both OncoHepa test and ADV score have considerably strong prognostic power, thus individual and combined findings of OncoHepa test and ADV score will be helpful to guide postresection surveillance in patients with solitary HCCs ≤5 cm.
