To identify the key genes and pathways in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from hepatitis B virus (HBV)‑positive liver cirrhosis, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HCC and liver cirrhosis tissue samples from the GSE17548 gene expression profile dataset were screened. A total of 1,845 DEGs were identified, including 1,803 upregulated and 42 downregulated genes. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were performed. It was identified that the 'cell cycle' and 'progesterone‑mediated oocyte maturation' KEGG pathways were significantly enriched in the DEGs. In addition, the high expression of the hub genes from the PPI network (including cyclin dependent kinase 1, cyclin B1, cyclin B2, mitotic arrest deficient 2 like 1, BUB1 mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase and cyclin A2; P=0.00116, 0.00021, 0.04889, 0.00222, 0.00015 and 0.00647, respectively) was associated with a decrease in overall survival for patients with HCC as identified using survival and expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The identified hub genes and pathways may help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of HCC progression from HBV‑positive liver cirrhosis. Additionally, they may be useful as therapeutic targets or serve as novel biomarkers for HCC prognosis prediction.
