Background and aim:Treatment for portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is not well established. Nevertheless, anticoagulation therapy can seemingly be used as first-line therapy. However, there are limited data on the role of this treatment in patients with PVT and cirrhosis. We sought to assess the safety and efficacy of anticoagulation therapy in a series of patients with non-malignant PVT and liver cirrhosis.Methods:We analyzed the data of 32 patients with cirrhosis and PVT between March 2009 and September 2015. All patients received anticoagulation treatment. PVT was diagnosed within the context of biannual hepatocellular carcinoma screening in these patients.Results:Recanalisation was achieved in 23 patients: complete in 17 patients (53.1%) and partial in 6 patients (18.7%). The median time for achieving a complete response was 7 months (95% CI: 6-8). We did not discover any risk factors associated with repermeation (partial or complete). None of the patients presented with thrombosis progression while receiving anticoagulation. Nine patients who achieved complete recanalisation and stopped anticoagulation therapy suffered rethrombosis (52%). There were no differences between the patients who achieved complete or partial recanalisation (35%) and those who did not (33%) in relation to the onset of hepatic events during follow-up. Three patients (9%) presented with bleeding complications: two variceal bleeding episodes and one brain hemorrhage.Conclusions:In cirrhotic patients with non-malignant PVT, anticoagulation therapy led to partial or complete recanalisation in 70% of patients, with a broad safety profile. Due to the existing rethrombosis rate, long-term anticoagulation should be considered.
