Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl 4-hydroxylases (HIF-P4Hs, also known as PHDs or EglNs) are enzymes that act as cellular oxygen sensors. Inhibition of HIF-P4Hs leads to stabilization of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs), which initiates a gene expression program that allows organisms to cope with low oxygen levels and restore tissue oxygenation. This involves, for example, upregulation of erythropoiesis and angiogenesis, modulation of inflammatory responses, and reprogramming of metabolism. Currently, several pharmacological HIF-P4H inhibitors are in clinical trials mainly for renal anemia. However, recent data suggest that HIF-P4H inhibitors could also be considered to treat metabolic disorders. Here, we discuss the potential of targeting HIF-P4Hs and the HIF pathway for the treatment of obesity, metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis, and fatty liver diseases (FLDs).
