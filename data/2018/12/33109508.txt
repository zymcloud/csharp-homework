Clinical manifestations of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are ranged from fulminant hepatitis to decompensated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver transplantation (LT) is one therapeutic option of these HBV infection complications. Intrahepatic viral persistence and low levels of circulating viral particles despite treatment optimization may lead to HBV recurrence after LT, which jeopardizes graft and patients survival after LT. HBV recurrence prophylactic strategies are based on nucleos(t)ides analogues (NUCs) treatment to block viral replication and anti-HBs immunoglobulin administration to neutralize circulating viral particles. The risk of HBV recurrence is also important in case of transplantation with a graft from a donor with a history of HBV infection (HBc+) to a "HBV naive" recipient or in case of immunosuppressive therapy after solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for a HBc+ recipient. Prophylactic strategies are mainly focused on biological monitoring and NUCs therapy for high-risk situations.
