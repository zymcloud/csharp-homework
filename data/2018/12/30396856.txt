Background:Hypoxia commonly occurs in solid tumors. The hypoxia in the center of solid tumors considerably decreases the chemosensitivity of tumor cells and induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as drug resistance of antitumor drugs.Methods:Here, the effects of salidroside (Sal) combined with platinum drugs on human hepatocellular carcinoma were examined in vitro and in vivo. We investigated the antitumor effects of Sal by inhibiting the drug resistance and explained its mechanism in inhibiting tumor growth.Findings:The results showed that Sal co-administration reverses the drug resistance of platinum drugs and suppressed metastasis induced by the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Sal promoted the degradation of HIF-1α. In conclusion, Sal significantly increased the sensitivity to platinum drugs and inhibited hypoxia-induced EMT in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through inhibiting HIF-1α signaling pathway.Interpretation:Therefore, Sal may be an effective platinum drug sensitizer that can improve the chemotherapeutic efficacy in patients with HCC.
