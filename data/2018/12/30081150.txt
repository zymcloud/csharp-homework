NLRC3 is a member of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) family protein that plays a role in inflammation and immunity. Although chronic inflammation has been identified as a hallmark of cancer, NLRC3 expression correlation with the development and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear. In the present study, we first used Oncomine and OncoLnc database to determine the clinical significance of NLRC3 in HCC. Then we performed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunohistochemical staining (IHC) and analyzed the correlation between NLRC3 expression and clinicopathological features of HCC in a Chinese population. We found that high levels of NLRC3 messenger RNA (mRNA) correlated with a favorable clinical outcome; furthermore, expression of NLRC3 was significantly reduced in the cancer tissue in patients compared with noncancerous hepatic tissues. NLRC3 reduction was correlated with Edmondson grade and metastasis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that HCC patients with high expression of NLRC3 have a more favorable prognosis compared with those with low expression of NLRC3. We then used short hairpin RNA to knock down NLRC3 expression in HCC cell lines and evaluated its effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Suppression of NLRC3 expression promoted cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis in vitro. Genomic analysis of the OncoLnc database also showed that NLRC3 mRNA level was directly correlated with mRNA levels of inflammasome components caspase-1, IL-1Î², and IL-18. Based on our present study, down-regulated expression of NLRC3 may play an important role in cancer progression and prognosis of HCC by acting as a tumor suppressor.
