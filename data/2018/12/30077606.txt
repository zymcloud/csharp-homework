Background:Although Child-Pugh grade A patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are candidates for curative resection, some may have a poor prognosis. The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade, a measure of liver function based on albumin and bilirubin, has the potential to detect Child-Pugh grade A HCC patients with poor prognosis. Because components of the ALBI grade can be measured easily even after surgery, we explored the predictive values of ALBI in patient prognosis after HCC resection.Methods:In this retrospective case-control study, we included 136 HCC patients who underwent curative resection between January 2004 and December 2013 at our hospital. ALBI grade was calculated from laboratory data recorded the day before surgery and at post-operative day 5.Results:Pre- and post-operative ALBI grade predicted patients' long-term outcomes (P = 0.020 and P Conclusions:Post-operative ALBI grade is useful to predict the prognosis in patients after HCC resection.
