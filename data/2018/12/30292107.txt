Metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and diabetes are associated with obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aggressive form of a fatty liver disease may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrated that there is a dysbiosis in the gut microbiota associated with early stages of metabolic disease. Therefore, the identification and repurposing of drugs already used to treat insulin resistance may be an excellent option for other disorders. We evaluated the effect of liraglutide on obesity, NAFLD and gut microbiota modulation in two different animal models of obesity: the ob/ob mice and the high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Liraglutide treatment induced significant weight loss in both obesity models, showed improvements in glycemic parameters and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration in the cecum and the liver. In ob/ob mice, the liraglutide treatment was able to reduce the accumulation of liver fat by 78% and reversed steatosis in the HFD mice. The gut microbiota analysis showed that liraglutide changed the overall composition as well as the relative abundance of weight-relevant phylotypes such as a reduction of Proteobacteria and an increase of Akkermansia muciniphila in the treated HFD group. We show that liraglutide can lead to weight loss and gut microbiota modulations, and is associated with an improvement of NAFLD. Furthermore, by generating a profile of the intestinal microbiota, we compiled a list of potential bacterial targets that may modulate metabolism and induce a metabolic profile that is considered normal or clinically controlled.
