Risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in hepatitis C virus cirrhotic patients treated with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) is still debating. We investigated it in a large cohort. The cohort comprised 1045 cirrhotic patients who completed treatment with DAA, with a median follow-up of 17.3 months after end of treatment (EOT), including 943 patients without history of HCC and 102 previously treated for HCC. The majority were men (59.9%), with compensated cirrhosis (88.8%), genotype 1b (44.7%). Univariate, multivariate analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves were performed to detect predictors of HCC in patients with and without reduction in alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) during treatment. SVR12 was 95.6%. HCC developed in 95 (9.9%), including 54 of 943 (5.7%) occurrent and 41 of 102 (39%) recurrent tumours. De novo were more often unifocal (P = 0.01) and curable (P = 0.03). AFP decreased from 16.1 ± 36.2 mg/dL (baseline) to 11.4 ± 55 mg/dL (EOT). At univariate analysis, predictors were a previous HCC, older age, higher model for end-stage liver disease, prolonged INR, lower platelets, baseline and EOT AFP, virological failure and no reduction in AFP during treatment. Kaplan-Meier curves showed lower incidence of HCC in patients showing any reduction in AFP (P = 0.001). Those with AFP
alpha-fetoprotein; direct-acting antiviral agents; hepatitis C; hepatocellular carcinoma.
