Previous studies have demonstrated that microRNA (miR)-760 serves an important role in various cancer types. However, to the best of our knowledge, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been fully elucidated. The current study investigated the prognostic role of miR-760 in HCC by using the Kaplan-Meier plotter database. The current data indicated that low expression of miR-760 was associated with higher overall survival (OS) for all patients with HCC from both the RNA-seq [hazard ratio (HR)=2.04; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.44-2.89; P=4.9Ã—10-5] and the non-commercial spotted microarray (HR=1.71; CI=1.05-2.76; P=0.028). In the RNA-seq platform, a lower expression of miR-760 was strongly associated with improved OS in male patients with HCC, but not in female patients with HCC. Additionally, low expression of miR-760 was associated with improved OS in patients with stage I, II and III HCC, and was associated with improved OS in Asian and Caucasian patients. The current results indicated that miR-760 serves as an oncogene for HCC and high expression of miR-760 is significantly associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in patients with HCC.
