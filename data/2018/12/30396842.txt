Purpose:To evaluate the value of α-fetoprotein (AFP) classification criteria in predicting tumor response and patient survival and to discuss the agreement between AFP criteria and modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (mRECIST).Materials and methods:Between January 2011 and December 2014, 147 patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with baseline AFP levels ≥ 400 ng/mL who underwent transarterial chemoembolization as initial treatment were retrospectively enrolled for AFP/imaging correlation analysis. AFP-based response was classified as complete response (CR) in cases of AFP level normalization, partial response (PR) in cases of > 50% decrease vs baseline, stable disease (SD) in cases of -50% to +30% change vs baseline, or progressive disease (PD) in cases of > 30% increase vs baseline. Intermethod agreement between the 2 methods was assessed by Cohen κ coefficient. Response rates according to AFP and mRECIST were compared, and the association between response rate and overall survival (OS) was evaluated.Results:The κ value for agreement between AFP criteria and mRECIST was 0.549 (ie, moderate), with objective response and disease control rates of 36.1% and 63.3% per AFP criteria and 34.7% and 46.3% per RECIST (P = .807 and P = .003), respectively. Although AFP criteria and mRECIST showed significantly prognostic strata for CR, PR, SD, and PD after chemoembolization (P Conclusions:The defined AFP response moderately correlated with mRECIST response and yielded accurate prognostic prediction in patients with HCC and AFP levels ≥ 400 ng/mL treated with chemoembolization.
