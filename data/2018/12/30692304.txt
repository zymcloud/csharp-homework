We report a case of ascending colon cancer with hepatic metastases that was treated by CapeOX plus bevacizumab with remarkable efficacy. A 40-year-old female patient presented with a medical history of surgery for resection of right breast cancer4 years ago, left-sided transverse colon 2 years ago, and right ovarian cancer 6 months ago. Follow-up computed tomography(CT)found wall thickening from the ascending colon to cecum. She was diagnosed with an ascending colon cancer by colonoscopy, and underwent right hemicolectomy. One month after the surgery, her serum marker carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA)and carbohydrate antigen 19-9(CA19-9)levels were high. She was diagnosed with unresectable multiple hepatic metastases by CT 2 months after the surgery. Her tumor was epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR)- positive and wild-type for RAS; she received 4 courses of CapeOX plus bevacizumab. Thereafter, liver metastases were remarkably decreased in size, and she could undergo central bisegmentectomy. Pathology examination revealed no tumor and that the center of the tumor was changed to necrotic tissue and the surrounding area was changed to fibrous tissue and lymphocyte infiltration. The patient is disease-free since the last operation.
