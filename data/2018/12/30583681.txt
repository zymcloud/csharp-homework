Background: To determine the effectiveness and performance of selective conventional transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and analyze the potential predictive factors of sustained complete response (CR) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and Methods: Total of 52 patients with HCC (33 males, 19 females; mean age 64.0 Â± 9.6 years) who underwent 81 sessions of selective TACE between November 2015 and March 2017 at Songklanagarind hospital were reviewed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to describe CR rates at various time points. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were performed to determine the predictive factors for sustained CR at six months. Results: The CR rates after selective TACE at 1, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months were 87%, 81%, 62%, 40% and 31%, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that alpha fetoprotein level
