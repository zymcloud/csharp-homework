Purpose:The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of preoperative pregabalin on postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatic focal lesions (HFLs).Methods:This randomised controlled study was carried out on 70 adult patients for whom RFA was indicated to treat hepatocellular carcinoma. They were randomised into two groups: Group I: 35 patients who were given a placebo before the procedure and Group II: 35 patients who were given 150 mg of oral pregabalin one hour before the procedure. The primary outcome was the analgesic effect in the form of postoperative pain severity and the need for opioid analgesics.Results:In the immediate postoperative period there was no significant difference between the two groups on pain assessment by the visual analogue pain scale (VAS Pain; p = 0.84). However, the medians of Group II VAS Pain were significantly (p Conclusion:Pre-emptive oral pregabalin is safe and effective for postoperative analgesia in patients scheduled for radiofrequency ablation of focal lesions in liver.
