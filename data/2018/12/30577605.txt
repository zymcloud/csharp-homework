The poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is resulted from tumor metastasis. Signaling pathways triggered by deregulated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) were the promising therapeutic targets for prevention of HCC progression. However, RTK-based target therapy using conventional kinase-based inhibitors was often hampered by resistances due to compensatory RTKs signaling. Herein, we report that Ling-Zhi-8 (LZ-8), a medicinal peptide from Ganoderma lucidium, was effective in suppressing cell migration of HCC413, by decreasing the amount and activity of various RTKs. These led to the suppression of downstream signaling including phosphorylated JNK, ERK involved in HCC progression. The capability of LZ-8 in targeting multiple RTKs was ascribed to its simultaneous binding to these RTKs. LZ-8 may bind on the N-linked glycan motif of RTKs that is required for their maturation and function. Notably, pretreatment of the N-glycan trimming enzyme PNGase or inhibitors of the mannosidase (N-glycosylation processing enzyme), kifunensine (KIF) and swainsonine (SWN), prevented LZ-8 binding on the aforementioned RTKs and rescued the downstream signaling and cell migration suppressed by LZ-8. Moreover, pretreatment of KIF prevented LZ-8 triggered suppression of tumor growth of HCC413. Our study suggested that a specific type of N-glycan is the potential target for LZ-8 to bind on multiple RTKs for suppressing HCC progression.
