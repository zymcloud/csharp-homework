The role of Notch pathway in hepatocarcinogenesis is unclear with conflicting results reported from different researchers. This study aimed to investigate the exact role of Notch1 in hepatocarcinogenesis and its influence on survival and to determine the possibility of it being a target therapy. Differential immunohistochemical expression of Notch1 in 100 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and adjacent non-neoplastic liver tissue was performed. The results showed that expression of Notch1 was significantly higher in the non-neoplastic hepatic tissues than in HCC tissues (p
