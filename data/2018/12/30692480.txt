The patient was a 63-year-old man with hepatitis C. He discontinued combination therapy containing interferon and ribavirin because of the development of skin symptoms. A screening examination showed multiple early-stage hepatocellular carcinomas. He refused treatment and was followed up as an outpatient. During follow-up, his PIVKA-â…¡ level remarkably elevated to 59,994mAU/mL. Computed tomography(CT)showed an enlarged tumor with portal invasion(vp2)in segment 8 and intrahepaticmetastasis. We performed right and partial hepatectomy. Three months later, CT showed multiple lung metastases. We initiated the daily administration of 800 mg of sorafenib. However, 6 months after hepatectomy, the lung metastases increased in size and number. We considered the therapeutic effect as progressive disease(PD)according to the RECIST criteria. We then initiated administering 120 mg of regorafenib daily as second-line therapy. In a course of the treatment containing sorafenib and regorafenib, the dose was reduced due to hand-foot skin reactions. 8.5 months after hepatectomy, the lung metastases significantly decreased in size. One year after hepatectomy, almost complete response(CR) was obtained, and no intrahepatic recurrence was found.
