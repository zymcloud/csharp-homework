A 69-year-old man was found to have a hepatocellular carcinoma of 2.3 cm in diameter, with extrahepatic growth in liver S4 during follow-up for chronic hepatitis C and liver cirrhosis. We performed a laparoscopic partial liver resection, but the tumor capsule was injured by the retractor used to keep the working space at the bleeding site. The pathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma(pT2N0M0, pStage â…¡). 7 months after the surgery, intrahepatic reoccurrence appeared. Thus, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(TACE)and radiofrequency ablation were performed. However, a single recurrence ofperitoneal dissemination appeared 8 months after the reoperation. We selected laparoscopic operation this time. Intraperitoneally, we found 4 peritoneal disseminated lesions and resected all the lesions macroscopically. However, even after the resection, peritoneal dissemination recurred and increased. Therefore, we continued treatment with sorafenib and S-1 as systemic therapy, TACE and transcatheter arterial infusion(TAI)for the multiple recurrences in the liver, and radiotherapy for the peritoneal dissemination focuses. However, his general condition worsened, and liver failure occurred. Thus, he was shifted to complete palliative treatment and died 2 years 6 months after the initial operation. The recurrent form ofhepatocellular carcinoma is mainly an intrahepatic recurrence, and recurrence ofperitoneal dissemination is rare. In this case, the intraoperative operation was considered to be the possible cause ofthe recurrence.
