Imaging still has a limited capacity to detect microvascular invasion (mVI). The objective of this critical review is the evaluation of the most significant predictors of mVI in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) detectable by computed tomography, PET/computed tomography and MRI using a mathematical model. We systematically reviewed 15 observational studies from 2008 to 2018 to analyze factors with most impact on mVI detection. The most significant predictors of mVI correlating with imaging techniques were considered. From 1902 patients considered, we individuated 30 total predictors of mVI in a multivariate analysis. The most frequent predictors related to the highest presence with mVI in HCC were: Î±-fetoprotein (p
