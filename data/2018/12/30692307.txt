A 71-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)underwent hepatectomy at another hospital in 200X. In 200X+ 7, +9, and +10, radiofrequency ablation(RFA)was performed for HCC recurrence. In 200X+11, he complained of a mass at the right site of the thoracic wall. After further examination, he was diagnosed with needle-tract implantation after RFA. We performed tumorectomy via a thoracotomy. Twelve months after the operation, he is alive with no recurrence. In case of needle-tract implantation after RFA, it is important to consider the possibility of surgical resection for local control.
