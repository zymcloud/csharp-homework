Liver inflammation after chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is essential for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. We did a nested case-control study based on QBC chronic HBV infection cohort to identify HCC-related inflammatory cytokines. Serum levels of distinct Th-cell representative cytokines at varied periods before HCC diagnosis were determined in 50 HCC cases and 150 age- and gender-matched controls who did not develop HCC in 8-10 years. The individuals with HCC outcome had statistically higher serum levels of IL-23 than controls (P + inflammatory macrophages were the major IL-23 producers. Monocytes-derived macrophages generated more amount of IL-23 after being stimulated with cell-associated HBV core antigen from damaged HBV-infected hepatocytes than the cells being stimulated with HBV-S and HBV e antigen, which are secreted from infected hepatocytes. IL-23 upregulated IL-23 receptor expressions on macrophages, enhanced macrophage-mediated angiogenesis. In HBV-transgenic (Alb1HBV) mice, administration of diethylnitrosamine induced more liver tumors than in wild-type mice. The livers of Alb1HBV mice had higher concentrations of IL-23 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) than the wild-type mice. Neutralizing IL-23 activity, diethylnitrosamine-treated Alb1HBV mice developed significantly less tumors and produced less VEGF, tumor angiogenesis was inhibited with dramatically decreased CD31+ cells within tumor mass (all P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Persistent IL-23 generation of liver inflammatory macrophages responding to damaged hepatocytes after chronic HBV infection altered macrophage function for HCC promotion. Blocking IL-23 activity might be helpful for the intervention in chronic hepatitis B patients who had high risk to HCC.
