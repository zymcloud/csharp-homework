Hepatoma derived growth factor related protein-3 (HRP-3) is a HDGF growth factor family member that is expressed mainly in nervous tissues. It shares structural similarities with HDGF but differs in its expression and scope of action. It has recently attracted more attention due to its variable roles. HRP-3 was originally reported as a mitogenic factor. However, over the last decade, additional functions for this growth factor have been uncovered. In addition to its mitogenic activity, other physiological functions were discovered including those related to proliferation, differentiation, and maintenance of neurons, presenting it as a neurotrophic and neuroprotective growth factor. Interestingly, HRP-3 was also shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of certain tumors via its mitogenic, angiogenic, and antiapoptotic effects. Based on this, HRP-3 represents a molecule that can be targeted for the treatment of cancer and various neurodegenerative diseases.
