Objective:To explore the expressions of miR-132 in patients with chronic hepatitis B, posthepatitic cirrhosis and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to investigate its possible mechanism affecting the function of the body.Patients and methods:Among 125 patients with HBV, there were 44 cases of chronic hepatitis, 42 cases of liver cirrhosis and 39 cases of liver cancer. Their liver function and HBV-deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV-DNA) viral load as well as the expressions of micro ribonucleic acid-132 (miR-132), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated-protein kinase B (p-Akt) and hepatitis B X protein (HBx), were detected.Results:There were significant differences in some liver function indexes and the HBV-DNA level among the three groups of patients (p Conclusions:Differences in the expression of miR-132 among the three groups are evident, which may be associated with differences in liver function, the HBV-DNA level, HBx and the expressions of PI3K and p-Akt proteins to a certain degree.
