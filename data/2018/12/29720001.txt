Objective:To evaluate the safety and long-term outcomes of microwave ablation (MWA) combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in a single stage for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with a maximum diameter of 5.0-10.0 cm.Methods:From January 2013 to December 2016, 84 consecutive HCC patients with cirrhosis from two medical centers who underwent MWA-TACE as a first-line treatment for up to three HCCs with maximum diameters of 5.0-10.0 cm were included. Feasibility, safety and effectiveness were evaluated. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression models were used to identify the prognostic factors.Results:The technique was successfully performed in all the patients. Grade 3 complications consisted of two cases of hemoperitoneum requiring blood transfusions and embolization. The cumulative incidence of local tumor progression was 25.8% at 3 years, with tumor size found to be the only significant predictive factor (p = .007). The cumulative incidence of OS was 81%, 68% and 49% at 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively. According to the Cox proportional hazards model analysis, serum AFP level, Child-Pugh class and tumor number were significant prognostic factors for OS.Conclusion:MWA-TACE is a safe, feasible and effective therapy for the treatment of 5.0- to 10.0-cm HCC lesions in patients with cirrhosis.
