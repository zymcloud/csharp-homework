The current prognostic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) signatures for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still controversial and need to be optimized by systematic bioinformatics analyses with suitable methods and appropriate patients. Therefore, we performed the study to establish a credible lncRNA signature for HCC outcome prediction and explore the related mechanisms. Based on the lncRNA profile and the clinical data of carefully selected HCC patients (n = 164) in TCGA, six of 12727 lncRNAs, MIR22HG, CTC-297N7.9, CTD-2139B15.2, RP11-589N15.2, RP11-343N15.5, and RP11-479G22.8 were identified as the independent predictors of patients' overall survival in HCC by sequential univariate Cox and 1000 times Cox LASSO regression with 10-fold CV, and multivariate Cox analysis with 1000 times bootstrapping. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis with patients trichotomized by the six-lncRNA signature, high-risk patients showed significantly shorter survival than mid- and low-risk patients (log-rank test P
