Postoperative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence and metastasis throw great threaten to its overall survival (OS). This paper focus on exploring the prognostic significance of NANOG and OCT4 expression in HCC recurrence and OS after liver transplantation. Eighty-six patients who meet University of California San Francisco (UCSF) criteria and underwent liver transplantation in Tianjin First Central Hospital between August 2010 and August 2013 were included. Expression of NANOG and OCT4 was determined by immunohistochemistry. The relationships between NANOG and OCT4 expression with tumor recurrence, tumor count, histology stage, lymph node metastasis (LNM) and microvascular invasion (MVI) were explored through the Ï‡2 test and Cox regression analysis. We found that 19/26 and 20/24 patients with positive expression of NANOG and OCT4 relapsed. Combination of NANOG and OCT4 expression was indicated as valuable prognostic signature for HCC recurrence prediction (P < 0.0011). Besides, we identified other key factors with significant correlations with recurrence, such as LNM (P = 0.011) and MVI (P = 0.024). Strikingly, recurrence sites could significantly affect recurrence time (P = 0.0062) and patients with recurrence in transplanted liver have longer recurrence time. In conclusions, we analyzed the relationships between NANOG/OCT4 expression, clinicopathology features, HCC recurrence, and OS after liver transplantation for the first time. Combination of NANOG, OCT4, LNM, histopathological stage, and MVI may be predictor for HCC recurrence posttransplantation. Comprehensive of histopathological stage grade and LNM were considered as prognosis factor for OS after liver transplantation. This should be helpful for treatment method selection for HCC patients after liver transplantation.
