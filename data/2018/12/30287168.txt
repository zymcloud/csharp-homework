Objectives:We investigated whether the combination of systemic chemotherapy (SCT) and liver-directed therapy (LDT) was superior to chemotherapy alone for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and synchronous liver metastases (PACLM).Methods:We reviewed the medical records of 184 patients treated with SCT Â± LDT at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital from 2001 to 2015. Overall survival (OS) was the primary end-point. The role of treatment modality and other clinical factors was evaluated by univariate and Cox regression analyses.Results:Sixty-four (34.8%) patients in the SCT-LDT group and 120 (65.2%) patients in the SCT group were included in the analysis. Baseline clinical characteristics were similar between the groups (all P > 0.05). The median survival was 8.7 months in the SCT-LDT group and was 6.3 months in the SCT group. The 0.5-, 1-, 2- and 3-year survival rates were 67.2%, 33.4%, 13.3% and 8.9%, respectively, after SCT-LDT, and were 54.9%, 19.0%, 4.5% and 2.0%, respectively, after SCT (P = 0.01). Primary tumor size, ascites, and treatment modality (SCT + LDT vs. SCT) independently predicted survival (P < 0.05). The clinical efficacy congruously favored the SCT-LDT group across the majority of subgroups.Conclusions:SCT combined with LDT was well tolerated and may be effective to improve survival of patients with PACLM. Ascites and large primary tumor size were poor prognostic factors associated with survival.
