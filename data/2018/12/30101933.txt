A 20-year old man was diagnosed with fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLHCC) with multiple lung metastases, and chemotherapy with FOLFOX was administered. Contrast enhanced CT after 3 cycles of FOLFOX showed no disease progression. We therefore performed surgical resection and radiofrequency ablation of the liver lesions and lung metastases, after obtaining the patient's informed consent. The liver lesions and lung metastases tested positive for DNAJB1-PRKACA. The treatment for FLHCC with extrahepatic metastasis has not been established; however, in a few cases, good long-term prognoses were obtained with multidisciplinary therapy. We herein report a case of FLHCC with multiple lung metastases that was treated with multidisciplinary therapies.
DNAJB1-PRKACA; fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma; multidisciplinary therapy.
