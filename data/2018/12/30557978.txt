Background:In patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the prognostic role of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for survival is still controversial. A meta-analysis was performed to investigate the prognostic effect of TILs in HCC.Methods:We identify studies from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to evaluate the prognostic value of TILs in patients with HCC. A meta-analysis was conducted to estimate overall survival and disease-free survival. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated employing fixed-effect or random-effect models depending on the heterogeneity of the included trials.Results:A total of 7905 patients from 46 observational studies were enrolled. For TILs subsets, the density of CD8+, FOXP3+, CD3+, and Granzyme B+ lymphocytes was significantly associated with improved survival (P Conclusion:Our findings suggested that some TIL subsets could serve as prognostic biomarkers in HCC. High-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to determine if these TILs could serve as targets for immunotherapy in HCC.
