Purpose:This study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of microwave-ablation-assisted liver resection (MW-LR) and clamp crushing liver resection (CC-LR) in cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:From July 2005 to January 2015, cirrhotic HCC patients who underwent CC-LR (n = 191) or MW-LR (n = 112) were retrospectively analysed. We compared morbidity, mortality, disease-free survival (DFS) time and overall survival time between the CC-LR and MW-LR groups.Results:The blood loss volume was significantly higher in the CC-LR group (mean of 752 ml) than that in the MW-LR group (mean of 253 ml, p Conclusions:MW-LR is a safe and feasible procedure for HCC patients with a cirrhotic liver history.
