Background:N6-methyladensine (m6A) is a common and abundant RNA methylation modification found in various species. As a type of post-transcriptional methylation, m6A plays an important role in diverse RNA activities such as alternative splicing, an interplay with microRNAs and translation efficiency. Although existing tools can predict m6A at single-base resolution, it is still challenging to extract the biological information surrounding m6A sites.Results:We implemented a deep learning framework, named DeepM6ASeq, to predict m6A-containing sequences and characterize surrounding biological features based on miCLIP-Seq data, which detects m6A sites at single-base resolution. DeepM6ASeq showed better performance as compared to other machine learning classifiers. Moreover, an independent test on m6A-Seq data, which identifies m6A-containing genomic regions, revealed that our model is competitive in predicting m6A-containing sequences. The learned motifs from DeepM6ASeq correspond to known m6A readers. Notably, DeepM6ASeq also identifies a newly recognized m6A reader: FMR1. Besides, we found that a saliency map in the deep learning model could be utilized to visualize locations of m6A sites.Conculsion:We developed a deep-learning-based framework to predict and characterize m6A-containing sequences and hope to help investigators to gain more insights for m6A research.
