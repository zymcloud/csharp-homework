The Asian American population is characterized by remarkable diversity. Studying Asians as an aggregate group may obscure clinically meaningful heterogeneity. We performed a population-based study using data from the US National Vital Statistics System. We determined the trends in age-standardized mortality rates for chronic liver disease stratified by aetiology among the most populous US-based Asian subgroups (Asian Indians, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese) and compared it to non-Hispanic whites. Annual percentage change was calculated to determine temporal mortality patterns using joinpoint analysis. Hepatitis C virus-related mortality rates were higher in non-Hispanic whites compared to individual Asian subgroups, but a sharp decline in mortality rates was noted in 2014 among non-Hispanic whites and all Asian subgroups. Age-standardized hepatitis B virus-related mortality rates were higher in all Asian subgroups as compared to non-Hispanic whites in 2016, with the highest mortality among Vietnamese followed by Chinese. Mortality rates for alcoholic liver disease have been steadily trending upwards in all Asian subgroups, with the highest mortality in Japanese. Overall, age-standardized cirrhosis-related mortality rates were highest in non-Hispanic whites, followed by Japanese, and more distantly by Vietnamese and other subgroups. However, hepatocellular carcinoma-related mortality rates were higher in most Asian subgroups led by Vietnamese, Japanese and Koreans compared to non-Hispanic whites. In this population-based study utilizing a nationally representative database, we demonstrated a marked heterogeneity in the mortality rates of aetiology-specific chronic liver disease among Asian subgroups in the United States.
