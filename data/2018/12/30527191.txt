Objective:The efficacy and safety of afatinib in elderly patients with EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have not been evaluated. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of afatinib in elderly chemotherapy-naive patients with NSCLC harboring sensitive EGFR mutations.Materials and methods:We prospectively assessed the clinical effects of afatinib as a first-line treatment for elderly (age â‰¥70 years) NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation). All patients were initially administered afatinib (30 mg/day).Results:Between May 2014 and August 2017, 40 patients (13 men, 27 women) with adenocarcinoma were included in our analysis. The median age was 77 years (range, 70-85 years). The dose was reduced in 19 patients. The objective overall response and disease control rates were 72.5% and 100%, respectively, and the median progression-free survival and overall survival were 12.9 months and not reached, respectively. Common adverse events (AEs) included diarrhea, rash/acne, and anemia. Major grade 3 or higher toxicities included diarrhea (12.5%), mucositis (7.5%), and pneumonitis (7.5%). Afatinib treatment was discontinued in 8 patients owing to AEs of elevated amylase (n = 1), liver dysfunction (n = 1), rash/acne (n = 1), nail change (n = 1), anorexia (n = 2), pneumonitis (n = 2), and diarrhea (n = 2). Two patients died due to treatment-related pneumonitis.Conclusions:This is the first study that verified the efficacy and feasibility of first-line chemotherapy with afatinib at 30 mg/day in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC harboring sensitive EGFR mutations. First-line afatinib of 30 mg/day could be a treatment option in this patient population.
