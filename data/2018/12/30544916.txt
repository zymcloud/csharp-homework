Skin cancer is among the most common cancer types accompanied by rapidly increasing incidence rates, thus making the development of more efficient therapeutic approaches a necessity. Recent studies have revealed the potential role of decosahexaenoic acid ester of phloridzin (PZDHA) in suppressing proliferation of liver, breast, and blood cancer cell lines. In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxic potential of PZDHA in an in vitro model of skin cancer consisting of melanoma (A375), epidermoid carcinoma (A431), and non-tumorigenic (HaCaT) cell lines. Decosahexaenoic acid ester of phloridzin led to increased cytotoxicity in all cell lines as revealed by cell viability assays. However, growth inhibition and induction of both apoptosis and necrosis was more evident in melanoma (A375) and epidermoid carcinoma (A431) cells, whereas non-tumorigenic keratinocytes (HaCaT) appeared to be more resistant as detected by flow cytometry. More specifically, PZDHA-induced cell cycle growth arrest at the G2/M phase in A375 and A431 cells in contrast to HaCaT cells, which were growth arrested at the G0/G1 phase. Elevated intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species ROS was detected in all cell lines. Overall, our findings support the potential of PZDHA as a novel therapeutic means against human skin cancer.
