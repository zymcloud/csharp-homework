Aim:To evaluate the efficacy and to identify prognostic factors of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) chemoembolisation for treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein (PV) tumour thrombosis (PVTT) and arterioportal shunts.Materials and methods:The clinical data of 145 advanced HCC patients with PVTT and arterioportal shunts were collected. The patients were divided into two groups: group A, with main PV invasion, (n=56) and group B, with PV branch invasion, (n=89). Based on arterioportal shunt types, different particle sizes of PVA were used for chemoembolisation. The overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP), and postoperative complications were analysed retrospectively.Results:The median OS of all patients was 10.1 months. The median OS of group A and group B was 8.2 and 12.5 months, respectively (χ2=6.03, p=0.01). The overall 6-, 12-, and 18-month survival rates of groups A and B were 63.8%, 24.9%, and 6.3%, and 78.1%, 55.2%, and 23.7%, respectively. After embolisation, there were two cases of acute liver failure and three cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Cox multivariate survival analysis revealed that main PVTT (HR [hazard ratio]=1.75, p=0.01), Child-Pugh B class (HR=1.99, p=0.003) and tumour burden ≥50% (HR=3.25, p<0.001) were independent risk factors. A dose of oxaliplatin >100 mg (HR=0.48, p<0.001) was an independent protection factor.Conclusion:Treatment of advanced HCC with PVTT and arterioportal shunts by PVA chemoembolisation is safe and effective. The patients achieved a better prognosis with the dose of oxaliplatin >100 mg, while main PVTT, Child-Pugh B class, and tumour burden ≥50% were poor prognostic indicators.
