Aim of study:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a common cause of cancer-associated mortalities worldwide, is a complex polygenic disease, and its development is dependent on many genetic factors. Hepatitis B virus infection, also called chronic hepatitis B (CHB), is the leading cause of HCC. This meta-analysis was performed to assess the association between cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA4) +49A/G and HCC risk.Materials and methods:The association studies were recruited from PubMed and China Biological Medicine Database, and eligible studies were included and synthesized using meta-analysis method.Results:Four reports were included into this meta-analysis for the association of CTLA4 A/G gene polymorphism and HCC risk, and all the included studies were from Chinese. The association between CTLA4 A/G gene polymorphism and HCC risk was found in this meta-analysis (G allele: odds ratio [OR] =1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.44, P = 0.02; GG genotype: OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.03-1.44, P = 0.02; AA genotype: OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.10-1.69, P = 0.004). Furthermore, G allele and GG genotype were associated with the CHB patients developing into HCC (G allele: OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, P = 0.03; GG genotype: OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.57-0.99, P = 0.04).Conclusion:CTLA4 A/G gene polymorphism was associated with HCC risk and CTLA4 G allele/GG genotype is associated with CHB patients developing into HCC in Chinese.
