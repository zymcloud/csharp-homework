Purpose:Improvement in outcomes of LT for pediatric HB and HCC has been reported in small series. We analyzed national outcomes and changes in donor, recipient, and perioperative factors over time that may contribute to survival differences.Methods:The UNOS database was queried for patients age Results:In total, 599 children with HB received LT (320 historic vs 279 contemporary). Concurrently, 141 children with HCC received LT (92 historic vs 49 contemporary). For both tumors, waitlist time decreased (HB 56.2 days historic vs 33.2 days contemporary, P = 0.017; HCC 189.3 days historic vs 71.7 days contemporary, P = 0.012). In the historic cohorts, patients with HB had a 1-year and 5-year OS of 84.6% and 75.1%, respectively. Survival for HCC was 84.4% and 59.9%, respectively. Outcomes improved in the contemporary era to 89.1% and 82.6% for HB, and 94.7% and 80.8% for HCC, respectively (both log-rank test P Conclusion:Outcomes of LT have improved significantly, with contemporary survival now equivalent between these tumors and exceeding 80% 5-year OS. Future studies are needed to explore whether offering LT in patients that are resectable is justifiable.
