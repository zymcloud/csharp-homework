Objectives:Sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables, has been reported to own anticarcinogenic, antiinflammatory and cancer chemopreventive properties. Benzyl sulforaphane (BSFN) was a derivative of SFN which was designed and synthesized by our laboratory. Here, the cancer prevention and anticancer effects of BSFN on human hepatoma (HepG2) cells were investigated.Methods:The following effects of BSFN on components of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway were examined: generation of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) changes by flow cytometry, the expression changes of Bcl-2 family proteins and Akt/MAPK proteins by western blot. The protein levels of Nrf2 and Keap1 were also tested via Western blot. The effects of BSFN on Nrf2 nuclear translocation and ARE-reporter gene activity were examined by fluorescence microscope and multifunctional spectrophotometer.Key findings:Benzyl sulforaphane could induce cell apoptosis by mitochondrion-dependent pathway, which inhibited HepG2 cells growth in a manner of time- and concentration -dependent. Furthermore, BSFN could inhibit the Akt/MAPK and activate the Nrf2/ARE pathway in HepG2 cells.Conclusions:Benzyl sulforaphane was superior to SFN in inhibiting Akt/MAPK and activating Nrf2/ARE signalling pathways in HepG2 cells, which indicated that BSFN could be a safe therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of liver cancer.
