Despite improved screening programs, the vast majority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are diagnosed at an advanced stage. A lack of effective diagnosis methods for preclinical HCC has resulted in a low rate of early detection. Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) is associated with several cancer types. However, to the best of our knowledge, the diagnostic value of AKR1B10 in early stage HCC is poorly understood. In the current study, the diagnostic performance of serum AKR1B10 in hepatitis B virus/hepatitis C virus (HBV/HCV)-related liver disorders was evaluated and the unique role of AKR1B10 in diagnosing HCC was assessed. Serum AKR1B10 was detected by sandwich ELISA in 84 patients with HBV/HCV-related HCC, 74 patients with liver cirrhosis, 29 patients with chronic hepatitis and 30 healthy controls. Serum AKR1B10 and α-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were analyzed and compared. Elevated levels of serum AKR1B10 were identified in patients with HCC compared with patients with other liver disorders (P
