BACKGROUND Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) is the largest class of small non-coding RNA, which has also been identiﬁed in somatic tissues, and aberrant expression of piRNAs in tumor tissues may be implicated in carcinogenesis. piR-823 is increased in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, there is no report on the function of piR-823 in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation during hepatic fibrosis. The present study investigated the role of piR-823 in HSC activation. MATERIAL AND METHODS Liver fibrosis was induced in mice by carbon tetrachloride (CCL4) injection and bile duct ligation (BDL). The primary HSCs were isolated from mice and cultured. The expression of piR-823 was measured by real-time PCR. The effect of piR-823 on HSCs was evaluated by either sense sequence or antisense sequence of piR-823 carried by liposome. Proteins binding to piR-823 were assayed by RNA pull-down technique and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). RESULTS Our data for the first time show that piR-823 is signiﬁcantly upregulated in activated HSCs. Overexpression of piR-823 promoted HSC proliferation, α-SMA and COL1a1 production, whereas inhibition of piR-823 suppressed the activity of HSCs. Interestingly, the combination of piR-823 and EIF3B promoted TGF-β1 expression. CONCLUSIONS Our data illustrate a novel mechanism of piR-823 in HSC activities. The combination of piR-823 and EIF3B increased TGF-β1 expression, which activates HSCs in liver fibrosis. piR-823 may be a new target in the treatment of liver fibrosis.
