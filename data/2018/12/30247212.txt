Thyroid metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is very rare. We present a case of a 41-year-old man with a markedly elevated serum Î±-fetoprotein (2,297 ng/mL) and a left neck mass 6 months after a hepatolobectomy for a primary HCC. F-FDG PET/CT imaging showed a focal uptake in the left thyroid lobe corresponding to a mass. The patient underwent a left hemithyroidectomy. Subsequent pathology confirmed HCC metastasis to the thyroid.
