Background:TRIP13 is highly expressed in several cancers and is closely connected with cancer progression. However, its roles on the growth and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the underlying mechanism are still unclear.Methods:Combining bioinformatics with previous studies, the correlation between TRIP13 and HCC was predicted. TRIP13 expressions from 52 HCC patients and several cell lines were determined. The effects of silencing TRIP13 on cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion were respectively detected using CCK-8, flow cytometry and Transwell. qRT-PCR and western blot were performed to reveal associated mechanism. A HCC model was established in BALB/c-nu mice by transplanting HepG2 cells. TRIP13 protein expression and apoptosis in mice tissues were accordingly detected by Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL.Results:High expression of TRIP13 in HCC affected the survival rate and it was enriched in RNA degradation and fatty acid metabolism according to bioinformatics and prediction from previous literature. Increased expression of TRIP13 in HCC patient tissues was associated with the progression of HCC. Silencing TRIP13 inhibited cell viability, migration and invasion, and induced cell apoptosis. TRIP13 knockdown also suppressed the formation of tumor in vivo. Meanwhile, silencing TRIP13 decreased the expressions of Ki67 and MMP-2 and increased the expressions of TIMP-2, active-caspase-3 and TGF-β1/smad3 signaling- related genes.Conclusions:Silencing TRIP13 acts as a tumor suppresser of HCC to repress cell growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo, and such a phenomenon possibly involved activation of TGF-β1/smad3 signaling.
