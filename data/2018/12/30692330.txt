A 35-year-old man was diagnosed with initially unresectable synchronous liver metastases from sigmoid colon cancer. We started FOLFOX plus panitumumab therapy. After 3courses of chemotherapy, the liver metastases became resectable. Sigmoidectomy, extended left lobectomy, and partial hepatectomy were performed. On the final histopathological analysis, all hepatic lesions were fibrotic without viable cancer cells. Nineteen months after the surgery, CT revealed isolated residual liver recurrence in segment 5. After partial hepatectomy, the patient is alive without recurrence. We report a case of pathological complete response with FOLFOX plus panitumumab therapy for initially unresectable colorectal liver metastases with icterus.
