Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of malignancy of the liver and has been reported as the third most frequent cause of cancer associated death worldwide. Accumulating evidence showed that the expression of miR-34a was abnormal in HCC patients; however, the role of miR-34a in HCC is not clear. In this study, we have observed low expression of the miR-34a in both HCC tissues and hepatoma cell line as compared to normal control. Further to investigate the role of miR-34a in HCC development, HepG2 cells were transfected with miR-34a mimic. Following transfection, miR-34a expression was significantly increased, which further repressed proliferation of HepG2 cells. Bioinformatics, Luciferase Reporter, RT-qPCR, and western blotting assays indicated that special AT-rich sequence-binding protein-2 (SATB2) is a direct target of miR-34a in HCC cells. There was a negative correlation between the expression levels of SATB2 and miR-34a. Investigation into the molecular mechanism indicated that miR-34a regulated cell proliferation through inhibiting SATB2. Therefore, the results of the present study may improve understanding regarding the role of miR-34a in regulating cell proliferation and contribute to the development of novel therapy of HCC.
