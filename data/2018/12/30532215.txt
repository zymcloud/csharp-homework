Background:The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolism of the spleen, bone marrow (BM), and liver from preoperative F-18 FDG PET/CT scans for the prediction of recurrence in breast cancer.Methods:We retrospectively included 153 patients diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast who underwent preoperative F-18 FDG PET/CT scan and a curative operation. The mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) of the spleen, liver, and BM and maximum SUV (SUVmax) of primary tumors were measured. The relationships between spleen, BM, and liver metabolism and clinicopathologic parameters were evaluated, and possible prognostic parameters predicting recurrence were assessed using disease-free survival (DFS).Results:Spleen SUVmean was significantly correlated with primary tumor SUVmax, pathologic T (pT) stage, and histologic grade of primary tumor. BM SUVmean also showed a positive correlation with primary tumor SUVmax. Spleen SUVmean were significantly associated with recurrence from binary logistic regression analysis (P = 0.004). Spleen, BM, liver, and primary tumor SUVs were all significant prognostic factors for DFS in univariate Cox regression analysis (all P<0.024). Among all PET parameters analyzed, spleen SUVmean â‰¥ 2.21 (P = 0.032) was in the multivariable analysis the powerful poor prognostic factor predicting DFS that was independent of other clinicopathological features like T stage (pT >2; P = 0.009) and estrogen receptor (ER) status (ER negativity; P = 0.001).Conclusion:Splenic metabolism together with pT stage and ER status was an independent prognostic factor for predicting recurrence in breast cancer. Metabolic activity of reticuloendothelial system such as spleen, liver or BM on preoperative F-18 FDG PET/CT can be a meritorious imaging factor for discriminating patients with IDC that require adjunctive therapy to prevent recurrence.
