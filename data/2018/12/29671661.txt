Aim: This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of combination therapy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and CT-guided percutaneous partial hepatic segment ablation. Material and methods: Liver cancer patients undergoing TACE plus partial segment ablation from 2012 to 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Patient characteristics were collected. TACE was performed for all patients before ablation. After ablation, CT imagings were used to evaluate treatment and follow-up. Overall survival (OS) and local tumor progression free survival (LTPFS) were calculated. Results: Twenty-three patients with 68 liver tumors were included. The median tumor maximum diameter was 55 mm (range, 24 to 91 mm). The complete response rate of combination therapy was 87%. The one-, two-, three- and four-year overall survival rates were 78%, 65%, 54% and 54%, respectively. The three-year survival rate for BCLC stage C HCC patients was 53%. The one-, two- and three-year LTPFS rates were 54%, 35% and 35%, respectively. Tumor maximum diameter, vascular invasion and partial treatment response were independent risk factors for LTPFS. Only one patient suffered a major complication. Conclusion: TACE combined with partial hepatic segment thermal ablation is a safe and effective treatment for liver cancer patients, especially for those with more advanced disease.
