Introduction:Repeated resection is known to prolong survival, with an acceptable morbidity rate, in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. However, little is known about the effect of repeated liver resection on postoperative liver regeneration and liver function. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of repeated liver resections on the postoperative liver regeneration rate and liver function.Methods:A total of 71 patients, who had undergone more than three liver resections for hepatocellular carcinoma between May 2001 and December 2013 at a tertiary care hospital in Japan, were included in the analysis. Among them, CT-volumetric data for the first, second, third, and fourth or more resections were available for 36, 49, 53, and 24 patients. We analyzed the regeneration index (RI) defined as the postoperative TLV/preoperative TLV Ã— 100 was calculated after each operation to measure the degree of regeneration. Liver function was evaluated using the indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (ICG-R15).Results:No significant differences in RI were observed among the first, second, and third or more liver resection groups. No significant difference in the ICG R15 value was seen between the first liver resection group and the second or more liver resection group (P = 0.75). However, a significant difference in the RI was observed when the 1 segmentectomy or less liver resection group (median [range] RI 98.1 [72.9-119.9]) was compared with the 2 or more segmentectomy group (median [range] RI 90.5 [62.6-113.6]) (P = 0.005).Conclusion:The regeneration process is maintained after as many as four repeated resections. Patients with sustained liver function can safely undergo repeated liver resections for recurrences of HCC.
