Severe reactions to modern iodinated contrasts are uncommon. Breakthrough reactions in the setting of pretreatment with corticosteroids are even rarer. Patients with a history of these refractory reactions can create challenging situations in the diagnostic and therapeutic process. Here, we present a case of an 83-year-old male with hepatocellular carcinoma and a history of multiple severe reactions to iodinated contrast. The patient required a transarterial chemoembolization but the conventional technique was unavailable due to the allergy. Gadolinium-based contrast was substituted and used in conjunction with C-arm CT and a percutaneous ethanol injection to treat the tumor. After nearly 3 years, there is no evidence of residual or recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma.
