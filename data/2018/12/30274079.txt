Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) serve numerous chief functions in cosmetics, engineering, textile, food technology and medicine. These nanoparticles are also utilized in the pharmaceutical industry particularly in the production of novel antimicrobial agents. However, despite the various studies of Ag NPs induced toxicity, there is a lack of information concerning cellular toxicity mechanisms of these nanoparticles on human cells. In the current project, we investigate the anti-cancer effects of Ag NPs in HepG2 (liver hepatocellular adenocarcinoma) cells. The mean particle size and morphology for the prepared nanoparticles were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. Cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, cytochrome c amount and expression level of BAX/CASP 3/CASP 8/CASP 9 were assayed in HepG2 cells after incubation with Ag NPs. The prepared nanoparticles showed the mean particle size of 30.71 nm with polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.21. Our results revealed decreased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner and the IC50 of 75 Î¼g/mL for Ag NPs. Ag NPs cytotoxicity was associated with induction of ROS and cell apoptosis in HepG2 cell line. According to our findings, Ag NPs could be considered as potential chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of liver hepatocellular carcinoma.
