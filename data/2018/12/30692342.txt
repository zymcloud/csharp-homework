Rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)is a disease wherein the prognosis is poor. In this study, we investigated cases of rupture of HCC that we encountered over 18 years. The age of onset ranged 48-76 years(67 years on average). The patients included 5 males and 1 female. All the cases experienced onset with rapid abdominal pain or loss of consciousness. Shock conditions appeared in 3 cases. Arrest of bleeding was possible by transcatheter arterial embolization(TAE)in all the cases. Subsequently, systemic search and evaluation of hepatic functional reserve were conducted. Hepatectomy was performed in all the cases. No notable complications occurred after the surgery. Two patients with recurrent peritoneal dissemination died of the original disease within 2 years. In the other 3 patients, recurrence has not occurred, and 2 of them have achieved long-term recurrence-free survivals for 4 years or longer. Therefore, based on the findings, we consider that longterm survival can be expected, depending on individual cases.
