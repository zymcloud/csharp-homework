Background and aims:The impact of portal hypertension (PH) on postoperative short-term outcomes and long-term survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients has lately been discussed controversially. This study aimed to explore the influence of PH on postoperative outcomes in HCC patients undergoing surgical resection.Methods:Patients undergoing hepatectomy for HCC from 2010 to 2014 were enrolled. The impact of PH on postoperative complications, posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated.Results:A total of 355 HCC patients were enrolled; 129 (36.3%) experienced postoperative complications and 21 (5.9%) developed PHLF. PH was identified as an independent predictor of PHLF. Patients with PH experienced a higher incidence of complications and PHLF than patients without PH. On the Cox proportional hazards regression model, PH was verified as a risk factor of OS for BCLC stage 0/A and B patients. Patients without PH had significantly better long-term survival compared to patients with PH both in the total cohort and in cirrhosis subgroup.Conclusion:Liver resection in HCC patients with PH showed a significantly increased postoperative complications and PHLF, and revealed a decreasing long-term survival than non-PH patients. Besides, tumor burden also played an important role in determining the OS. However, due to the improvement in surgical technique and perioperative management, surgery was feasible in carefully selected HCC patients with PH.
