Nanodrug-delivery systems modified with targeting molecules allow antitumor drugs to localize to tumor sites efficiently. CD147 protein is expressed highly on hepatoma cells. Firstly, we synthesized magnetothermally responsive nanocarriers/doxorubicin (MTRN/DOX) which was composed of manganese zinc (Mn-Zn) ferrite magnetic nanoparticles, amphiphilic and thermosensitivity copolymer drug carriers together with DOX. Then CD147-MTRN/DOX was formed with MTRN/DOX and monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to CD147 protein. It could target hepatoma cells actively and improve the DOX concentration in the tumor sites. Subsequently, an external alternating magnetic field elevated the temperature of the thermomagnetic particles, resulting in structural changes in the thermosensitive copolymer drug carriers, thereby releasing DOX. Hence, CD147-MTRN/DOX could enhance the responsiveness of hepatoma cells to the pre-existing chemotherapy drugs owing to active targeting combined synergistically with thermotherapy and chemotherapy, which has more significant anticancer effects than MTRN/DOX.
