Objective:Hepatic cancer is well known, and leading cancer around the world and remain asymptomatic diseases. Carissa carandas possess anti-proliferative, antioxidant, hepatoprotective property and used in hepatic cancer. The current study deals to evaluate the chemoprotective and therapeutic property of Carissa carandas embedded silver nanoparticles (CCAgNPs) against diethylnitrosamine (DEN) -induced hepatic cancer.Material and method:Wistar rats were divided into six groups and hepatic cancer was induced with diethylnitrosamine at the dose of 200 mg/kg BW. The animals were gastrogavaged with standard drug and CCAgNPs for 16 weeks. Serum biomarkers, haematological profile, antioxidants enzymes, inflammatory markers and membrane bound enzymes were assessed to find the anti-proliferative potential of silver nanoparticles. Histological evaluation and microscopic characterizations were also performed to authenticate the outcomes of the present work.Results:Biosynthesized CCAgNPs significantly down-regulated the serum marker enzymes of hepatic and non-hepatic parameter, elevated the levels of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant profile, elevation in membrane bound enzymes and diminish the levels of inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β) via NF-κB pathway. Histopathological features also showed recovery of a hepatic architecture in cancer-induced rats in a dose-dependent manner.Conclusion:Our consequences established that such plant mediated silver nanoparticles shown a defensive impact against DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, and serves as a better option to ameliorate the clinical results against hepatocellular carcinoma.
