Background:Several studies have reported that osteopontin (OPN) is a promising marker for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, some studies emerged with conflicting results. Therefore, we provide a systematic review to evaluate the diagnostic performance of OPN for HCC.Methods:Studies that investigated the diagnostic value of OPN and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in HCC were collected from PubMed and Embase. Sensitivity, specificity, and other parameters about the diagnostic accuracy of serum OPN and AFP in HCC were pooled using STATA 12.0 software. The summary receiver operating characteristic curve (sROC) and other parameters were used to summarize the overall test performance.Results:Twelve studies were included in our meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio were 0.813 (95% CI: 0.671-0.902), 0.874 (95% CI: 0.778-0.932), and 30.047 (95% CI: 8.845-102.067) for OPN; 0.639 (95% CI: 0.538-0.729), 0.959 (95% CI: 0.909-0.982), and 41.518 (95% CI: 13.688-125.929) for AFP; and 0.856 (95% CI: 0.760-0.918), 0.738 (95% CI: 0.630-0.823), and 16.718 (95% CI: 7.950-35.156) for OPN+AFP, respectively. The area under the sROC for OPN, AFP, and OPN+AFP was 0.91, 0.88, and 0.85, respectively. For diagnosis of early HCC, pooled sensitivity of serum OPN, AFP, and OPN+AFP was 0.493 (95% CI: 0.422-0.563), 0.517 (95% CI: 0.446-0.587), and 0.732 (95% CI: 0.666-0.791), respectively.Conclusions:OPN is a comparable marker to AFP for the diagnosis of HCC, and the sensitivity of OPN was higher than that of AFP. A combination of AFP and OPN can elevate the sensitivity of diagnosis for early HCC.
