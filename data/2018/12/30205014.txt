We investigated the role of vitamin D (Vit D) alone and in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in thioacetamide (TAA)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in rats. Fifty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into a control group and 4 groups that received TAA (200 mg/kg, i.p.) twice per week for 16 weeks. These 4 groups were further divided as follows: HCC group; 5-FU group (75 mg/kg, i.p., once weekly for 3 weeks starting from the 12th week); Vit D group (200 IU/kg daily by oral tube for 16 weeks); and 5-FU + Vit D group (received the previously mentioned dosage regimens of 5-FU and Vit D). HCC was detected by histopathological changes in liver sections and the elevation of serum α-fetoprotein (AFP). Treatment with 5-FU + Vit D significantly decreased gene expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NrF2) and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) at both the gene and protein level and serum AFP concentrations in comparison with their corresponding monotherapy. Moreover, 5-FU + Vit D treatment enhanced apoptosis by increasing caspase-3 gene and protein expression. Conclusively, Vit D enhances antitumor activity of 5-FU in an HCC-induced model and improves liver function of treated animals. Combination therapy in a TAA-induced HCC rat model was more effective than 5-FU or Vit D through the modulation of TGF-β1, caspase-3, and NrF2 expressions.
