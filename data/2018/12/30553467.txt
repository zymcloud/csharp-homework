Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTL) is a rare subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma predominantly seen in young males. This disease presents with isolated hepatosplenomegaly and thrombocytopenia with sinusoidal infiltration of liver and sinusal infiltration of spleen. Immunophenotype shows positivity for CD3, CD7, TCRγδ or TCRαβ, CD38 and double negative for CD4, CD8, TdT, CD5, and CD56. Isochromosome 7q with or without trisomy 8 is seen in HSTL. Recently, ring chromosome 7 has also been identified as a new abnormality. We describe the clinical, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic analysis in a 24-year-old woman. We present an unusual case of TCRγδ positive T-cell lymphoma with aberrant expression of CD19, which is a B-cell lymphoid marker, with amplification of 7q region and subsequent formation of ring chromosome 7 and trisomy 8. This is the second case of HSTL, positive for CD19 and first case presenting with ring chromosome 7 and trisomy 8 in a CD19 positive HSTL which is a rare finding in T-cell lymphoma and needs to be explored further.
