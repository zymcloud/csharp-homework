The roles of miR-548b-3p in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain undiscovered. This study aims to explore the roles and mechanisms of miR-548b-3p in HCC. Using TCGA database, we found that miR-548b-3p expression was lower in HCC compared to the normal tissues, which was further confirmed by RT-qPCR of 20 cases of surgically resected HCC and corresponding normal tissues. miR-548b-3p mimic and inhibitor were transfected into Huh7 and SK-Hep-1 cells, respectively. MTT, colony formation, and cell cycle assays showed that miR-548b-3p mimic suppressed cell growth and G1/S cell cycle transition. In contrast, miR-548b-3p inhibitor facilitated cell growth and cell cycle transition. miR-548b-3p mimic also increased cisplatin sensitivity by upregulating apoptosis rate. JC-1 staining showed that miR-548b-3p mimic downregulated mitochondrial membrane potential, while miR-548b-3p inhibitor showed the opposite effects in SK-Hep-1 cells. Using prediction software, we found that CIP2A was on the target list of miR-548b-3p. miR-548b-3p mimic downregulated CIP2A and its downstream target protein c-Myc. Luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that CIP2A was as a direct target of miR-548b-3p. CIP2A depletion partly reduced the effect of miR-548b-3p mimic/inhibitor on c-Myc. CIP2A depletion also reduced the effect of miR-548b-3p mimic/inhibitor on proliferation. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that miR-548b-3p was downregulated in HCC. miR-548b-3p regulates proliferation, apoptosis and mitochondrial function by targeting CIP2A in HCC.
