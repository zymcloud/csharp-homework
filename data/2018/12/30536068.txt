The effects of essential oil from Carpesium abrotanoides L. (CAEO) on the proliferation and apoptosis of human hepatic cancer cells were investigated in this study. MTT assays indicated that CAEO inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells with the IC50 values ranging from 41.28±3.06 to 130.36±20.79 μg/mL. Moreover, many obviously nuclear morphological changes of apoptotic cells in CAEO-treated HepG2 cells were detected by Hoechst 33258 staining and fluorescence microscopy. Flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis and cell cycle, and noticeable findings showed that CAEO arrested cell-cycle at S and G2/M phases. The decreased Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio and the activation of caspase-3, caspase-9 were also detected by Western blotting. All results suggested that CAEO is a potential agent to fight against liver cancer, and the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway could be involved in CAEO-mediated apoptosis of human liver carcinoma cells.
