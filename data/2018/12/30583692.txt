Objective: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fatal cancer worldwide. Spontaneously Rupture remains important complication of HCC. The incidence of spontaneous HCC rupture was high in ASEAN but limited studies were reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate predictors and overall survival of ruptured HCC in tertiary care center in Thailand. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of HCC patients aged â‰¥15 years old during January 2012-January 2016 and followed up through June 2016 at Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand. All clinical information, laboratory and radiologic findings were collected from reviewing computer data base of medical records. Results: 333 patients had completely retrievable information. Of which, 51patients (15.3%) had spontaneous ruptured HCC. Clinical symptoms with abdominal discomfort and anemic symptoms were significantly higher in ruptured than non-ruptured HCC groups. (76.47% vs.39.36%: p200 ng/mL were significantly higher in ruptured than non-ruptured HCC groups (10.29cm. vs. 6.47cm. p6 were independent risk factors of HCC rupture (OR=0.96, 95%CI=0.93-0.99, p=0.02; OR=3.47, 95%CI=1.26-9.6, p=0.016; OR=54.51, 95%CI=7.09-418.89, p6 might be predictive factors of spontaneous ruptured HCC. Ruptures of HCC remained a fatal disease with poor survival rate in Thailand. Appropriate treatment in early stage could be effective tool to improve the treatment outcomes.
