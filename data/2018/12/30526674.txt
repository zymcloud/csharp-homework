Purpose:The goal of this study was to investigate the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) v.2017 for the categorization of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) with gadoxetic acid compared with gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Material and methods:We included 141 high-risk patients with 145 pathologically-confirmed HCCs who first underwent gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced 1.5-T followed by gadoxetic acid-enhanced 1.5-T MRI. Two independent radiologists evaluated the presence or absence of major HCC features and assigned LI-RADS categories after considering ancillary features on both MRIs. Finally, the sensitivity of LI-RADS category 5 (LR-5) and the frequencies of major HCC features were compared between gadoxetic acid- and gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced 1.5-T MRI using the Wilcoxon test.Results:The sensitivity of LR-5 for diagnosing HCCs was significantly different between gadoxetic acid- and gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI (73.8% [107/145] vs 26.2% [38/145], P Conclusion:Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI showed a comparable sensitivity to gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI for the diagnosis of HCCs, and LI-RADS category 4 (LR-4) hepatic nodules were upgraded to LR-5 when taking into account the major features according to LI-RADS v.2017.
