Purpose:To evaluate the short-term reproducibility of radiomic features in liver parenchyma and liver cancers in patients who underwent consecutive contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) with intravenous iodinated contrast within 2 weeks by chance.Methods:The Institutional Review Board approved this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study and waived the requirement for patients' informed consent. Patients were included if they had a liver malignancy (liver metastasis, n = 22, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, n = 10, and hepatocellular carcinoma, n = 6), had two consecutive CECT within 14 days, and had no prior or intervening therapy. Liver tumors and liver parenchyma were segmented and radiomic features (n = 254) were extracted. The number of reproducible features (with concordance correlation coefficients > 0.9) was calculated for patient subgroups with different variations in contrast injection rate and pixel resolution.Results:The number of reproducible radiomic features decreased with increasing variations in contrast injection rate and pixel resolution. When including all CECTs with injection rates differences of less than 15% vs. up to 50%, 63/254 vs. 0/254 features were reproducible for liver parenchyma and 68/254 vs. 50/254 features were reproducible for malignancies. When including all CT with pixel resolution differences of 0-5% or 0-15%, 20/254 vs. 0/254 features were reproducible for liver parenchyma; 34/254 liver malignancy features were reproducible with pixel differences up to 15%.Conclusion:A greater number of liver malignancy radiomic features were reproducible compared to liver parenchyma features, but the proportion of reproducible features decreased with increasing variations in contrast injection rates and pixel resolution.
