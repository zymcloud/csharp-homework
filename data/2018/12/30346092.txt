Proteus syndrome (PS) is a rare disorder caused by a mosaic AKT1 variant that comprises patchy overgrowth of tissues derived from all three germinal layers affecting multiple viscera. We sought to delineate the extent of hepatoportal manifestations in patients with PS. We identified patients with PS who had abdominal imaging from 1989 to 2015 in a natural history study. Imaging was characterized for evidence of focal findings in the liver, spleen, and portal vasculature and for organomegaly. Relevant clinical and laboratory data were compared among those with or without organomegaly. Abdominal imaging was available on 38 patients including 20 who had serial studies. Nine patients had focal hepatic lesions including vascular malformations (VMs). Focal splenic abnormalities were noted in seven patients. Patients without cutaneous VMs did not have visceral VMs. Nine patients had splenomegaly, 12 had portal vein dilation, and 4 had hepatomegaly. There was a weak correlation of portal vein dilation to spleen height ratio (r2 = 0.18, p < .05). On laboratory evaluation, hepatic function was normal but there was thrombocytopenia in those with splenomegaly; platelet counts were 179 ± 87K/μL compared to those with normal spleen size at 253 ± 57K/μL (p < .05). Overall, focal hepatosplenic abnormalities occurred in 11 of 38 (29%) patients with PS. Splenomegaly and portal venous dilation were both found in 8 of 38 (21%) patients; however, other than relative thrombocytopenia, there was no evidence of portal hypertension. Although the AKT1-E17K somatic variant is a suspected oncogene, there were no malignant lesions identified in this study.
