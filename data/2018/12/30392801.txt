Purpose:To assess the role of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-positive circulating tumor cell (CTC) count in predicting survival outcomes of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:EpCAM-positive CTC counts were prospectively determined via CellSearch in peripheral blood of 97 patients with unresectable HCC treated with chemoembolization. The impact of each CTC cutoff point on overall survival (OS) was evaluated by univariate Cox regression analysis. Based on hazard ratio, patients were divided into 3 groups with low (CTC count 0/1), moderate (CTC count 2-5), and high (CTC count â‰¥ 6) levels. Correlation of CTC counts with survival was assessed by Cox proportional-hazards model.Results:Eighty-nine patients met inclusion criteria and were enrolled. On multivariate Cox regression analysis, CTC count was found to be an independent predictor of OS (P = .049) and progression-free survival (PFS; P = .007) in patients treated with chemoembolization. After adjustment for confounding factors, mortality risks in the high- and moderate-level groups were 2.819 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.218-6.526; P = .016) and 1.301 times (95% CI, 0.630-2.685; P = .477) greater, respectively, than in the low-level group. The risk of progression was 3.705 fold higher in the high-level group (95% CI, 1.628-8.433; P = .002) and 1.648 fold higher in the moderate-level group (95% CI, 0.843-3.223; P = .144) vs the low-level group.Conclusions:High EpCAM-positive CTC count predicts poor survival of patients with unresectable HCC treated with chemoembolization.
