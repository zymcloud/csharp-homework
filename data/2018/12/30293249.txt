Background:The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of actual resected liver volume (ARLV) in anatomical liver resections (ALRs) guided by 3-dimensional parenchymal staining using fusion indocyanine green fluorescence imaging (IGFI).Methods:Patients eligible for hepatic resection were enrolled in the current study from January 2016 to November 2017. All patients underwent surgery planning based on Medical Image Three-Dimensional Visualization System (MI-3DVS) before the operation, in which predicted resected liver volumes (PRLVs) were calculated. Under 3-dimensional guidance by fusion IGFI, ALRs were performed and ARLVs were measured. Simple linear regression, intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis were used to evaluate the relationship and agreement between PRLV and ARLV.Results:Of the 27 patients who achieved valid demarcation by fusion IGFI, 12 (44.4%) received hemihepatectomy, while 10 (37.0%) and five (18.5%) underwent sectionectomy and segmentectomy, respectively. The relationship and agreement between PRLV (481.37 ± 189.47 cm³) and ARLV (450.57 ± 205.19 cm³) were then evaluated. The simple regression equation obtained was PRLV = 0.874 × ARLV + 87.75 (R = 0.946; P = 0.000). Meanwhile, ARLV (ICC = 0.943) achieved an excellent agreement with PRLV ( P Conclusions:In the study, these findings validated the consistency between PRLV calculated by MI-3DVS and ARLV guided by fusion IGFI, which proved that IGFI can accurately guide anatomical hepatectomy. Generally, fusion IGFI can provide a valid, feasible and accurate demarcation line, which can confer precision to hepatic resection.
