Lung transplant recipients have a significant incidence of posttransplant lung nodules. Such nodules can occur from various etiologies, both in the lung allograft or in the native lung. They most commonly originate from infections, such as Pseudomonas or Aspergillus species, or from posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Lung cancer is challenging to diagnose in a native lung, especially with an underlying fibrotic disease. We present a case of a 75-year-old woman who presented with classic clinical features of pulmonary aspergillosis in the native right lung with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 5 years after left-sided single-lung transplant. She required a right lower lobectomy and antifungal treatment with isavuconazonium sulfate and inhaled amphotericin. A persistent right upper lobe lung nodule was noted during surveillance imaging and was initially presumed to be recurrent Aspergillus infection; however, growth of the nodule and change in its characteristics prompted additional examination. A navigational bronchoscopic biopsy was positive for squamous cell carcinoma. Her options for stage IIIA squamous cell carcinoma were limited to chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin plus radiation. Although initial surveillance scans showed adequate tumor response, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma was found in the liver 6 months later. She was eventually transitioned to palliative care. This case highlights the importance of a high index of suspicion for examination of nodules in the native lung of lung transplant recipients, even in cases of a known diagnosis, owing to the high morbidity and mortality associated with primary lung cancer in this population.
