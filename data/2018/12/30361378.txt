Image-guided procedures are used worldwide in the management of primary liver tumors and liver metastases. These locoregional therapies include local tumor ablation and transarterial therapies and can occasionally downstage an inoperable patient to an operable status. In hepatocellular carcinoma, data have suggested that for tumors smaller than 2 cm ablation may be preferable to surgery. Similar results are emerging for colorectal cancer liver metastases. Catheter-directed therapies such as bland embolization, transarterial chemoembolization, and drug-eluting beads represent potential techniques that can provide survival benefit for inoperable patients. In this review we highlight the most used techniques and the evidence supporting their current indications for the treatment of liver tumors. We briefly review upcoming developments in combination strategies with temperature-sensitive liposomes or immunotherapy for enhancing ablation efficacy.
