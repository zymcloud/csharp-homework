Inflammation plays a key role in setting the stage leading to atherosclerosis progression, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) has been recognized as a predictor of cardiovascular risk. As a monotherapy and in combination with statins, gemcabene markedly reduced CRP in humans. Present investigation was undertaken to understand the mechanism of CRP reduction. In human hepatoma cells, gemcabene inhibited IL-6 plus IL-1β-induced CRP production in a concentration-dependent manner, reaching 70% inhibition at 2 mM. In TNF-α-stimulated primary human coronary artery endothelial cells, both CRP and IL-6 productions were reduced by 70% at 2 mM gemcabene concentration. To investigate the mechanism of gemcabene-mediated reduction of CRP, transfection studies were performed with human CRP regulatory sequences in luciferase/β-gal system that showed 25-fold increase in IL-6- and IL-6 plus IL-1β-stimulated CRP transcription. Luciferase activity was reduced by 50% by gemcabene, suggesting transcriptional down-regulation of CRP. Site-directed mutagenesis of human CRP promoter revealed that the overlapping downstream C/EBP and NF-κB binding sites are important for gemcabene-mediated CRP transcription. Gel shift assays identified the transcription factor that binds to the downstream CRP promoter as C/EBP-δ. In conclusion, gemcabene decreases CRP by C/EBP-δ and NF-κB-mediated transcriptional mechanism and suppresses IL-6 and IL-1β-induced CRP production.
