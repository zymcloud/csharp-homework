Background:Differential expression profile of microRNAs (miRNAs) could be a diagnosis signature for monitoring gastric cancer (GC) progression. In this study, we focus on the comparison of expression levels of miR-21, miR-25, miR-93, miR-106b, and miR-375 during the sequential pattern of GC development, including normal gastric, gastric dysplasia, and GC sample.Methods:We used SYBR Green-based quantitative-PCR to quantify miRNAs expression.Results:Our analysis revealed the increased expression levels of miR-21 (p = 0.034), miR-25 (p = 0.0003), miR-93 (p = 0.0406), and miR-106b (p = 0.023) in GC samples. In addition, GC patients with positive lymph node metastasis showed the up-regulation of miR-25, miR-93, and miR-106b (p < 0.05).Conclusion:Our findings suggested that the expression of miR-21, miR-25, miR-93, and miR-106b altered in GC, and some of them may be further investigated as biomarkers for GC early detection and prognosis prediction.
