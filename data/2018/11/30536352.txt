Objective:Fatigue may be cause by all cancer treatments, maybe because the tissue damage or the build-up of dead cells derived products.Patients and methods:At the Mede Clinic in Sacile, Pordenone, Italy, from February 2016 to May 2018 we studied 50 patients with cancer and fatigue (15 with breast cancer, 12 with lung cancer, 11 with colon cancer, 5 with renal cancer, 3 with prostate cancer, 2 with melanoma and 2 hepatocellular carcinoma). Patients were treated with Auto Hemotransfusion (GAE) according to the SIOOT (Scientific Society of Oxygen Ozone Therapy) protocols, two times a week for one month and then twice monthly as maintenance therapy.Results:Nineteen of them were undergoing neoplastic treatment, 10 had already ended the cancer therapy and 21 were in a palliative setting. The Fatigue Severity Scale was used to assess the extent of fatigue in patients, in order to estimate the severity of the symptom with a score from 1 to 7. No side effects were found, and 35 patients (70%) achieved a significant improvement (> 50%) of the symptoms.Conclusions:Our preliminary data demonstrate that ozone therapy is a valid supportive therapy for fatigue in cancer patients, both during cancer therapy and in a palliative setting with no significant side effects.
