Kinesin family member 20B (KIF20B, also known as MPHOSPH1) is a kinesin protein that plays a critical role in cytokinesis. Previously, we and others have demonstrated the oncogenic role of KIF20B in several cancers; however, the exact mechanisms underlying its tumorigenic effects remain unclear. Herein, we showed overexpression of KIF20B in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and reported a negative correlation between KIF20B level and prognosis of patients. Mechanistically, reducing KIF20B blockades mitotic exit of HCC cells at telophase in a spindle assembly checkpoint independent way. Importantly, reducing KIF20B acts synergistically with three microtubule-associated agents (MTA) to p53- or p14ARF-dependently suppress p53-wt or p53-null HCC cells. In addition to taxol, reducing KIF20B also enhanced the toxicity of two chemotherapeutic drugs, hydroxycamptothecin and mitomycin C. In conclusion, we found a novel mechanism in that blocking cytokinesis by KIF20B inhibition increases the efficacy of MTA; our results thus suggested a dual-mitotic suppression approach against HCC by combining MTA with KIF20B inhibition, which simultaneously blocks mitosis at both metaphase and telophase.
