Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. However, the mechanism underlying the tumorigenesis of HCC is still unclear. Improper recruitment of Pescadillo homologue 1 (PES1) can lead to tumorigenesis in multiple cancer types, such as gastric cancer and colon cancer. Here, we reported that PES1 was upregulated and associated with a poor prognosis in HCC specimens. Next, we found that PES1 promoted the growth of HCC in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we showed that the knockdown of PES1 decreased glycolysis via altering the gene expression of GLUT1, PKM2, ENO1, FBP1, and PCK1, which are related to glucose metabolism in HCC cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that PES1 is regulated by bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) and is partially responsible for modulating the antitumor effect of BET inhibitors in HCC. Taken together, our results suggest that PES1 plays an important role in promoting the proliferation of human liver cancer cells, suggesting that PES1 may be an ideal molecular target for HCC therapy.
