Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a tumor that usually metastasizes to lung, liver, bone and brain, but rarely to skeletal muscles. We report a case of an elderly man with a history of bilateral metachronous RCC for which he underwent curative bilateral nephrectomies and renal transplantation, was in remission, and presented with a large solitary skeletal muscle metastasis from the initial RCC, 3 years later.
Renal cell carcinoma; Skeletal muscle metastasis.
