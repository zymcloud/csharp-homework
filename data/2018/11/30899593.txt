There is an increasing prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome, which promote the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a disease that can evolve into cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Repin1 loss was previously shown to have beneficial effects on lipid and glucose metabolism and obesity regulation. Herein, we characterized NAFLD in mice with hepatic deletion of Repin1 (LRep1-/-). For this purpose, liver disease was analysed in male LRep1-/- and wild-type mice treated with streptozotocin/high fat diet or a control diet over a period of 20 wks. Streptozotocin/high fat diet treated LRep1-/- mice showed a significant decrease in systemic and hepatic lipid accumulation, accompanied by diminished chronic inflammation and a subsequent reduction in liver injury. Remarkably, Repin1-deficient mice exhibited a lower tumour prevalence and tumour frequency, as well as a reduced liver weight/body weight index. A therapeutic approach using Repin1 siRNA in the early phase of NAFLD verified the observed beneficial effects of Repin1 deficiency. This study provides evidence that loss of Repin1 in the liver attenuates NAFLD progression, most likely by reducing fat accumulation and alleviating chronic tissue inflammation. Thus, modulating Repin1 expression may become a novel strategy and potential tool to inhibit NAFLD progression.
