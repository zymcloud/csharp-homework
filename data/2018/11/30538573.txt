Objective:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a rapidly proliferating malignancy that requires large amounts of fatty acids to synthesize cellular membranes and provide energy. Epidermal fatty acid-binding protein (EFABP) is uniquely expressed in epidermal cells, but its role and expression in HCC are not clear.Subjects and methods:A total of 804 HCC specimens were collected to construct a tissue microarray (TMA) and for immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. The relationship between EFABP expression and clinical features of patients with HCC was analyzed.Results:The EFABP IHC score for HCC tissue was 0.76±0.69, being significantly higher than that for matched nontumorous tissue (0.48±0.55; P<0.001). Using the median IHC score (ie, 0.8) in the tumorous tissue, a high level of EFABP expression was found in 57.3% (461/804) of the cases. Patients with HCC displaying high EFABP expression had poorer tumor differentiation (P=0.029), more vascular invasion (P=0.006), and a higher proportion of late TNM stage disease (P=0.042). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the patients with high EFABP expression had significantly worse outcomes in terms of overall survival (P=0.003), worse disease-free survival (P=0.021), and a higher probability of recurrence (P=0.014). Multivariate analysis indicated that EFABP expression was an independent prognostic variable for overall survival (P=0.021) and disease-free survival (P=0.044). For HCC recurrence, only vascular invasion (P=0.020) and EFABP expression (P=0.026) were independent risk factors.Conclusion:Our data revealed that EFABP expression was increased in HCC samples. High EFABP expression was correlated with shorter survival times in patients with HCC and served as an independent factor for worse outcomes. Our study therefore provides a promising bio-marker for the prognostic prediction of HCC and a potential therapeutic target for the disease.
