Purpose:To compare tumor vascularity in 4 types of rat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) models: N1S1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-transfected N1S1 (VEGF-N1S1), McA-RH7777, and VEGF-transfected McA-RH7777 (VEGF-McA-RH777) tumors.Materials and methods:The N1S1 and McA-RH7777 cell lines were transfected with expression vectors containing cDNA for rat VEGF. Eighty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight range, 400-450 g) were randomly divided into 4 groups (ie, 22 rats per model), and 4 types of tumor models were created by using the N1S1, VEGF-N1S1, McA-RH7777, and VEGF-McA-RH777 cell lines. Tumor vascularity was evaluated by perfusion computed tomography (CT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of VEGF, CD34 staining, angiography, and Lipiodol transarterial embolization. Intergroup discrepancies were evaluated by Kruskal-Wallis test.Results:Arterial perfusion (P Conclusions:McA-RH7777 tumors were more hypervascular than N1S1 tumors, and tumor vascularity was enhanced further by VEGF transfection. Therefore, the VEGF-McA-RH7777 tumor is recommended to mimic hypervascular human HCC in rats.
