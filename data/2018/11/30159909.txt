Objectives:Reported antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties for one aqueous-ethanolic extract from Thalassia testudinum which grows in the Caribbean Sea compelled us to explore about extract cytotoxic effects.Methods:Cell viability was assayed on tumour (HepG2, PC12, Caco-2 and 4T1) and non-tumour (VERO, 3T3, CHO, MCDK and BHK2) cell lines. The extract effects upon primary cultures of rat and human hepatocytes and human lymphocytes were assayed.Key findings:The extract exhibited cytotoxicity against cancer cells compared to normal cells, and the IC50 values were 102 μg/ml for HepG2, 135 μg/ml for PC12, 165 μg/ml for Caco-2 and 129 μg/ml for 4T1 cells after 48 h, whereas IC50 could not be calculated for normal cells. Additional data from a high-content screening multiparametric assay indicated that after 24-h exposure, the extract (up to 100 μg/ml) induced death in HepG2 cells through oxidative stress-associated mechanism, DNA damage and hypercalcaemia. Comet assay corroborated extract-induced DNA damage.Conclusions:Thalassia testudinum extract is more cytotoxic and produced more DNA damage on human hepatoma cells than to other non-tumour cells. A possible mechanism is suggested for extract-induced cytotoxicity based on oxidative stress, nuclear damage and hypercalcaemia in HepG2 cells. T. testudinum may be a source for antitumour agents.
