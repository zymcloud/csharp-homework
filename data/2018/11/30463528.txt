Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor that threatens global human health. High PKM2 expression is widely reported in multiple cancers, especially in HCC. This study aimed to explore the effects of PKM2 on global gene expression, metabolic damages, patient prognosis, and multiple transcriptional regulation relationships, as well as to identify several key metabolic genes and screen some small-molecule drugs.Methods:Transcriptome and clinical HCC data were downloaded from the NIH-GDC repository. Information regarding the metabolic genes and subsystems was collected from the Recon 2 human metabolic model. Drug-protein interaction data were obtained from the DrugBank and UniProt databases. We defined patients with PKM2 expression levels â‰¥11.25 as the high-PKM2 group, and those with low PKM2 expression (Results:The results showed that the global metabolic gene expression levels were obviously divided into the high- or low-PKM2 groups. In addition, a greater number of affected metabolic subsystems were observed in the high-PKM2 group. Furthermore, we identified 98 PKM2-correlated deregulated metabolic genes that were associated with poor overall patient survival. Together, these findings suggest more comprehensive influences of PKM2 on HCC. In addition, we screened several small-molecule drugs that target these metabolic enzymes, some of which have been used in antitumor clinical studies.Conclusions:HCC patients with high PKM2 expression showed more severe metabolic damage, transcriptional regulation imbalance and poor prognosis than low-PKM2 individuals. We believe that our study provides valuable information for pathology research and drug development for HCC.
