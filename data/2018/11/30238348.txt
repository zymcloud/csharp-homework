Primary hepatobiliary malignancies are hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma and the rare hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma (mixed tumor). The indications for liver transplantation and the oncological prognosis differ considerably between these tumor entities. Treatment and decision making for these tumors are often complicated by an underlying chronic liver disease. The aim of this review is to delineate the indications for transplantation and bridging therapies for each cancer entity as well as to highlight some aspects pertinent to transplantation, such as the principles of organ allocation.
