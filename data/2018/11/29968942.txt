This study was designated to verify if the lncRNA H19/miR-193a-3p axis would play a regulatory role in the radio-/chemo-resistances of HCC cells through targeting PSEN1. Within the study, five human HCC cell lines were prepared, including Bel-7402, HepG2, Hep3b, QGY-7703, and SMMC-7721. Moreover, docetaxel (DT), paclitaxel (Pt), vinorelbine (Vb), and 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) were managed as the chemo-therapeutics, and single-dose X-rays were performed as radio-therapies. Besides, lncRNA H19 and miR-193a-3p were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot were implemented to quantify the expressional levels of PSEN1, Ku80, Î³-H2AX, and RAD51. Luciferase reporter gene assay was advanced to verify the targeted relationship between lncRNA H19 and miR-193a-3p. As a consequence, QGY-7703 and Bel-7402 were, respectively, the most radiation-sensitive and radiation-proof cell lines, and Bel-7402 was associated with the highest resistances to DT, Pt, Vb, and 5-FU. The restrained lncRNA H19 and over-expressed miR-193a-3p expressions tended to significantly elevate the survival rate and proliferation of Bel-7402 cells, when they were exposed to radiation and subject to chemo-therapies. The lncRNA H19 was also found to directly target miR-193a-3p in inducing the HCC development. PSEN1 appeared to be subject to the modification of lncRNA H19 and miR-193a-3p in its acting on the survival rates and proliferative abilities of HCC cells. The lncRNA H19/miR-193a-3p/PSEN1 axis could be regarded as the treatment targets for HCC, so as to further improve the treatment efficacy of chemo- and radio-therapies for HCC.
