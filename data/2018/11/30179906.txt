Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major complication of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Accumulating data suggest that antiviral treatment in both CHB and CHC reduces the incidence of HCC. Evidence is more consistent for interferon-based treatment in both CHB and CHC and for lamivudine in patients with CHB. However, more limited data suggest that other nucleos(t)ide analogues might also reduce the risk of HCC. In contrast, conflicting data have been reported on the effects of direct-acting antivirals on the incidence of HCC.
