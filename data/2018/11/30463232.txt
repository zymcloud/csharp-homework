The detection of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in plasma is important in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in humans. We developed a biosensor to detect AFP in HCC patient plasma and in a phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution using a graphene field-effect transistor (G-FET). The G-FET was functionalized with 1-pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (PBASE) for immobilization of an anti-AFP antibody. AFP was detected by assessing the shift in the voltage of the Dirac point (ΔVDirac) after binding of AFP to the anti-AFP-immobilized G-FET channel surface. This anti-AFP-immobilized G-FET biosensor was able to detect AFP at a concentration of 0.1 ng mL-1 in PBS, and the detection sensitivity was 16.91 mV. In HCC patient plasma, the biosensor was able to detect AFP at a concentration of 12.9 ng mL-1, with a detection sensitivity of 5.68 mV. The sensitivity (ΔVDirac) depended on the concentration of AFP in either PBS or HCC patient plasma. These data suggest that G-FET biosensors could have practical applications in diagnostics.
