Objective: To study the constitutional features of diseases spectrum of inpatients with liver disease in infectious diseases department of three comprehensive hospitals to provide resource allocation proposition for the construction of Department of Infectious Diseases. Methods: Inpatients data were extracted from the department of infectious diseases of three comprehensive hospitals (Kunming General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army, Yuxi People's Hospital and Dali People's Hospital) between January 2010 to December 2015, and were retrospectively analyzed. The distribution of patients with viral hepatitis (A, B, C, E) and severe liver disease (Severe hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer) was further analyzed in hospitalized patients. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. A chi-squared test was used for comparison between groups. The change trends of disease constituent ratio in different years were checked by 2 test. Results: Liver disease, tuberculosis and AIDS were the three common diseases of three comprehensive hospitals in Yunnan, accounting for 58.61% of all admissions. However, an inpatients with liver diseases (17.25%, 3555/20606, 95% CI 16.73%-17.77%) were significantly lower than tuberculosis inpatients (33.98%, 7002/20606, 95% CI 33.34%-34.62%). An observations from different hospitals and at different time points showed that the proportion of patients with liver disease was lower than that of tuberculosis patients. The proportion of inpatients with HBV infection showed a downward trend (P < 0.001), whereas the proportions of inpatients with HCV and severe liver diseases showed an increased trend over time (P < 0.001). Conclusion: The proportion of inpatients with liver diseases was lower than tuberculosis inpatients in the Department of Infectious Diseases of three comprehensive hospitals. Hence, the paucity of the disease spectrum should be considered for resource allocation in the construction of infectious disease department.
