Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major global health burden. Currently, two types of treatment, interferons (IFNs) and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs), have been approved. These treatments are effective in suppressing HBV replication and in decreasing the risk of developing cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and death. However, these treatments do not eliminate the virus, and the risk of HCC remains. This review article summarizes current knowledge about the safety, efficacy, and clinical indications of hepatitis B treatment. It also discusses limitations of existing treatment, gaps in knowledge, and feasibility of a hepatitis B cure.
