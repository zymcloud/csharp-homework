Background/objectives:Organ transplant recipients (OTR) have an increased risk of skin cancers compared with the general population.Methods:A prospective study of renal (RTR) and liver transplant recipients (LTR) was conducted in a single New South Wales tertiary referral centre over 60 months. Initial and subsequent visit data were recorded in our transplant database. Only patients with a minimum of 11 months follow up were included.Results:Altogether 142 RTR and 88 LTR were included in the analysis. Compared with RTR, the median age of liver transplant recipients was higher (64 vs 57 years), more men were patients (73 vs 60%) and there were higher rates of high-risk skin types (54 vs 33%) and heavy sun exposure (43 vs 30%). RTR developed 304 non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) with a squamous cell carcinoma:basal cell carcinoma ratio of 1.7:1. LTR developed 205 NMSC with a squamous cell carcinoma:basal cell carcinoma ratio of 1.6:1. The odds ratio of developing NMSC in LTR:RTR was 1.8:1 (95% CI: 1.02-3.11, P = 0.044) on univariate analysis but there was no difference on multivariate analysis. A previous history of NMSC, age, time from transplant from first visit, skin phenotype and previous sun exposure were significant risk factors for developing NMSC.Conclusions:Liver transplant recipients are not at a lower risk of NMSC than RTR. Our study supports routine and regular post-transplant skin surveillance of all LTR, like other OTR.
