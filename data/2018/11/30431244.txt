Rarely encountered in the Western countries, membranous occlusion of the inferior vena cava results from a fibrous thickening of the intima and is commonly located at the orifices of the hepatic veins. To date, two etiopathogenic hypotheses have been formulated: the first, dealing with the embryological aspect, the second, arguing for a thrombotic origin. Nevertheless, several studies are still underway to understand the exact physiopathological mechanism of this obstruction. Among these studies, some suspect the predisposing role of anatomical and infectious factors. On average, it takes 6 years between the beginning of the symptoms and the diagnosis. The later the diagnosis is settled, the higher is the risk of encountering a hepatocellular carcinoma. The most relevant additional examinations to visualize the membrane are the abdominal ultrasound and the cavography. Computed tomography allows to highlight the effects of obstruction on the hepatic parenchyma. Concerning the treatment, many studies showed that angioplasty has an excellent immediate and late efficacy. A few surgical techniques also exist but those are less exploited because of the non invasive aspect and lower morbidity-mortality of the endovascular treatment.
