Chronic hepatitis B is globally prevalent and is a major cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite immunoprophylaxis against hepatitis B in pregnancy, perinatal transmission still occurs in at least 10% of the children born to a mother with high level of viremia. Decisions regarding hepatitis B therapy during pregnancy must take into account the benefits and safety for both the mother and the unborn baby.
