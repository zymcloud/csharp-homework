Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs) have been employed for centuries in the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previous reviews of this topic have focused on certain aspects of TCM treatment rather than an overall assessment of their value and mechanisms of action. Both the Chinese and English medical literatures were reviewed to identify where TCM might be of value in the treatment of HCC and the justification for such treatment. TCM treatment corrects the "internal disequilibriums" thought to be responsible for the development, growth, and spread of the tumor. It has also been used to manage symptoms associated with HCC and the adverse effects of chemo- and radiation-therapies. Recent research has documented the precise effects of TCM on tumor biology. There are also increasing efforts to identify which of the many components of TCM herbal remedies are primarily responsible for these beneficial effects. This review outlines the benefits of TCM treatment of HCC and the laboratory data describing their anti-tumor properties.
