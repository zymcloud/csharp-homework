AKAP12 belongs to A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) family of scaffold proteins and is known as a tumor suppressor in several human cancer types. Its role as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was proposed due to its downregulation and epigenetic modification in human HCC; however, the effect of its deficiency on liver injuries, such as liver fibrosis and cancer has been poorly studied. By analyzing tumor and non-tumor tissues of 15 patients with HCC, it was confirmed that AKAP12 expression was downregulated in human HCC as compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. Immunohistochemical staining of mouse liver tissue for AKAP12 revealed that its sinusoidal expression was diminished in capillarized endothelium after 8 weeks of thioacetamide (TAA) administration. AKAP12 deficiency resulted in the promotion of ductular response of biliary epithelial cells, whereas overall fibrosis and myofibroblast activation were comparable between genotypes after short-term TAA treatment. The mRNA expressions of some fibrosis-related genes such as those encoding epithelial cell adhesion molecule, collagen type 1 Î±1 and elastin were upregulated in liver tissues of AKAP12-knockout mice. Long-term administration of TAA for 26 weeks led to the development of liver tumors; the incidence of tumor development was higher in AKAP12-deficient mice than in wild-type littermates. Together, these results suggest that AKAP12 functions as a tumor suppressor in liver cancer and is associated with the regulation of hepatic non-parenchymal cells.
