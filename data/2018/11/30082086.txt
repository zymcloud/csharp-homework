Introduction:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is considered a therapeutic option. It is mostly used in hepatocellular carcinoma or liver colorectal, neuroendocrine or melanoma metastases. Although it is considered a safe procedure, TACE presents complications, such as acute cholecystitis, which is the most common. Other procedure-related complications include pulmonary embolism, hepatic abscess, bile duct injury, gastric mucosa injury and, less frequently, acute pancreatitis. The aim of this study is to review the complications following TACE for liver tumors.Methods:We performed a retrospective study including all the TACE procedures performed in a single center during the period between January 2013 and December 2016.Results:Out of the 196 patients with liver tumors who had undergone 322 TACE, 258 (80%) were male and 64 (20%) were female. Mean patient age was 66.5years. Major complications after chemoembolization included: decompensation with edema/ascites (6patients), acute cholecystitis (4), acute pancreatitis (3), liver rupture (1), liver abscess (1) and renal failure (1). Postembolization syndrome appeared in 71 (20%) patients. On multivariate analysis, it was observed that concomitant cardiovascular disease (OR: 4.5; 95%CI: 1.2-17; P=.025) is a risk factor for the development of complications.Conclusions:TACE is a safe and effective procedure for liver tumor treatment. The majority of the complications are rare and present a low incidence of mortality.
