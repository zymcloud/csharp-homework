The erythropoietin-producing hepatoma (EPH) receptor A2 (EphA2) belongs to the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases. EphA2 is highly correlated with the formation of many solid tumors and has been linked to the dysregulation of signaling pathways that promote tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion as well as angiogenesis. Deregulation of Wnt signaling is implicated in many forms of human disease including gastric cancer. We previously reported that EphA2 promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition through Wnt/β-catenin signaling in gastric cancer. Herein, we present a novel mechanism by which EphA2 regulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling. EphA2 acts as a receptor for Wnt ligands and recruits Axin1 to the plasma membrane by directly binding Dvl2. The EphA2-Dvl2/Axin1 interaction was enhanced by Wnt3a treatment, suggesting that EphA2 acts as a functional receptor for the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and plays a vital role in downstream signaling. We showed that Dvl2 mediates the EphA2-Axin1 interaction by binding to the tyrosine kinase domain of EphA2. We propose that EphA2/Dvl2/Axin1 forms a complex that destabilizes the β-catenin destruction complex and allows β-catenin to translocate to the nucleus and initiate the transcription of c-MYC, the primary Wnt signaling target gene. Intriguingly, c-MYC could bind directly to the EphA2 and Wnt1 promoter to enhance their transcription. The entire process formed an EphA2-mediated feed-forward loop. A small molecular inhibitor of EphA2 potently inhibited the proliferation of gastric cancer in vitro and in vivo, including gastric cancer patient-derived xenografts. Thus, our data identify EphA2 as an excellent candidate for gastric cancer therapy.
