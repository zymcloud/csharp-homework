Background:Hepatitis C, a liver disease transmitted by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), can result in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). According to WHO estimates for 2015, approximately 71 million people worldwide are chronically infected with HCV, representing 1% of the world population. Worldwide migration movements lead to immigration from HCV high- to low-prevalence countries. There are, however, no published data available on HCV seroprevalence and its correlation with the country of origin in current unselected larger refugee populations (>1000 people) having entered Europe/Germany.Objectives:Documentation and evaluation of hepatitis C seroprevalence and its correlation with the country of origin of refugees in Rhineland-Palatinate/Germany in 2015.Methods:As part of routine diagnostics during the initial medical examination, 12,880 refugees in Rhineland-Palatinate were screened for HCV antibodies in 2015. The data have been analyzed retrospectively and anonymously.Results:The collective comprising 12,880 refugees showed a HCV seroprevalence of 1.5%. This is higher than the HCV prevalence of the general German population (0.5%). In particular, a correlation between HCV seroprevalence and the country of origin could be demonstrated.Conclusions:To reach the 2030 HCV-elimination target of the WHO, national and international recommendations to screen refugees/migrants from HCV high-prevalence countries for HCV should be emphasized. The chronically infected should be treated in accordance with HCV-guidelines. National, easily accessible information on HCV high-prevalence countries is required by attending physicians.
