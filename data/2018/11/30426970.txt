BACKGROUND Therapeutic evaluation of 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) is rarely reported for non-resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). The aim of this study was to determine the value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in evaluating the therapeutic response of HCC with PVTT treated with 3DCRT. MATERIAL AND METHODS PVTT reduction rate in the study was determined after 3DCRT using time intensity curve (TIC) analysis software before and after radiotherapy. Seventy-nine HCC patients with PVTT treated with 3DCRT were studied. HCC and PVTT were performed by CEUS, before and after 3DCRT, over time. The parameters of blood flow, including arrival time (AT), time to peak (TTP), peak intensity (PI), washout time (WT), and area under the curve (AUC), were quantified and evaluated on still images by CEUS. RESULTS After 3DCRT, typing and staging of PVTT in 38 patients was decreased, the reduction rate was 48.1%. HCC was effective in 45 patients, the effective rate was 57%; No differences were found between the PVTT reduction rate and the HCC effective rate (Ï‡2=2.96, P>0.05). In the effective group, the PI and AUC of HCCs and PVTTs after 3DCRT were significantly lower than before 3DCRT, while the other parameters of TIC were not significantly different before and after 3DCRT. CONCLUSIONS CEUS might be a useful monitoring option for the evaluation of HCC with PVTT treated with 3DCRT. CEUS might be useful as an important choice for monitoring and evaluation HCC with PVTT after 3DCRT. TIC parameters might provide quantitative data for efficacy evaluation, which helps to modify treatment strategies timely and accurately.
