To investigate the effect of ursolic acid on the invasion and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells co-cultured with macrophages, and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Methods: The migration and invasion ability of HCC cells in the co-culture system with or without ursolic acid intervention were evaluated by transwell assay. The levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin in HCC cells co-cultured with macrophages were detected by Western blot. Results: The migration and invasion ability and EMT were significantly enhanced when co-cultured with macrophages, and the expression of E-cadherin was significantly increased while N-cadherin and vimentin levels were significantly decreased. However, after ursolic acid treatment, the migration and invasion ability were significantly reduced, and the expression of E-cadherin was increased while N-cadherin and vimentin levels were decreased. Conclusion: Ursolic acid exerts inhibitory effect on the ability of migration, invasion, and EMT for HCC, which are enhanced by co-culturing with macrophages.
