[Fe(NO)2] - modified nanoparticles of low-density protein (DNICLDL) can serve as conveyors of iron in the form of stable complexes with ApoB100 protein. As reported recently, in human hepatoma cells DNICLDL significantly increased the total iron content, while showing low toxicity. In the present work, we focused on the effects of internalization of DNIC-modified lipoproteins in macrophages, with special regards to cytotoxicity. DNICLDL was administered to a model macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. Administration of DNICLDL considerably increased total iron content. High increase of iron was accompanied by moderate toxicity. As shown by in vitro plasmid nicking assay, chelation of iron in the form of DNIC strongly reduced the iron-related reactive oxygen species (ROS) -induced DNA damage. In addition, DNICLDL, plausibly due to its NO-donating activity, did not induce inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, as opposed to other forms of low-density protein (LDL).
