Introduction:Up to 38% of pancreatic and periampullary cancer patients undergoing curative intended surgery turn out to have incurable disease. Therefore, staging laparoscopy (SL) prior to laparotomy is advised to spare patients the morbidity, inconvenience and expense of futile major surgery. The aim of this study was to assess the added value of SL with laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) and laparoscopic near-infrared fluorescence imaging (LFI).Methods:All patients undergoing curative intended surgery of pancreatic or periampullary cancer were included prospectively in this single arm study. Patients received an intravenous infusion of 10 mg indocyanine green (ICG) one or two days prior to surgery to allow LFI. Suspect lesions were analyzed via biopsy or resection. Follow-up visits after surgery occurred every three months.Results:A total of 25 patients were included. Suspect lesions were identified in 7 patients: liver metastases (n = 2; identified by inspection, LUS, and LFI), peritoneal metastases (n = 1; identified by inspection only), and benign lesions (n = 4; identified by inspection or LUS). Quality of LFI was good in 67% (10/15) of patients dosed one day and 89% (8/9) dosed two days prior to surgery. A futile laparotomy was averted in 3 patients (12%). Following SL the primary tumor was resected in 20 patients. Two patients (10%) developed metastases within 3 months after resection.Conclusions:Despite current preoperative imaging modalities metastases are still identified during surgery. This study shows limited added value of LUS during SL in patients with pancreatic or periampullary cancer. LFI was of added value due to its high negative predictive value in case of suspect hepatic lesions identified by inspection.
