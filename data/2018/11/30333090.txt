Although the regeneration of the adult liver depends on hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs), many uncertainties regarding hepatic regeneration in the injured liver remain. Trefoil factor family 1 (TFF1), a secretory protein predominantly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, is responsible for mucosal restitution. Here, we investigated the role of TFF1 in liver regeneration using a mouse model of hepatic injury (choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented diet and carbon tetrachloride administration) and genetically engineered mice (TFF1 knockout (TFF1-/-)). Immunohistochemistry analysis of human liver samples revealed TFF1 expression in the hepatocytes close to ductular reaction and the regenerating biliary epithelium in injured liver. The number of cytokeratin 19 (CK19)-positive bile ducts was significantly decreased in the TFF1-/- mice after liver injury. Notch pathway in the TFF1-/- mice was also downregulated. HPCs in the control mice differentiated into biliary cells (CK19+/SRY HMG box 9 (SOX9)+) more frequently. In contrast, HPCs in the TFF1-/- mice more frequently differentiated into a hepatic lineage (alpha fetoprotein+/SOX9+) after acute liver damage. Hepatocyte proliferation was upregulated, and the liver weight was increased in TFF1-/- mice in response to chronic liver damage. Thus, TFF1 is responsible for liver regeneration after liver injury by promoting HPC differentiation into a biliary lineage and inhibiting HPC differentiation into a hepatic lineage.
