Some primary and secondary liver carcinomas cannot be resected using a conventional approach due to their size, location, or major vascular invasion. The aim of this study was to explore the application of ex vivo liver resection and autotransplantation for complicated HB in children. A 1.5-year-old girl with HB after repeated chemotherapy was analyzed. In this patient, tumor invasion includes the IV, V, and VIII liver segments, and thrombosis formed in the inferior vena cava and right atrium. It is difficult to obtain complete tumor resection using conventional hepatectomy. The patient was treated via ex vivo liver resection and autotransplantation, and tumor thrombus in the inferior vena cava and right atrium was removed via cardiopulmonary bypass. Operative methods and precautions were analyzed during and after the operation. The operation was completed successfully within 8 hours, and the liver's cold ischemia time was 190 minutes. The patient recuperated successfully, and the liver's function and AFP levels gradually tended to normalize 2 weeks after the operation. Ultrasonic examination revealed that the blood flow velocity of the hepatic vein, portal vein, and hepatic artery was good. The patient recovered and was discharged 3 weeks after the operation. Ex vivo liver resection and autotransplantation have great application value for complicated HB in children that is not suitable for conventional hepatic lobectomy.
