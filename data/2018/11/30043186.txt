Background:Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD Ia) in dogs closely resembles human GSD Ia. Untreated patients with GSD Ia develop complications associated with glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) deficiency. Survival of human patients on intensive nutritional management has improved; however, long-term complications persist including renal failure, nephrolithiasis, hepatocellular adenomas (HCA), and a high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Affected dogs fail to thrive with dietary therapy alone. Treatment with gene replacement therapy using adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) expressing G6Pase has greatly prolonged life and prevented hypoglycemia in affected dogs. However, long-term complications have not been described to date.Methods:Five GSD Ia-affected dogs treated with AAV-G6Pase were evaluated. Dogs were euthanized due to reaching humane endpoints related to liver and/or kidney involvement, at 4 to 8 years of life. Necropsies were performed and tissues were analyzed.Results:Four dogs had liver tumors consistent with HCA and HCC. Three dogs developed renal failure, but all dogs exhibited progressive kidney disease histologically. Urolithiasis was detected in two dogs; uroliths were composed of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate. One affected and one carrier dog had polycystic ovarian disease. Bone mineral density was not significantly affected.Conclusions:Here, we show that the canine GSD Ia model demonstrates similar long-term complications as GSD Ia patients in spite of gene replacement therapy. Further development of gene therapy is needed to develop a more effective treatment to prevent long-term complications of GSD Ia.
