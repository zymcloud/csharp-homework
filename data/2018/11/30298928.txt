Background:The characteristics of red blood cell (RBC) products change after 2 weeks of cold storage. It is unclear whether older RBCs affect mortality after liver transplantation. This retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the association between the age of transfused RBCs and death after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT).Study design and methods:Of 200 recipients who underwent LDLT, 118 who received RBCs with a mean storage duration of less than 10 days (shorter storage group) were compared with 82 with an RBC mean storage duration of more than 14 days (longer storage group). Key exclusion criteria were transfusion of very fresh RBCs stored for less than 4 days and transfusion of old RBCs in recipients of the shorter storage group. The primary outcome was posttransplant overall death. Survival analysis was performed using the Cox model.Results:Mean RBC storage duration was 7 days in the shorter storage group and 17 days in the longer storage group. Death probability at 1, 2, and 5 years posttransplant was 5.1%, 7.6%, and 13.6% in the shorter storage group, respectively, and 6.1%, 8.5%, and 13.5% in the longer storage group. Death risk was comparable between the two groups in univariable (hazard ratio [HR] 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.47-2.16, p = 0.991) and multivariable (HR 1.07, 95% CI, 0.46-2.50, p = 0.882) analyses. Graft failure risk was also comparable (HR 1.04, 95% CI, 0.50-2.18, p = 0.916). Hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence probability at 1, 2, and 5 years was 10.8%, 15.4%, and 23.1%, respectively, in the shorter storage group and 11.4%, 15.9%, and 20.7% in the longer storage group (HR 0.84, 95% CI, 0.37-1.89, p = 0.670). No significant differences were observed regarding graft regeneration/function, vascular/biliary complications, acute kidney injury, surgical site infection, or rejection (p > 0.05).Conclusions:No evidence was found that transfusion of old RBCs contributes to death after LDLT.
