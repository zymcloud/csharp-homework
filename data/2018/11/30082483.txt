Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a heterogeneous disease. Mouse models are commonly used as preclinical models to study hepatocarcinogenesis, but how well these models recapitulate molecular subtypes of human HCC is unclear. Here, integration of genomic signatures from molecularly and clinically defined human HCC (n = 11) and mouse models of HCC (n = 9) identified the mouse models that best resembled subtypes of human HCC and determined the clinical relevance of each model. Mst1/2 knockout (KO), Sav1 KO, and SV40 T antigen mouse models effectively recapitulated subtypes of human HCC with a poor prognosis, whereas the Myc transgenic model best resembled human HCCs with a more favorable prognosis. The Myc model was also associated with activation of β-catenin. E2f1, E2f1/Myc, E2f1/Tgfa, and diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced models were heterogeneous and were unequally split into poor and favorable prognoses. Mst1/2 KO and Sav1 KO models best resemble human HCC with hepatic stem cell characteristics. Applying a genomic predictor for immunotherapy, the six-gene IFNγ score, the Mst1/2 KO, Sav1 KO, SV40, and DEN models were predicted to be the least responsive to immunotherapy. Further analysis showed that elevated expression of immune-inhibitory genes (Cd276 and Nectin2/Pvrl2) in Mst1/2 KO, Sav1 KO, and SV40 models and decreased expression of immune stimulatory gene (Cd86) in the DEN model might be accountable for the lack of predictive response to immunotherapy.Implication: The current genomic approach identified the most relevant mouse models to human liver cancer and suggests immunotherapeutic potential for the treatment of specific subtypes.
