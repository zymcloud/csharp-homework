Purpose:To evaluate whether response based on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) change at diffusion-weighted MRI after transarterial radioembolization (TARE) can predict survival, in patients with prior transarterial chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We identified all patients who received DEB-TACE prior to TARE for HCC between 2007 and 2016. Response on MRI was determined by modified RECIST (mRECIST) and ADC change relative to pre-TARE imaging (ADCratio). Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests were used to correlate the response/disease and treatment variables to overall survival. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to correct for confounders.Results:A total of 29 consecutive patients were included. Univariable analysis showed that response determined by mRECIST was a nonsignificant predictor of survival (p = 0.057), and response determined by ADCratio was a significant predictor of survival (p = 0.011). Number of prior DEB-TACE procedures (p = 0.037), female gender (p Conclusion:ADCratio following TARE is an independent predictor for survival in patients who previously underwent DEB-TACE for HCC.
