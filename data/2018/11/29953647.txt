Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNA molecules involved in regulation of post-translational gene expression. Although aberrant levels of miRNAs have been found in various tumor tissues, their importance in tumor development and the molecular basis of their regulatory role remain unclear. Our bioinformatic analysis on The Cancer Genome Atlas database and microarray-based comparison of miRNA in different cell lines revealed that the level of mir-1287 is suppressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. When upregulated, mir-1287 can reduce the tumorigenesis phenotypes of HCC cells in several in vitro models. We further found that mir-1287 directly targets messenger RNA encoding PIK3R3, which is a tumor-promoting factor acting in several pathways linked to tumorigenesis. Our study suggests that aberrant suppression of mir-1287 is potentially responsible for the development of HCC, and miRNA-based strategies may be developed for efficient detection and treatment of HCC.
