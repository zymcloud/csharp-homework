The effective treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage IIIB remains controversial and challenging because of the high recurrence rate after resection and low survival rate. The median survival of those with macroscopic portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) is short. We reported such a case which received liver transplantation (LT) after successful consecutive downstaging therapies. A 40-year-old man with alcohol related liver cirrhosis and repeated esophageal varices bleeding had HCC with tumor thrombi in right main portal vein and the second portal branch of segment VI (stage IIIB). The received percutaneous alcohol injection, radiofrequency ablation, 8 sessions of transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization, radiotherapy, and target therapy with sorafenib. Computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging after treatments showed no viable fragments in the tumor and revealed both the right main portal vein and V1 branch were patent. One month later, the patient received a deceased LT. The perioperative course was rather smooth. After discharge, the interval follow-up CT studies of the chest and liver and whole body bone scan showed no tumor recurrence or metastasis up to 20 months postoperation.
