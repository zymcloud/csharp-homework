Steroids affect normal and pathological functions of the liver through receptors, which require coactivators for their transcriptional activation. Steroid receptor coactivator (SRC)-1 and SRC-3 have been demonstrated to be regulated in numerous cancers; however, their expression profiles in liver cancer including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) remain unclear. Using tissue microarray immunohistochemistry, normal liver tissue and HCC tissue exhibited immunoreactivity of SRC-1, which were predominantly localized within extranuclear components; in CCC, they were detected within the cell nuclei; SRC-3 was also detected in the cell nuclei. Furthermore, no altered expression of SRC-1 and SRC-3 was observed in liver cancer compared with normal liver tissue; however, in CCC, the expression of SRC-3 was significantly increased compared with that detected in HCC. Importantly, although expression of SRC-1 and SRC-3 did not reveal any significant differences (30 vs. 40%) in normal liver tissue, HCC and CCC expression of SRC-1 was significantly decreased compared with that of SRC-3 (9.3 vs. 36%, and 6.7 vs. 67.7% for HCC and CCC, respectively). Further comparative analysis revealed that this discrepancy was detected in males with liver cancer, across all ages of HCC cases, younger CCC cases and all stages of liver cancer. The results suggested the presence of an imbalanced expression pattern of SRC-1 and SRC-3 from normal liver tissue to liver cancer (decreased SRC-1 and increased SRC-3), which may affect hepatic function and therefore promote liver carcinogenesis.
