Background:Anhydrous ethanol, for its part, has been successfully used to treat renal cyst, hepatocellular carcinoma and ovarian chocolate cyst et al. However, in spite of the high frequency of tuberculous purulent pleural effusion, we found that only a few very early studies that attempted to assess the use of intrapleural anhydrous ethanol in tuberculous effusions with signs of empyema. We report a patient who was injected anhydrous ethanol into pleural cavity to treat chronic tuberculous empyema.Case presentation:A 23-year old male was admitted in the hospital because of chronic tuberculous empyema. Ultra-sonography guided thoracentesis and thoracic close drainages were done, but had no effect. However, the patient refused Video-assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) and traditional thoracotomy. Therefore, we injected anhydrous ethanol into the pleural cavity after getting the patient's consent. Pyothorax was quickly controlled and the patient finally recovered fully.Conclusion:Surgical operation is the main treatment of chronic tuberculous empyema, which has a high cost and large injury, and many patients do not accept this treatment. In this study, intrapleural injection of anhydrous ethanol could achieve the purpose of eliminating the pus cavity, which is particularly suitable for patients who cannot tolerate surgery or are unwilling to undergo surgical treatment.
