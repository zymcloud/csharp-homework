Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare, hemorrhagic autoimmune disease, whose pathogenesis involves reduced coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) activity related to the appearance of inhibitors against FVIII. Common etiological factors include autoimmune diseases, malignancy, and pregnancy. We report two cases of AHA in solid cancer. The first case is a 63-year-old man who developed peritoneal and intestinal bleeding after gastrectomy for gastric cancer. He was diagnosed with AHA, and was treated with prednisone, followed by cyclophosphamide. In the second case, a 68-year-old man developed a subcutaneous hemorrhage. He was diagnosed with AHA in hepatocellular carcinoma on CT imaging, and treated with rituximab alone. Hemostasis was achieved for both patients without bypassing agents as the amount of inhibitors was reduced and eradicated. However, both patients died within 1 year due to cancer progression. Successful treatment for AHA in solid cancer can be difficult because treatment of the underlying malignancy is also required.
