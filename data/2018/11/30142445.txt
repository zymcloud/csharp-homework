Commercially available targeted panels miss genomic regions frequently altered in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We sought to design and benchmark a sequencing assay for genomic screening of HCC. We designed an AmpliSeq custom panel targeting all exons of 33 protein-coding and two long noncoding RNA genes frequently mutated in HCC, TERT promoter, and nine genes with frequent copy number alterations. By using this panel, the profiling of DNA from fresh-frozen (n = 10, 1495×) and/or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumors with low-input DNA (n = 36, 530×) from 39 HCCs identified at least one somatic mutation in 90% of the cases. Median of 2.5 (range, 0 to 74) and 3 (range, 0 to 76) mutations were identified in fresh-frozen and FFPE tumors, respectively. Benchmarked against the mutations identified from Illumina whole-exome sequencing (WES) of the corresponding fresh-frozen tumors (105×), 98% (61 of 62) and 100% (104 of 104) of the mutations from WES were detected in the 10 fresh-frozen tumors and the 36 FFPE tumors, respectively, using the HCC panel. In addition, 18 and 70 somatic mutations in coding and noncoding genes, respectively, not found by WES were identified by using our HCC panel. Copy number alterations between WES and our HCC panel showed an overall concordance of 86%. In conclusion, we established a cost-effective assay for the detection of genomic alterations in HCC.
