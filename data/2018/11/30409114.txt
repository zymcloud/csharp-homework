Background:Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) is a rare tumor that constitutes 1% of all pancreatic neoplasms. Pancreatic ACC has unique characteristics in terms of biological behavior, imaging and prognosis.Case presentation:The present study reported two cases of pancreatic ACC confirmed by postoperative pathology and both cases exhibited several different imaging features and laboratory test results. Both cases had approximately 4 cm mass located in uncinate process of pancreas. Dilated intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts was observed in one case, along with calcification. Heterogeneous enhancement of the tumor was exhibited in both patients with different intensities. Obstructive jaundice, elevated Î±-fetoprotein and CA 19-9 was found in one case, while the other case had normal liver function and tumor markers.Conclusions:It was difficult to accurately diagnose pancreatic ACC before the operation despite its unique characteristics. Radical resection was the best treatment modality for resectable pancreatic ACC.
