Background and objectives:The treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) includes surgical, interventional and systemic approaches. This review highlights the importance of surgical treatment approaches in the multimodal treatment of HCC, based on the currently available literature, corresponding German guidelines as well as current developments in organ donation in Germany.Results:Curative treatment options for HCC include liver transplantation, partial liver resection, and local ablative procedures depending on the lesion size. In the case of an early HCC in a cirrhotic liver fulfilling the Milan criteria, liver transplantation is the treatment of choice. In view of the organ shortage in Germany and improved results after partial liver resection, surgery can alternatively be performed in patients with a sufficient liver function. In selected patients with multinodular HCC, regional lymph node metastases or macrovascular invasion, the possibility of liver resection must be decided on an individual basis; however, the latter two criteria are contraindications for transplantation. Local ablative procedures can be considered as an alternative to resection in selected patients with early solitary HCC. Surgery of HCC in the non-cirrhotic liver with a curative intent is guided by the general principles of oncological liver surgery.Discussion:Curative treatment options for HCC include liver transplantation, partial liver resection and local ablative procedures. Current developments in the area of organ donation and technical advances in minimally invasive liver surgery should be included in decision-making in tumor boards.
