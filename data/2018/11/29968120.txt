As a part of our endeavor toward the synthesis of a new class of biologically potent heterocyclic hybrids, a series of newly fused thiazolo[2,3-b]pyrimidinones bearing a pyrazolylcoumarin moiety (6a-p) were synthesized in acceptable yields. Anticipated structures of all titled compounds were in agreement with spectral and analytical (C, H and N) analyses. The compounds were screened for in vitro antibacterial activity against both G+ and G- bacterial strains and antiproliferative activity against K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia), MCF-7 (breast cancer), MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer), COLO 205 (colorectal adenocarcinoma), HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma) cell lines. Further, potent antibacterial compounds were subjected to molecular docking studies in order to gain insight into their plausible binding modes and mechanism of action against MurB. The modeling results were in agreement with the experimental data.
