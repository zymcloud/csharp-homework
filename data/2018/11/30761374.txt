Purpose:To find potentially diagnostic texture analysis (TA) features and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic resonance (MR) TA for differentiation between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and benign hepatocellular tumors in the non-cirrhotic liver in an exploratory MR-study.Materials and methods:108 non-cirrhotic patients (62 female; 41.5 Â± 18.3 years) undergoing preoperative contrast-enhanced MRI were retrospectively included in this multi-center-study. TA including gray-level histogram, co-occurrence and run-length matrix features (total 19 features) was performed by two independent readers. Native fat-saturated-T1w and T2w as well as arterial and portal-venous post contrast-enhanced 2D-image-slices were assessed. Conventional reading was performed by two separate independent readers. Differences in TA features between HCC and benign lesions were investigated using independent sample t-tests. Logistic regression analysis was performed to obtain the optimal number/combination of TA-features and diagnostic accuracy of TA analysis. Sensitivity and specificity of the better performing radiologist were compared to TA analysis.Results:The highest number of significantly differing TA-features (n = 5) was found using the arterial-phase images including one gray-level histogram (skewness, p = 0.018) and four run-length matrix features (all, p Conclusion:2D-TA of MR images is a feasible objective method that may help to distinguish HCC from benign hepatocellular tumors in the non-cirrhotic liver. Most promising results were found in TA features in the arterial phase images.
