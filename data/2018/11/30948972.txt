To evaluate the safety and efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent TACE utilizing up to one vial of LC BeadM1 (70-150 μm) embolics with doxorubicin was performed. If tumor devascularization was not achieved, up to one additional vial of LC Bead (100-300 μm) embolics with doxorubicin was subsequently administered. Ninety-four sessions of TACE were completed among 48 patients. After a mean follow-up of 182 days, complete response was achieved in 10 patients (21%), partial response in 19 (40%), stable disease in 8 (17%), and progressive disease in 10 (21%). Disease control was achieved in 79% of patients: 90% of patients treated with 70- to 150-μm embolics alone vs. 70% of patients treated with both sizes of embolics (P = 0.47). Pathologic examination revealed complete necrosis in 5 of 10 tumors in eight transplants. Overall survival at 3, 12, and 24 months was 100%, 94%, and 94%, respectively. The median progression-free survival was 282 days. In conclusion, drug-eluting bead TACE with 70- to 150-μm embolics alone or in combination with 100- to 300-μm embolics is safe and demonstrates good disease control, particularly with small, solitary tumors.
