The most effective way of treating liver cancer is surgical resection, which usually requires blocking the hepatic portal circulation, and may result in hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI). It is of paramount importance to control HIRI for liver cancer surgical resection. In this study, a 70% ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) model of rat liver was established, and the protective effect and mechanism of limb ischemic post-conditioning (LIPOC) on HIRI was investigated. We show that LIPOC has a protective effect on hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats, which reduces the elimination of superoxide dismutase, thereby increasing oxygen free radical scavenging, decreasing lipid peroxidation, inhibiting neutrophil aggregation, as well as reducing TNFα, IL1β, and other inflammatory cytokines. In addition, LIPOC inhibited the apoptosis of hepatocytes induced by I/R injury, and decreased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Furthermore, LIPOC promoted the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. The use of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and ERK1/2 blocker PD98059 inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 caused by LIPOC and abolished the injury protection of liver I/R. Moreover, through 16 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma resections, we found that short-term LIPOC treatment significantly suppressed the elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspartic transaminase, and total bilirubin in the early post-operation of liver resection, and reduced reperfusion injury to the ischemic liver. In summary, our study demonstrates that LIPOC could be an effective method for HIRI in the clinical implementation of liver resection and uncovers the potential mechanism of LIPOC in the protective effects of HIRI.
