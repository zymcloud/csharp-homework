Background:There is a strong correlation between liver fibrosis and postoperative morbidity after hepatectomy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate which noninvasive fibrosis index (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase to platelet ratio [GPR], aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index, fibrosis-4 index, or Forns index) was best able to predict complications in patients undergoing hepatectomy for HCC.Materials and methods:This retrospective analysis included 275 patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC from January 2008 to December 2012. Postoperative mortality was defined as death within 90 d after surgery. Complications were grouped into seven grades on the basis of the modified Clavien classification, and major postoperative complications were defined as grade 3 or above. The influence of noninvasive fibrosis indices on postoperative outcomes was assessed by receiver operating characteristic analysis. The primary outcomes were overall complications and major complications, estimated by univariate and multivariate analysis.Results:Patients with HCC undergoing anatomical liver resection in the authors' department were evaluated for this study. Finally, 275 patients who underwent minor liver resection (â‰¤2 liver segments) were included. Of these, 231 (84%) were male. The multivariate analysis indicated that the GPR index was not only independently associated with overall complications (hazard ratio, 2.692; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.626-4.250; P Conclusions:The data suggested that the GPR index could be a promising predictor of overall postoperative complications and major complications after minor hepatectomy for HCC.
