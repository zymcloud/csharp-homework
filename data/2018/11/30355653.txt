Sialic-acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (siglec) regulates cell death, anti-proliferative effects and mediates a variety of cellular activities. Little was known about the relationship between siglecs and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis. Siglec gene expression between tumor and non-tumor tissues were compared and correlated with overall survival (OS) from HCC patients in GSE14520 microarray expression profile. Siglec-1 to siglec-9 were all down-regulated in tumor tissues compared with those in non-tumor tissues in HCC patients (all P < 0.05). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that siglec-2 overexpression could predict better OS (HR = 0.883, 95%CI = 0.806-0.966, P = 0.007). Patients with higher siglec-2 levels achieved longer OS months than those with lower siglec-2 levels in the Kaplan-Meier event analysis both in training and validation sets (P < 0.05). Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels in siglec-2 low expression group were significantly higher than those in siglec-2 high expression group using Chi-square analysis (P = 0.043). In addition, both logistic regression analysis and ROC curve method showed that siglec-2 down-regulation in tumor tissues was significantly associated with AFP elevation over 300 ng/ml (P < 0.05). In conclusion, up-regulation of siglec-2 in tumor tissues could predict better OS in HCC patients. Mechanisms of siglec-2 in HCC development need further research.
