Purpose:High mobility group box 3 (HMGB3) is associated with hepatocytes malignant transformation by our previous work. We continued to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic values of HMGB3 for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:Circulating HMGB3 levels were quantitatively detected in a cohort of 225 patients with chronic liver diseases by ELISA and compared with alpha-fetoprotein by the receiver operating characteristic curve. HMGB3 expression in tissues of 170 HCC was detected by tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry. Relationship between HMGB3 level and HCC prognosis was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression model.Results:The incidence of serum HMGB3 >2.0 ng/mL was 75.6% in HCC (96/127), 20.8% in liver cirrhosis (10/48), 16.0% in chronic hepatitis (8/50), and none in healthy controls (0/49). Significant difference (P<0.001) of circulating HMGB3 level was found between HCC and benign liver diseases. Total diagnostic sensitivity of serum HMGB3 plus alpha-fetoprotein was up to 89.0% for HCC. Higher HMGB3 expression was confirmed to be 73.5% in HCC tissues (125/170) >30.6% in their paracancerous tissues (52/170). HMGB3 expression was closely related to tumor size, TNM stage, poor survival, and high recurrence, suggesting an independent prognosis factor for HCC.Conclusion:HMGB3 with aberrant expression could be a novel diagnostic and prognostic marker for HCC.
