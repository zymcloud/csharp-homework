The identification of viability-associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) might be a promising rationale for new therapeutic approaches in liver cancer. Here, we applied an RNA interference screening approach in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines to find viability-associated lncRNAs. Among the multiple identified lncRNAs with a significant impact on HCC cell viability, we selected cancer susceptibility 9 (CASC9) due to the strength of its phenotype, expression, and up-regulation in HCC versus normal liver. CASC9 regulated viability across multiple HCC cell lines as shown by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference and single small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated and siRNA pool-mediated depletion of CASC9. Further, CASC9 depletion caused an increase in apoptosis and a decrease of proliferation. We identified the RNA binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (HNRNPL) as a CASC9 interacting protein by RNA affinity purification and validated it by native RNA immunoprecipitation. Knockdown of HNRNPL mimicked the loss-of-viability phenotype observed upon CASC9 depletion. Analysis of the proteome (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) of CASC9-depleted and HNRNPL-depleted cells revealed a set of coregulated genes which implied a role of the CASC9:HNRNPL complex in AKT signaling and DNA damage sensing. CASC9 expression levels were elevated in patient-derived tumor samples compared to normal control tissue and had a significant association with overall survival of HCC patients. In a xenograft chicken chorioallantoic membrane model, we measured decreased tumor size after knockdown of CASC9. Conclusion: Taken together, we provide a comprehensive list of viability-associated lncRNAs in HCC; we identified the CASC9:HNRNPL complex as a clinically relevant viability-associated lncRNA/protein complex which affects AKT signaling and DNA damage sensing in HCC.
