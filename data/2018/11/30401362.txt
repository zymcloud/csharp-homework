Objective:The aim of this study is to determine whether post-transarterial chemoembolization imaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) could accurately predict the tumors' necrosis on pathologic specimens.Background:Transarterial chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads has been proven to be an effective way to bridge patients with hepatocellular carcinomas to liver transplantation.Materials and methods:From September 2012 to June 2017, 59 patients with a total of 78 hepatocellular carcinomas, who received transarterial chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads before liver transplantation in Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, were included in the study. All patients and hepatocellular carcinomas have pre-transarterial chemoembolization and post-transarterial chemoembolization images (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) and pathological findings for correlation. Tumor response was evaluated according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. The ranges of necrotic percentage are 100%, 91-99%, 51-90%, and Results:The accuracy rate between the imaging and pathology correlation was 40% for computed tomography and 42% for magnetic resonance imaging. The recurrent rate of the complete respond group is 11.5%, the partial respond group is 16.0%, and the stationary group is 28.6%.Conclusion:Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging sensitivity is not satisfactory for microscopic evaluation of residual tumors after transarterial chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads. However, survival is good after liver transplantation no matter what the microscopic findings were.
