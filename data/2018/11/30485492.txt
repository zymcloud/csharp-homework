Increasing evidence indicates that the expressions of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) undergo a frequent and aberrant change in carcinogenesis and cancer development. But some research was carried out on mRNA-lncRNA signatures for prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis. We aimed to establish an mRNA-lncRNA signature to improve the ability to predict HCC patients' survival. The subjects from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) data set were randomly divided into two parts: training data set (n = 246) and testing data set (n = 124). Using computational methods, we selected eight gene signatures (five mRNAs and three lncRNAs) to generate the risk score model, which were significantly correlated with overall survival of patients with HCC in both training and testing data set. The signature had the ability to classify the patients in training data set into a high-risk group and low-risk group with significantly different overall survival (hazard ratio = 4.157, 95% confidence interval = 2.648-6.526, P
