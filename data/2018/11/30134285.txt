The liver is the most common site of colorectal cancer metastases. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with raltitrexed and oxaliplatin for colorectal liver metastases in a prospective, multicenter, single-arm trial conducted in 12 hospitals from different areas in China. A total of 90 patients with colorectal liver metastases were enrolled and treated by TACE with raltitrexed 4 mg and oxaliplatin 100 mg, followed by embolotherapy with 50 mg oxaliplatin and 5-20 ml lipiodol, administered every 28 days for four cycles. Patients were followed up every 3 months after the treatment and up to 12 months. The primary endpoint was time to progression. For the full analysis set (FAS), the median time to progression and overall survival were 9.1 and 17.8 months, respectively. The disease control rate in FAS was 71 (78.9%). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported for 24 (26.7%) out of all 90 patients. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia, transglutaminase abnormality, and decreased neutrophil were observed in eight (8.9%), six (6.7%), and five (5.6%) patients, respectively. No unexpected adverse events or toxic deaths were observed. TACE with raltitrexed plus oxaliplatin is feasible, clinically beneficial, and well tolerated with low-grade toxicity for colorectal cancer patients with liver metastases.
