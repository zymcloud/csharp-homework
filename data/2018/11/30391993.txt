BACKGROUND Hepatic carcinoma is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-tumor effects of rosmarinic acid (RosA) combined with Adriamycin (ADM) on proliferation and apoptosis of hepatic carcinoma cell lines. MATERIAL AND METHODS Human HepG2 and Bel-7402 cells were treated with RosA and ADM and divided into HepG2 or Bel-7402, 25 μg/ml, 50 μg/m, and 100 μg/ml RosA+0.4 μg/ml ADM groups, respectively. The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to evaluate cell viability. Immunohistochemistry assay was used to examine B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) expression. Cell cycle analysis was used to detect cell cycle distribution. Flow cytometry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated d-UTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay were utilized to evaluate apoptosis. RESULTS RosA combined with ADM damaged cell morphology and decreased cell viability, and significantly decreased S-phase cell numbers compared to the HepG2 or Bel-7402 group (p
