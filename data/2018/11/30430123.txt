Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is a potent nucleotide analogue with high barrier to resistance, which is recommended for multi-drug resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, nephrotoxicity has been reported during TDF treatment, and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), which has comparable efficacy to TDF and improves bone and renal safety, can be used as a replacement strategy. Herein, we describe a clinical case concerning a 60-year-old individual suffering liver cirrhosis and renal dysfunction, and being infected with multidrug-resistant HBV. When failing treatment with TDF, he received TAF as a rescue therapy. TAF effectively inhibited HBV replication without worsening renal function or serum phosphorus abnormality. Furthermore, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurred during TAF treatment despite controlling the viral load. The risk of HCC could not be eliminated and should be monitored during TAF treatment.
