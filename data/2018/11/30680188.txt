The World Cancer Research Fund International has released 32 anticancer effects (ACEs) that targeted every stage of cancer processes. Thus, we designed two formulas of natural food combination Diet I and Diet II, mainly produced by elite crop varieties rich in ACEs with different mixture ratios, and evaluated their cancer preventive effects on N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. After 20 weeks of dietary intervention, Diet I and Diet II reduced incidence, size, and number of hepatic nodules (p < 0.01) and prevented hepatic tumor formation in NDEA-induced hepatocarcinogenesis rats. Low-grade hepatic dysplasia incidence was 20% for Diet II and 40% for Diet I, and apparent hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) rates were both 0, while 90% HCC in control diet treatment group (p < 0.01). Diet I and Diet II ameliorated abnormal liver function enzymes, reduced serum alpha fetal protein, tumor-specific growth factor, dickkopf-related protein 1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 levels, regulated hepatic phase I and II xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, enhanced antioxidant capacity, suppressed NDEA-initiated oxidative DNA damage, and induced apoptosis coupled to down-regulation of proinflammatory, invasion, and angiogenesis markers. Daily intake of combination diet produced from ACEs-rich elite crop varieties can effectively prevent or delay occurrence and development of NDEA-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rats.
