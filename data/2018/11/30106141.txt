The novel neurite outgrowth inhibitor B (Nogo‑B) receptor (NgBR) is specific for Nogo‑B, which is highly expressed in various human organs and cells, including the lung, liver, kidney, smooth muscle cells, blood vessel endothelial cells and inflammatory cells. Previous studies have indicated that NgBR directly interacts with Nogo‑B and is able to independently influence lipid and cholesterol homeostasis, angiogenesis, N‑glycosylation, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, the chemotaxis of endothelial cells and cellular proliferation and apoptosis. These multiple functions and actions of this receptor provide an understanding of the important roles of NgBR in various conditions, including fatty liver, atherosclerosis, intracranial microaneurysms, retinitis pigmentosa and severe neurological impairment. Furthermore, NgBR has been demonstrated to exert protean, multifunctional and enigmatic effects in cancer. The present review summarizes the latest knowledge on the suppressing and activating effects of NgBR, emphasizing its function in cancer. Further basic and medical research on this receptor may provide novel insight into its clinical implications on the prognosis of relevant human cancer types.
