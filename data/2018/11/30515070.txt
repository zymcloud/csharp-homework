Multimodal nanoprobes are highly demanded for biomedical imaging applications to enhance the reliability of the diagnostic results. Among different types of nano-objects, ultrasmall silica gadolinium nanoparticle (SiGdNP) appears as a safe, effective, and versatile platform for this purpose. In this study, a new method to functionalize SiGdNP based on silane chemistry has been reported. Two types of chelating silanes (APTES-DOTAGA and APTES-NODAGA) have been synthesized and grafted on SiGdNP by a simple one-step protocol. This functionalization strategy requires no other reactants or catalyzers and does not compromise the ultrasmall size of the particles. NODAGA-functionalized particle has been labeled with 64Cu isotope and injected intravenously to mice bearing TS/A carcinoma tumor for biodistribution study to demonstrate its potential as a bimodal MRI/PET imaging agent. A fully integrated MRI/PET system was used to simultaneously monitor the distribution of the particle. The results showed that the functionalized particle maintained properties of a renal clearable NP which could rapidly escape through kidneys and had low retention in other organs, especially liver, even though its accumulation in the tumor was modest.
