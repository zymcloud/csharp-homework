Background/aims:The aim of this study was to investigate parameters that predict radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) following stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to identify the clinical significance of RILD.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 117 HCC patients who were treated by SBRT from March 2011 to February 2015. RILD was defined as elevated liver transaminases more than five times the upper normal limit or a worsening of Child-Pugh (CP) score by 2 within 3 months after SBRT. All patients were assessed at 1 month and every 3 months after SBRT.Results:Median follow-up was 22.5 months (range, 3 to 56) after SBRT. RILD was developed in 29 of the 117 patients (24.7%). On univariate analysis, significant predictive factors of RILD were pretreatment CP score (p Conclusion:CP score is a significant factor to predict RILD in patients with chronic liver disease. RILD can be tolerated by patients with a CP score â‰¤ 7. However, careful monitoring of liver function is needed for patients with a CP score 7 after SBRT.
