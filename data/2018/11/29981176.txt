Background:To study the epidemiology of chronic hepatitis C virus infection in Hong Kong and to estimate the service gap for achieving the WHO hepatitis elimination targets of attaining a diagnosis rate of 90%, treatment rate of 80% and 65% reduction in mortality rate by 2030.Methods:From January 2005 to March 2017, patients who were tested positive for anti-HCV were retrospectively retrieved from all public hospitals in Hong Kong. The epidemiological data of 15 participating hospitals were analysed.Results:A total of 11 309 anti-HCV+ patients were identified and the estimated diagnosis rate was 50.9%. Our HCV-infected patients were ageing (median age 59). The all-cause mortality rate increased from 26.2 to 54.8 per 1000 person-years over the last decade. Our estimated treatment rate was 12.4%. Among the treated patients, 93.6% had received pegylated interferon/ribavirin (Peg-IFN/RBV) but only 10.8% had received interferon-free direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). In a cohort of 1533 patients, 39% already had advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. The sustained virological response rate for Peg-IFN/RBV and DAAs were 74.8% and 97.2% respectively. However, more than 70% of patients were not subjected to interferon treatment for various reasons. Patients who achieved SVR were associated with a significantly lower risk of HCC (4.7% vs 9.6%, P = 0.005) and death (1.7% vs 23.8%, P Conclusion:Our diagnosis rate, treatment rate and mortality rate reduction were still low, particularly the Peg-IFN outcomes, making it difficult to meet the WHO hepatitis elimination targets. A more generalized use of DAAs is urgently needed to improve the situation.
