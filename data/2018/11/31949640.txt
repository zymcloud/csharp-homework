The tumor suppressor liver kinase B1 (LKB1), a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed protein kinase, plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. LKB1 has recently been identified in tumorigenesis of several cancers including lung cancer, breast cancer, and pancreatic cancer. However, the role of LKB1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Herein, we examined the expression levels of LKB1 in HCC patients and cell lines by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis. Furthermore, LKB1 protein expression was analyzed in archived paraffin-embedded HCC tissues using immunohistochemistry (IHC), and its association with overall survival was shown in statistical analysis. In vitro assays, including RNAi studies, were performed to further explore the role of LKB1 in tumor progression in HCC cell lines. Our results revealed that the expression of LKB1 was lower in HCC tissue and cell lines than in corresponding adjacent normal tissue and normal human liver cell line (HL7702). Moreover, HCC patients with low LKB1 expression had advanced clinical stage and worse prognosis than those with higher LKB1 expression. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of LKB1 resulted in enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells. Additionally, the expression level of LKB1 positively correlated with E-cadherin levels, wherein siRNA-transfected cells exhibited significantly decreased levels of E-cadherin, while phosphorylated p38 and vimentin levels were enhanced. Inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling was capable of reversing E-cadherin up-regulation and vimentin down-regulation. In all, our results indicate that LKB1 acts as a tumor suppressor gene, which may inhibit EMT through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway involved in HCC progression.
