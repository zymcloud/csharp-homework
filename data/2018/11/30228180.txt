Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are vital players in cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We previously identified an lncRNA, GAS8-AS1, that is located in intron 2 of GAS8 However, its involvement in HCC is still largely unknown. In this study, we report that both GAS8-AS1 and its host gene GAS8 act as HCC tumor suppressors. We found that expression of GAS8-AS1 or GAS8 is significantly decreased in HCC tissues and is associated with a poor prognosis among HCC patients. Interestingly, lncRNA GAS8-AS1 could promote GAS8 transcription. We detected a CpG island in the GAS8 promoter, but lncRNA GAS8-AS1 did not affect DNA methylation at this GAS8 promoter site. Moreover, we identified two GAS8-AS1-interacting proteins, mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1), a histone 3 Lys-4 (H3K4) methyltransferase, and its partner WD-40 repeat protein 5 (WDR5). RNA pulldown, ChIP, and RNA immunoprecipitation assays revealed that GAS8-AS1 is required for maintaining the GAS8 promoter in an open chromatin state by recruiting the MLL1/WDR5 complex and for enhancing RNA polymerase II activity and GAS8 transcription. Of note, GAS8-AS1-dependent GAS8 hyperactivation inhibited malignant transformation of hepatocytes. Our results provide important insights into how lncRNA GAS8-AS1 suppresses HCC development and suggest potential strategies for treating patients with liver cancer.
