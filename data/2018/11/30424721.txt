Background:Earlier diagnosis is beneficial for the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is the most widely used biomarker for HCC, but its sensitivity and specificity are only 60 and 90%, respectively. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance to identify early prognostic biomarkers for HCC, especially a blood-based biomarker as it offers several advantages over tissue-based biomarkers. Trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), a novel secretory protein, was over-expressed in HCC tissues, indicating it might be a blood-based biomarker for HCC. In addition, circulating microRNAs have been investigated as biomarkers for HCC, indicating that miR-7-5p and miR-203a-3p, which are reported or predicted to target TFF3, also hold promise as blood-based biomarkers for HCC.Methods:We enrolled 43 patients who were firstly diagnosed HCC and matched 47 control subjects without HCC. The levels of TFF3, miR-7-5p and miR-203a-3p were tested in the plasma of HCC patients. Moreover, we assayed the correlation of TFF3 with its related micro RNAs, miR-7-5p and miR-203a-3p, and evaluated their predictive powers for HCC.Results:Decrease of TFF3 was associated with increase of miR-203a-3p in the plasma of HCC patients and they displayed potent predictive powers for HCC diagnosis. However, there was no significant change of plasma miR-7-5p between HCC and control group.Conclusion:Decrease of TFF3 correlated with increase of miR-203a-3p in the plasma of HCC patients and they could be additional biomarkers to improve sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of HCC.
