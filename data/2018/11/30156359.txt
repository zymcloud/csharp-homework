Distant metastasis to liver, lung, brain, or bone occurs by circulating tumor cells (CTC). We hypothesized that a subset of CTC had features that are more malignant than tumor cells at the primary site. We established a highly malignant cell line, Panc-1-CTC, derived from the human pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1 using an in vivo selection method. Panc-1-CTC cells showed greater migratory and invasive abilities than its parent cell line in vitro. In addition, Panc-1-CTC cells had a higher tumor-forming ability than parent cells in vivo. To examine whether a difference in malignant phenotypes exists between Panc-1-CTC cells and parent cells, we carried out comprehensive gene expression array analysis. As a result, Panc-1-CTC significantly expressed transforming growth factor beta-induced (TGFBI), an extracellular matrix protein, more abundantly than did parent cells. TGFBI is considered to regulate cell adhesion, but its functions remain unclear. In the present study, knockdown of TGFBI reduced cell migration and invasion abilities, whereas overexpression of TGFBI increased both abilities. Moreover, elevated expression of TGFBI was associated with poor prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer.
