Chromobox (CBX) proteins are important components of epigenetic regulation complexes known to play key roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Little is known about the function of distinct CBXs in HCC. To address this issue, the study investigated the roles of CBXs in the prognosis of HCC using ONCOMINE, UALCAN, Human Protein Atlas, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, c-BioPortal databases. Over expressions of 8 CBXs members were found to be significantly associated with clinical cancer stages and pathological tumor grades in HCC patients. Besides, higher mRNA expressions of CBX1/2/3/6/8 were found to be significantly associated with shorter overall survival (OS) in HCC patients, while higher mRNA expression of CBX7 was associated with favorable OS. Multivariate analysis also showed that high mRNA expressions of CBX1/2/3/6/8 were independent prognostic factors for shorter OS of HCC patients. Moreover, high mutation rate of CBXs (51%) was also observed in HCC patients, and genetic alteration in CBXs was associated with shorter OS and disease-free survival (DFS) in HCC patients. Taken together, these results indicated that CBX1/2/3/6/8 could be prognostic biomarkers for survivals of HCC patients.
