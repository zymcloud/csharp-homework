The cholinergic signaling pathways have been recently implicated in the development of various human cancers. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unclear. In the present study, we reported that α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR), an important member of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, interacts with Protein Phosphatase-1γ (PP1γ) in human Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) tissues. In addition, we found that α7nAChR facilitates the ubiquitination and activation of TRAF6 in a PP1γ-dependent manner in HCC cells. Furthermore, we showed that ligand-bounded α7nAChR induces the degradation of IκBα, leading to resultant phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of NF-κB p65. Accordingly, acetylcholine triggers the expression of critical NF-κB target genes, such as Cyclin D1 and PCNA, as well as the proliferation of HCC cells in a PP1γ- and α7nAChR-dependent manner. Furthermore, we revealed that nicotine-triggered α7nAChR activation promotes oncosphere formation and in vivo tumor growth of HCC cells. Moreover, we showed that the protein levels of both α7nAChR and PP1γ are significantly upregulated in human HCC specimens compared with adjacent non-cancerous ones, and that upregulated expression of the two proteins predict significantly worsened prognosis in HCC patients. These findings together indicate that the cholinergic receptor α7nAChR exerts a facilitating role in HCC development through PP1γ-dependent TRAF6/NF-κB signaling.
