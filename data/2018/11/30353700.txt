Pancreatic metastasis is extremely rare, particularly from small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Studies on the role of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) with liquid-based cytology (LBC) in the diagnosis of metastatic small-cell carcinoma in the pancreas have been rarely conducted. We report herein a case of pancreatic metastasis from SCLC diagnosed using EUS-FNA with LBC (ThinPrep). A 71-year-old man presented with chief complaints of hemoptysis and jaundice over the past 1 month. Lung & pancreas tumors with multiple liver nodules were detected on computed tomography. The aspirated material from the pancreas using EUS-FNA was prepared as a cytologic specimen with ThinPrep method, which revealed scattered and clustered "small blue cells" with scant cytoplasm and stippled chromatin with frequent apoptotic bodies. Immunocytochemical staining of the cellblock material revealed strong positivity for CD56 and thyroid transcription factor-1. Endobronchial biopsy for lung mass revealed nests of small, round, blue tumor cells with hyperchromatic nuclei showing salt and pepper chromatin, scant cytoplasm, and brisk mitotic activity. Therefore, a diagnosis of metastatic small-cell carcinoma to the pancreas with an extensive stage was finally made.
