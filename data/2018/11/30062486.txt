Purpose:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide with limited therapeutic options. Exosome is a member of extracellular vesicles that can be released by different cells in liver to communicate with other cells. HCC development has been characterized by a dysfunction of exosome regulation through many molecular mechanisms. The aim of the present review is to summarize the literature on exosomes in HCC, their roles in hepatocarcinogenesis from liver disease, molecules exchange between tumor cells and neighboring cells, metastasis, chemoresistant, immunosuppression, early diagnose and therapy application.Methods:Literatures about HCC and exosomes from PubMed databases were reviewed in this article.Results:As our review described, exosomes can induce malignant transformation of liver disease via promoting viral diffusion and inflammation, exchange oncogenic factors between tumor cells, sustain tumor growth by neighboring stromal cells, play a important role in metastasis, trigger chemoresistance through transmitting long noncoding RNAs, stimulate immune activation as well as immune evasion, be utilized in biomarkers discovery and therapeutic options.Conclusions:Available data suggested that exosomes may play an important role in HCC development. More studies on the way that exosomes mediated the HCC progression are needed to promote the clinical utilization of exosomes.
