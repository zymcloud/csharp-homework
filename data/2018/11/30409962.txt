BACKGROUND This study investigated the effect of xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) silencing on the growth of hepatoma cells and assessed the mechanisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS XPD gene was silenced by siRNA in hepatoma cells. The experiments were randomly divided into a control group, a liposome control group, a negative control (NC) group, an XPD siRNA group, and an XPD siRNA + P53 inhibitor group. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) was used to detect cell viability 24 h after gene silencing and treatments. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferases (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and flow cytometry were used to detect apoptosis. Invasive ability was detected by Transwell assay. Additionally, the expression of mouse double-minute 2 homolog (Mdm2), mouse double-minute 4 homolog (Mdm4), CyclinD1, P21, Bax, P53, C-sis, and Bcl-2 was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. RESULTS Compared with the NC group, XPD siRNA significantly reduced XPD expression at both mRNA and protein levels. XPD siRNA significantly promoted cell proliferation, reduced apoptosis, and promoted cell invasive ability. Expression of CyclinD1, Bcl-2, and C-sis increased significantly after XPD silencing, while the expression of P21, Mdm2, Mdm4, Bax, and P53 significantly decreased (vs. NC, P
