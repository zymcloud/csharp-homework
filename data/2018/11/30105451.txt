Purpose:We investigated whether external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) could induce compensatory liver hypertrophy in liver cancers and assessed related clinical factors.Methods:A total of 82 consecutive patients receiving EBRT for hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 77) or cholangiocarcinoma (n = 5) from April 2012 to June 2014 were recruited and divided into two subgroups according to tumor location in the right or left lobe. The left lateral and right lobes were considered as unirradiated volumes accordingly. Total liver volume (TLV), nontumor liver volume (NLV), left and right lobe whole volume (LLWV and RLWV, respectively), volume of liver irradiated < 30 Gy), Child-Pugh (CPS) score, future liver remnant (FLR) ratio, and percentage of FLR hypertrophy from baseline (%FLR) were assessed.Results:In the right lobe group, %FLR hypertrophy and LLWV increased significantly at all follow-ups (p Conclusion:Significant compensatory hypertrophy of the liver was observed, with a steady increase of %FLR hypertrophy until the fourth follow-up (median: 396 days). Locally advanced tumors extending across the upper and lower right lobe were a significant factor for compensating hypertrophy after EBRT.
