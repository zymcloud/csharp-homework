The biological functions of high-mobility group (HMG) proteins include regulation of DNA replication, transcription, recombination and repair. According to molecular weight, sequence alignment and DNA structural characteristics, HMG proteins are subdivided into three superfamilies (HMGA, HMGB and HMGN). Recently, HMGB family members (HMGB1, HMGB2, HMGB3, and HMGB4) found to interact with hepatitis B or C virus. Therefore, activation of relevant signaling molecules to regulate transcription of genes related to hepatocellular carcinoma as a mediator of inflammation promoting HCC progression has attracted considerable attentions. This article focuses on the clinical application of the expression of HMGB family members in the process of HCC progression.
