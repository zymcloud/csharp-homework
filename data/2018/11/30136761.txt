Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a malignancy of the liver, has become the second most lethal cause of cancer death globally. Recently, scientists discovered that a splenic erythroblast-like cell induced by the primary tumor, termed Ter-cell, promoted HCC progression and metastasis. These findings shed light on the inhibition of Ter-cell or artemin that can serve as a new therapeutic target for HCC.
