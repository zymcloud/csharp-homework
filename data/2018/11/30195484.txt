Background:Correct staging of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) could help physicians to precisely select treatments for patients, such as surgery, chemotherapy, or their combination. The objective of this study was to explore potential metabolic markers for staging of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:By liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS), the serum metabolic profiles of 60 pathologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients were analyzed using the TNM staging system and Chinese staging system.Results:The serum levels of dihydrocortisol, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC-18:0), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE-16:0), taurine, uric acid, adipic acid, tetracosatetraenoic acid, and L-octanoylcarnitine differed significantly between staging I and non-stage I HCCs (p Conclusion:These dysregulated metabolites in sera of HCC patients potentially could be used as biomarkers for the clinical staging of HCC.
