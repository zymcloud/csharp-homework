Background:The superiority of anatomic resection compared with nonanatomic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma remains a matter of debate. Further, the technique for anatomic resection (dye injection) is difficult to reproduce. Anatomic resection using a compression technique is an easy and reversible procedure based on liver discoloration after ultrasound-guided compression of the tumor-feeding portal tributaries. We compared the oncologic efficacy of compression technique anatomic resection with that of nonanatomic resection.Methods:Among patients with resected hepatocellular carcinoma, patients who underwent compression technique anatomic resection were matched 1-to-2 with nonanatomic resection cases based on the Child-Pugh class, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma number (1/>1), and hepatocellular carcinoma size (>30, 30-50, and >50 mm). The exclusion criteria were nonanatomic resection because of severe cirrhosis, major hepatectomy, 90-day mortality (0 compression technique anatomic resection), non-cancer-related death, and follow-up Results:All patients were Child-Pugh A, and 53% were cirrhotic. Liver function tests and signs of portal hypertension were similar between the groups. There was 1 hepatocellular carcinoma in 81% of the patients, and the hepatocellular carcinoma was â‰¥30 mm in 68%. Patients undergoing anatomic resection with compression had better 5-year survival (77% vs 60%; risk ratio = 0.423; P = .032; multivariable analysis), less local recurrences (4% vs 20%; P = .012), and better 2-year local recurrence-free survival (94% vs 78%; P = .012). Nonlocal recurrence-free survival was similar between the groups. The compression technique anatomic resection group more often had repeat radical treatment for recurrence (68% vs 28%; P = .0004) and had better 3-year survival after recurrence (65% vs 42%; P = .043).Conclusion:Compression technique anatomic resection appears to provide a more complete removal of the hepatocellular carcinoma-bearing portal territory. Local disease control and survival are better with compression technique anatomic resection than with nonanatomic resection.
