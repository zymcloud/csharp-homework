Objective:To investigate the role of GLI-1 signaling pathway on TGF-β1 induced proliferation and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line HepG2.Materials and methods:Cultured HepG2 cells were treated with various concentration of TGF-β1 for 24 h and the effect of TGF-β1 on invasion ability of HepG2 was detected with transwell assay. Next, cultured HepG2 cells were treated with various concentration of TGF-β1 for 12, 24 and 48 h; then, the proliferation rate was detected by MTT. The mRNA and protein expression levels of GLI-1 were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. Furthermore, GLI-1 siRNA was used to investigate the role of GLI-1 on TGF-β1 induced proliferation and invasion.Results:The results demonstrated that TGF-β1 could promote HepG2 cells proliferation and invasion. The mRNA and protein level of GLI-1 were upregulated by TGF-β1 treatment, whereas GLI-1 siRNA could block these processes.Conclusions:TGF-β1 promotes HCC cell line HepG2 proliferation and invasion by activating GLI-1 signaling pathway.
