Metastases to the skull or upper cervical spine from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are very rare. We herein report a unique case of two-site surgery for both skull and upper cervical spine metastases from HCC. The patient was a 64-year-old man with cervical pain. Computed tomography (CT) revealed osteolytic change related to metastatic cervical spine and occipital bone tumors. Two-stage surgery involving posterior occipitocervical fusion and occipital bone tumor resection was performed. The patient's pain decreased in severity, and postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy could be conducted. The postoperative course was favorable, and the patient exhibited improvement in his activities of daily living. Neither cervical spine X-ray examination nor CT showed any instrumentation failure, such as screw loosening, before the patient died of liver failure 13 months after surgery. Patients with both skull and upper cervical spine metastases from liver cancer may have a markedly unfavorable prognosis. Even in these patients, however, surgery as an aggressive palliative treatment may prolong the survival period or maintain the quality of life as long as the patient's general condition permits.
