A new series of Schiff bases containing benzіmidazole moiety 11-17 were synthesized by the reaction of 4-(1H-benzо[d]іmіdazоl-2-yl)anіline (1) with different aromatic aldehydes (4-10) via conventional heating and microwave irradiation methods. The structures of the novel Schiff bases were characterized by using different spectral data. Also, metal complexes 18-21 of compound 13 were synthesized, and their structure was confirmed by spectral measurements (IR, NMR, UV), molar conductivity, magnetic susceptibility and thermo-gravimetric analysis. The novel synthesized ligand 13 and its complexes 18-21 were tested for their in vitro antitumor activities towards breast, liver and lung cancer cell lines. Also, the acute toxicity of the prepared compounds 13 and 18-21 was determined in vivo. The results showed that the newly synthesized compounds 13 and 18-21 exhibited a significant activity against cancer, especially for complex 21, compared to standard drug doxorubicin. The molecular docking of complexes 20 and 21 has been also studied as Aurora kinase inhibitors.
