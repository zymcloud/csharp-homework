Backgrounds/aims:The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score has been validated as a predictor of disease-free survival and overall survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of this study was to assess the ALBI score as a risk factor for early recurrence (ER) after curative liver resection in HCC.Methods:Patients who underwent liver resection with curative intent for HCC without previous treatment between January 2004 and December 2014 were included in this retrospective study. The utility of the ALBI score in predicting ER and late recurrence (LR) was evaluated.Results:A total of 465 HCC patients were enrolled; multivariate analysis identified ALBI grade ≥2 (p=0.003) as a risk factor for ER, in addition to hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive status (p<0.001), tumor size ≥3.5cm (p≤0.001), lymph-vascular invasion (p=0.001), and the presence of satellite lesions (p=0.009). In subgroup analysis for ALBI grade 1, Model for End-stage Liver Disease score >9 (p=0.046), HBsAg positive status (p=0.004), tumor size ≥3.5 cm (p<0.001), lymph-vascular invasion (p=0.001), presence of satellite lesions (p=0.002), and poor tumor differentiation (p=0.007) were independent risk factors for ER; however, in subgroup analysis for ALBI grade 2, no significant associations with ER were found. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that long-term survival in HCC with ER was significantly shorter than in patients with LR.Conclusions:The ALBI score was a preoperative risk factor for ER and may be useful in determining appropriate management according to liver function when recurrence develops.
