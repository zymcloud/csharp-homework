Objective::To investigate the clinical value of fucosylated GP73 (Fuc-GP73) levels for differential diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma from other liver diseases.Methods::Serum specimens were collected from 50 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 60 patients with other digestive system diseases (ODSD), and 40 normal controls. Lectin affinity chromatography column combining with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the ELISA index was utilized to measure the level of Fuc-GP73. By receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis its sensitivity and specificity were used to evaluate the diagnostic significance of Fuc-GP73 in hepatocellular carcinoma.Results::The median serum Fuc-GP73 level of hepatocellular carcinoma (20.4 μg/L) was much higher than that of ODSD patients (1.8 μg/L) and the normal controls group (0.3 μg/L), significantly ( P 0.05); however, it was related to tumor, node, metastasis stage and lymph node metastasis ( P Conclusion::Fuc-GP73 can act as a superior glycobiomarker for the differential diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma; its combined detection with other biomarkers can improve diagnostic accuracy.
