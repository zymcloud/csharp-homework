Successful immunogene therapy depends not only on the therapeutic gene but also on the gene delivery vector. In this study, we synthesized a novel copolymer consisting of low-molecular-weight polyethylenimine (PEI) cross-linked by myo-inositol (INO) and conjugated with a galactose-grafted PEG chain, named LA-PegPI. We characterized the chemical structure and molecular weight of the copolymer and particle properties of LA-PegPI/pDNA. Furthermore, we showed that LA-PegPI/pDNA polyplexes possessed excellent stability in physiological salt solution, low cytotoxicity, and high transfection efficiency in the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR)-positive liver cells in vitro. Importantly, we also showed that through intraperitoneal injection of LA-PegPI/pDNA nanoparticles, the reporter gene was forcefully expressed in the liver hepatocytes of mice. Finally, we documented that intraperitoneal injection of LA-PegPI/pIL15 nanoparticles effectively suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival time of tumor-bearing mice via activation of CD8+ T cells and NK cells and upregulation of the cytokines IFN-Î³, TNF, and IL12 in an orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma mouse model. Interestingly, LA-PegPI/pluc nanoparticles could effectively stimulate the proliferation of NK cells and inhibit tumor growth in this model. In summary, LA-PegPI is a useful gene vector for immunogene therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma, and its potential for clinical application warrants further study.
