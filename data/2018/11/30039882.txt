Acute liver injury (ALI) induced by acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the most common cause of drug-induced liver injury. Saponins from Platycodon grandiflorum (PGSs) ameliorate alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity and enhance human lung carcinoma cell death via AMPK signaling pathway. However, whether PGS could protect from APAP-induced ALI through AMPK activation and its downstream signals is still poorly elucidated. This work investigated the protective effect and the underlying mechanisms of PGS against APAP-induced liver toxicity in mouse. PGS was administered at 15 or 30 mg/kg i.g./day for 1 week before a single injection of APAP (250 mg/kg, i.p.) 1 hr after last treatment of PGS. Serum alanine/aspartate aminotransferases, liver tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β levels, liver malondialdehyde formation, liver glutathione depletion, cytochrome P450 E1, and 4-hydroxynonenal levels were measured to demonstrate the protective efficacy of PGS against APAP-induced ALI. Liver histological observation provided further evidence on PGS's protective effects. PGS treatment altered the phosphorylation of AMPK and PI3K/Akt, as well as the downstream signals including Bcl-2 family, caspase, and NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, we demonstrate that PGS exhibits a significant liver protection against APAP-induced ALI, mainly through NF-κB and AMPK/PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.
