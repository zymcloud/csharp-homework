Background:Hepatic percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) is usually performed in patients under conscious sedation. Nonetheless, many patients reported pain during the procedure. The current study investigated the safety and effectiveness of analgesia given at personalized dosage during the MWA procedure.Methods:A total of 100 patients with hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) were included in this study. These patients underwent CT-guided percutaneous MWA between February and October 2017. Patients were randomized into two groups: Experimental group (n = 50) and Control group (n = 50). Patients in the Control group were given 5 mg of morphine intravenously, followed by 10 mg of morphine injected subcutaneously 30 min before surgery. Patients in the Experimental group were given a personalized dosage of morphine during the procedure when the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was â‰¥4. Other clinical and treatment parameters were also analysed.Results:A significantly less amount of morphine (p Conclusion:The administration of personalized dosage of morphine to HCC patients undergoing percutaneous MWA is an effective and safe procedure for pain control.
