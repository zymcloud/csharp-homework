Colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (CRNDE) is a significantly upregulated long noncoding RNA in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CRNDE could promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while its molecular mechanisms were still largely unclear. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of CRNDE. CRNDE was significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. In vitro, we revealed that knockdown of CRNDE inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and cell invasion capacities in HCC. Animal studies indicated that CRNDE knockdown represses both growth and metastasis of HCC tumors in vivo. Moreover, knockdown of CRNDE suppressed the cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process by increasing the expression of E-cadherin and ZO-1, whereas, decreasing the expression of N-cadherin, slug, twist, and vimentin in HCC cells. We also revealed that knockdown of CRNDE suppressed the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in HCC. Thus, CRNDE could modulate EMT of HCC cells and knockdown of CRNDE impaired the mesenchymal properties. CRNDE increased invasion of HCC cells might be through activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
