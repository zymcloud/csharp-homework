Background:Active, ligand-mediated, targeting of functionalized liposomes to folate receptors (FRs) overexpressed on cancer cells could potentially improve drug delivery and specificity. Studies on folate-targeting liposomes (FTLs) have, however, yielded varying results and generally fail to display a clear benefit of FR targeting.Method:Tumor accumulating potential of FTLs and NTLs were investigated in a FR overex-pressing xenograft model by positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging.Results:Tumors displayed significantly lower activity of FTLs than NTLs. Furthermore, FTLs displayed worse circulating properties and increased liver-accumulation than NTLs.Conclusion:This study underlines that long-circulating properties of liposomes must be achieved to take advantage of EPR-dependent tumor accumulation which may be lost by functionalization. FR-functionalization negatively affected both tumor accumulation and circulation properties.
