Background:Liver transplantation (LT) has become established therapy for end-stage liver disease and small-cell hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), relying mainly on living donor LT (LDLT) in Taiwan. The cost of LDLT varies in different countries depending on the insurance system, the costs of the facility, and staff. In this study we aimed to investigate cost outcomes and determinants of LDLT in Taiwan.Methods:From January 2014 to December 2015, 184 LDLT patients were enrolled in a study performed at the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Patients' transplantation costs were defined as expense from immediately after surgery to discharge during hospitalization for LDLT. Antiviral therapy and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) for prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) were included, but direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for hepatitis C (HCV) was excluded.Results:The median total, intensive care unit (ICU), and ward costs of LT were US$64,250, $43,357, and $16,138 (currency ratio 1:30), respectively. HBV significantly increased the total cost of LT, followed by postoperative reintubation and bile duct complications.Conclusion:The charges associated with anti-HBV viral therapy and HBIG increase the cost of LDLT. Disease severity of liver cirrhosis showed less importance in predicting cost. Postoperative complications such as reintubation or bile duct complications should be avoided to reduce the cost of LT.
