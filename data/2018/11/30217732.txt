Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and the fifth most common cancer worldwide. Most of these patients are seen with advanced disease at the time of presentation. In spite of its high prevalence, there are not many therapeutic options available for patients with advanced-stage HCC. There is an urgent need for improving early detection and prognostication of patients with HCC. In addition, the development of new therapies targeting specific pathways involved in the pathogenesis of HCC should be a major goal for future research, with the objective of improving outcomes of patients with HCC. Biomarkers represent a relatively easy and noninvasive way to detect and estimate disease prognosis. In spite of the numerous efforts to find molecules as possible biomarkers, there is not a single ideal marker in HCC. Many new findings have shown promising results both in diagnosing and treating HCC. In this review, we summarized the most recent and relevant biomarkers in HCC.
