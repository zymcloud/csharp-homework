Hepatic fibrosis is the process of fiber formation and inflammation caused by chronic liver injury, and is a common pathological process of hepatic cirrhosis and hepatic carcinoma. The prevention and treatment of liver fibrosis can effectively control the incidence of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer, but its pathogenesis remains unclear. Endoplasmic reticulum stress is a kind of subcellular organelle pathological process that causes the disruption of ion balance in endoplasmic reticulum or the obstacle of protein processing and transportation. In recent years, more and more studies have shown that endoplasmic reticulum stress is involved in the occurrence, development and reversal of liver fibrosis. This article reviews the regulatory role of endoplasmic reticulum stress in liver fibrosis.
