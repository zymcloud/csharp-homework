Purpose:To determine the expression and function of Delta/Notch-like EGF-related receptor (DNER) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The expression of DNER in 84 HCC tissue samples and matched adjacent noncancerous specimens, as well as HCC cells, were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. Survival analysis was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier method. For experiments in vitro, cell viability was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 Assay and Colony Formation Assay. Furthermore, cell invasion and migration assays were performed with Transwell Assay.Results:The results showed that DNER was overexpressed in the tissues and cell lines of HCC (all, p Conclusions:Taken together, DNER could promote proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells by regulating the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway, and it might act as a potential prognostic biomarker for HCC.
