Background/objective:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the leading risk factor for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The objective of this investigation was to assess the association between "Killer Cell Immunoglobulin-Like Receptor" (KIR) gene frequencies and chronic HBV infection.Methods:Chronic HBV carriers and healthy patients were selected for this study. The viral load for HBV were performed, and SSP-PCR was used to characterize the frequencies of KIR genes.Results:The study suggested that inhibitory genes KIR2DL2 (crude OR = 2.82; p Conclusion:Our data showed evidence of a correlation between the risk of developing chronic HBV infection and certain KIR gene frequencies and also show that KIR3DL1, KIR3DL2, KIR2DS1 might confer a protective status against chronic HBV infection.
