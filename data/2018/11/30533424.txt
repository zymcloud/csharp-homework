Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancy tumors with insidious onset, rapid development and metastasis, and poor prognosis. Therefore, it is necessary to understand molecular mechanisms of HCC and identify clinically useful biomarkers for it. This study aimed to investigate the role of retinoblastoma binding protein 5 (RBBP5) in HCC. The expression level of RBBP5 was examined by immunohistochemistry and western blot. The effect of RBBP5 on cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis, and drug sensitivity was analyzed. RBBP5 was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and cells. High RBBP5 expression was significantly associated with elevated level of AFP, advanced TNM stage, high Ki-67 expression, larger tumor size, and poor prognosis. Knockdown of RBBP5 significantly inhibited proliferation of HCC cells through cell cycle arrest. In addition, inhibition of RBBP5 increased the sensitivity of HCC cells to doxorubicin. In conclusion, our findings suggest that RBBP5 plays an important role in the progression of HCC and may serve as a novel biomarker and potential therapeutic target for HCC.
