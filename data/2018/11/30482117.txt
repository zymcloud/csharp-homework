CME: Paraneoplastic Endocrine Syndromes Abstract. Paraneoplastic endocrine syndromes are caused by ectopic hormone production by malignant tumor cells. Knowledge of paraneoplastic endocrine syndromes may allow a timely diagnosis of the underlying cancer at a treatable stage and, on the other hand, appropriate treatment of the endocrine manifestations reduces morbidity and mortality of the affected patients. The most common endocrine syndromes are paraneoplastic hypercalcaemia, caused by the secretion of PTHrP, and hyponatremia, caused by the inadequate secretion of ADH. Although there may be clinical symptoms like fatigue, nausea/vomiting and renal insufficiency for hypercalcaemia and gait disturbances and mental alterations for hyponatremia, the diagnosis must be confirmed by laboratory testing and prompt the search for associated tumors.
