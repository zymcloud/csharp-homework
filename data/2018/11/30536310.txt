Objective:To investigate the regulating roles of miR-199b in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:The expression of miR-199b of 45 human HCC tissues and the corresponding para-cancerous tissue samples were detected by quantitative Real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Western blot was employed to investigate the level of JAG1. Transwell assay was used to monitor the ability of cell migration and invasion. Cell proliferation was tested by CCK-8 assay and luciferase reporter assay was done to clarify whether JAG1 was a target of mir-199b.Results:miR-199b expression level was decreased in 45 paired tumor tissues in contrast with the corresponding para-carcinoma tissues. The expression level of miR-199b was closely associated with TNM stage, tumor size, and 5-year overall survival. Transwell assay result showed that miR-199b inhibited HCC cell migration and invasion. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) results demonstrated that miR-199b could suppress HCC cell proliferation. Luciferase reporter assay suggested that Jagged1 (JAG1) was a direct target of miR-199b in HCC cells. miR-199b could negatively regulate JAG1 expression by targeting JAG1.Conclusions:miR-199b exerted tumor suppressive functions in HCC by targeting JAG1, and it may be a potential target treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma.
