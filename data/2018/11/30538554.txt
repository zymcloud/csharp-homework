Background:More than 500,000 people suffered from hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) annually and the relative incidence to mortality rate indicates its unfavorable prognosis. Several studies have proved that heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is indirectly engaged in the invasion and the metastasis of some types of malignancies, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer. The role of HO-1 in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC is still not clarified.Materials and methods:The Western blot, doubling time, cell cycle analysis, migration assay, invasion assay, gene transfection, xenograft animal model, immunohistochemistry staining, and clinical validation study were applied in this study.Results:HO-1 overexpression not only decreased the growth but also inhibited the migration and invasion in human HBV-HCC cells (Hep-3B vs PLC/PRF/5). The inhibitory effect on growth, migration, and invasion is further demonstrated by the overexpression of HO-1 in Hep-3B cell by transfection study. Furthermore, HO-1 decreasing the growth of HBV-HCC was confirmed in animal study. The clinical validation illustrated that higher HO1 expression was also associated with favorable disease-free survival of HBV-HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy.Conclusions:We identified HO-1 as a favorable prognostic factor for HBV-HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy.
