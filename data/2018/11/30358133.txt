Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) fails to demonstrate the predictive value for early detection pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Glypican-1 (GPC1+) exosomes may serve as a noninvasive diagnostic tool to detect early stages of PDAC. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the serum GPC1 levels and determine whether serum GPC1 serves as a novel biomarker for PDAC patients. Blood samples were collected from 156 patients with PDAC, 199 non-cancer controls, and 240 patients with other cancers. Serological levels of GPC1 were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Finally, a 5-year follow-up was monitored to evaluate the correlation between serum GPC1 levels and overall survival in 156 patients with PDAC. The results suggested that levels of serum GPC1 and CA19-9 were higher in PDAC patients than that of controls (P
