Background:Laparoscopy for colorectal cancer treatment is widely accepted. However, there is no consensus as to whether or not laparoscopy can be considered the preferred treatment strategy in octogenarian and nonagenarian patients with colon cancer. The aim of this study was to compare operative and postoperative outcomes of laparoscopic right colectomy between oldest-old (≥80 years) and younger (<80 years) patients with colon cancer.Methods:The study population was sampled from the CLIMHET Study Group cohort. Between January 2005 and December 2015, data were retrieved for all patients who had undergone elective laparoscopic right colectomy for colon cancer in five University Hospital centers in France (CHU of Clermont-Ferrand, Hôpital Civil of Strasbourg-IRCAD, Hôpital Henri-Mondor of Créteil, Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou of Paris, and CHRU of Tours).Results:Overall, 473 cancer patients were selected and analyzed. There were 156 oldest-old patients (median age: 84.1 years, range: 80-96) and 317 younger patients (median age: 67 years, range: 25-79). After adjusting based on propensity score on gender, obesity, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, smoking, arteriopathy, coronaropathy, comorbidity, and American Joint Committee on Cancer staging, no significant difference was found in operative and postoperative outcomes, except for time to resume a regular diet (3.6 days versus 3.0 days, P = .008) and length of hospital stay (12.1 days versus 9.1 days, P = .03), which were longer for oldest-old patients. Overall and disease-free survival rates were also equivalent between groups.Conclusion:These findings support that laparoscopic right colectomy can be safely performed in cancer patients aged 80 and older, and its outcomes are similar in oldest-old and younger patients.
