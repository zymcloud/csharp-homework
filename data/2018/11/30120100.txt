Objective: To explore whether aspirin (ASA) enhances the sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) side population (SP) cells to doxorubicin (Doxo) via miR-491/ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2).Methods: Non-SP and SP cells were isolated from MHCC-97L cell line using flow cytometry analysis and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Colony formation assay was performed to determine the colony-formation ability of cells. Cell viability of SP cells was determined with the MTT assay. Luciferase reporter assay was applied in confirming the binding between miR-491 and ABCG2.Results: Although the Doxo treatment lowered the colony-formation ability of both non-SP and SP cells, the colony-formation ability of SP cells was 2-fold higher than that of non-SP cells (P<0.05). Doxo slightly inhibited the cell viability of SP cells in a concentration-dependent manner; the addition of ASA dramatically enhanced the inhibitory effect of Doxo on SP cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner (P<0.05). Compared with non-SP cells, the miR-491 expression was significantly decreased in SP cells, which was significantly reversed by ASA (P<0.05). miR-491 directly controlled the ABCG2 expression. In the presence of Doxo, miR-491 inhibitor reduced the inhibitory effect of ASA on the cell viability of SP cells, which was significantly reversed by knockdown of ABCG2 (P<0.05).Conclusion: ASA enhanced the sensitivity of SP cells to Doxo via regulating the miR-491/ABCG2 signaling pathway.
