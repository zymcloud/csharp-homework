Purpose:The aromatase inhibitor (AI) letrozole is a first-line drug in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Adherence to AI therapy, including letrozole, remains problematic due to the development of debilitating AI-induced arthralgia. Letrozole is metabolized in the liver by CYP2A6. It remains unknown if plasma letrozole levels or CYP2A6 genetic variation is associated with the development of arthralgia.Methods:We enrolled 126 female breast cancer patients initiated on letrozole therapy and prospectively collected blood samples at baseline and two follow-up time points to determine letrozole plasma concentrations and CYP2A6 genotype. At each visit, participants completed two validated questionnaires to assess the severity of arthralgia symptoms.Results:More than half (55%) of patients experienced a significant increase in their arthralgia symptoms after initiation of treatment. The clinical variables of body mass index (P = 0.0003) and age (P = 0.0430) were negatively and positively associated with plasma letrozole concentrations, respectively. CYP2A6 genotype was significantly associated with letrozole levels (P < 0.0001), and increased plasma letrozole levels were observed in patients with CYP2A6 reduced-function genotypes. Plasma levels of letrozole and CYP2A6 genotype were not significantly associated with a change in pain score from baseline.Conclusions:CYP2A6 genotype was a significant predictor of letrozole plasma levels, but was not associated with the development of arthralgia.
