To investigate the effects of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with precise radiation therapy (RT) on p53 gene expression and prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 80 patients with unresectable HCC treated in the First People's Hospital of Qinhuangdao from March 2009 to March 2015 were randomly divided into TACE group (n=40) and TACE + RT group (n=40). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the levels of p53 in both groups before and after treatment. The biochemical indexes of liver function [α-fetoprotein (AFP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT)] were detected. Moreover, adverse reactions were compared between the two groups of patients, the short-term therapeutic effect was evaluated, and effects of two treatment methods on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients were detected. There were no statistically significant differences in clinical data between the two groups of patients (P>0.05). The p53 protein levels were significantly downregulated in both treatment methods, and it was decreased more significantly in TACE + RT group than that in TACE group (P
