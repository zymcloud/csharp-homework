Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, and metastasis of HCC is the leading cause of poor prognosis. Among all the extrahepatic metastases, lymph node metastasis (LNM) is common, second only to lung metastasis. However, the pathogenesis of HCC LNM remains largely unknown.Methods:Microarray was performed to investigate the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiles in serum samples from HCC LNM patients (N = 4) and HCC non-LNM controls (N = 5). Subsequently, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was applied to validate the expression levels of randomly selected differential lncRNAs and mRNAs. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were employed to explore the potential functions of differentially expressed mRNAs. Co-expression networks were further constructed to elucidate the interactions of the differential genes and to speculate on the potential functions of the dominant lncRNAs. In this research, we attempted to illuminate the correlations between lncRNA and HCC LNM.Results:Compared with the non-LNM group, a total of 234 lncRNAs and 58 mRNAs were obtained as significantly dysregulated genes in LNM group (p Conclusion:This study first revealed the expression profiles and potential functions of dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs in HCC LNM, which may provide novel clues for further studies on HCC LNM.
