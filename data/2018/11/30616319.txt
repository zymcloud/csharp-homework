Objective: To investigates the role of piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNA) in the occurrence and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: Second-generation small RNA sequencing was performed on cancer and paracancerous tissues, metastatic and non-metastatic liver cancer tissues of patients with liver cancer, and the sequencing data were filtered out for the common RNA sequences to be repeated. The piRNA predictor was used to forecast the possible new piRNA merged with the downloaded known piRNA to screen out distinction. A miRanda algorithm was used to predict the corresponding target genes and functional enrichment analysis. piRNA was selected for experimental functional (migration) analysis. An independent t-test was used to compare means between the two groups. Results: 66 772 piRNAs (known 149) were obtained by sequencing. 241 piRNAs were found in cancer and paracancerous tissues, and 1 634 piRNAs were found in metastatic and non-metastatic tumors. Analysis of the GO and KEGG pathways of the target genes of differential piRNAs revealed that they were mainly involved in cell adhesion. An experimental functional analysis was performed on the selected Pirna (PIR1/97), which showed that it promoted the migration of hepatoma cells (LM3: t = 8.829, P < 0.05; PLC: t = 7.318, P < 0.05). Conclusion: The expression levels of piRNA in hepatocellular carcinoma patients with cancer and paracancerous tissues, metastasis and non-metastatic liver cancer tissues are different and it could be entailed in the metastasis process of hepatocellular carcinoma. Hence, experimental functional analysis is required for research and experimental confirmation.
