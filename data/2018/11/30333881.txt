Interleukin (IL)-20 is a member of the IL-10 family of cytokines, which has been reported to participate in autoimmune inflammatory diseases. However, the potential role of IL-20 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression has not yet been investigated. In the present study, it was observed that IL-20 mRNA and protein levels were markedly increased in the HCC tissues examined via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining. In addition, IL-20 expression was significantly associated with tumor size, metastasis, TNM stage and poor prognosis in patients with HCC. Mouse recombinant IL-20 (mIL-20) enhanced liver cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro, while the anti-IL-20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) attenuated the effect of mIL-20, inhibiting cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and suppressing cell growth in vitro and in vivo. This was detected by Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, Transwell assays and a xenograft tumor nude mouse model. Western blotting revealed that IL-20 promoted HCC progression through inducing transforming growth factor-Î² and matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression and enhancing the phosphorylation of Jun N-terminal kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. The results of the present study indicated that IL-20 promotes HCC development. In addition, anti-IL-20 mAb may attenuate the effect of IL-20 and suppress liver tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo, indicating that anti-IL-20 mAbs may potentially serve as effective therapeutic agents for HCC.
