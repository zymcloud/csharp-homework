We intended to evaluate miR-490-5p expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and detect the potential targets of miR-490-5p. In vitro experiments were conducted to further investigate the biological function of miR-490-5p on HCC cell metastasis. We investigated the abnormally expressed miRNAs in HCC tissues, and the miR-490-5p expression level was detected by qRT-PCR. E2F2 and ECT2 were proved to be the potential targets of miR-490-5p by luciferase reporter assay. The expression levels of E2F2 and ECT2 were determined using Western blot. Transwell assay was used to analyse the impact of miR-490-5p on metastasis of HCC cells. Four high-expressed miRNAs, and seven low-expressed miRNAs, including miR-490-5p, were detected in HCC tissues. The expression level of miR-490-5p was connected with the tumor size, tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, and survival ratio of HCC patients. E2F2 and ECT2 were the targets of miR-490-5p, and miR-490-5p inhibited HCC cell metastasis through down-regulating the expressions of E2F2 and ECT2. The over-expressed miR-490-5p could restrain the metastasis of HCC cells by down-regulating E2F2 and ECT2 expression levels.
