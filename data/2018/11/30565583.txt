This is the case report of a patient with right-sided, RAS and BRAF wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer, with borderline/potentially resectable liver-limited disease. Following neoadjuvant treatment with FOLFOX plus bevacizumab and radical resection, an early intra-hepatic disease relapse was observed and deemed as potentially resectable. Therefore, treatment with FOLFIRI plus aflibercept was started: a major partial response and radical re-resection were achieved. Following unresectable disease relapse, second-line treatment with FOLFIRI aflibercept was resumed and achieved again a partial response that is still ongoing after more than 9 months. This case report highlights how treatment goals (potentially curative resection vs palliation), molecular status and primary tumor location influence treatment strategies in order to maximize patients' outcomes.
