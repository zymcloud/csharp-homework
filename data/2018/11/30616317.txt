Objective: To analyze the prognostic factors on multidisciplinary team patients for diagnosis, and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: This retrospective study enrolled 132 HBsAg positive patients with HCC. MDT diagnostic approach was conducted at our hospital between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2015, and all patients were followed up to 31 December 2017. Groups were arranged according to variables such as Barcelona stage, MDT compliance, and multidisciplinary combination therapy. TTP and OS were statistically analyzed. Results: The survival of the MDT compliance group was better than the non-compliance group. The difference in survival curves was statistically significant (χ(2) = 4.062, P < 0.05). The 1- and 2-year survival rates of the former group were 72.0%, 60.9%, and the latter was 64.3%, 40.3%. The survival of the combined treatment group was better than the non-combination group. The survival curves of the two groups were statistically significant (χ(2) = 9.502, P < 0.05), and they were independent influencing factors of survival (HR = 0.451, 95% CI, 0.210-0.968). The 1- and 2-year survival rates of the former group were 82.2% and 75.4%, and the latter was 63.1% and 44.6%. The median survival time of the follow-up group was 29.4 months, and the non-compliance and the uncombined group were 17.0 months. The difference was statistically significant (χ(2) = 13.336, P < 0.001). The median tumor progression time was 15.7 months in the combination group and 10.1 months in the non-compliance group (χ(2) = 7.263, P < 0.05). Conclusion: An advanced MDT compliance with implementation of multidisciplinary combination therapy may help to improve the prognosis of MDT patients with liver cancer.
