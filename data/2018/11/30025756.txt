Background:Hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) has been revealed as an important marker of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection recently. We aimed to evaluate the HBcrAg assay for indication of HBV loads in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and assess the association between HBcrAg/cccDNA and HCC recurrence.Methods:HBcrAg was measured by chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay. Intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) was measured by real-time PCR with TaqMan fluorescent probes based on liver specimens from 89 HCC patients.Results:HBcrAg correlated positively with HBV DNA irrespective of HBeAg status. Both HBcrAg and HBV DNA were associated with cccDNA in patients with elevated serum HBV DNA (>4 log IU/mL). In patients with non-elevated HBV DNA (â‰¤4 log IU/mL), no relationship between HBV DNA and cccDNA was observed, but we still documented a modest correlation between HBcrAg and cccDNA. Finally, the recurrence-free survival rates were significantly lower in HCC patients with high intrahepatic cccDNA and serum HBcrAg levels than those with low cccDNA/HBcrAg levels (p = 0.035, p = 0.003 respectively).Conclusions:HBcrAg not only can serve as a biomarker to assess HBV loads in patients as well as provide a good method for monitoring cccDNA in HCC, but also can be used as a good prognostic predictor for HCC patients.
