The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of hepatectomy plus adjuvant transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with multicentric occurrence (MO) or intrahepatic metastases (IM) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with multifocal HCC who underwent hepatic resection only (HR) or HR plus adjuvant TACE (HRT) between January 2005 and December 2015 were divided into MO or IM groups. The patient characteristics and outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 103 patients (59 and 44 in the MO and IM groups, respectively) were included in the analysis. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 92.7, 76.8 and 56.8% for the MO group, and 93.1, 41.6 and 18.5% for the IM group, respectively (OS, P=0.001), and the 1-, 3- and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 84.1, 44.6 and 40.5% for the MO group and 51.7, 22.5 and 15.0% for the IM group, respectively (DFS, P
