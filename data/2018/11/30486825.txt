Background:The aim of this study was to propose a prognostic scoring system based on preoperative serum apolipoprotein A-1 and C-reactive protein (ApoA-1 and CRP, AC score) levels and to evaluate the prognostic value of these markers in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:In all, 539 consecutive cases diagnosed with HCC from 2009 to 2012 at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center were analysed. The characteristics and levels of pretreatment lipids (ApoA-1, apolipoprotein B (Apo-B), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs)) and CRP were reviewed and determined by univariate and multivariate Cox hazard models. Then, the AC score was proposed, which combines two independent risk factors (ApoA-1 and CRP).Results:The optimal cut-off points in our study were determined according to established reference ranges. Patients with decreased ApoA-1 levels (Conclusions:The AC score is a significant valuable predictor of OS and DFS and could more accurately differentiate the prognosis of HCC patients. As this study is a retrospective analysis, the value of the AC score should be validated in large prospective trials.
