Background:Although direct-acting antiviral (DAA) developments make most of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection curable, some HCV patients develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative treatment of HCV. There is much dispute whether the rapid clearance of the virus enhances the HCC development. In advance of the dispute, we should make clear the characteristics of the patients with very early occurrence and recurrence of HCC after DAA therapy because it was still unclear.Methods:We prospectively followed consecutive patients with HCV who had received sofosbuvir (SOF)-based treatment at two hospitals. The baseline characteristics, laboratory data, and liver imaging findings were acquired. We evaluated the rate of HCC occurrence and recurrence within 1-year after DAA therapy and analyzed the associated factors of very early HCC occurrence and recurrence right after SOF therapy.Results:Between July 2013 and October 2016, we studied two cohorts with HCV infection that received SOF therapy. 402 and 462 patients in Yamanashi Central Hospital and Chiba University Hospital were included in this analysis, respectively. The SVR12 rates of genotypes 1 and 2 were 98.9% (561/567) and 96.0% (285/297), respectively. 41 patients developed HCC within 1 year after SOF therapy. The cumulative HCC occurrence and recurrence rate after SOF therapy was 5.0%. The common associated factor of 1-year HCC occurrence and recurrence in all cohorts was the existence of imaging "dysplastic nodule".Conclusions:SOF regimens for HCV also have very high rates of SVR 12 in the post-market distribution. The appearance of imaging "dysplastic nodule" was an associated factor of 1-year HCC occurrence and recurrence. To investigate existence of "dysplastic nodule" by imaging surveillance before DAA treatment is useful to detect high-risk patients of very early HCC occurrence and recurrence and it should be performed.
