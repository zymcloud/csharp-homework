Objective: To study the clinical value of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma with blood supply from right adrenal artery. Methods: An imaging and clinical data of HCC patients with blood supply from right adrenal artery were collected from 2012 to 2016 after TACE treatment in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University and the safety and therapeutic efficacy of complete embolization therapy was analyzed retrospectively. Results: Twenty hepatocellular carcinoma patients with blood supply from right adrenal artery had received 23 times treatment. All lesions had invaded and protruded from the exogenous development of liver capsule. There were 14 cases with lesions > 5 cm in diameter. Right adrenal artery was found to be involved in the blood supply of three cases of hepatocellular carcinoma during TACE treatment for the first time. In addition, the remaining 17 cases had also received TACE treatment for the second to sixth time. The superior, middle, and inferior adrenal arteries were involved in 13, 3, and 9 cases, respectively. Twenty-four right adrenal arteries (96.0%) superselectively cannulated were successfully embolized without any serious complications. The standard method for evaluating the efficacy of liver cancer in 20 solid tumors follow-up cases showed that three cases were completely relieved, nine cases were partially relieved, two cases were stable, and six cases were progressive. The effective rate of embolization with blood supply from right adrenal artery lesions was 60.0%, and the control rate of lesion development was 70.0%. Conclusion: The right adrenal artery is mainly located in the S5-S7 segments of the liver. TACE features are obvious to ascertain its safety and effectiveness in the treatment of right adrenal artery tumors.
