The primary goals of managing chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are prevention of liver-related complications and reduction of mortality. Universal vaccination has dramatically reduced the incidence of new infection, but the management of existing CHB patients are still challenging. Areas covered: This review compares the similarities and differences among the latest published regional guidelines on the indications and choices of antiviral therapy. We have summarized advances in virological biomarkers and non-invasive tests for liver fibrosis in disease assessment. Benefits and remaining challenges of current standard of care by peginterferon and nucleos(t)ide analogs (NA) have been presented. Data on combination therapy of peginterferon and NA in seeking functional cure of the disease is also critically discussed. We have also described the improvement in the management of CHB at pregnancy and prophylaxis in patients on chemotherapy and immunosuppressants. Expert commentary: Controversies exist in the assessment of disease activity for selection patients for treatment as well as on the use of tenofovir alafenamide as a safe and cost-effective alternative to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Though combination therapy of peginterferon and NA has induced HBsAg seroclearance in a small proportion of patients, peginterferon is not preferred in the future trend of drug development.
