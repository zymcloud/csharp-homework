At present, the chemotherapy of advanced inoperable liver cancer is limited with serious side effects. Curcumin possesses multiple cancer preventive activities and low safety concerns. However, its poor solubility and instability in water pose significant pharmacological barriers to its clinical application. In this study, we presented a novel delivery system - the glycyrrhetinic acid modified curcumin-loaded cationic liposomes (GAMCLCL) and investigated its antitumor activities on HepG2 cells in vitro and in H22 tumor-bearing mice. The experimental results demonstrated that GAMCLCL was a cationic liposome and could be Intravenous administration. Compared to free curcumin, GAMCLCL exhibited stronger antitumor activities in vitro and in vivo. The antitumor results of GAMCLCL after intravenous administration were very similar to those after intratumoral administration. The main activities of GAMCLCL and curcumin included inhibition of HepG2 cell proliferation, inhibition of tumor growth, reduction of tumor microvascular density, down-regulation of the expression of VEGF protein, and up-regulation of the expression of Caspases3 protein in H22 tumor tissues. Furthermore, GAMCLCL improved the parameters of WBC, RBC, ALT, CRE, LDH of H22 tumor-bearing mice. Curcumin is a nontoxic natural compound with definite antitumor activities, its antitumor effects can be enhanced by preparation of GAMCLCL.
