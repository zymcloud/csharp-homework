A 72-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was diagnosed with acute perforated cholecystitis requiring emergency surgery. Unexpectedly, a bile duct tumor thrombus was found to have spread into the intracystic space, mimicking a gall stone and presumably causing the severe acute cholecystitis. We herein report an extremely rare subtype of bile duct tumor thrombus of HCC.
Bile duct tumor thrombus; Gall bladder; Hepatocellular carcinoma.
