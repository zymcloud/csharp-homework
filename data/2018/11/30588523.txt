Backgrounds/aims:The superiority of anatomical resection (AR) for a small HCC remains controversial. In this study, we investigated the clinical outcomes after AR and non-anatomical liver resection (NAR) for single HCC smaller than 3 cm and the risk factors for HCC recurrence.Methods:A total of 116 consecutive patients who underwent liver resection for single HCC (Results:There was no significant difference in tumor recurrence and survival between AR and NAR group. Multivariate analysis showed that hepatitis B (p=0.035, HR=8.72), presence of satellite nodule (p=0.029, HR=3.97) and microvascular invasion (MVI) (p=0.039, HR=2.79) were independent risk factors for early recurrence within 1 year. The overall recurrence was independently related to the presence of satellite nodule (p=0.001, HR=4.98) and background liver cirrhosis (p=0.032, HR=1.96). In patients with MVI, HCC recurrence was significantly more frequent in width of safety margin <1 cm group than ≥1 cm group (p=0.049).Conclusions:The outcomes of NAR are comparable with those of AR in single HCC smaller than 3 cm. The presence of satellite nodule, MVI and hepatitis B are the independent risk factors for early recurrence, however overall recurrence is correlated with background liver cirrhosis and the presence of satellite nodule rather than pathobiologic factors in single HCC smaller than 3 cm. Hepatic resection with sufficient margin (≥1 cm) is recommended for decreasing risk of recurrence in patients with suspected MVI.
