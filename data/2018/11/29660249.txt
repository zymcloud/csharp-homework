Background & aims:The combination of hepatitis B immunoglobulin and a nucleos(t)ide analogues has markedly reduced the rate of hepatitis B virus recurrence after liver transplantation; however, the optimal duration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin has not been clarified. This lack of consensus perpetuates the use of different strategies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors associated to hepatitis B virus recurrence after liver transplantation in a large cohort of patients under different hepatitis B immunoglobulin regimens.Methods:Retrospective multicentre analysis of hepatitis B virus-related liver transplantation recipients receiving combined prophylaxis (hepatitis B immunoglobulin + nucleos(t)ide analogues). The strategy of short-term hepatitis B immunoglobulin was compared to lifelong administration. Hepatitis B virus recurrence was defined as positive HBsAg after liver transplantation.Results:Three hundred and thirty-eight patients were analysed. After a median follow-up period of 72 months, 37 patients (11%) developed hepatitis B virus recurrence. Hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence and lamivudine resistance after liver transplantation were the only factors independently associated to hepatitis B virus recurrence (HR 5.4 [2.3-12] and 9.3 [4.2-20] respectively P Conclusions:Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for hepatitis B virus-related liver disease. Since the introduction of combined prophylaxis the rate of hepatitis B virus recurrence is very low. However, lifelong hepatitis B immunoglobulin administration does not seem necessary to reduce hepatitis B virus recurrence.
