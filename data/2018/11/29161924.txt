Objective:The aims of this study were to compare the clinical outcomes between ultrasound (US)-guided percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) and surgical resection (SR) in patients with thoracoabdominal wall implants from hepatocellular carcinom (HCC) and to identify the prognostic factors associated with the two treatment methods.Materials and methods:A total of 47 patients (mean age, 56.7 Â± 15.9 years, range, 18-78 years; 34 men and 13 women) with 61 thoracoabdominal wall HCC seeding were included from April 2007 to May 2017. Twenty-five patients underwent US-guided MWA and 22 patients underwent SR. Survival, recurrence and liver function were compared between the two groups. Effect of changes in key parameters (i.e. overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and local tumour reoccurrence-free (LTRF)) was statistically analysed with the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on several clinicopathological variables to identify factors affecting long-term outcome and recurrence.Results:The OS, DFS and LTRF after MWA were comparable to those of SR (p =0.493, p = 0.578 and p =0.270, respectively). Estimated 5-year overall survival rates were 63% after MWA and 48.1% after SR; for disease-free survival, estimated 5-year rates were 67.5% after MWA and 48.8% after SR; estimated 24-month LTRF rates were 71.3% after MWA and 87.8% after SR. The MWA group had less surgical time (p = Conclusions:Ultrasound-guided percutaneous MWA is a safe and effective treatment method for metastatic HCC on the thoracoabdominal wall with similar outcomes to SR. Residual intrahepatic HCC, Child Pugh grade and distant metastasis are predictors for survival.
