Purpose:To compare the diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and combined fluorodeoxyglucose/positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) for detection of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) in patients eligible for local treatment.Materials and methods:This health-research ethics-committee-approved prospective consecutive diagnostic accuracy study, with written informed consent, included 80 cases (76 patients, four participating twice) between 29 June 2015 and 7 February 2017. Prior chemotherapy or local treatment did not exclude participation. Combined FDG-PET/CT including CE-CT and MRI was performed within 0-3 days shortly before local treatment. CE-CT and MRI images were read independently by two readers for each modality. The combined FDG-PET/CT images were read independently by two pairs of readers. A composite reference standard was used. Sensitivities, specificities and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCROC) were calculated and compared.Results:In total, 260 CRLMs were confirmed. The MRI readers had significantly higher per-lesion sensitivity (85.9% and 83.8%) than both CE-CT readers (69.1% and 62.3%) and both PET/CT reader pairs (72.0% and 72.1%) (p<0.001). There were no significant differences in per-lesion specificity. MRI readers had significantly higher AUCROC (0.92 and 0.88) than both CE-CT readers (0.80 and 0.82) (p≤0.001). AUCROC for MR reader 1 was higher than that of both PET/CT reader pairs (0.83 and 0.84) (p≤0.0001).Conclusion:MRI performed significantly better than both CE-CT and combined FDG-PET/CT for detection of CRLM in consecutive patients eligible for local treatment irrespective of prior chemotherapy or local treatment.Key points:• Patients eligible for local treatment of colorectal liver-metastases require optimal imaging. • In 80 consecutive patients, MRI had superior per lesion diagnostic performance. • Findings were independent of prior treatment and type of planned local treatment. • Equally, MRI had superior diagnostic performance on per segment basis.
