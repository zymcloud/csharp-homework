BACKGROUND The purpose of the study was to investigate the functional roles of phosphatase in regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as the related molecular mechanisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS HCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected from 124 HCC patients. The mRNA and protein levels of PRL-3 were detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot assays, respectively. The relationship between PRL-3 expression and clinical characteristics of HCC patients was evaluated by chi-square test. MTT and Transwell assays were performed to estimate cell proliferation and motility, respectively. RESULTS The expression of PRL-3 was significantly increased in HCC tissues and cells at both protein and mRNA levels (P
