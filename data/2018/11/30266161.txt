Although liver tumors are rare in the pediatric population, they are common in the setting of children with specific risk factors requiring increased awareness and, in some instances, screening. The evaluation of a liver mass in children is largely driven by the age at diagnosis, the presence of any medical comorbidities, and initial testing with alpha fetoprotein and imaging. Specific guidelines for the management of different tumors have been implemented in recent years such that a multidisciplinary approach is ideal and care should be provided by centers with experience in their management.
