Dauricine (Dau) is a natural alkaloid exhibiting anti-proliferative activity against several different types of malignant cell. However, effects of Dau on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained to be fully elucidated. In this study, we found that Dau elevated the sensitivities of HCC cells to chemotherapeutic reagents, including cisplatin, sorafenib, and isoliensinine. Moreover, Dau promoted apoptosis of HCC cells triggered by these chemotherapeutic reagents. Consistently, in a xenograft mouse model, Dau sensitized HCC cells to sorafenib. In HCC cells, Dau dose-dependently inhibited glucose glycolysis and increased oxidative phosphorylation. Mechanistically, Dau downregulated the expression of hexokinase 2 (HK2) and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). HK2 and PKM2 can be directly targeted by miR-199a. Dau dose-dependently increased miR-199a expression in HCC cells. Transfection of anti-miR-199a abrogated Dau-mediated suppression of HK2 and PKM2. Dau-induced metabolic shift was thereby severely crippled by anti-miR-199a. In addition, the incremental activity of Dau on sorafenib sensitivity of HCC cells was diminished in response to the transfection of anti-miR-199a. Taken together, our findings provided novel insights into the impact of Dau on HCC cells and supported considering Dau as an adjuvant reagent in the clinical treatment of HCC.
