Background:The prognosis of massive hepatocellular carcinomas (MHCCs; â‰¥10 cm) remains worse.Purpose:The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical benefits of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) or TACE combined with percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy (PMCT) and the long-term survival rate of MHCC patients treated with these techniques.Patients and methods:A retrospective study was performed using data involving 102 MHCC patients admitted to the Second Hospital of Nanjing from September 2010 to August 2015. The median interval between treatments and overall survival (OS) was hierarchically analyzed using log-rank tests. Multivariate analysis was done using Cox regression model analysis.Results:The median survival time of MHCC patients was 3 months (range, 1-10 months) in the palliative group, 3 months (range, 1-39 months) in the TACE group, and 7.5 months (range, 3-30 months) in the TACE-PMCT group (P=0.038). The 6-, 12-, and 18-month OS rates for MHCC patients were 15%, 0%, and 0% in the palliative group, 30%, 25.63%, and 17.97% in the TACE group, and 50%, 41.67%, and 16.67% in the TACE-PMCT group, respectively (P=0.0467). In addition, TACE sessions had positive correlation with the survival time of MHCC patients (rho = 0.462, P<0.001). TACE treatment more than three times (HR =0.145, P<0.001) was an independent predictor of the survival of MHCC patients, which was identified by the Cox regression model analysis.Conclusions:These results indicated that TACE-PMCT treatment in MHCC patients had advantages in prolonging OS and improving liver function. Multiple TACE treatments might be a suitable treatment for the MHCC patients.
