Background:Hepatic carcinosarcomas, which include both carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements, are uncommon in adults. Although carcinosarcoma in hepatocellular carcinoma is occasionally reported, carcinosarcoma in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is an extremely rare ICC variant. Few such cases have been reported in English and no large study of its clinicopathological features exists.Case presentation:Here, we report a 60-year-old man with an asymptomatic hepatic B infection who developed hepatic carcinosarcoma from an otherwise normal liver. The 6.0-cm tumor was accidentally discovered by PET-CT in a cancer examination. Serum examinations showed no elevation of tumor markers. He underwent left and caudate lobectomy of the liver. The diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with sarcomatous stroma was based on thorough pathologic examination and immunohistochemical staining. The tumor exhibited adenocarcinomatous and sarcomatous components; the adenocarcinomatous element was positive for epithelial markers, the sarcomatous element was positive for mesenchymal markers, but negative for epithelial markers. The patient made an uneventful recovery after surgery. At present, 14 months after surgery, he remains well with no evidence of tumor recurrence.Conclusions:We report an unusual case of hepatic carcinosarcoma (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with sarcomatous stroma) and discuss the etiology and prognosis of this rare disease.
