Purpose:To longitudinally study clinical and radiologic outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent yttrium-90 transarterial radioembolization (TARE) as a bridge to surgical resection.Materials and methods:TARE was performed in 31 patients with HCC before resection. Of patients, 25 underwent major hepatic resection (16 received right hepatectomy and 9 received trisegmentectomy), and 6 underwent partial hepatectomy. Clinical outcomes after TARE and after resection were recorded. Future liver remnant (FLR) was calculated before and after TARE, and actual liver remnant volume was calculated after resection. Radiologic response after TARE and pathologic necrosis were assessed. Overall and recurrence-free survivals after resection were estimated.Results:Median time between TARE and resection was 2.9 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 2-5 months). Median FLR hypertrophy after TARE (and before resection) was 23.3% (IQR:10%-48%) for patients who had radiation lobectomy and 9% (IQR: 6%-25%) for patients who had radiation segmentectomy (P = .037). Median augmented hypertrophy of the liver remnant 3 months after resection was 72% (IQR:45%-88%) in patients who had radiation lobectomy and 94% (IQR: 72%-146%) in patients who had radiation segmentectomy. Complete, 50%-99%, and Conclusions:TARE can serve as a safe bridge to resection providing FLR hypertrophy and disease control.
