Background/aim:To compare overall survival (OS) and liver cancer-specific survival (LCSS) of Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) database patients treated with cryoablation (cryo) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Materials and methods:This was a retrospective review of Stage I or II HCC patients from the SEER database treated with cryo and RFA from 2004-2013. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regressions were performed on pooled and propensity-matched cohort.Results:Out of 3,239 patients, RFA showed a significant survival advantage over cryo in liver cancer specific survival (LCSS) (HR=1.634 p=0.0004). A total of 91 propensity-matched pairs had similar OS (HR=1.006 p=0.9768), but no difference in LCSS was observed between the groups [HR=1.412 (95%CI=0.933-2.137) p=0.1023]. Survival Cox models did not reveal treatment type as an independent prognostic factor.Conclusion:Propensity-matched cohort showed no significant difference in terms of OS and LCSS was found for patients treated with either cryo or RFA for localized HCC.
