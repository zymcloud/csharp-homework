Background:Irreversible electroporation (IRE) has successfully been used for palliation of pancreatic and liver cancers due to its ability to ablate tumors without destroying nearby vital structures. To date, it has not been evaluated in patients with advanced hilar cholangiocarcinoma (AHC). This study presents a single-institution experience with IRE for management of obstructive jaundice in AHC.Methods:A single-institution database was queried for patients undergoing IRE for AHC after PTBD placement for relief of obstructive jaundice from 2010 to 2017 and compared to a control group treated with standard of care only (No IRE).Results:Twenty-six patients underwent IRE for AHC after PTBD replacement. Three patients experienced complications, with two experiencing severe (â‰¥ grade 3) complications. After IRE, median time to PTBD removal was 122 days (range 0-305 days) and median catheter-free time before requiring PTBD replacement was 305 days (range 92-458 days). In comparison, the 137 control patients had an admission rate of 59% (N = 80 patients) for PTBD infection, occlusion, or catheter related problem.Conclusion:IRE safely achieves biliary decompression via tumor electroporation and allows PTBD removal for an extended period of time. In appropriately selected patients with obstructive jaundice in the setting of AHC, IRE can be used to increase catheter-free days and optimize overall quality of life.
