Osteopontin and Pokémon genes may have an important role in the pathogenesis of different malignancies. Osteopontin is a glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix, and Pokémon is a regulator of transcription. Both have been hypothesized to be useful as therapeutic targets or diagnostic markers. We aim to assess the role of both in hepatocellular carcinoma and liver fibrosis due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We conducted our study on 50 patients and classified them into three groups-Group I: Patients with HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (n = 30); Group II: Patients with hepatitis C cirrhosis (n = 10); and Group III: Patients with hepatitis C fibrosis (n = 10). We found high levels of Osteopontin and Pokémon gene expression in group I. Osteopontin levels were higher also in patients with liver fibrosis was correlated to high levels of parameters such as alpha fetoprotein and caspase. We conclude that HCC is associated with overexpression of both Osteopontin and Pokémon and that Osteopontin plays a significant role in liver fibrosis due to hepatitis C infection.
