Objective:The predictive value of esophageal varices (EV) in determining the patient outcome in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unresolved. We aimed to assess the impact of EV on the prognosis of HCC patients after surgical resection.Materials and methods:We consecutively enrolled 446 treatment-naive HCC patients who underwent surgical resection and esophagogastroduodenoscopy from 2003 to 2015. Prognostic factors were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model and a propensity score matching analysis.Results:A total of 89 (20.0%) HCC patients presented with EV. Compared with those without EV, patients with EV had poorer preservation of liver function and higher rates of cirrhosis in the nontumor part of liver specimens. After a median follow-up period of 34.6 months (25-75 percentiles; 12.8-59.3 months), 130 patients had died. The cumulative 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 62.3 and 70.6% in patients with and without EV, respectively (P=0.102). A multivariate analysis showed that serum albumin level less than or equal to 4 g/dl (P=0.020), Î±-fetoprotein level greater than 20 ng/ml (PConclusion:EV is not an independent risk factor predictive of poor prognosis for HCC patients after resection surgery if they have well-preserved liver function.
