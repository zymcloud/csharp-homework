A 47-year-old man, with a history of anabolic steroid abuse, developed hepatic adenomatosis and multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma. He underwent ultrasound and CT follow-up, showing multiple solid and fluid hepatic lesions. Consequently, hospitalization was required because of high fever (up to 39Â°C), weakness, and anorexia. An abdominal CT scan revealed an enlargement of one of the intrahepatic fluid collections. Biochemical and microbiological analyses of a fluid sample showed bilirubin and bile acids as well as Streptococcus cristatus and Enterobacter cloacae. Thus, the patient underwent Tc-trimethylbromo-iminodiacetic acid scintigraphy, demonstrating bile collection in the lesion with a flow from a bile duct.
