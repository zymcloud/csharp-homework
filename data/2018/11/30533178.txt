Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the second cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The incidence of HCC is constantly increasing in correlation with the rise in diabetes and obesity, arguing for an urgent need for new developments in the treatment of this lethal cancer. Exosomes are small double-membrane vesicles loaded with distinct cargos, particularly small non-coding RNAs called microRNAs, representative of each donor cell and secreted to affect the features of neighboring cells or recipient cells located further away, like in the case of metastasis. A better understanding of the role of exosomes with a microRNA signature in cancer pathogenesis gave rise to the concept of their use as a non-invasive diagnostic biomarker and in the treatment of cancer, including HCC. In this communication, we review recent works that demonstrate that hepatic stellate cells establish an epigenetic communication with liver cancer cells, which affects their pro-malignant features. If naturally secreted patient-derived exosomes show major limitations concerning their clinical use, bio-engineered exosome mimetics that incorporate controlled components and exhibit no protumoral properties could be promising carriers for the treatment of liver cancers, which is the organ preferentially targeted by systemic injection of exosomes.
