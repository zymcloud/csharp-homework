Purpose:Hepatotoxicity risk in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is modulated by radiation dose delivered to normal liver tissue, but reported dose-response data are limited. Our prior work established baseline [99mTc]sulfur colloid (SC) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) liver function imaging biomarkers that predict clinical outcomes. We conducted a proof-of-concept investigation with longitudinal SC SPECT/CT to characterize patient-specific radiation dose-response relationships as surrogates for liver radiosensitivity.Methods and materials:SC SPECT/CT images of 15 patients with HCC with variable Child-Pugh (CP) status (8 CP-A, 7 CP-B/C) were acquired in treatment position before and 1 month (nominal) after stereotactic body radiation therapy (n = 6) or proton therapy (n = 9). Localized rigid registrations between pre/posttreatment CT to planning CT scans were performed, and transformations were applied to pre/posttreatment SC SPECT images. Radiation therapy doses were converted to EQD2 and Gy RBE (relative biological effectiveness) and binned in 5 GyEQD2 increments within tumor-subtracted livers. Mean dose and percent change (%ΔSC) between pre- and posttreatment SPECT uptake, normalized to regions receiving max), dose midpoint (Dmid), and dose-response slope (αmid) parameters.Results:Individual patient sigmoid dose-response curves had high goodness-of-fit (median R2 = 0.96, range 0.76-0.99). Large interpatient variability was observed, with median (range) in %ΔSCmax of 44% (20%-75%), Dmid of 13 Gy (4-27 GyEQD2), and αmid of 0.11 GyEQD2-1 (0.04-0.29 GyEQD2-1), respectively. Eight of 15 patients had %ΔSCmax of 20% to 45%, whereas 7 of 15 had %ΔSCmax of 60% to 75%, with subgroups made up of variable baseline liver function status and radiation treatment modality. Fatal hepatotoxicity occurred in patients (2 of 15) with low total liver funcation (<0.12) and low Dmid (<7 GyEQD2).Conclusions:Longitudinal SC SPECT/CT imaging revealed patient-specific variations in dose-response and may identify patients with poor baseline liver function and increased sensitivity to radiation therapy. Validation of this regional liver dose-response modeling concept as a surrogate for patient-specific radiosensitivity has potential to guide HCC therapy regimen selection and planning constraints.
