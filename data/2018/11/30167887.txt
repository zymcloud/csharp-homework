Rapid advances in imaging technology have improved the detection, characterization and staging of colorectal liver metastases, hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. A variety of imaging modalities are available and play a pivotal role in the work-up of patients, particularly as imaging findings determine resectability. Surgery often represents the only measure that can render long-term survival possible. Imaging is also indispensable for the assessment of responses to neoadjuvant treatment and for the detection of recurrence. At a consensus meeting held in June 2017 in Vienna, Austria, Austrian experts in the fields of surgery and radiology discussed imaging requirements prior to and after hepatic surgery for malignant liver lesions. This consensus was refined by online voting on a total of 47 items. Generally, the degree of consensus was high. The recommendations relate to the type of preferred preoperative imaging modalities, technical settings with respect to computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, use of contrast agents, reporting, postoperative follow-up, and long-term follow-up. Taking local resources into account, these consensus recommendations can be implemented in daily clinical practice at specialized centers as well as outpatient diagnostic institutes in Austria.
