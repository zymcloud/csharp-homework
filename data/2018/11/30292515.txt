Objectives:The aim of this systematic review is to investigate diagnostic accuracy of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans using liver specific tissue contrast media over contrast enhanced Multi Detector CT (MDCT) in diagnoses of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic liver disease.Key findings:A total of 8 diagnostic studies were identified and generally considered of high quality. The studies reported sufficient evidence on sensitivity and specificity, which was synthesised and summarised providing an overview of the evidence. Findings indicate that MRI scans using liver specific tissue contrast have a better diagnostic performance compared to contrast enhanced MDCT in diagnostic work-up of HCC in patients with chronic liver disease.Conclusion:The current review identified sufficient high quality studies reporting statistical difference (P
