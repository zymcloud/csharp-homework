Objective:A randomized controlled trial was conducted to prospectively compare the therapeutic effectiveness of switching bipolar (SB) radiofrequency ablation (RFA) using cooled-wet electrodes and switching monopolar (SM) RFA using separable clustered (SC) electrodes in patients with hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).Materials and methods:This prospective study was approved by our Institutional Review Board. Between April 2014 and January 2015, sixty-nine patients with 74 HCCs were randomly treated with RFA using either internally cooled-wet (ICW) electrodes in SB mode (SB-RFA, n = 36) or SC electrodes in SM mode (SM-RFA, n = 38). Technical parameters including the number of ablations, ablation time, volume, energy delivery, and complications were evaluated. Thereafter, 1-year and 2-year local tumor progression (LTP) free survival rates were compared between the two groups using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:In the SB-RFA group, less number of ablations were required (1.72±0.70 vs. 2.31±1.37, P = 0.039), the ablation time was shorter (10.9±3.9 vs.14.3±5.0 min, p = 0.004), and energy delivery was smaller (13.1±6.3 vs.23.4±12.8 kcal, pConclusion:Both SB-RFA using ICW electrodes and SM-RFA using SC electrodes provided comparable LTP free survival rates although SB-RFA required less ablations and shorter ablation time.
