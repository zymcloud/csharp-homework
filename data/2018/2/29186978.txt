Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major risk factor associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the association of T2DM with liver cirrhosis and therapy response in HCC patients is not clear. Hence, in this study, we have evaluated the influence of T2DM on liver cirrhosis severity of HCC and sorafenib response. HCC patients were divided in two groups: T2DM (n = 20) and non-T2DM (nT2DM; n = 50). We found significantly higher number of patients in T2DM group had decompensated liver disease with Child-Turcotte-Pugh score â‰¥ 7. Additionally, 71.4% patients were observed to be sorafenib sensitive in T2DM group which was significantly higher as compared to 30% in nT2DM group. This study has highlighted the predisposition of HCC patients with T2DM toward more severe liver disease who were found to be better respondents of sorafenib. Impact statement We have explored the association of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on liver cirrhosis severity along with response toward sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Most HCC patients exhibit prior history of liver cirrhosis that results following long span of chronic liver disease. T2DM constitutes as an important risk factor for HCC development which is known to elevate its incidence. Further, sorafenib is the FDA approved therapy for HCC whose therapeutic outcome is not investigated in HCC patients with T2DM till date. This observation-based study has unveiled a positive association between T2DM and severity of liver cirrhosis as well as sorafenib response in HCC as examined in a clinical setting.
