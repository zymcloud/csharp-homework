Background:Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) remains a global health dilemma with high morbidity and mortality. Human males absent on the first (hMOF) (a histone acetyltransferase) is responsible for DNA damage repair, tumorigenesis and cell cycle regulation. Persistence of HBV DNA contributes to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in CHB patients. Histone acetyltransferase enhances HBV replication, however the precise underlying mechanism of hMOF in HBV replication in CHB patients remains to be explored. This study aims to investigate the correlation between hepatic hMOF and HBV DNA replication in CHB patients, and may provide new insights towards the treatment of CHB patients.Methods:hMOF in liver biopsy (CHB, n = 33 HBeAg+; n = 20 HBeAg-, and three healthy controls) was determined, using immunohistochemistry, qPCR and Western blot. The correlation between hMOF and HBsAg, as well as, HBeAg were determined.Results:A positive correlation between hMOF and HBV DNA in overall CHB patients was observed. A distinct positive correlation between hMOF and HBsAg and/or HBeAg in HBeAg+ CHB patients was also detected, however not observed between hMOF and HBsAg in HBeAg- CHB patients. No correlation was observed between hMOF and hepatic inflammation severity and fibrotic stage in CHB patients.Conclusions:Hepatic hMOF might contribute to host HBV clearance in CHB patients and possible pathogenesis.
