Background:To compare the presentations and outcomes of anti-HBc seropositive Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HBc-HCC) with anti-HBc seronegative (NHBc-HCC) patients in HBsAg negative Non-HBV Non-HCV (NBNC-HCC) HCC population.Methods:515 newly diagnosed HCC patients from January 2011 to September 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. 145 (66.5%) NHBc-HCC and 73 (33.5%) HBc-HCC patients were identified. Patient demographics, disease characteristics, details of treatments, recurrence and survival outcomes were analysed.Results:A significantly lower proportion of HBc-HCC patients were diagnosed through surveillence (6.8% vs 26.2%, p = 0.001). HBc-HCC patients were less likely cirrhotic (p Conclusion:Isolated anti-HBc seropositivity in HbsAg negative patients tend to present incidentally with delayed diagnoses resulting in larger tumors, but their long-term survival remain comparable.
