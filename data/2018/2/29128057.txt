Although hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is more common in the setting of cirrhosis, there is increasing evidence that it can develop in the setting of noncirrhotic nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and that steatosis alone can promote carcinogenesis. In addition, obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome are recognized risks for the development of HCC. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the development of NAFLD/NASH-related HCC will allow the discovery of new targets for therapeutic and preventive intervention. The surveillance for HCC in the setting of noncirrhotic NAFLD/NASH, obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome remains an area of uncertainty.
