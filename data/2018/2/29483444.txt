Background and Aim: The recommendedind ication of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(TACE)for hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)is Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer(BCLC)stage B HCC. But there are some cases in which we do not perform TACE because of liver damage with malnutrition in stage B. So we examined whether branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)improve nutritional status and perform TACE to contribute the prolongation of HCC survival.Methods:This study included8 8 patients treatedfor liver cirrhosis with HCC. All patients initially receivedBCAA granules. In patients with unchangedor decreasedAlb levels, BCAA granules were discontinuedandBCAA enrichednutrient was started. TACE for HCC were performedin those with an improvedChild -Pugh score.Results:TACE were performedfollowing the aggressive intervention with BCAA nutritional education in 66 of 88(75%)patients. Finally, overall survival time was significantly extended in TACE group(pConclusion:Timely aggressive nutritional intervention in BCLC stage B HCC, early partial replacement with BCAA enrichednutrient before TACE may consequently contribute to improvement of the treatment outcome of HCC.
