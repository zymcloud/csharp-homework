Background and aims:In this work, the multi-frequency impedance both in normal and liver cancer tissues was studied. This was to investigate the feasibility to detect liver cancer by a low cost, easy to use, and a relatively non-invasive electrical impedance measure technique, and thus potentially improving liver cancer diagnosis.Methods:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was induced in male Wistar rats by the administration of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) during 16 weeks. The electrical impedances at a frequency sweep of 10-100 KHz in the whole body and 10-60 KHz in the liver were taken at the end of the treatment.Results:The electrical impedance showed that the real component values of the impedance change in HCC. In addition, we found that the imaginary component was not associated with HCC.Conclusion:Our results suggest that the electrical impedance may be used as a diagnostic HCC tool.
