The objective of this study was to identify the expression profile of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) with concurrent assessment of microRNA (miRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) profiles in leiomyomas and paired myometrium using next-generation RNA sequencing and assembly of RNA transcripts. Total RNA was isolated from leiomyoma and paired myometrium (N = 8) and samples from 3 pairs were subjected to RNA sequencing. Normalized assembly of over 48 000 lncRNAs resulted in identification of 45 936 lncRNAs. Of these lncRNAs, 22 148 representing overlapping, intergenic, intronic, and antisense subtypes were expressed in all paired tissues, with 5941 (2813 up- and 3128 downregulated at ≥1.5 fold) differentially expressed in leiomyomas. Concurrent RNA sequencing revealed the expression of 2588 miRNAs and 21 814 mRNAs, of which 392 miRNAs and 16 559 mRNAs were expressed in all paired tissues. Of these transcripts, 56 and 92 miRNAs and 2030 and 1825 mRNAs were up- or downregulated at ≥1.5 fold, respectively, in leiomyoma as compared to myometrium. Using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR), we confirmed the expression of hepatocellular carcinoma upregulated (HULC), lnc-maternally expressed 3 (MEG3), long intergenic ncRNA 890 (LINC00890), TSIX, long intergenic ncRNA 473 (LINC00473), lnc-KLF9-1, and lnc-POTEM-3 (lncRNA-ATB) in leiomyoma and matched myometrium (N = 8). Collectively, the results presented here provide a comprehensive expression profile of lncRNAs in leiomyomas with concurrent integrated expression of miRNAs and mRNAs and implicate potential regulatory functions of lncRNAs through interactions with specific miRNAs and mRNAs which are known to be critical in the pathogenesis of leiomyoma.
