The impact of sustained virologic response (SVR) on mortality after direct-acting antiviral treatment is not well documented. This study evaluated the impact of direct-acting antiviral-induced SVR on all-cause mortality and on incident hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 15,059 hepatitis C virus-infected patients with advanced liver disease defined by a FIB-4 >3.25. Overall, 1,067 patients did not achieve SVR (no SVR) and 13,992 patients achieved SVR. In a mean follow-up period of approximately 1.6 years, 195 no SVR patients and 598 SVR patients died. Mortality rates were 12.3 deaths/100 patient years of follow-up for no SVR patients and 2.6 deaths/100 patient years for SVR patients, a 78.9% reduction (P
