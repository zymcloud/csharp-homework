Background and aim:To develop a scoring method using with common clinical data for predicting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development after sustained virological response at 24 weeks (SVR24) after treatment with direct acting antivirals (DAAs), we retrospectively evaluated clinical features of patients who obtained SVR24.Methods:From October 2014 to December 2017, 1069 hepatitis C virus patients without a past history of HCC, who obtained SVR24 by DAAs at two different areas, were enrolled (the training [n = 484, ChuShikoku-group] and validation [n = 585, Chubu-group] sets). All were examined by ultrasonography as surveillance for HCC at the time of starting DAAs and twice a year after SVR24. We identified three parameters at SVR24, male gender, FIB-4 index > 3.25, and Î±-fetoprotein level > 5.0 ng/mL, as risk factors for HCC development and gave them point values, with the sum used as After DAAs Recommendation for Surveillance (ADRES) score.Results:In the ChuShikoku-group, the respective 1-/2-year rates for HCC incidence rates ADRES score 0 were 0.0%/0.0%, for a score 1 were 1.1%/2.1%, score 2 were 8.8%/15.9%, and score 3 were 17.1%/28.1%. On the other hand, those respective scores for the Chubu-group were 0.0%/0.0%, 0.0%/0.7%, 7.9%/10.6%, and 19.5%/not available. The c-index of the predictive value for HCC development in the training set after SVR24 was 0.835 while 0.899 in the validation set. Finally, those of the entire cohort were 0.0%/0.0%, 0.5%/1.6%, 8.4%/13.4%, and 18.0%/32.8%.Conclusion:The present ADRES score was simple and easy to use and may be useful for predicting risk of HCC development in short term after reaching SVR24 by DAAs.
