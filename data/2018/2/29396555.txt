Ubiquitin-specific protease 4 (USP4) is a member of the deubiquitinating enzyme family, which plays an important role in human tumor diseases. However, the mechanisms by which USP4 facilitates tumor development, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), remain unclear. Clinically, we found that USP4 is overexpressed in human HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumoral tissues and is significantly correlated with malignant phenotype characteristics, including tumor size, tumor number, differentiation, serum alpha-fetoprotein level, and vascular invasion. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a poor overall survival rate in patients with USP4-overexpressing tumors. Analyses of univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models indicated that USP4 is a prognostic biomarker for poor outcome. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we demonstrated that USP4 overexpression enhanced HCC cell growth, migration, and invasion. Mechanistically, cyclophilin A (CypA) was identified as an important molecule for USP4-mediated oncogenic activity in HCC. We observed that USP4 interacted with CypA and inhibited CypA degradation via deubiquitination in HCC cells. Subsequently, the USP4/CypA complex activated the MAPK signaling pathway and prevented CrkII phosphorylation. These data suggest that USP4 acts as a novel prognostic marker, offering potential therapeutic opportunities for HCC.
