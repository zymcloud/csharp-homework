The expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), a classical imprinting gene, didn't completely correlate with its imprinting profiles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The mechanistic importance of promoter activity in regulation of IGF2 has not been fully clarified. Here we show that histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) modified by menin-MLL complex of IGF2 promoter contributes to promoter activity of IGF2. The strong binding of menin and abundant H3K4me3 at the DNA demethylated P3/4 promoters were observed in Hep3B cells with the robust expression of IGF2. In IGF2-low-expressing HepG2 cells, menin didn't bind to DNA hypermethylated P3/4 regions; however, menin overexpression inhibited DNA methylation and promoted H3K4me3 at the P3/4 as well as IGF2 expression in HepG2. In addition, the H3K4me3 at P3/4 locus was activated in primary HCC specimens with high IGF2 expression. Furthermore, inhibition of the menin/MLL interaction via MI-2/3 reduced IGF2 expression, inhibited the IGF1R-AKT pathway, and significantly repressed HCC with robust expression of IGF2. Taken together, we conclude that H3K4me3 of P3/4 locus mediated by the menin-MLL complex is a novel epigenetic mechanism for releasing IGF2.
