Background:The ideal management for patients with intermediate and advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial. The main purpose of this systematic review is to examine the role of liver resection in patients with intermediate stage HCC (multinodular HCCs) and in advanced stage HCC [mainly patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT)].Methods:A systematic search of the literature was performed in Pud Med and the Cochrane Library from 01.01.2000 to 30.06.2016.Results:Twenty-three articles with 2412 patients with multinodular HCCs were selected. Also, 29 studies with 3659 patients with HCCs with macrovascular invasion were selected. In patients with multinodular HCCs the median post-operative morbidity was 25% and the 90-day mortality was 2.7%. The median survival was 37 months and the 5-year survival 35%. The 5-year survival was much better for patients with a number of HCCs â‰¤3 vs. HCCs >3 (49% vs. 23%). In patients with macrovascular invasion, who underwent hepatic resection, the median post-operative morbidity was 33% and the in-hospital mortality 2.7%. The median survival was 15 months. The 3 and 5year survival was 33% and 20% respectively. Moreover a significant difference in survival was noted according to PVTT stage: 5- year survival for distal PVTT, PVTT of the main intrahepatic PV branch and PVTT extending to the main PV was 45%, 19% and 14.5% respectively.Conclusions:Liver resection in patients with multinodular HCCs and HCCs with PVTT offers satisfactory long-term survival and should be considered in selected patients.
