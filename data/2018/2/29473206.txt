Background and aim:Mac-2-binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) was recently identified as a serum glycobiomarker for liver fibrosis. However, the relationship between M2BPGi and malnutrition in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) is unknown. We aimed to evaluate whether M2BPGi could be a surrogate marker for malnutrition in patients with CLD.Methods:In total, 338 outpatients with CLD were enrolled (median age: 67 years). We evaluated the associations among liver fibrosis markers (M2BPGi, fibrosis-4 index, and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet count ratio index), Child-Pugh stages, and nutritional status markers.Results:The median value (range) of serum M2BPGi levels was 0.94 cut-off index (COI) (0.22-11.57) in chronic hepatitis and Child-Pugh A (n = 274), 4.775 COI (1.32-16.68) in Child-Pugh B (n = 46), and 11.37 COI (6.03-18.33) in Child-Pugh C (n = 18) (overall significance, P s = -0.649, P < 0.001 and rs = 0.671, P < 0.001, respectively). The correlations between M2BPGi and nutritional status markers were especially high in patients with hepatitis C virus infection and non-B non-C hepatitis and patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Among the three fibrosis markers, M2BPGi yielded the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.920) for predicting hypoalbuminemia at an optimal cut-off value of 2.41 (sensitivity, 87.3%; specificity, 87.6%; P < 0.001).Conclusions:Serum M2BPGi levels are correlated with nutritional status markers in patients with CLD and could be a useful clinical marker of malnutrition.
