Introduction:Oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the chromosomal rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were associated with superior clinical outcome. Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are known to have peculiar toxicity profile, hence, increasing awareness to the safety profile of ALK inhibitors is essential.Methods:A comprehensive systematic review of literature has been conducted to include prospective trials that used the ALK inhibitors Crizotinib, Ceritinib, Alectinib, Brigatinib and Lorlatinib in patients with advanced NSCLC and have available efficacy and toxicity results.Results:A total of 14 studies including 2793 patients were considered eligible for our review and included two phase IB, seven phase II and five phase III studies. The most common adverse events (AEs) observed with ALK inhibitors were gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities as nausea (up to 83%), vomiting (up to 67%) and diarrhea (up to 86%), elevation of liver enzymes occurred in up to 60% and fatigue (up to 43%). There were differences in the toxicity patterns between the different ALK inhibitors with more GI and hepatic toxicities with Ceritinib, more visual disorders with Crizotinib, more dysgeusia with crizotinib and Alectinib and possibly more respiratory complications with Brigatinib. Most of the AEs were low grade and treatment-related deaths were associated with ALK inhibitors in 0-1% of patients.Conclusion:Most of adverse effects of ALKi can be managed efficiently via dose modifications or interruptions. Timely identification of each ALKi pattern of toxicity can prevent treatment-related morbidity and mortality in this palliative setting.
