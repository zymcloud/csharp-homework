Background:Whether primary liver transplantation (PLT) or upfront curative treatment with salvage liver transplantation (SLT) is a better treatment option for early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial. This study aims to compare the long-term survival starting from the time of primary treatment between the two approaches for early HCC using propensity score matching (PSM) analysis.Methods:From 1995 to 2014, 175 patients with early HCC undergoing either PLT (n = 149) or SLT (n = 26) were retrospectively reviewed in a prospectively collected database. Patients' demographic data, tumor characteristics, short-term and long-term outcome were compared between two groups after PSM.Results:After matching, the baseline characteristics were comparable between mPLT group (n = 45) and mSLT group (n = 25). The tumor recurrence rate after transplant was significantly higher in mSLT group than mPLT group (28% vs. 15.6%). Calculating from the time of primary treatment, the 1, 3, and 5-year overall survival rates were comparable between mPLT group (97.8%, 91.1% and 86.3%) and mSLT group (100%, 95% and 85%). However, the 1, 3, and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates were significantly better in mPLT group than mSLT group (95.6% vs. 90%, 86.6% vs. 80% and 84.3% vs. 70%). SLT approach and high pre-treatment serum alpha-fetoprotein level (>200 Î·g/mL) were poor prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival after transplant.Conclusions:PLT may be a better treatment option for early HCC, whereas SLT approach for HCC should be cautiously considered under the circumstance of organ shortage.
