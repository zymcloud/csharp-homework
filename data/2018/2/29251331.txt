Ovarian cancer (OC), of which epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most common, is the deadliest gynecological tumor because of the difficulties in detection at early stages, and metastasis and chemoresistance at advanced stages. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) differentiate through alternative pathways and play important roles in tumor growth and metastasis. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we established a mouse TAM model using bone marrow monocytes and conditioned medium (CM) of TAMs to culture ID8 mouse EOC cells. The results showed that TAM CM accelerated the proliferation and migration of ID8 cells. In a previous study, gene chip analysis showed that human TAMs expressed significantly higher levels of insulin-like growth factor‑1 (IGF1) than undifferentiated M0 myeloid cells. In the present study, we observed that the IGF1 level was higher in human EOC specimens than that in benign ovarian tumor specimens, and further analysis showed that a higher level of IGF1 was related to more advanced clinical stage and liver metastasis. Therefore, we hypothesized that TAMs may accelerate the proliferation and migration of EOC cells by upregulating IGF1. As expected, increased IGF1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels was observed in ID8 cells cultured with TAM CM, whereas blockade of the IGF1 pathway in ID8 cells with an IGF1 neutralizing antibody effectively reversed the promotion of proliferation and migration. Finally, we inhibited the phosphorylation of insulin-like growth factor‑1 receptor (IGF1R) and its downstream molecules Akt and Erk with the IGF1R inhibitor linsitinib, and observed that the treatment effectively suppressed the proliferation and migration of ID8 cells exposed to TAM CM. Thus, we demonstrated that TAMs may promote the growth and metastasis of EOC via the activation of the IGF1 pathway; thus, targeting the IGF1 pathway may be promising for EOC therapy.
