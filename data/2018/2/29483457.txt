A 77-year-old man underwent extended right lobectomy of the liver for rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma. Recurrence in the inferior vena cava andright atrium was noted 30 months after surgery. We performedextirpation of this tumor thrombosis under retrograde cerebral perfusion during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. The pericardium was cut through sternotomy, and cooling was initiated. After cardiac arrest at 20.4Â°C, the inferior vena cava was separated. An incision was made in the right atrium andthe tumor thrombus was extirpated. In the meantime, brain protection was maintainedby retrograde cerebral perfusion. The patient was discharged on day 12 without postoperative complications. He remains alive 6 months after surgery without recurrence. This procedure prevented pulmonary embolism due to tumor thrombosis release. It was also possible to perform the procedure with retrograde cerebral perfusion.
