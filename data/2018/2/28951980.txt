SOCS3 as an important negative regulator of IL6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway may be early critical determinants of carcinogenesis. This study aimed to explore the aberrant promoter methylation of SOCS3 gene in circulating DNA as a noninvasive biomarker for screening hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) high-risk individuals and for prognosis of HCC patients after partial hepatectomy. We detected its methylation status in 116 liver tissues and 326 plasma specimens of different hepatic diseases and healthy subjects, and its mRNA and protein expression in tissues. Higher methylation rate was remarkably detected in HCC (47.92%), compared with corresponding non-tumor (25.0%), liver cirrhosis (LC) (10.0%), benign liver diseases (0%) and normal liver tissues (0%) (all P
