Objectives:To assess hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) survival and to investigate the prognostic role of immunonutritional biomarkers, as neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI), in a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients.Methods:All HIV-positive patients diagnosed with HCC at our Department from January 2000 to December 2013 were included. The outcomes were overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and liver-related death (LRD). To examine the role of inflammatory biomarkers on the outcomes, univariate and multivariable Cox regression models were used. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were implemented to evaluate the prediction role of NLR, PLR, and PNI.Results:A total of 40 patients (90% males) with a mean age of 48.3 years (SD = 5.6) were recruited. NLR ≥ 2.9 was associated with all causes mortality, as well as, PLR ≥ 126. NLR and PLR were predictors of OS, RFS, and LRD, while PNI did not emerge as a prognostic marker. According to the multivariate analysis, no HCC treatment was the only risk factor associated with risk of death. The areas under the ROC curves were 68.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.5-82.1) for PLR and 66.3 (95% CI, 54.3-78.2) for NLR at 3 years; similar results were found at 5 years of follow-up.Conclusions:Although, if examined singularly, NLR and PLR are prognostic factors for HCC recurrence and survival in HIV-infected patients, at the multivariate analysis, "no HCC treatment" remains the only independent risk factor associated with fatal outcome.
