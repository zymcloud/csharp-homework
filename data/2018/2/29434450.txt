Aim:To assess the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic liver disease due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).Methods:A retrospective cohort study was performed, including patients with chronic liver disease due to HBV or HCV, with and without HIV coinfection. Patients were selected in the largest tertiary public hospital complex in southern Brazil between January 2007 and June 2014. We assessed demographic and clinical data, including lifestyle habits such as illicit drug use or alcohol abuse, in addition to frequency and reasons for hospital admissions via medical records review.Results:Of 804 patients were included (399 with HIV coinfection and 405 monoinfected with HBV or HCV). Coinfected patients were younger (36.7 ± 10 vs 46.3 ± 12.5, P < 0.001). Liver cirrhosis was observed in 31.3% of HIV-negative patients and in 16.5% of coinfected (P < 0.001). HCC was diagnosed in 36 patients (10 HIV coinfected and 26 monoinfected). The incidence density of HCC in coinfected and monoinfected patients was 0.25 and 0.72 cases per 100 patient-years (95%CI: 0.12-0.46 vs 0.47-1.05) (long-rank P = 0.002), respectively. The ratio for the HCC incidence rate was 2.98 for HIV-negative. However, when adjusting for age or when only cirrhotic are analyzed, the absence of HIV lost statistical significance for the development of HCC.Conclusion:In this study, the presence of HIV coinfection in chronic liver disease due to HBV or HCV showed no relation to the increase of HCC incidence.
