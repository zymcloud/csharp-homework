Liver failure remains as the most common complication and cause of death after hepatectomy, and continues to be a challenge for doctors.t test and Ï‡ test were used for single factor analysis of data-related variables, then results were introduced into the model to undergo the multiple factors logistic regression analysis. Pearson correlation analysis was performed for related postoperative indexes, and a diagnostic evaluation was performed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of postoperative indexes.Differences in age, body mass index (BMI), portal vein hypertension, bile duct cancer, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), operation time, cumulative portal vein occlusion time, intraoperative blood volume, residual liver volume (RLV)/entire live rvolume, ascites volume at postoperative day (POD)3, supplemental albumin amount at POD3, hospitalization time after operation, and the prothrombin activity (PTA) were statistically significant. Furthermore, there were significant differences in total bilirubin and the supplemental albumin amount at POD3. ROC analysis of the average PTA, albumin amounts, ascites volume at POD3, and their combined diagnosis were performed, which had diagnostic value for postoperative liver failure (area under the curve (AUC): 0.895, AUC: 0.798, AUC: 0.775, and AUC: 0.903).Preoperative total bilirubin level and the supplemental albumin amount at POD3 were independent risk factors. PTA can be used as the index of postoperative liver failure, and the combined diagnosis of the indexes can improve the early prediction of postoperative liver failure.
