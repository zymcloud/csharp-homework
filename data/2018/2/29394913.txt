Background:Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) is a candidate diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Here, we determined the possible association of systemic TIMP-1 levels with cachexia and jaundice, two common PDAC-associated conditions.Methods:Plasma TIMP-1 was measured by ELISA in patients diagnosed with PDAC (n = 36) and chronic pancreatitis (CP) (n = 25). Patients without pancreatic pathologies and known malignancies of other origin served as controls (n = 13). TIMP-1 levels in these patients were tested for asscociation with jaundice and chachexia, and furthermore correlated with cachexia-related clinical parameters such as weight loss and ferritin, parameters of lung function, hemoglobin and liver synthesis parameters.Results:TIMP-1 plasma levels were mostly higher in CP and PDAC patients with concomitant jaundice or cachexia. Elevated plasma TIMP-1 levels were also associated with clinical cachexia markers, including absolute and relative values of weight loss and lung function, as well as ferritin, hemoglobin, and cholinesterase levels. TIMP-1 levels significantly correlated with cachexia only in patients without jaundice. Jaundice also impaired the use of TIMP-1 as a prognostic marker in cancer patients. Relating to cachexia status alone, a slightly improved association of TIMP-1 levels with survival of PDAC patients was observed.Conclusion:This retrospective study reports for the first time that plasma levels of TIMP-1 are associated with pancreatic lesion-induced cachexia in patients without jaundice. TIMP-1 is counterindicated as a survival marker in patients with jaundice.
