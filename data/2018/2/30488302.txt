Background:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is often repeated until unTACEable progression (UTP) occurs. There is little data on the various reasons for stopping TACE and its consequences for subsequent treatment and survival.Aim:To assess the impact of the various reasons of UTP on survival and consequences for subsequent treatments.Methods:Consecutive HCC patients who underwent TACE between 2003 and 2016 were analyzed retrospectively for the reason of TACE discontinuation. UTP was defined according to the EASL guidelines, considering radiological pattern of progression, liver function and performance status (PS). Overall and post-progression survival (OS, PPS) for different reasons of TACE discontinuation were compared. The correlation between time to untreatable progression by chemoembolization (TTUPc) and OS was analyzed.Results:One hundred and sixty-six patients (BCLC-A 40%, BCLC-B 54%, BCLC-C: 7%) were included, undergoing a median of 2 TACE procedures with a median OS of 22.1 months (95% CI 17.4-26.7). UTP occurred in 116 patients (70%) after a median TTUPc of 11.6 months (95% CI 7.8-15.4). There was a strong positive correlation (œÅ = 0.816, p Conclusion:The majority of HCC patients treated with TACE have UTP due to intrahepatic tumor progression with preserved liver function and PS, making them potential candidates for subsequent liver-directed or systemic treatment. TTUPc may be a valuable surrogate endpoint for OS in patients treated with TACE.Level of evidence:Level II, prognosis study.
