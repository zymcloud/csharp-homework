Background:There is currently limited information regarding the prognostic ability of the dNLR-PNI (the combination of the derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [dNLR] and prognostic nutritional index [PNI]) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to assess the predictive ability of the dNLR-PNI in patients with intermediate-to-advanced HCC after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:A total of 761 HCC patients were enrolled in the study. The dNLR-PNI was retrospectively calculated in these patients, as follows: patients with both an elevated dNLR and a decreased PNI, as determined using the cutoffs obtained from receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, were allocated a score of 2, while patients showing one or neither of these alterations were allocated a score of 1 or 0, respectively.Results:During the follow-up period, 562 patients died. Multivariate analysis suggested that elevated total bilirubin, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer C stage, repeated TACE, and dNLR-PNI were independently associated with unsatisfactory overall survival. The median survival times of patients with a dNLR-PNI of 0, 1, and 2 were 31.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 22.5-39.5), 16.0 (95% CI 12.2-19.7) and 6.0 (95% CI 4.8-7.2) months, respectively (P Conclusions:The dNLR-PNI can predict the survival outcomes of intermediate-to-advanced HCC patients undergoing TACE, and should be further evaluated as a prognostic marker for who are to undergo TACE treatment.
