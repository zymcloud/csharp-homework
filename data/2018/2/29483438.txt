Myocardial metastasis for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma(ESCC)is relatively rare and it is diagnosed as a part of widespread metastasis in the terminal stage. We experienced a case of myocardial metastasis of ESCC treated effectively with chemoradiotherapy. A 56-year-old man was diagnosed ESCC(clinical T3N2M0, Stage III). He received neoadjuvant chemotherapy of 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin followed by subtotal esophagectomy with dissection of the 3 regional lymph nodes. The pathological diagnosis was moderate differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, CT-pT3(T3), pN1, sM0, fStage III. Four months after surgery, he had no clinical symptom, however myocardial metastasis located in the apex was detected on the follow up positron emission tomography(PET). Chemoradiotherapy was performed for the myocardial metastasis. Myocardial metastasis treated effectively with chemoradiotherapy almost disappeared on the PET and computed tomography taken 3 months after chemoradiotherapy. He died, however, of multiple liver and bone metastases 15 months after the initial surgery.
