Magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as a promising tool for suicide gene therapy. However, the separate delivery of the suicide gene and prodrug in current systems limits their clinical translation. Therefore, improving magnetically mediated suicide gene therapy by exploring higher performance magnetic NP-based hybrid nanoplatforms is an important challenge. In the current study, shape-controlled magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (M-MSNs) were prepared, and their performance in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided, magnetically targeted and hyperthermia-enhanced suicide gene therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was investigated. Compared with sphere-like MSNs, rod-like MSNs exhibited higher loading capacity, faster prodrug release behavior, stronger magnetically enhanced gene delivery and better magnetic hyperthermia properties. Utilizing the improved magnetic properties of the M-MSNs allowed us to demonstrate highly effective dual magnetically enhanced suicide gene therapy in vivo with decreased systematic toxicity and with the ability to monitor therapeutic outcome by MRI. Because of their magnetic targeting abilities, magnetic hyperthermia performance and MRI properties, these M-MSNs might prove to be a potentially superior candidate for suicide gene therapy of HCC.
