Objectives:Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) is a life-threatening disease characterized by multiple small-vessel occlusions of rapid onset. Ischemic pancreatic duct lesions secondary to CAPS have never been reported.Methods:We describe 4 patients who presented lesions suspected to be intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas following a CAPS.Results:All patients had a history of CAPS months or years before the IPMN diagnosis. They had abdominal pain or abnormal liver test results and had undergone radiography. In a 36-year-old man, endoscopic ultrasonography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography demonstrated parietal thickening, stenoses and dilatations of the main pancreatic duct, which suggested IPMN. A pancreatic resection was performed because of presumed risk of malignancy. Histology revealed pancreatitis and thrombosis of small pancreatic vessels but no IPMN. The 3 other cases had lesions consistent with IPMN disclosed on MRI. From the first case experience, regular radiography surveillance was decided for the 3 other patients. After more than 4 years of follow-up, lesions remained unchanged.Conclusion:Physicians must be aware that these lesions may be encountered in CAPS and may closely mimic IPMN, with subsequent risk of performing unnecessary pancreatectomy.
