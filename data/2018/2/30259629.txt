Pediatric hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rare, resulting in scattered knowledge of tumor biology and molecular background. Thus far, the variant in children has been treated as a different entity from adult HCC. We weigh the hypothesis that HCC in the pediatric and adult groups may be the same entity and may benefit from the same treatment. Although certain differences between adult and pediatric HCC are obvious and certain types of HCC may ask for a customized approach, in conventional HCC, similarities predominate, warranting treatment aiming at common molecular targets in adult and pediatric HCC patients.
