Despite widespread distribution of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-genotype D, the clinical implications of its ten subgenotypes (D1-D10) have not been well documented. Here, we have investigated the impact of two major circulating HBV/D subgenotypes, D1 and D3 in Eastern India towards pathogenesis of liver disease progression to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV subgenotypes were determined using full-length genome sequences of HBV isolates from patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), liver cirrhosis (LC) and HCC. Impact of D1 and D3 on viral lifecycle and disease progression was assessed by several in vitro assays. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that HBV/D1 and HBV/D3 were the two predominating HBV subgenotypes circulating in Eastern India. Interestingly, the frequency of patients infected with HBV/D1 was noticed progressively rising from CHB to HCC through LC while the increasing frequency of HBV/D3 declined suddenly in HCC implicating HBV/D1 might have greater oncogenic potential than HBV/D3. Similar to higher viral load noted in HCC patients infected with HBV/D1 than HBV/D3, the larger amount of intracellular/extracellular viral DNA and secreted HBsAg levels in transfected cell lines also implicated that HBV/D1 might replicate faster than HBV/D3. Again, higher expression of marker genes related to endoplasmic reticulum stress, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, DNA double strand breaks, angiogenesis etc. and faster rate of cellular migration and anchorage independent growth cumulatively suggested that compared to HBV/D3, HBV/D1 generates more liver injuries which eventually culminates into HCC. Therefore, our results highlight the importance of determination of subgenotypes of HBV in CHB patients, so that high-risk individual can be monitor periodically that may help to detect HCC at early stages.
