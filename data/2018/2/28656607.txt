Aim:Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been recognized as a treatment option for patients with intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This randomized, controlled study compared the local control efficacy of TACE with miriplatin (platinum monohydrate) or with epirubicin.Methods:The study group consisted of 200 Japanese patients with unresectable HCC treated at the Kitasato University East Hospital (Sagamihara, Japan) between July 2010 and June 2013. The primary end-point of the study was time to tumor progression (TTP).Results:We analyzed 198 patients (99 in the miriplatin group and 99 in the epirubicin group) treated with TACE. The median TTP in the epirubicin group was 5.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.8-7.0) and 7.6 months (95% CI, 5.8-9.4) in the miriplatin group. There was a significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.021; risk ratio, 1.488; 95% CI: 1.061-2.086). In the epirubicin group, 53 patients (53%) had complete response, 24 patients (24%) had partial response, 12 patients (12%) had stable disease, and 10 patients (10%) had progressive disease. In the miriplatin group, 38 patients (38%) had complete response, 41 patients (41%) had partial response, 2 patients (2%) had stable disease, and 18 patients (18%) had progressive disease. There was no significant difference in the response rate (P = 0.862). Overall incidences of adverse events and adverse drug reactions did not differ significantly between the two groups.Conclusion:Miriplatin proved more effective than epirubicin in TACE for unresectable HCC. The trial described in this work has been registered under the trial number: UMIN000004790.
