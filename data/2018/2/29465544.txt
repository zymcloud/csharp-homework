The aim of this study was to evaluate different surgical therapies for hepatic alveolar echinococcosis in different clinical stages.We analyze the clinical data of 115 patients who received surgical treatment in West China Hospital from January 2004 to June 2016. Among these patients, 77 cases underwent radical hepatic resection (group A, n = 77); 17 cases underwent palliative resection (group B, n = 17), and 21 cases underwent liver transplantation (group C, n = 21) with 12 cases of orthotopic liver transplantation and 9 cases of liver autotransplantation.The postoperative complication rate of radical hepatic resection group was 13.0% (10/77), which is statistically significant (P < .05) than the rate of palliative resection group 29.4% (5/17) or liver transplantation group 23.8% (5/21). The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 72 months. The overall median survival rate of radical resection was 72/77, higher than the rate of palliative group (12/17) or transplantation group (17/21), which was also statistically significant (P < .01).In our study, we believe in that all stages of hepatic alveolar echinococcosis should take active surgical interventions, and radical hepatic resection should be considered as the first-choice treatment for early stage of alveolar echinococcosis, while palliative surgery is still helpful to relieve symptoms and improve the life quality for advanced patients. Liver transplantation might also be an alternative option for the late-stage hepatic alveolar echinococcosis.
