Background:KIF18A is associated with a variety of tumours; however, the specific mechanism of action of KIF18A in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. In this study, in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed with the aim of exploring the potential function and molecular mechanism of kinesin KIF18A in the occurrence and development of HCC.Methods:We detected the expression of KIF18A in tumour and adjacent tissues as well as cell proliferation, cell invasion and migration in hepatoma cells after silencing KIF18A. KIF18A-silenced hepatoma cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice to verify the tumorigenicity of KIF18A. We also detected the expression of signal pathway-related proteins in hepatoma cells after KIF18A knockdown with the aim of exploring the association between KIF18A and related signalling pathways.Results:The level of KIF18A protein was higher in liver cancer tissues than adjacent tissues. After silencing KIF18A in SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells, cell growth was obviously inhibited; the migration and invasion abilities were significantly decreased and the in vivo tumour weight was decreased compared to the control group (0.201 ± 0.088 g vs 0.476 ± 0.126 g, p = 0.009). The expression of cell cycle-related protein (cyclin B1), invasion and metastasis-related proteins (MMP-7 and MMP-9) and Akt-related proteins in hepatoma cells was also decreased after knocking down KIF18A.Conclusions:KIF18A may promote proliferation, invasion and metastasis of HCC cells by promoting the cell cycle signalling pathway as well as the Akt and MMP-7/MMP-9-related signalling pathways and may serve as a new target for the diagnosis and treatment of HCC.
