Background and objectives:Neoadjuvant chemoradiation and liver transplantation may be offered for unresectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (pCCA). This study aimed to determine the dropout rate and survival of patients who entered a national tri-modality protocol.Method:Patients enrolled Jan 2009-Aug 2015 were included. Enrolment criteria: â‰¤65 years, brush biopsy-proven unresectable pCCA <3.5 cm diameter. Conformal radiotherapy was given concurrently with Capecitabine. Following surgical staging, patients received maintenance Cisplatin and Gemcitabine until transplant or progression. Time to event analyses were performed from start of neoadjuvant therapy.Results:Of 43 patients screened, 18 started treatment; median age 53.9 (26.7-62.8) years, tumour diameter 2.7 (2.0-3.4) cm. 11/18 dropped out due to metastatic disease identified during chemoradiation (n = 2), surgical staging (n = 6), or maintenance chemotherapy (n = 3). Six patients underwent transplantation. Median follow up was 17.6 (4.9-57.7) months and overall survival 16.4 months. One and two year survival was 70.6% and 35.3%, respectively. One and 2 year post transplant survival was 83.3% and 55.6%. Median progression free survival was 11.5 months.Conclusion:Neoadjuvant chemoradiation and liver transplantation for unresectable early stage pCCA is feasible, although with high rates of dropout and disease progression. Further research is required to determine factors to help select patients for treatment.
