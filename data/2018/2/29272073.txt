Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a common cause of chronic liver disease (CLD), has a global prevalence of 25%. Its progressive form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is a leading indication for liver transplantation (LT) in the United States. As a result, specialty societies, including the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver, have developed guidance on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of NAFLD and NASH. Therefore, the transplant team must be well versed in the state of current knowledge about NAFLD and transplant-specific issues for this increasingly important indication for LT.
