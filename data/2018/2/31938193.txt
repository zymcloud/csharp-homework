Objective:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a global public health concern that lacks efficient methods for early diagnosis. Accumulated evidence has revealed great potential using microRNAs (miRNAs) as noninvasive biomarkers in HCC detection.Methods:Serum miRNAs (miR21, miR122, miR-214, miR15b, and let-7f) were detected in 75 patients with HCC and 80 healthy controls (HC). In addition, 75 HCC tissues and paired normal adjacent tissues were also analyzed for comparison. Quantified by real-time quantitative RT-PCR was used to evaluate the expression of miRNAs.Results:We discovered significant up-regulation of miR-21 (P P = 0.012) were independently associated with HCC whereas miR-214 (OR = 0.631, P = 0.006) was associated with a decreased risk of HCC. When we employed miR-(21 + 122 + 15b) classifier as biomarkers, we could discriminate HCC tissues from adjacent non-tumor tissues with an AUC of 0.885 (specificity: 89.7%; sensitivity: 73.1%). In serum, the cluster of miR-(21 + 214 + 15b) classifier (AUC = 0.887) had a sensitivity of 80.3% and a specificity of 87.0% for HCC diagnosis.Conclusion:Our results suggest that these serum miRNAs may be useful markers for discriminating HCC patients from healthy controls. Combined determination of circulating miR-21, miR-122, miR-214, and miR-15b has great potential to serve as an accurate and noninvasive biomarker for the early HCC preliminary screening.
