Objective To prepare lentiviruses expressing shRNA sequences targeting human signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and detect the effect of STAT3 knockdown on type I interferon (IFN1)-induced proliferation and migration in HepG2 cells. Methods Four STAT3-targeting shRNA sequences (shRNA1-shRNA4) and one control sequence (Ctrl shRNA) were selected and cloned respectively into pLKO.1-sp6-pgk-GFP to construct shRNA-expressing vectors. Along with backbone psPAX2 and pMD2.G vectors, they were separately transfected into HEK293T cells to prepare lentiviruses. HepG2 cells were infected with the lentiviruses. Cytoplastic STAT3 level was detected by Western blotting to screen effective shRNA sequence(s) targeting STAT3. Proliferation and migration of HepG2 cells were analyzed by CCK-8 assay and TranswellTM migration and scratching assay, respectively. To detect the effect of IFN1 on cell proliferation and migration of HepG2 cells, the cells were treated with 2000 U/mL IFNα2b for indicated time and the activation of IFN-triggered STAT1 signal transduction was assayed by Western blotting. Results Two most effective STAT3-targeting shRNA sequences shRNA1 and shRNA2 were selected, and the expression of both STAT3 shRNA significantly decreased proliferation and migration of HepG2 cells. When treated with IFNα2b, 2000 U/mL of IFN1 showed more competent in attenuating growth and migration of HepG2 cells. Our data further proved that knockdown of STAT3 increased the phosphorylation of STAT1, and IFNα2b further enhanced the activation of STAT1 signaling in HepG2 cells. Conclusion Knockdown of STAT3 inhibits cell migration and growth, and rescues IFN response through up-regulating STAT1 signal transduction in HepG2 hepatoma cells.
