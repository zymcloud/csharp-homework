This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated dexamethasone efficacy at preventing fever, anorexia, and nausea/vomiting, the most frequent adverse events of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Child-Pugh class A/B patients with HCC and no macrovascular invasion/extrahepatic metastases were randomly assigned to either a dexamethasone regimen (day 1, intravenous dexamethasone [20 mg] and granisetron [3 mg] before TACE; days 2 and 3, intravenous dexamethasone [8 mg]) or a control regimen (day 1, intravenous placebo [saline] and granisetron [3 mg]; days 2 and 3, intravenous placebo). The primary endpoint was complete response, defined as the absence of grade â‰¥1 fever, anorexia, or nausea/vomiting according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0) and no use of rescue therapy for 120 hours after TACE. A total of 120 patients between October 2010 and June 2013 were randomly assigned to treatment groups. Overall the complete response rate was greater with the dexamethasone regimen than with the control regimen (47.5%, 95% confidence interval 34.3%-60.9%, versus 10.2%, 95% confidence interval 3.8%-20.8%; P
