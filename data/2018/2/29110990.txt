Background:Portal hypertension (PHTN) increases the risk of non-hepatic surgery in cirrhotic patients. This first systematic review analyzes the place of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in preparation for non-hepatic surgery in such patients.Methods:Medline, EMBASE, and Scopus databases were searched from 1990 to 2017 to identify reports on outcomes of non-hepatic surgery in cirrhotic patients with PHTN prepared by TIPS. Feasibility of TIPS and the planned surgery, and the short- and long-term outcomes of the latter were assessed.Results:Nineteen studies (64 patients) were selected. TIPS was indicated for past history of variceal bleeding and/or ascites in 22 (34%) and 33 (52%) patients, respectively. The planned surgery was gastrointestinal tract cancer in 38 (59%) patients, benign digestive or pelvic surgery in 21 (33%) patients and others in 4 (6%) patients. The TIPS procedure was successful in all, with a nil mortality rate. All patients could be operated within a median delay of 30 days from TIPS (mortality rate = 8%; overall morbidity rate = 59.4%). One year overall survival was 80%.Conclusions:TIPS allows non-hepatic surgery in cirrhotic patients deemed non operable due to PHTN. Further evidence in larger cohort of patients is essential for wider applicability.
