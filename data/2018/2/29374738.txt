Background/aim:The aim of this study was to assess the appropriateness of pulmonary metastasectomy (MT), with a focus on the primary organ.Patients and methods:The pathological status of the primary organ, outcome of the MT, disease-free interval, and overall survival were assessed.Results:The primary organ was the most significant prognostic factor analyzed, with a relative risk of 4.6 (95% confidence interval: 1.69-12.56, p=0.003). Patients with colorectal carcinoma had a better survival than those with another primary organ (p=0.003). The hazard ratios by primary organ in comparison to colorectal carcinoma were 3.2 for head and neck carcinoma, 3.5 for soft tissue sarcoma, 8.3 for hepatocellular carcinoma, and 8.9 for urinary carcinoma.Conclusion:Colorectal carcinoma is associated with a greater survival benefit than cancer of other primary organs. Colorectal carcinoma cases should be more aggressively considered for MT than other primary organ cases.
