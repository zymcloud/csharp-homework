The current study investigates the phytochemical and pharmaceutical activities of Sargassium vulgare (SVE) collected from the Suez Canal. The prescreening using cytotoxicity was tested against hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. Furthermore the SVE inhibit cell growth effectively with IC50 = 20.8 Âµg/ml. The pharmacological studies revealed high antioxidant capacity at all examined concentrations. On the meantime, anticancer assay carried out using tyrosine kinase (PTK) and sphingosine kinase 1 inhibitor screening assays revealed inhibition with 75.73 and 80.01%; respectively. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory profiling revealed that the activities against COX1, COX2, IL6 and TNF were 77.39, 88.35, 75.38 and 71.24%; respectively. Additionally, the anti-Alzheimer results showed high activity at 1 mg with 76.33%. Finally the antiviral activities using reverse transcriptase inhibition assay give 92.24%. Consequently, it can be easily conclude that the SVE collected from the Suez Canal are excellent source of natural products for nutritional and pharmaceutical applications.
