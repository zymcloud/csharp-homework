Chemical investigation of the resinous exudates of Commiphora myrrha has led to the isolation of four sesquiterpenes (1a/1b, 2, and 3), including one pair of new sesquiterpene enantiomers (1a/1b), one new racemic mixture 2, and two steroids (4 and 5). Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, and the absolute configurations of 1a/1b were determined by CD analysis. The antimigratory potential of compounds 1-5 were evaluated and compound 3 was found to inhibit human hepatocellular liver carcinoma HepG2 cell migration in dose-dependent manner.
