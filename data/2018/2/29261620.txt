Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan on a 70-year-old man with recently diagnosed prostate cancer revealed a spiculating nodule in the apex of the left lung with intense Ga-PSMA uptake. The nodule had no pathological F-FDG uptake and turned out to be a primary adenocarcinoma of the lung. Cases with complementary pattern of uptake in F-FDG and Ga-PSMA in metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma and in well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma have previously been reported; however, this case illustrates that this unusual pattern can also be present in primary lung cancer.
