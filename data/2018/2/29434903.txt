Liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) have important roles in the occurrence, development, recurrence, therapy resistance and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, intensive studies are undergoing to identify the mechanisms by which LCSCs contribute to HCC invasion and metastasis, and to design more efficient treatments for this disease. With continuous efforts in LCSC research over the years, therapies targeting LCSCs are thought to have great potential for the clinical treatment and prognosis of liver cancer. Novel LCSC surface markers are continuously discovered and several have been used in targeted therapies to reduce HCC recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance following tumor resection. The present review describes the surface markers characterizing LCSCs and the recent progress in therapies targeting these markers, including antibodies and polypeptides.
