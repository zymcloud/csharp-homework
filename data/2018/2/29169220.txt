Ingredients of soy and fermented soy products have been widely utilized as food supplements for health-enhancing properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of fermented soymilk (FSM) and soymilk (SM) on free fatty acid-induced lipogenesis in the hepatocellular steatosis model. HepG2 cells were incubated with palmitic acid (PA) for 24 h to induce lipogenesis and accumulation of intracellular lipid contents. The PA-treated cells were co-incubated with FSM, SM, genistein, and estrogen, respectively. Lipid accumulation in the PA-treated HpG2 cells was significantly decreased by co-incubation with FSM. Treatment of HepG2 cells with PA combined with genistein or estrogen significantly increased the expression of SREBP-1. However, FSM co-incubation significantly attenuated SREBP-1 expression in the PA-treated HepG2 cells; in addition, expression of NRF-2 and phosphorylation of ERK were significantly increased in the PA and FSM co-incubated cells. PA-induced ROS production was significantly reduced by FSM and SM. Our results suggested that the bioactive components of FSM could protect hepatocytes against the lipid accumulation and ROS production induced by free fatty acids. These effects may be mediated by the inhibition of SREBP-1 and the activation of NRF-2 via the ERK pathway in HepG2 cells.
