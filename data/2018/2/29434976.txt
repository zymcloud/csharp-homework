The present study developed a novel laboratory-based algorithm to predict long-term survival rates in patients undergoing curative resection for solitary hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study included 426 patients with solitary HBV-related HCC who underwent surgery for primary tumors at a single center between 2003 and 2012. Demographic characteristics, laboratory analysis, clinical pathology and immunohistochemistry of topoisomerase II-a and Ki67 were analyzed. A simple prognostic risk calculator was developed using regression coefficients from multivariate models. A prognostic risk calculator incorporating tumor encapsulation, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, vascular invasion, α-fetoprotein level, Edmondson-Steiner classification, Topo II-α, prognostic nutritional index and Child-Pugh grade was constructed. The prognostic model demonstrated good discrimination with a C-index prior to adjustment of 0.81 (95% confidence interval: 0.78-0.84) and a bootstrap-corrected C-index of 0.81. Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated that the probabilities of overall survival rates in the low-risk group were increased compared with those in the high-risk group. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve using the method were greater compared with those under the 7th Tumor-Node-Metastasis system and Cancer of the Liver Italian Program scoring system [0.83 vs. 0.62 and 0.77 (P
