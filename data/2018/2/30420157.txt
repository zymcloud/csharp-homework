Background and objectives:Delayed hepatectomy is the preferred approach for spontaneous rupture of resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, delayed surgery for ruptured HCC may increase the risk of peritoneal metastasis.Methods:A retrospective analysis was conducted on the pooled data obtained from 44 HCC patients with spontaneously ruptured hemorrhage, These patients were divided into emergency group and delayed group. Perioperative events, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates, and the incidence of recurrent and metastatic disease were compared between these two groups.Results:Median survival time was 17.0 months in the emergency group vs. 28.0 months in the delayed group. In the emergency group, the 6-month, 1-year and 3-year OS rates were 58.8%, 57.6% and 11.5%. In the delayed hepatectomy group, the 6-month, 1-year and 3-year OS rates of were 84.3%, 77.5% and 37.8%. The incidence of peritoneal metastasis was higher in delayed group than in the emergency group, but the difference was not statistically significant (40.7% vs. 35.3%, P > 0.05).Conclusion:Delayed hepatectomy warrants better short-term prognosis, compared with emergency hepatectomy, for HCC patients with spontaneously ruptured hemorrhage. Delayed hepatectomy does not increase the possibility of postoperative peritoneal metastasis.
