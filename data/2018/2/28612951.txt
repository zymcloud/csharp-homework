Background and aim:Over the past decade, the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and viral hepatitis has been improved. We explored survival trends and factors affecting survival of HCC in a hepatitis B virus (HBV)-endemic population.Methods:From 31 521 and 38 167 HCC registrants to the population-based national cancer registry in Korea, an HBV-endemic country, in the period of 2003-2005 and 2008-2010, we randomly sampled cohorts of 4515 and 4582 patients, respectively, for the investigation of clinical characteristics and survival.Results:Compared with Cohort 2003-2005, Cohort 2008-2010 had significantly better liver function (Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A, 64.2% vs 71.6%; P Conclusions:The consistent improvement in survival of patients with HCC was confined to HBV-related HCC subcohort over the last decade in an HBV-endemic population. The survival improvement coincided with the exponential use of oral antiviral agents for HBV in the patients.
