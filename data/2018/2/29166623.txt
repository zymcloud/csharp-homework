Drawbacks and limitations of recently available therapies to hepatocellular cancer (HCC) devoted the scientist to focus on emerging new strategies. ZnO nanoparticles (ZnONPs) based chemotherapeutics has been emanating as a promising approach to maximize therapeutic synergy facilitating the discovery of novel multitargeted combinations. In the present study we conjugated ZnONPs with ferulic acid (ZnONPs-FAC) characterized by computational, spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. In vitro anticancer potential has been evaluated by assessing cell viability, morphology, ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane permeability, comet assay, immunofluorescent staining of 8-OHdG, Ki67 and Î³-H2AX, cell cycle analysis and western blot analysis and in vivo anticancer potential against DEN induced HCC was analyzed by histopathological and immunohistochemical methods. The results revealed that ZnONPs-FAC induces cell death through apoptosis and can suppress the DEN-induced HCC. Our study documents therapeutic potential of nanoparticle conjugated with phytochemicals, suggesting a new platform for combinatorial chemotherapy.
