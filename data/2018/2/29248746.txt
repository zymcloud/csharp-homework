In early 2017, the Hepatitis B Foundation invited 30 experts in the fields of hepatitis B and liver cancer research to identify projects they deemed important to the goal of finding a cure for chronic hepatitis B and D and the diseases with which these viral infections are associated. They were also asked to identify general categories of research and to prioritize sub-project topics within those areas. The experts generally agreed on broadly defined areas of research, but there was usually little difference between the highest and lowest scoring projects; for the most part, all programs described in this document were considered valuable and necessary. An executive summary of this discussion was recently published (Alter et al., Hepatology 2017). The present manuscript reports the areas of research identified by the workshop participants, provides a brief rationale for their selection, and attempts to express differences among the priorities assigned to each area of research, when such distinctions were expressed.
