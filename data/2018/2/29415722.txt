Background:Although liver resection (LR) provides the best chance of long-term survival for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) hepatic metastasis, concerns regarding chemotherapy before liver resection remain unresolved.Methods:A retrospective review of patients who underwent curative LR for CRC hepatic metastasis between January 2008 and February 2016 was performed. Outcome relevance based on oncologic prognostic factors and chemotherapy prior to liver resection was assessed.Results:Patients who had received pre-hepatectomy chemotherapy for CRC hepatic metastasis and delayed liver resection had a worse outcome in terms of CRC recurrence following liver resection. The hazard ratio (HR) of pre-hepatectomy chemotherapy in patients with minor oncologic prognostic factors was 1.55 (confidence interval, CI = 1.07-2.26, p = 0.021) for CRC recurrence after liver resection for hepatic metastasis, whereas the HR of pre-hepatectomy chemotherapy was 1.34 (CI = 0.99-1.81, p = 0.062) for CRC recurrence in patients with multiple oncologic prognostic factors.Conclusion:The administration of pre-hepatectomy chemotherapy and delaying liver resection seems not to be an optimal strategy to provide a clinical benefit for patients with CRC hepatic metastasis. Hence, liver resection should be attempted without delay at the initial detection of CRC hepatic metastasis whenever possible.
