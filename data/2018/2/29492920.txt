Objective:To evaluate the safty and feasibility of the D2 radical resection of omental bursa and No.12p and No.8p for gastric carcinoma (GC).Methods:Clinical data of 1801 GC patients undergoing D2 radical resection of omental bursa and No.12p and No.8p at Fujian Medical University Cancer Hospital from January 2000 to January 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. Inclusion case criteria: (1)age of 18 to 90 years;(2)pathologically diagnosed as GC and receiving D2 radical resection of omental bursa and No.12p and No.8p;(3)complete clinical, pathological and follow-up data; (4)operation performed by same leading surgeon;(5)exclusion of other gastric malignancies, postoperative relapse of GC, and other simultaneous or heterochronous primary malignancies. Surgical procedure points: (1)The outer part of the peritoneum of duodenum descending was cut; the serosa was migrated to the anterior leaf of the gastrointestinal ligament. (2)The posterior lobe of the gastrocolic ligament and the transverse mesocolon were separated bluntly from left side to reach the omentum attaching to the colon portion; incision was made at the edge of the omentum attaching to the transverse colon behind the gastrocolic ligament; the leaves were turned to the anterior mesenteric anterior leaflets, and the entire anterior leaflet of the transverse mesentery was free.(3)The pancreas was separated, and resection of the posterior wall of the omentum sac continued up so that the entire retinal capsule was free; along the edge of the liver the attachment of the omentum was cut to reach the front of esophagus, and transverse incision was made in abdominal peritoneal layer of the esophagus, and then turned to the spleen on the pole; from the obturator to the esophagus incision was performed behind the peritoneum for the net; the uppermost edge of the resection of the capsule was performed as the posterior peritoneal incision to the right edge of the esophagus and was connected with the posterior parietal lobe of the previous resection; the posterior peritoneum was attached along the right edge of the esophagus and descended to the celiac artery; the posterior wall of the omental sac was removed. In the meantime, the liver duodenum ligament was cut, and the portal vein, hepatic artery trilocular was formed. Then the ligament lymph nodes were cleared.(4)The lymph nodes of celiac artery and its major branches were cleared; the envelope in front of pancreas and the part of the pancreas in posterior abdomen were resected; spleen and part of the pancreas tail were free.Results:A total of 1801 cases were enrolled, including 1292 males and 509 females with a ratio of 2.54 with a mean age of(58.9±11.5)(18 to 89) years. The proportion of cases with T1a, T1b, T2, T3, T4a and T4b was 4.8% (87 cases), 6.6% (118 cases), 10.7% (193 cases), 17.5% (315 cases), 55.7% (1003 cases) and 4.7%(85 cases) respectively. All the patients completed operations successfully. The mean number of harvested lymph node was 28.5±13.7(10 to 85). Lymph node metastasis was found in 1439 cases (79.9%), including 180 cases (10.0%) in No.12p and 232 cases(12.9%) in No.8p respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that in T1a, T1b, T2, T3, T4a and T4b stage, the proportion of No.12p was 0, 1.7% (2/118), 5.2%(10/193), 10.5% (33/315), 12.4% (124/1003) and 12.9%(11/85) respectively, and the proportion of No.8p was 0, 0.8%(1/118), 2.1%(4/193), 4.8%(15/315), 18.9%(190/1003), and 25.9%(22/85) respectively. Postoperative complications were found in 195 patients (10.8%), including 63 cases(3.5%) of peritoneal infection, 52 cases (2.9%) of pulmonary infection, 33 cases(1.8%) of pancreatic leakage, 37 cases (2.1%) of anastomotic fistula, 45 cases (2.5%) of intestinal obstruction and 13 cases(0.7%) of gastroplesia. The 5-year overall survival rate was 53.6%.Conclusion:D2 radical resection of omental bursa and No.12p and No.8p is safe and feasible in the treatment of gastric cancer.
