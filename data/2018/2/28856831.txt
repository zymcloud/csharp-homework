Solitary mediastinal lymph node metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rare. We report a case of metachronically solitary mediastinal metastases of HCC treated by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) twice. A 66-year-old man underwent repeated laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation or trans-arterial catheter chemo-embolization against HCC for more than 10 years. The level of alpha fetoprotein protein was elevated, and radiological modalities including FDG-PET revealed solitary mediastinal tumor metachronically. VATS was performed bilaterally twice. The postoperative course was uneventful and there had no recurrence of extra-hepatic metastases and tumor markers are within normal limits at 18 months after second VATS. VATS is a minimally invasive and useful procedure for solitary mediastinal lymph node metastasis of HCC. If primary HCC was controlled and lymph node metastasis was solitary, mediastinum lymphadenectomy using VATS might give good short and long term results.
