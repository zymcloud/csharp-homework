Aim:The predictors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment were investigated.Methods:A total of 1174 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection were treated with DAA therapy (sofosbuvir and ledipasvir [n = 615], sofosbuvir and ribavirin [n = 380], and daclatasvir and asunaprevir [n = 179]) and achieved sustained virologic response (SVR). The HCC development rate and the factors that might contribute to the development of HCC after the end of DAA treatment were analyzed.Results:During the median observation period of 537 days, HCC developed in 33 cases. The incidence of HCC was 1.9%, 3.2%, and 4.1% at 1, 1.5, and 2 years after the end of DAA therapy, respectively. Multivariate analysis with pre- and post-treatment factors identified the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.021-1.178; P = 0.011) and post-treatment Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) (HR = 1.11; 95% CI, 1.054-1.172; P Conclusions:A high FIB-4 index and a high post-treatment AFP at the end of DAA treatment were the independent predictors for developing HCC after DAA treatment. For patients with these risk factors, extra attention to the possibility of HCC development is needed.
