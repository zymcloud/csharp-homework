Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver diseases including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Approximately 3% of the world population is infected with HCV. Thus, HCV infection is considered a public healthy challenge. It is worth mentioning, that the HCV prevalence is dependent on the countries with infection rates around 20% in high endemic countries. The review summarizes recent data on HCV molecular biology, the physiopathology of infection (immune-mediated liver damage, liver fibrosis and lipid metabolism), virus diagnostic and treatment. In addition, currently available in vitro, ex vivo and animal models to study the virus life cycle, virus pathogenesis and therapy are described. Understanding of both host and viral factors may in the future lead to creation of new approaches in generation of an efficient therapeutic vaccine.
