Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a lethal malignancy worldwide with frequent intrahepatic and distant metastasis. Elucidating the underlying molecular mechanism that modulates HCC progression is critical for exploring novel therapeutic strategies. Serine/Threonine Kinase 17B (STK17B) is upregulated in HCC tissues, but its role in HCC progression remains elusive. In the present studies, we reported that STK17B had a critical role in HCC progression. STK17B was significantly upregulated in HCC cell lines and specimens, and patients with ectopic STK17B expression characterized with poor clinicopathological features. In vitro and in vivo assay demonstrated that inhibition of STK17B markedly inhibits HCC tumorigenesis and metastasis, while STK17B overexpression promoted these processes. Furthermore, we found that STK17B promoted EMT process via activating AKT/GSK-3β/Snail signal pathway, and miR-455-3p was identified as the upstream regulator of STK17B. Combination of high level of STK17B and low level of miR-455-3p predicted poor prognosis with higher accuracy for HCC patients. In conclusion, our research demonstrated that STK17B promotes HCC progression, induces EMT process via activating AKT/GSK-3β/Snail signal and predicts poor prognosis in HCC.
