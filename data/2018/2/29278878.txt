Background:The role of serum biomarkers in the surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial.Objective:We assessed the diagnostic performances of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein-induced by vitamin-K-absence/antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) in 388 cirrhotic patients with chronic liver disease (CLD).Methods:Biomarkers were quantified by automated chemiluminescent-enzyme-immunoassays (Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan) at HCC diagnosis in 258 patients (204 males; median age 66.9 years) and in 130 cirrhotics without HCC (104 males; median-age 60.6 years). CLD etiology in HCC/non-HCC was CHB in 48/35, CHC in 126/56 and Non-Viral in 84/39.Results:Overall AUROC values for AFP and PIVKA-II were 0.698 (95%CI = 0.642-0.753, PConclusion:The diagnostic performance of AFP and PIVKA-II is significantly influenced by the etiology and activity of CLD; their combination provides a better diagnostic accuracy.
