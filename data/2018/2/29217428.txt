Cancer cells exhibited the aberrant cancer-associated glycans that are potential biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring of the cancer. In this study, Sophora japonica agglutinin (SJA) was used to detect SJA-specific N-acetylgalactosamine-associated glycans (SNAG) in liver tissues and sera from cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patients. Whether SNAG could be the diagnostic and prognostic markers for CCA was evaluated. SJA-histochemistry revealed that SNAG was undetec2 in normal bile ducts but was highly expressed in hyperplastic/dysplastic bile ducts and CCA. SNAG was negative in hepatocytes and hepatoma tissues indicating SNAG as a differential marker of CCA and hepatoma. SJA-histochemistry of CCA hamster tissues revealed the involvement of SNAG in the early pathogenesis of bile duct epithelia and CCA development. A SJA-based ELISA was successfully developed to determine SNAG in serum. Serum-SNAG from CCA patients was significantly higher than those of non-CCA control groups with the diagnostic values of 59.5% sensitivity and 73.6% specificity, comparable to those of serum CA19-9. High levels of serum SNAG (â‰¥69AU/ml) indicated poor survival of CCA patients. Taken together, SNAG was first demonstrated here to be a glycobiomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of CCA. Association of SNAG with pathogenesis of bile ducts and CCA development were suggested. (198).
