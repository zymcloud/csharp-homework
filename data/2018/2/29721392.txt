The Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonists as polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly (I:C)) have been implicated as potential immunotherapy adjuvant for cancer whereas the exact roles of TLR3 agonists in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment have not been clearly evaluated. In consistent with previous reports, we found that poly (I:C) triggering of TLR3 inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in HCC cells. However, poly (I:C), when used at lower concentration that cannot remarkably inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in HCC cells, enhanced the migration and invasion in vitro and the metastasis in vivo. More importantly, we found that bufalin, a prominent component of toad venom, could suppress poly (I:C)-inspired migration, invasion and metastasis of HCC cells despite that bufalin could not potentiate poly (I:C)-induced inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. In MHCC97 H cells, bufalin impaired poly (I:C)-induced activation of Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) pathway and NF-κB pathway. Inhibitor for TBK1 but not NF-κB suppressed poly (I:C)-inspired migration and invasion, which was further supported by using TBK1 deficient (Tbk1-/- ) cells. In another model using poly (I:C) transfection, bufalin could also suppress the migration and invasion of HCC cells, which was not observed in Tbk1-/- MHCC97 H cells. Our data suggest that bufalin can suppress the metastasis of HCC cells in poly (I:C) therapy by impairing TBK1 activation, indicating that bufalin may be used in combination with poly (I:C) therapy in HCC treatment for the sake of reversing poly (I:C)-triggered metastasis of HCC cells.
