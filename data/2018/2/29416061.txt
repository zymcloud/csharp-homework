The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) in patients undergoing hepatectomy and to compare it to established biomarkers including the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR). Medical records were retrospectively analyzed for 652 HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy at the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University and the First People's Hospital of Changde between April 2004 to April 2012. The correlation between the LMR and clinical variables were analyzed in Kaplan-Meier log-rank survival analysis and then multivariate Cox regression models trying to find relation with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the LMR(AUC:0.627) for predicting long-term survival was greater than that of the NLR(AUC:0.600) and the PLR(AUC:0.520).Multivariate analysis showed LMR to be an independent risk factor for OS (P = 0.002), and the NLR and PLR were not independently significant. Subgroup analysis also showed that LMR was significantly associated with poor DFS and OS in patients positive for HBsAg or with cirrhosis (both P
