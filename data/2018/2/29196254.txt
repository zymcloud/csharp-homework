The aim of the study was to investigate the role of adiponectin and 5 variants of its gene in the risk of premature myocardial infarction (MI). The studied group (MI<50) consisted of 158 young patients (125 men) aged <50 with MI. The control groups consisted of 155 healthy people (97 men), aged <50 and 202 patients (130 men) aged ≥50 with MI (MI≥50). There were statistically significant differences between MI<50 patients and healthy control group in the prevalence of rs17300539:G>A (AA genotype: 19.3% vs. 0%, p<0.0001) and rs72563731:C>T variants (CC genotype: 81.5% vs. 15.9%, p<0.0001) and between MI<50 and MI≥50 patients in variants: rs17300539:G>A (AA genotype: 19.3% vs. 0.5%, p<0.0001), rs72563731:C>T (CC genotype: 82.1% vs. 60.8%, p<0.0001), rs1501299:G>T (TT genotype: 6.8% vs. 14.9%, p=0.019) and rs822387:T>C (genotype CC: 1.5% vs. 0%, p=0.017). Multivariate analysis showed a significantly higher risk of MI in young CC carriers of rs72563731:C>T and in young AA carriers of rs17300539:G>A. Total and HMW adiponectin plasma levels have been significantly lower in MI<50 patients in comparison to MI≥50 patients (p=0.001 and p=0.001, respectively) and to healthy subjects (p=0.009 and p=0.01, respectively). Our study indicates the possible role of adiponectin and its genetic variants in MI in young age.
