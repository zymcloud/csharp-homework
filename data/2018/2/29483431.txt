We report 2 cases of prolonged survival achieved with surgical resection and multidisciplinary therapy for acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas with liver metastases.Case 1: The patient was a 55-year-old woman.She presented with upper right abdominal pain and anemia.We diagnosed a tumor originating from the pancreas and multiple liver metastases.To avoid death caused by bleeding from the tumor, we performed pancreaticoduodenectomy and right-hemi hepatectomy, and a rapid diagnosis of acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas was confirmed intraoperatively.After the hospital discharge, we administered hepatic intra-arterial chemotherapy and performed microwave ablation for the remnant liver metastases.Additionally, systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine was administered; however, multiple metastases of the lung and liver became uncontrollable and she died 2 and half years postoperatively.Case 2: The patient was a 42-year-old woman.Through a medical checkup, gastric varix and elevated tumor markers were detected.The examination revealed a tumor at the tail of the pancreas and liver metastasis.We performed distal pancreatomy and partial liver resection.The pathological diagnosis was acinar cell carcinoma and liver metastasis.We administered adjuvant chemotherapy by using gemcitabine and achieved 5 years of relapse-free survival.The prognosis of ACC is better than that for PDAC.However, prognosis of unresectable cases is still unfavorable.Therapeutic strategies including aggressive surgical resection for metastatic ACC are worthy of consideration.
