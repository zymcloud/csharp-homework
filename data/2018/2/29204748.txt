The glypican-3 (GPC3) receptor is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target. GPC3-targeted molecular imaging will be helpful to differentiate diagnosis and guide therapy. In the present study, we will develop a novel PET probe for imaging the expression of GPC-3. L5 (sequence: RLNVGGTYFLTTRQ), a GPC3 targeting peptide, was labeled with 5-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and 18F-fluoride. Cell binding tests were performed to identify the binding specificity of FAM-L5 and 18F radiolabeled peptide. MicroPET/CT imaging was used to determine the potential of a novel PET tracer for visualizing HCC tumors with a high expression of GPC3. In vitro binding tests showed that the uptake of FAM-L5 in HepG2 cells (high expression of GPC3) was significantly higher than that of HL-7702 cells (negative expression of GPC3) (mean fluorescent intensity: 14,094 ± 797 vs. 2765 ± 314 events, t = 32.363, P = 0.000). Confocal fluorescent imaging identified that FAM-L5 accumulated where the GPC3 receptor was located. A novel PET tracer (18F-AlF-NODA-MP-6-Aoc-L5) was successfully labeled by chelation chemistry. In vitro cell uptake studies showed that 18F-AlF-NODA-MP-6-Aoc-L5 can bind to HepG2 tumor cells and was stable in PBS and mouse serum stability tests. MicroPET/CT showed that HepG2 tumors could be clearly visualized with a tumor/muscle ratio of 2.46 ± 0.53. However, the tumor/liver ratio was low (0.93 ± 0.16) due to the high physiological uptake in the liver. This study demonstrates that FAM and the 18F-labeled L5 peptide can selectively target HCC with a high expression of GPC3 in vitro and in vivo. 18F-AlF-NODA-MP-C6-L5 has the potential to be a GPC3 target tracer but requires some chemical modifications to achieve a high enough tumor/liver ratio for detection of the tumor in the liver.
