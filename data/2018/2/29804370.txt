The focus of clinical research on liver transplantation of hepatocellular carcinoma over past decade is as follows: (1) the appropriate indications, so that the limited liver resources can be used more fairly and reasonably. A number of new indications standards have been proposed and validated. Our country scholar puts forward the standard norms, which could benefit more liver cancer patients from liver transplant. (2) To explore the appropriate immunosuppressive regimen in the control of rejection while preventing and reducing tumor recurrence rate after transplantation. At present, there is not enough clinical trial data to conclude, but for patients with high recurrence risk, it is recommended to minimize the dosage of calmodulin inhibitors and convert them to mTOR inhibitors after liver transplantation. In recent years, the rapid development of cancer precision medicine and immunotherapy technology has provided new opportunities for the study of liver transplantation in liver cancer.
