Screening active components from Chinese traditional medicine is an effective approach to discover new drugs or active structures. Cell membrane chromatography (CMC), developed rapidly because of its high sensitivity and effectiveness, has achieved a wide application in screening active components on pathological cells or tissues. However, it is hard to clarify the selectivity between pathological and normal tissues through simply using pathological cells. In this study, a novel comparative two-dimensional (2D) cell membrane chromatography system was established. Briefly, hepatic carcinoma HepG2 CMC columns and normal hepatic L02 CMC columns were simultaneously loaded to screen potential selective antitumor components from Scutellariae Radix by comparing the retention behaviors on two kinds of cells. Totally 13 components in Scutellariae Radix retained on both HepG2/ CMC and L02/ CMC columns. Among them, three components, oroxylin A, wogonin and chrysin, were screened out to perform stronger affinity on HepG2 columns, and in further cell proliferation assay, IC50 of these three compounds of HepG2 cells were 9.66 μM, 66.77 μM and 36.26 μM respectively, while of L02 cells, IC50 of chrysin was 59.10 μM and over 200 μM of the other two components. On the whole, the toxity of these three compounds to hepatoma cells was stronger than to normal cells. It can be supposed that oroxylin A, wogonin, and chrysin own the potential to be developed as selective anti-hepatoma active components, which expects further research to validate.
