The liver is the most common metastatic site for colorectal cancer(CRC).The 5-year survival rate of resected cases has been reported to be about 40%.Hepatic lymph node metastasis is reportedly associated with a poor prognosis in patients with liver metastases of CRC.The incidence of hepatic lymph node involvement in patients with liver metastases of CRC ranges from 5% to 28%.However, few reports have focused on hepatic lymph node involvement in patients with resectable liver metastasis who have undergone preoperative chemotherapy.This retrospective study was undertaken to address this issue.The subjects were 33 consecutive patients who had undergone the resection of liver metastases of CRC with hepatic lymph node sampling after preoperative chemotherapy between 2001 and 2016. Hepatic lymph node metastasis was confirmed in only one patient(3%).There was no significant difference in the frequency of hepatic lymph node metastasis between the cases with or without preoperative chemotherapy.The further collection of data is warranted to elucidate the significance of hepatic lymph node involvement in patients with liver metastases of CRC treated with preoperative chemotherapy.
