Mutations in hepatitis B virus (HBV) S gene are one of factors contributing to occult HBV infection (OBI). The study aimed to uncover the impact of OBI-related S-gene mutations on the detectability of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Nine representative mutations within the major hydrophilic region of the S region were investigated. These included six (M1-M6) from an OBI patient with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma, and three (M7-M9) from three OBI blood donors. Recombinant plasmids on the basis of pTriEx-mod-1.1 HBV and pcDNA3.1(-)/myc-His A vectors were constructed for each and transfected into HepG2 or Huh7 cells, respectively. Electrochemical luminescence, ELISA, Western blotting, and confocal immunofluorescence were used to examine HBsAg expression and antigenicity. In comparison to wild-type strain, supernatant and intracellular HBsAg levels of the nine mutants were reduced by 56.39-99.09% and 42.76-99.77% upon Roche quantitative Elecsys assay, respectively. Confocal immunofluorescence showed that relative intensity ratios of HBsAg-myc-His fusion protein detected by anti-HBs and anti-His-tag were lower by 11.87-76.27% for the nine mutants compared to the wild-type strain. Specifically, M1-M5 mutants that we firstly found recently were 33.14%, 76.27%, 57.93%, 53.37%, and 40.88% lower, respectively. Consistent results were obtained using double-antibody sandwich ELISA assays (anti-myc + anti-HBs vs anti-myc + anti-His). Antigenicity reduction played a major role for the poor detectability of HBsAg caused by the OBI-related mutations, although decreased HBsAg expression of some mutants and anti-HBs in samples might play coordinated roles. Taken together, antigenicity reduction contributes mostly to poor detectability of HBsAg caused by these OBI-related mutations.
