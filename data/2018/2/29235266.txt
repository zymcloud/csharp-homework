Treatment with recently developed interferon-free oral regimens combining direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) results in the elimination of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in almost all chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. In the era of DAAs, surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after eradication of HCV by anti-HCV therapy is particularly important. As is well known, an advanced state of hepatic fibrosis is the major risk factor for developing HCC. Therefore, an increased understanding of various factors associated with disease progression and development of HCC in CHC patients is essential for implementing personalized treatment and surveillance of disease progression and HCC. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several host genetic variants influencing treatment efficacy or clinical course in HCV infection. This review focuses on these host genetic variations recently identified, mainly by GWAS, which are associated with the clinical course of chronic HCV infection, especially disease progression and hepatocarcinogenesis.
