Purpose:To examine differences in outcome and response of cirrhotomimetic (CMM) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to a combination of bridging transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) compared with non-CMM HCC.Materials and methods:All patients with pathologically proven CMM HCC who underwent bridging transcatheter arterial chemoembolization before OLT between 2007 and 2013 (n = 23) were retrospectively compared with a control group of patients with pathologically proven non-CMM HCC (n = 46).Results:There were 29 tumors in the CMM HCC group and 64 tumors in the non-CMM group identified and treated. Objective response rate on MR imaging at 1 and 3 months after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for CMM HCC tumors (including patients with complete and partial response) was 93.1% and 86.4% compared with 85.2% and 93.2% for non-CMM tumors without statistically significant difference (P = .54 and P = .09, respectively). Pathologic study of liver explants showed complete tumor necrosis in 62.3% of non-CMM tumors (38/61) compared with 10.3% of CMM tumors (3/29) (P 50% of liver parenchyma had worse survival with mean 2-year survival of 402 days ± 102 vs 656 days ± 39 for the remaining patients with CMM HCC (P = .02).Conclusions:Despite similar early imaging response rates, CMM HCC tumors had markedly lower rates of complete pathologic necrosis on liver explants and were associated with reduced survival after OLT compared with conventional HCCs.
