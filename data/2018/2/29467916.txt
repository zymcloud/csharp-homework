Hepatocellular carcinoma constitutes over 90% of the primary liver tumors, the rest being cholangiocarcinoma. It has an insidious presentation, which is responsible for the delayed presentation. Hence, the management strategy relies on screening to diagnose it an early stage for curative resection and/or treatment with local ablative techniques or chemotherapy. However, even with different screening programs, more than 60% of tumors are still detected at an advanced stage, leading to an unchanged mortality rate, thereby implying a room for improvement in the screening and diagnostic process. In the last few years, there has been evolution of utility of endoscopy, specifically endoscopic ultrasonography along with Fine needle aspiration, for this purpose, which we comprehensively review in this article.
