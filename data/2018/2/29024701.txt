In clinical therapy, the poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is mainly attributed to the failure of chemotherapeutical agents to accumulate in tumor as well as lack of potency of tumor penetration. In this work, we developed actively tumor-targeting micelles with pH-sensitive linker as a novel nanocarrier for HCC therapy. These micelles comprised biodegradable poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(aspartate) polymers, in which paclitaxel can be covalently conjugated to pAsp via an acid-labile acetal bond to form pH-responsive structures. In vitro drug release studies showed that these structures were stable in physiological condition, whereas collapsed once internalized into cells due to the mildly acidic environment in endo/lysosomes, resulting in facilitated intracellular paclitaxel release. In addition, dehydroascorbic acid and guanidinopropyl methacrylamide polymers were decorated on the surface of micelles to achieve specific tumor accumulation and tumor penetration. Cellular uptake and in vivo imaging studies proved that these micelles had remarkable targeting property toward hepatocarcinoma cells and tumor. Enhanced anti-HCC efficacy of the micelles was also confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, this micellar system may be a potential platform of chemotherapeutics delivery for HCC therapy.
