Purpose:To compare the therapeutic effects of 125I versus non-125I combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with obstructive jaundice.Methods:A retrospective analysis was conducted using the records of 54 consecutive patients who were initially diagnosed with HCC with obstructive jaundice between May 2009 and July 2016. Twenty-one cases (group A) were treated with percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) followed by 125I radioactive seed strip implantation through the PTBD tube. After the total serum bilirubin level was reduced to normal and the liver function recovered to Child-Pugh class A or early B, TACE was conducted. In 33 cases (group B) PTBD was performed in combination with TACE without applying the 125I radioactive seeds. The duration of biliary patency and survival were analyzed.Results:The technical success rate in both groups was 100%. The median biliary patency time was 6.000 ± 0.315 months (95% CI 5.382-6.618 months) in group A and 4.000 ± 0.572 months (95% CI 2.879-5.121 months) in group B; the two groups were significantly different (P = 0.001). The median survival was 11.000 ± 0.864 months (95% CI 9.306-12.694 months) in group A and 9.000 ± 0.528 months (95% CI 7.965-10.035 months) in group B; the two groups were significantly different (P = 0.022).Conclusions:The combination of 125I with TACE was more effective than TACE without the radioactive seeds for treating patients with unresectable HCC with obstructive jaundice. Future prospective trials with larger samples will be required to validate these results.
