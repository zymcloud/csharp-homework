Objective: To explore the characteristics of tumor recurrence after liver transplantation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with hepatitis B and to analyze the risk factors that influence the recurrence and prognosis. Methods: The clinicopathological and survival data of 162 patients with hepatitis B -associated liver cancer who underwent liver transplantation in Peking University People's Hospital from January 2002 to December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. The postoperative survival rate (OS) and tumor free survival rate (DFS) was statistically analyzed by using the log-rank test. Univariate analysis was performed for various clinicopathological indicators, and the Cox proportional risk regression model was used for multivariate analysis. Results: Univariate analysis showed that the age of the recipients (P(OS) = 0.047, P(DFS) = 0.045), the maximum tumor size (P < 0.001, P(DFS) < 0.001), preoperative AFP levels (P(OS) < 0.001, P(DFS) < 0.001), preoperative HBV-DNA levels (P(OS) = 0.035, P(DFS) = 0.029), vein tumor thrombosis (P(OS) < 0.001, P(DFS) < 0.001), and tumor differentiation degree (P(OS) <0.001, P(DFS) < 0.001) were associated with overall prognosis and tumor recurrence. Multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative AFP levels (P(OS) = 0.014, P(DFS) = 0.013), the maximum tumor size (P(OS) < 0.001, P(DFS) = 0.001), vein tumor thrombosis (P(OS) = 0.012, P(DFS) < 0.004), and tumor differentiation degree (P(OS) = 0.004, P(DFS) = 0.009) were independent risk factors affecting overall prognosis and tumor recurrence. Conclusion: The major prognostic factors linked to tumor biological characteristics after liver transplantation in HBV-related HCC patients are preoperative AFP levels, the largest tumor size, and vein tumor thrombosis and tumor differentiation degree.
