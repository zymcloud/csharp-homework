The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Huaier on autophagy of human hepatoma SK-HEP-1 cells and the effect of autophagy on the proliferation of SK-HEP-1 cells. CCK-8 assay was used to evaluate the effect of Huaier on the proliferation of SK-HEP-1 cells under different concentrations and different times. Acridine orange staining was used to measure the effect of Huaier on the autolysosome formation in SK-HEP-1 cells. Immunofluorescence assay was applied to examine the effect of Huaier on the expression and distribution of autophagy marker LC3 in SK-HEP-1 cells. In addition， LC3 expression was also checked by immunoblot analysis in the presence of Huaier. At last， the effects of Huaier in combination with autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 on the proliferation of SK-HEP-1 cells was detected by CCK-8 assay. The results showed that Huaier aqueous extract significantly inhibited the proliferation of human hepatoma SK-HEP-1 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Huaier aqueous extract dramatically promoted the formation of autolysosome in SK-HEP-1 cells. Moreover， Huaier markedly increased the number and intensity of intracellular LC3 fluorescent puncta and up-regulated LC3-Ⅱ expression. These data indicated that Huaier evidently activated autophagy of SK-HEP-1 cells. Additionally， autophagy inhibition significantly attenuated the sensitivity of SK-HEP-1 cells to Huaier treatment. Therefore， autophagy activation is involved in the inhibitory effects of Huaier on the proliferation of human hepatoma SK-HEP-1 cells.
