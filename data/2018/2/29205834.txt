Background:Our aim was to validate alcohol flushing questionnaires in detecting inactive ALDH2 (ALDH2*1/*2 or ALDH2*2/*2).Methods:Two study sets were established; in study set 1, 210 healthy male subjects (age 22 to 59 years) were enrolled; in study set 2, 756 subjects were enrolled who received esophagogastroduodenoscopy to evaluate their dyspeptic symptoms or as part of a gastric cancer screening program. Subjects in study sets 1 and 2 completed the modified alcohol flushing questionnaires of Yokoyama and colleagues (, ). Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method was used to determine ALDH2 genotype.Results:In study set 1, 29.0% (61 of 210) had inactive ALDH2. The sensitivity and specificity of the modified alcohol flushing questionnaire for detecting inactive ALDH2 were 95.1 and 76.5%, respectively. Drinking problems negatively correlated with positive alcohol flushing response and inactive ALDH2 (all p-values < 0.05). In study set 2, the sensitivity and specificity of the alcohol flushing questionnaire for detecting inactive ALDH2 were 78.9 and 82.1%, respectively. Interestingly, drinking ≥7 units/wk in men or ≥3.5 units/wk in women significantly increased the risk of benign gastric ulcer (BGU) among positive alcohol flushers (odds ratio, 8.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.38 to 58.30), but not among negative alcohol flushers.Conclusions:Simple flushing questionnaires may be administered to the Korean population as a screening tool in detecting individuals who carry inactive ALDH2. Alcohol flushing response negatively correlates with drinking problems and can modify the risk for BGU by alcohol intake.
