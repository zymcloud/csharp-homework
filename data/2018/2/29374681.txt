Surgical resection is the standard therapy for solitary primary or metastatic liver tumors. However, liver tumors are often unresectable at diagnosis and hepatectomy is invasive. Local therapies, such as radiofrequency ablation, are used instead, which can be challenging. Recent advances in modern radiotherapy, including stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), have increased the use of radiotherapy as a curative modality. SBRT delivers ablative high doses of irradiation in small volumes. SBRT for liver tumors provided local control with potential survival benefits in patients with inoperable status. However, the following issues remain: primary vs. metastatic liver cancers; SBRT-related toxicity and prevention; pathological features of liver cancers; and potential SBRT strategies. We summarized a literature review to summarize the effectiveness of SBRT and patient tolerance and present the current status and future perspective of SBRT for liver tumors. SBRT is a potential game changer for multimodal therapy.
