Direct acting antivirals (DAA) have revolutionized the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Sustained virological response rates of nearly 100% have become common in the general population. However, physicians face the growing problem of managing HCV in patients with the complications of cirrhosis, eg hepatic decompensation or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Safety and efficacy remain a clinical challenge in these difficult-to-treat patients. This review focuses on the current state of knowledge and treatment regimens in patients with decompensated cirrhosis as well as the potential risk of the development of HCC following DAA therapy.
