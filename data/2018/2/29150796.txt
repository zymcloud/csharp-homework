Background:Gender differences in chronic liver disease (CLD) have been partially investigated. To extend the present knowledge, we evaluated 12,263 patients with CLD enrolled in two national surveys (9997 in 2001 and 2557 in 2014).Methods:The two surveys prospectively recruited patients aged â‰¥ 18 referring to Italian liver units throughout the country using a similar clinical approach and analytical methods.Results:The overall male to female ratio (M/F) was 1.4 (7138/5124). Compared with females, males were significantly more likely to be younger (52.9 vs. 58.7 yrs.), with HBV infection alone (13.2% vs. 9.2%) and with alcoholic liver disease alone (11.4% vs. 6.9%), but less likely to show HCV infection alone (48.0% vs. 67.9%). A male preponderance was observed in HBV-related cases (1.99) and in alcoholic-related cases (2.3), a preponderance observed both in the 2001 and in 2014 cases. In HCV-related cases, however, females predominated in 2001 (M/F 0.9) and males in 2014 (M/F 1.5).The rate of cirrhosis in alcohol-related etiology was close to 36% in both genders, a finding much higher than that observed for both sexes in HBV and HCV etiologies.Both males and females enrolled in 2014 were older (p Conclusion:This study highlights important inter- and intra-gender differences in the characteristics and etiological factors of patients with CLD in Italy.
