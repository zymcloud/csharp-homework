Backgrounds/aims:Long-term immunosuppression regimens after liver transplantation (LT) are rarely reported in detail. We aimed to provide information on actual long-term immunosuppression regimens through this cross-sectional study.Methods:Our institutional LT database was searched for adult patients who underwent primary LT operation from 2000 to 2016. We identified 3620 live recipients with actual information on immunosuppressive agent use for 1-17 years.Results:The study cohort was divided into 7 groups according to posttransplantation period. The immunosuppressive agents used at the cross-sectional review period were tacrolimus in 2884 (79.7%), cyclosporine in 445 (12.3%), mycophenolate mofetil in 2007 (55.4%), and everolimus in 138 (3.8%) recipients. There was no marked difference in immunosuppressive agent use according to pretransplantation liver malignancy or type of LT operation. Tacrolimus, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and everolimus were used in 97.4%, 1.8%, 60.9%, and 9.2%, respectively, in the year 2 group; 94.1%, 3.9%, 51.6%, and 8.3%, respectively, in the year 3 group; 87.3%, 8.4%, 68.9%, and 4.8%, respectively, in the year 4-5 group; 78.2%, 12.9%, 64.6%, and 3.0%, respectively, in the year 6-7 group; 76.9%, 10.8%, 58.8%, and 2.4%, respectively, in the year 8-10 group; 66.7%, 22.4%, 43.4%, and 1.5%, respectively, in the year 11-15 group; and 73.8%, 15.4%, 32.9%, and 1.7%, respectively, in the year â‰¥15 group.Conclusions:Tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil are the primary immunosuppressive agents after LT, and the indications for everolimus have started to increase at our institution. We believe our results will help establish tailored long-term immunosuppression regimens.
