Background:Increasing numbers of studies have shown that skeletal muscle measures are closely associated with tumors. This study explored the relationship between skeletal muscle measures and short- and long-term outcomes after radical gastrectomy (RG) for gastric cancer (GC).Methods:The study analyzed 221 GC patients who underwent RG between December 2009 and December 2010. The total psoas area (TPA) and psoas density [Hounsfield unit average calculation (HUAC)] were measured. The total psoas gauge (TPG) was created by multiplying TPA Ã— HUAC. Low TPA, low HUAC, and low TPG were defined in the categorical analyses as the lowest quartile. Logistic regression modeling, the Kaplan-Meier method, and three-step multivariate analysis were used.Results:The median follow-up period was 64 months. Compared with low TPA and low HUAC, only low TPG was an independent risk factor for postoperative complications. The univariate analysis showed that low TPA, low HUAC, and low TPG were predictors of overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and cancer-specific survival (CCS) after surgery. The result of the three-step multivariate analysis demonstrated that low TPG was an independent risk factor for OS, RFS, and CCS. Moreover, the prognostic value of TPG was superior to that of TPA and HUAC. The patients with low TPG experienced significantly more postoperative liver recurrence than the patients with high TPG (p = 0.011).Conclusion:Compared with preoperative skeletal muscle quantity (TPA) and quality (HUAC), TPG can more accurately predict complications and prognosis after RG. In addition, TPG may be an indicator for the early detection of liver recurrence after RG.
