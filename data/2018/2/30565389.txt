Objectives:The present study was committed to investigate the role of miR-148a-3p in HCC infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the regulatory mechanism of miR-148a-3p/c-Jun/MAPK signalling pathway.Methods:Differential analysis and GSEA analysis were performed with R packages. QRT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect RNA or protein level, respectively. The targeted relationship between miR-148a-3p and c-Jun was predicted by TargetScan database and determined by double luciferase reporter assay. MTT assay and flow cytometry were used to evaluate cell proliferation, cell cycle and cell apoptosis, respectively.Results:C-Jun was up-regulated, and MAPK signalling pathway was activated in HCV-infected HCC cells. C-Jun expression regulated inflammation-related gene expression and had an influence on cell proliferation, cell cycle and cell apoptosis. MiR-148a-3p, down-regulated in HCV-infected HCC cells, could target c-Jun mRNA to suppress c-Jun protein expression.Conclusions:MiR-148a-3p suppressed the proliferation of HCC cells infected with HCV through targeting c-Jun mRNA.
