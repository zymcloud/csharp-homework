Aim:To evaluate the expression of miRNA-542-3p in hepatocellular carcinoma, establish its function, and evaluate whether it could serve as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of HCC patients.Methods:qRT-PCR analysis was performed to determine the expression level of miRNA-542-3p in normal liver cells and HCC cell lines. Additionally, samples from TCGA consortium and from our patients were analyzed using biostatistical methods to ascertain whether miR-542-3p could be a good biomarker for HCC diagnosis and prognosis. The effects of miRNA-542-3p on HCC were investigated in HCCLM9 cells.Results:The expression of miRNA-542-3p in HCC cells was significantly downregulated compared with normal liver cells. A lower level of expression of miRNA-542-3p was found in HCC tissue samples than in adjacent normal liver tissue samples from TCGA cases and our patients. Further evaluation revealed that the downregulation was clearly related to aggressive clinicopathological characteristics and affected the prognosis, as low-expressing patients tended to have shorter overall survival. Moreover, cell assays revealed that miR-542-3p overexpression inhibited HCC cell growth and induced apoptosis.Conclusion:We demonstrated for the first time that miRNA-542-3p appears to function as a novel tumor suppressor in HCC and may serve as a promising prognostic biomarker in HCC patients.
