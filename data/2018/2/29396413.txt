There is a growing consensus that genetic variation in candidate genes can influence cancer progression and treatment effects. In this study, we genotyped the rs9642880 G > T polymorphism using DNA isolated from blood samples of 271 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who received radiotherapy treatment. We found that patients who carried the GT or TT genotypes had significantly shorter median survival times (MSTs) compared to patients with the GG genotype (14.6 vs.21.4 months). The multivariate P value was 0.027, the hazard ratio (HR) was 1.38, and the 95% confidence interval was 1.04-1.84. Further analysis revealed that patients with the variant genotypes had an increased risk of poor tumour response to radiotherapy (P = 0.036 and 0.002 for stable disease and progressive disease, respectively) and higher incidence of multiple intrahepatic lesions (P = 0.026) and BCLC C stage (P = 0.027). Moreover, further stratified survival analyses revealed that at least radioresponse and BCLC stage contributed to the association between the rs9642880 G > T polymorphism and survival of HCC patients in this study (P value, 0.017 vs 0.053 for BCLC C stage vs B stage; 0.011 vs 0.531 for radioresponse SD + PD vs CR + PR). These results illustrate the potential association between rs9642880 G > T and survival in HCC patients who received radiotherapy treatment.
