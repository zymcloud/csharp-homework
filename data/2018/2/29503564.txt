Background:CDCA5 plays an important role in the development of various human cancers, but the associated mechanisms have not been investigated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:We evaluated expression levels and functions of CDCA5 in HCC and showed that CDCA5 is upregulated in HCC tissues compared with paired or unpaired normal liver tissues.Results:Increased CDCA5 expression in HCCs was significantly associated with shorter survival of patients. Knockdown of CDCA5 using lentivirus-mediated shRNA significantly inhibited cell proliferation and suppressed cell survival, as well as induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and cell apoptosis of HCC cells. The tumor suppression effects of CDCA5 knockdown were mediated by decreased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and CyclinB1, which were increased in HCC tissues comparing with adjacent normal liver tissues. Moreover, upregulation of CDCA5 was positively associated with increased CDK1 and CyclinB1 expression in HCC tissues.Conclusion:The present data warrant consideration of CDCA5 as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.
