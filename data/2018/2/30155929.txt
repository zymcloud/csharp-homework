Prognosis and oncologic treatment feasibility in solid organ transplant patients with de novo cancer remain poorly described. We investigated the impact of immunosuppressive therapy modifications after de novo cancer diagnosis on oncologic treatment feasibility, toxicities, and prognosis. Patients with de novo cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers) were selected from a monocentric cohort of 4,637 kidney and liver allograft recipients. We assessed oncologic treatment optimality according to guidelines and analyzed immunosuppressive drug modifications and oncologic treatment impacts on treatment feasibility, toxicities, and graft/patient survivals. A total of 180 patients with 205 cancers were included: mean age 60 years, median delay from transplantation to first de novo cancer 5 years. In 46% of cases, immunosuppressive therapy was modified after cancer diagnosis: 24% dose reduction and 22% mTOR inhibitor introduction. Optimal oncologic treatment was performed in 80% and 38% of patients with localized and advanced cancer respectively. Transplantation and immunosuppression hindered optimal oncologic treatment in 11% instances. Immunosuppressive therapy modifications did not affect oncologic treatment tolerance nor graft survival. In multivariate analysis, optimal oncologic treatment and mTOR inhibitor introduction improved survival of patients with de novo carcinoma. Optimal oncologic treatment is feasible in kidney and liver allograft recipients without safety concerns. Optimal oncologic treatment and mTOR inhibitor introduction seem to markedly improve survival of patients with de novo carcinoma.
