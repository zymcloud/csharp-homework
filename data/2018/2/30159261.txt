Background: Resveratrol (RSV) provides several important biological functions in wide variety of cells. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying anti-inflammatory effect of RSV on HepG2 cells by assessing the gene expression of RelA and c-Jun- subunits of NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors. Methods: HepG2 cells were settled in a serum- free medium with high concentrations of glucose (30 mM) and insulin (1 µM) overnight and were then incubated with RSV (5, 10, and 20 µM) for 24 and 48 hours. Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to determine RelA and c-Jun expression. Results: RSV diminished hyperglycemia/hyperinsulinemia stimulated expression of c-Jun dose- dependently after 24 and 48 hours (p<0.05). In addition, RelA gene expression was decreased dose-dependently in all RSV doses after 48-hour incubation (p<0.05). Our results indicated that RSV may reduce NF-κB and AP-1 activity via RelA and c-Jun gene regulation. Conclusion: The findings of the present study demonstrated that RSV may be considered as a preventative and therapeutic agent for antagonizing inflammation in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
