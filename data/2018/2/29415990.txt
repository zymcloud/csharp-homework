Noncoding RNAs plays an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we show that miR-124 was downregulated in HCC tissues and that the ectopic expression of miR-124 inhibited the proliferation and migration of HCC cells. We proposed that aquaporin 3 (AQP3) is a direct target of miR-124. AQP3 was upregulated in HCC tissues and inversely correlated with miR-124 expression. The overexpression of miR-124 decreased AQP3 expression. Indeed, AQP3 overexpression promoted cell proliferation and migration, whereas miR-124 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore, we found that circular RNA HIPK3 (circHIPK3) acted as a miR-124 sponge and regulated the expression of the miR-124 target gene AQP3. circHIPK3 was upregulated in HCC tissues and positively correlated with AQP3 expression. Thus, silencing circHIPK3 inhibited cell proliferation and migration by downregulating AQP3 expression. Moreover, miR-124 inhibition rescued circHIPK3 knockdown induced reduction in cell proliferation and migration, as well as AQP3 expression. In vivo experiments also confirmed that circHIPK3 regulated xenograft tumor growth via the miR-124-AQP3 axis. These observations indicate a possible novel therapeutic strategy involving circular RNAs in HCC.
