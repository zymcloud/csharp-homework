Background:We evaluated the surgical outcomes of metastatic spine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and determined the factors that might influence the outcomes of metastatic HCC of the spine.Methods:From 2010 to 2017, 72 patients with HCC-derived metastatic spine tumors were treated in our department. For each patient, we recorded the pre- and postoperative visual analog scale score, Frankel grade, perioperative complications, and mortality. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to explore a range of factors that might influence postoperative survival.Results:The mean postoperative survival was 10.8 Â± 5.4 months. The concordance rate between a Tokuhashi score of 0-8 and a life expectancy of Conclusions:Our results have challenged previously reported estimates of the life expectancy correlating with the Tokuhashi score. Our results showed that excisional surgery resulted in better clinical outcomes compared with palliative surgery.
