Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a prevalent condition that is associated with the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and with no approved treatment options except for lifestyle changes. Guidelines have been drafted for the management of NAFLD patients in this setting. Because of the lack of real-life cohort data, we will focus on practice surveys on the management of patients with NAFLD/NASH, which included primary care practitioners, gastroenterologists/hepatologists and other specialists from various countries. Practice patterns have been collected from interviews with practitioners or reviews of patient's files. This review discusses the screening, diagnosis and therapeutic management of NAFLD/NASH patients in real life practice, as well as adherence to guidelines.
