Background:The aim of this retrospective review was to evaluate the long-term survival benefits of thermal ablation versus wedge or segmental resection in solitary HCC lesions using tumor size and clinical factors.Methods:Survival analysis was performed on 43,601 patients from 2004 to 2015 in the National Cancer Database with solitary HCC lesions â‰¤5 cm with further stratification by tumor size, fibrosis score, and type of resection.Results:In patients with moderate fibrosis or less, survival benefit was seen with one-segment resection over ablation in tumors 1.1-3 cm (HR 0.54, p = 0.03) while tumors of 3.1-5 cm received survival benefit from wedge (HR 0.44, p = 0.04), one (HR 0.28, p = 0.001) and two-segment (HR 0.20, p = 0.001) resections over ablation. In patients with severe fibrosis to cirrhosis, wedge resection demonstrated survival benefit over ablation in patients with tumors 1.1-3 cm (HR 0.48, p = 0.01) with no survival benefit of any resection type in patients with tumors of 3.1-5 cm.Conclusion:These findings suggest that the decision to utilize thermal ablation versus resection to extend survival in solitary HCC lesions should include tumor size, fibrosis score, and type of resection.
