Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) usually develops in the setting of chronic liver disease. In the adequate clinical context, both multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT and magnetic resonance imaging are non-invasive modalities that allow accurate diagnosis and staging of HCC, although the latter demonstrates greater sensitivity and specificity. Imaging criteria for HCC diagnosis rely on hemodynamic features such as hyperenhancement in the arterial phase and washout in the portal or equilibrium phase. However, imaging performance drops considerably for small (i.e., imaging characteristics that modify the likelihood of HCC, have been described and incorporated into clinical reports, especially in Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System. In this paper, ancillary imaging features will be reviewed and illustrated.
