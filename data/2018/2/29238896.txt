Background:The treatment of intrahepatic recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been poorly investigated, and the optimal treatment strategy remains unclear.Aims:The aim of this study was to compare outcomes between salvage liver transplantation (SLT) and re-resection (RR)/radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for intrahepatic recurrent HCC according to recurrence pattern.Methods:Based on postoperative histopathological examination, 122 patients with intrahepatic recurrent HCC were divided into an intrahepatic metastasis (IM, n = 75) group and a multicentric occurrence (MO, n = 47) group. The demographic, clinical, and primary and recurrent tumor characteristics of the IM group and the MO group were collected and compared. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed, and subgroup analysis according to retreatment type (SLT vs. RR/RFA) was conducted. Twenty-nine clinicopathological variables potentially related to prognostic factors affecting survival were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazard model.Results:The patients that received SLT treatment exhibited favorable DFS compared to patients that received RR/RFA (P = 0.002). OS (P Conclusions:For patients with intrahepatic recurrent HCC, an MO recurrence pattern is associated with better long-term outcomes than the IM pattern. SLT is the preferred option for intrahepatic recurrent HCC, especially for MO cases.
