The article reviews the multimodality (ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance [MR]) imaging appearance of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and discusses the radiologic diagnostic criteria as well as the sensitivity and specificity of these imaging methods. The authors review the role of both ultrasound and MR elastography for the diagnosis of fibrosis and for the longitudinal evaluation of patients following therapeutic intervention. Lastly, the authors briefly discuss the screening and diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with NAFLD, as there are special considerations in this population.
