Background:Recent findings have identified thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and reveal that lncRNAs play crucial roles in the regulation of tumor development and progression. However, the clinical significance and potentially functional value of LINC00261 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown.Methods:Expression of LINC00261 was detected by qRT-PCR in HCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess the relationship between LINC00261 expression and the overall survival (OS) time. Cell proliferation and invasion were evaluated using MTT assay, cell colony formation assay and transwell assay. The protein expression was determined by western blot analysis.Results:In present study, we confirmed that LINC00261 was frequently lower in HCC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Decreased LINC00261 expression associated with lager tumor size, TNM stage (III-IV) and poor overall survival time of HCC patients. The functional assays demonstrated that overexpression of LINC00261 in HCC cells inhibited cell proliferation, cell colony formation, cell invasion and EMT process in vitro. Moreover, we also demonstrated that upregulation of LINC00261 significantly inhibited Notch signaling by downregulating Notch1 and Hes-1 expression in HCC cells.Conclusion:These results indicated that LINC00261 may be a potential target of HCC treatment.
