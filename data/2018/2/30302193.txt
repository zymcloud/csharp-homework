Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem worldwide with limited systemic therapies available. Immunotherapy is a fast-moving field that is quickly evolving as a treatment for HCC with three recent clinical trials published treating HCC with immune checkpoint inhibitors with promising results. Checkpoint inhibition may lead to a unique adverse event profile with the potential to cause immune-related adverse events by unbalancing the immune system. Here, we report a case of a 61-year-old male with advanced HCC who developed a shellfish allergy after completing three cycles of combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab therapy.
