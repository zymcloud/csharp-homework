Background:Accumulating evidence has confirmed that CRNDE is significantly expressed in various cancers, suggesting that it may be a potential biomarker for cancer. However, its diagnostic and prognostic values of CRNDE in cancer are not completely clear. Therefore, we conduct a comprehensive study on CRNDE in cancer.Materials and methods:CRNDE expression data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Microarray data were derived from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to validate its differential expression. Furthermore, the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were used to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic values of CRNDE in cancer, respectively. Finally, we carried out a meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic values of CRNDE in cancer.Results:In TCGA database, CRNDE was overexpressed in nine types of cancer, among which polymorphic glioblastoma and colonic adenocarcinoma are the most highly expressed. The area under curves (AUC) of nine cancer types ranged from 0.855 to 0.984. Additionally, the high expression level of CRNDE was significantly associated with poor overall survival only in hepatocellular carcinoma (p = 0.032) among the nine cancers in the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Finally, the results of the meta-analysis on the literatures showed that the pooled sensitivity, specificity, summary receiver operator characteristic curve (SROC), and the overall hazard ratio of CRNDE in cancers were 0.77 (95% CI: 0.71-0.82), 0.90 (95% CI: 0.82-0.95), 0.87 (95% CI: 0.84-0.90), and 1.66 (95% CI: 1.37-2.01), respectively.Conclusion:CRNDE could be a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
