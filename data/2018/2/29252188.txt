Background:Distinctive exosomal contents could be useful for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, little is known about whether serum exosomal heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (hnRNPH1) mRNA is a satisfactory biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Two hundred and ninety-one participants divided into four age- and gender-matched groups, including a HCC group (n=88), a liver cirrhosis (LC) group (n=67), a chronic hepatitis B (CHB) group (n=68) and a healthy control group (n=68), were enrolled. Serum exosomal hnRNPH1 mRNA and GAPDH mRNA were measured using TaqMan real-time PCR, and the relative expression levels were calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the effectiveness of hnRNPH1 mRNA alone and in combination with Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) in the diagnosis of HCC. The correlation between hnRNPH1 mRNA levels and clinicopathological characteristics and overall survival (OS) in HCC was determined.Results:The serum exosomal hnRNPH1 mRNA levels in HCC patients were remarkably higher than in the other groups (pConclusions:These findings suggested that serum exosomal hnRNPH1 mRNA could be an effective marker for HCC in high HBV prevalence areas.
