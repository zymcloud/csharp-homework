The gene encoding the ATPase of the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complexes SMARCA4 (BRG1) is often mutated or silenced in tumors, suggesting a role as tumor suppressor. Nonetheless, recent reports show requirement of SMARCA4 for tumor cells growth. Here, we performed a computational meta-analysis using gene expression, prognosis, and clinicopathological data to clarify the role of SMARCA4 and the alternative SWI/SNF ATPase SMARCA2 (BRM) in cancer. We show that while the SMARCA4 gene is mostly overexpressed in tumors, SMARCA2 is almost invariably downexpressed in tumors. High SMARCA4 expression was associated with poor prognosis in many types of tumors, including liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). In contrast, high SMARCA2 expression was associated with good prognosis. We compared tumors with high versus low expression of SMARCA4 or SMARCA2 in LIHC and KIRC cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas. While a high expression of SMARCA4 is associated with aggressive tumors, a high expression of SMARCA2 is associated with benign differentiated tumors, suggesting that SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 play opposite roles in cancer. Our results demonstrate that expression of SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 have a high prognostic value and challenge the broadly accepted general role of SMARCA4 as a tumor suppressor.
