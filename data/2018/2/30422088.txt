Purpose To (a) evaluate the postsurgical prognostic implication of the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) categories of primary liver cancers and (b) determine the performance of LI-RADS version 2017 in differentiating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) and combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) at gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 194 patients with cirrhosis and surgically proven single primary liver cancer (53 with cHCC-CC, 44 with IHCC, and 97 with HCC) were evaluated with gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI between 2009 and 2014. The mean patient age was 57 years (age range, 30-83 years). There were 155 men with a mean age of 56 years (range, 30-81 years) and 39 women with a mean age of 58 years (range, 38-83 years). Two independent readers assigned an LI-RADS category for each nodule. Overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and their associated factors were evaluated by using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazard model. Results In the multivariable analysis, the LI-RADS category was an independent factor for OS (hazard ratio, 4.2; P
