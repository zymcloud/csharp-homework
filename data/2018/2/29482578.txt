Background:This study was performed to investigate the role of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor X1 (NLRX1) in regulating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression.Methods:Expression levels of NLRX1 in clinical specimens and cell lines were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot (WB). Transwell assays were conducted to evaluate the effect of NLRX1 on cell invasion, and flow cytometry was used to assess apoptosis. Expression patterns of key molecules in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathways were determined via WB. The effect of NLRX1 on cell senescence was evaluated with Î²-galactosidase assays. Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox regression models were used for prognostic evaluation.Results:NLRX1 was downregulated in tumor tissue compared with adjacent normal liver tissue. Low tumor NLRX1 expression was identified as an independent indicator for HCC prognosis (recurrence: hazard ratio [HR] 1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26-2.76, overall survival [OS] 2.26, 95% CI 1.44-3.56). NLRX1 over-expression (OE) significantly inhibited invasiveness ability and induced apoptosis in HCC cells. In vivo experiments showed that NLRX1 knock-down (KD) significantly promoted HCC growth. Mechanistically, NLRX1 exhibited a suppressor function by decreasing phosphorylation of AKT and thus downregulating Snail1 expression, which inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) in HCC cells. Moreover, NLRX1 OE could induce cell senescence via an AKT-P21-dependent manner.Conclusions:NLRX1 acted as a tumor suppressor in HCC by inducing apoptosis, promoting senescence, and decreasing invasiveness by repressing PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Future investigations will focus on restoring expression of NLRX1 to provide new insights into HCC treatment.
