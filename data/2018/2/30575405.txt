Introduction: In 2005, sorafenib was the first targeted therapy approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), transforming treatment. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), for more than a decade, sorafenib remained the only approved systemic therapy to have demonstrated a survival benefit in first-line unresectable HCC. In 2013, sorafenib was the first targeted agent approved for patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) refractory to radioactive iodine treatment. Areas covered: This review discusses the development, advances, and challenges associated with sorafenib use in RCC, HCC, and DTC over the past decade. A search was performed on PubMed and key congresses as required, with no time limits. Expert commentary: Sorafenib has had a lasting impact on the therapeutic landscape of RCC, HCC, and DTC, and remains an important treatment option despite a rapidly evolving treatment landscape. Extensive clinical and real-world experience has been invaluable in improving patient management and maximizing benefit from treatment. Ongoing clinical trials continue to evaluate sorafenib in different settings, and in combination with other therapies in HCC and DTC. We have no doubt that sorafenib will continue to be an important treatment option in the coming years.
