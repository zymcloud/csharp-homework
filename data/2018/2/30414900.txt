In this study, ginger polysaccharide (GP) was obtained from ginger by enzymatic method, its chemical properties and antitumor activity were investigated. The results indicated that the composition and proportion of GP were l‑rhamnose, d‑arabinose, d‑mannose, d‑glucose and d‑galactose in a molar ratio of 3.64:5.37:3.04:61.03:26.91, GP had the characteristic absorption peak of polysaccharide. Congo red experiment showed that GP had a triple helix structure, which could have anti-tumor effect. Furthermore, MTT assay, cell morphology observation, nuclear morphology observation and reactive oxygen species observation demonstrated that GP had significant antitumor effect. Flow cytometry suggested that GP could promote apoptosis and arrest cells in G0-G1 phase. Real-time fluorescence quantification and Western blot revealed that GP could up-regulate the expression of Bax, Fas, FasL, caspase-3, p21 and p53, and down-regulate the expression of Bcl-2. These studies suggested that GP would be used as an antitumor drug in foods to promote the development of functional foods.
