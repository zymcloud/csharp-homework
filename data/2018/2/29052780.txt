Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver malignancy and the second most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Current treatment options for patients with intermediate and advanced HCC are limited, and there is an unmet need for novel therapeutic approaches. HCC is an attractive target for immunomodulation therapy, since it arises in an inflammatory milieu due to hepatitis B and C infections and cirrhosis. However, a major barrier to the development and success of immunotherapy in patients with HCC is the liver's inherent immunosuppressive function. Recent advances in the field of cancer immunology allowed further characterization of immune cell subsets and function, and created new opportunities for therapeutic modulation of the immune system. In this review, we present the different immune cell subsets involved in potential immune modulation of HCC, discuss their function and clinical relevance, review the variety of immune therapeutic agents currently under investigation in clinical trials, and outline future research directions.
