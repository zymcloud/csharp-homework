Seminoma is the most common testicular germ cell tumor worldwide and mainly occurs in 15-35-year-old young men. Early studies have indicated that testicular nuclear receptor 4 (TR4) first cloned from testis is involved in the invasion and metastasis of several human tumors; however, little attention is paid to the function of TR4 in seminoma. Our immunohistochemical (IHC) staining results showed that patients with advanced stage tumors tended to have higher expression of TR4. Importantly, there was a significant association between elevated TR4 expression and reduced overall survival in seminoma patients. In vitro MTS, western blot and transwell assays, after manipulating TR4 expression in Tcam-2 cells, revealed that TR4 induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and promoted Tcam-2 cell proliferation and invasion. Mechanism dissection demonstrated that AKT3, a critical component in the signaling pathway, played a crucial role in mediating TR4-promoted Tcam-2 cell proliferation and invasion. We further revealed that TR4 modulated AKT3 at the transcriptional level via chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays. Meanwhile, addition of the AKT3 siRNA blocked the function of TR4. Overall, these findings first elucidate that TR4 is a novel prognostic marker and plays a critical role in the metastatic capacity of Tcam-2 cells by EMT regulation and, consequently, targeting TR4-AKT3 pathway may serve as a potential therapeutic approach for seminoma.
