Background The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and clinical significance of extra-vascular findings in patients undergoing magnetic resonance angiography of the abdomen, pelvis and lower extremities. Materials and methods Three hundred fifty-two patients underwent abdominal, pelvic and lower extremity 1.5 T magnetic resonance angiography. Clinically relevant vascular and extra-vascular findings were identified. Relevant vascular findings were classified as stenosis, occlusion, aneurysm, sclerosis, dissection or vasculitis. Relevant extra-vascular findings were categorized as 'safe' (Group A), intermediate - requiring additional investigation - (Group B) and malignant/endangering - requiring change of therapy (Group C). Results A total of 2152 clinically relevant vascular findings was identified (6.1/patient). The most frequent vascular finding was femoral artery stenosis (10.6%). Four hundred fifty-one extra-vascular findings were observed (1.3/patient) and classified into Group A (78%), Group B (19.5%) and Group C findings (2.4%). The most frequent malignant findings were lung cancer, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma (7/352 patients). Conclusions Extravascular findings are frequently encountered in magnetic resonance angiography performed for vascular indications. Clinically relevant findings are seen in a substantial part of patients and should prompt further diagnostic work-up.
