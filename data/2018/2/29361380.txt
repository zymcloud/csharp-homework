Liver pathologies (fibrosis, cirrhosis, alcoholic, non-alcoholic diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma) represent one of the most common causes of death worldwide. A number of genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of liver diseases. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine, exerting variety of effects on inflammation, liver regeneration, and defence against infections by regulating adaptive immunity. Due to its high abundance in inflammatory settings, IL-6 is often viewed as a detrimental cytokine. However, accumulating evidence supports the view that IL-6 has a beneficial impact in numerous liver pathologies, due to its roles in liver regeneration and in promoting an anti-inflammatory response in certain conditions. IL-6 promotes proliferation, angiogenesis and metabolism, and downregulates apoptosis and oxidative stress; together these functions are critical for mediating hepatoprotection. IL-6 is also an important regulator of adaptive immunity where it induces T cell differentiation and regulates autoimmunity. It can augment antiviral adaptive immune responses and mitigate exhaustion of T cells during chronic infection. This review focuses on studies that present IL-6 as a key factor in regulating liver regeneration and in supporting effector immune functions and suggests that these functions of IL-6 can be exploited in treatment strategies for liver pathologies.
