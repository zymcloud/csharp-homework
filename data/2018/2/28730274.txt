Background:Many centers consider hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) located in segments 7 or 8 to be unsuitable for laparoscopic liver resection (LLR). We evaluated the safety of LLR of HCC in segments 7 or 8 following the introduction of new laparoscopic techniques.Methods:This retrospective study included 104 patients who underwent LLR (n = 46) or open liver resection (OLR) (n = 58) for HCC located in segments 7 or 8 between October 2004 and June 2015. The LLR group was subdivided into two subgroups according to whether LLR was performed before (Lap1; n = 29) or after (Lap2; n = 17) the introduction of the Pringle maneuver, intercostal trocars, and semi-lateral patient positioning.Results:Non-anatomical resection was more frequent (63.0 vs. 29.3%; P Conclusion:LLR can be safely performed for HCC located in segments 7 or 8 with recent improvements in surgical techniques and accumulated experience.
