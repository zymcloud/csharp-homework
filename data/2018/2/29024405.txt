Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is the second most common liver cancer, and it is associated with a poor prognosis. CCA can be divided into intrahepatic, hilar, and distal. Despite the subtype, the median survival is 12-24 months without treatment. Liver transplantation (LT) is recognized worldwide as a curative option for hepatocellular carcinoma. On the other hand, the initial results for LT for CCA were very poor mainly due to a lack of adequate patient selection. In the last 2 decades, improvements have been made in the management of unresectable hilar CCA, and the results of LT after neoadjuvant chemoradiation have been shown to be promising. This has prompted a consideration of hilar CCA as an indication for LT in some centers. Furthermore, some recent research has shown promising results after LT for patients with early stages of intrahepatic CCA. A better understanding of the best tools to prognosticate the outcomes of LT for CCA is still needed. Here, we aimed to review the role of LT for the treatment of patients with perihilar and intrahepatic CCA. Also, we will discuss the most recent advances in the field and the future direction of the management of this disease in an era of transplantation oncology.
