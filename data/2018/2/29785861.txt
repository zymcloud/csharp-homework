Aim:The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic importance of the albumin to globulin ratio (AGR) in terms of overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) in metastatic gastric cancer patients.Methods:The patients diagnosed with metastatic gastric cancer between 2009 and April 2016 at the hospital have been studied retrospectively. The clinicopathological characteristics, laboratory, and treatment parameters have been assessed. AGR value has been calculated using the following formula (AGR = serum albumin/total protein - serum albumin).Results:In total, 251 patients were included in the study population. The median value of AGR was 1.206 (range = 0.460-3.130), and the cut-off value was set as 1.20. Based on the cut-off value, 126 patients were categorized in the low AGR group, while the remaining 125 patients were categorized in the high AGR group. ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance scores, CEA levels, CA19-9 levels, hemoglobin levels, lactate dehydrogenase levels, and liver metastasis ratios varied significantly between the low and high AGR groups (p < .05). The Kaplan-Meier curve has shown that, compared to the low AGR group, the high AGR group has better OS (12.2 vs 9.3 months, p = .002) and better PFS (8.0 vs 5.7 months, p < .001) rates. The univariate and multivariate analyses also proved that low AGR is an independent bad risk factor in metastatic gastric cancer patients, both in terms of OS (p = .019, Hazard Ratio (HR) = 1.380, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.055-1.805) and PFS (p = .002, HR = 1.514, 95% CI = 1.164-1.968).Conclusion:In metastatic gastric cancer patients, AGR is an independent prognostic factor for OS and PFS. Thus, in this patient group, the low cost albumin and globulin which can be measured with routine clinical practice may be used as an appropriate prognostic tool.
