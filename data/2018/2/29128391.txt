Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can manifest as non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is often associated with progressive fibrosis which can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NASH is increasing as an aetiology for end-stage liver disease as well as HCC. There are currently no approved therapies for NASH. A major barrier to development of therapeutics for NASH is the lack of preclinical models of disease that are appropriately validated to represent the biology and outcomes of human disease. Many in vitro and animal models have been developed. In vitro models do not fully capture the hepatic and extrahepatic milieu of human NASH and large animal models are expensive and logistically difficult to use. Therefore, there is considerable interest in the development and validation of mouse models for NAFLD, including NASH. Several models based on varying genetic or dietary manipulations have been developed. However, the majority do not recreate steatohepatitis, strictly defined as the presence of hepatocellular ballooning with or without Mallory-Denk bodies, accompanied by inflammation in the presence of macrovesicular steatosis. Others lack validation against human disease. Herein, we describe the best practices in development of mouse models of NASH. We further review existing models and the literature supporting their use as a surrogate for human disease. Finally, data on models to evaluate protective genes are discussed. It is hoped that this review will provide guidance for the interpretation of data derived from mouse models and also for the development and validation of newer models.
