Background:In recent decades, the patterns and trends of gastrointestinal (GI) cancer epidemics in Chinese population have been changing.Aims:To present the epidemiological trends and geographic distributions of four major GI cancers (esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer and colorectal cancer) in China from 2010 to 2014.Methods:It used standardized data extracted from the National Central Cancer Registry database.Results:The age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) of esophageal cancer decreased from 16.7 to 12.2 per 100,000 and the age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) decreased from 12.0 to 8.8 per 100,000. The ASIR and the ASMR of stomach cancer dropped from 23.7 to 19.5 per 100,000 and from 16.6 to 13.3 per 100,000. The ASIR of liver cancer fell from 21.4 to 17.8 per 100,000 and its ASMR fell from 18.4 per 100,000 to 15.3 per 100,000. The ASIR of colorectal cancer increased from 16.1 to 17.5 per 100,000, whereas the ASMR fluctuated between 7.6 and 7.9 per 100,000. Moreover, the incidence and mortality of each cancer differed between males and females, urban and rural residence, as well as various regions.Conclusion:From 2010 to 2014, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer and liver cancer showed downward trend, while the ASIR of colorectal cancer slightly rose and its ASMR presented stable.
