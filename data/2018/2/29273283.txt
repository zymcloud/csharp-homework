Purpose:To evaluate outcomes in patients with liver metastases from breast cancer treated with stereotactic radiofrequency (RF) ablation.Materials and methods:A retrospective analysis of 29 stereotactic RF ablation treatment sessions in 26 consecutive patients with 64 biopsy-proven breast cancer liver metastases (BCLMs) was conducted. Patients were included only if systemic treatment failed and all visible BCLMs were treatable.Results:Primary and secondary technical success rates were 96.9% (62 of 64) and 100%, respectively. There were no perioperative mortalities. Local recurrence was identified in 5 tumors (7.8%), with no significant differences among tumor sizes (P = .662): < 3 cm (9.3%), 3-5 cm (0%), and > 5 cm (8.3%). Median estimated overall survival (OS) from first stereotactic ablation treatment was 29.3 months ± 8.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.9-46.8 mo; mean, 28.7 mo) after a median follow-up of 23.1 months (mean, 31.3 mo; range, 0.1-100.8 mo). No significant differences in OS (P = .223) were observed among tumor volumes < 50 cm3 (median, 84.9 mo ± 53.1; mean, 58.4 mo), 50-100 cm3 (median, 37.8 mo ± 5.7; mean, 36.3 mo), and > 100 cm3 (median, 17.1 mo ± 3.5; mean, 21.8 mo). Numbers of metastases did not affect estimated OS, with a median OS of 32.7 months ± 10.4 (mean, 35.8 mo) for single lesions vs 17.7 months ± 3.2 (mean, 25.9 mo) for 2/3 lesions and a mean of 68.4 months ± 17.23 for > 3 lesions (P = .113).Conclusions:Multiple-electrode stereotactic RF ablation proved to be a safe minimally invasive alternative to surgical liver resection in selected patients with BCLMs.
