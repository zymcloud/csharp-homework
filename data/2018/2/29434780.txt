Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignancy in the liver, which is a global health problem. The present study aimed to observe the apoptotic effects of berbamine on SMMC-7721 cell lines and to investigate the effects of berbamine on induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The human HCC SMMC-7721 cells were cultured and cell morphology observed using a phase contrast microscope. SMMC-7721 cell apoptosis was examined by employing a flow cytometry assay. The nuclei of SMMC-7721 cells were stained with DAPI and observed by utilizing a laser fluorescence microscope. Cytochrome c (Cyto c) levels were evaluated by using immunofluorescence staining. The reverse transcription-semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-sqPCR) and western blot analysis were used to examine the mRNA and protein levels of B-cell lymphoma 2, (Bcl-2), Bax, Bcl-2-associated X, apoptosis regulator, p53 and survivin, respectively. Berbamine inhibited SMMC-7721 cell growth at 20 and 0 µmol/l, compared with control group (0 µmol/l berbamine). DAPI results demonstrated that berbamine affected the nucleus morphology of SMMC-7721 cells. Berbamine at a concentration of 20 µmol/l (P<0.05) and 40 µmol/l (P<0.01) significantly enhanced apoptosis rate compared with control group. Berbamine triggered Cyto c release from SMMC-7721 cell nuclei to the cytoplasm. Berbamine (10, 20, 40 µmol/l) significantly enhanced Bax and p53 levels and decreased Bcl-2 and survivin levels compared with control group, according to RT-sqPCR and western blot assay findings. In conclusion, berbamine induced SMMC-7721 cell apoptosis, through upregulating p53 expression and downregulating survivin expression, which further triggered mitochondria signaling pathway-mediated apoptosis.
