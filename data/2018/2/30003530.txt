Purpose:To assess the efficacy and safety of drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) in liver cancer patients with different times of previous conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) treatments.Methods:367 liver cancer patients about to receive DEB-TACE treatment were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. All patients were divided into no previous cTACE group (NPC group), 1-2 times previous cTACE group (PC group) and triple or above previous cTACE group (TPC group) according to the times of previous cTACE treatments.Results:There was no difference in complete response (CR) (P = 0.671) and objective response rate (ORR) (P = 0.062) among three groups. Additionally, no difference in overall survival (OS) among groups (P = 0.899) was found. As to liver function, most liver function indexes were deteriorative at 1 week after DEB-TACE operation, but returned to baseline at 1-3 months after DEB-TACE operation in all three groups, while percentage of abnormal total bile acid (TBA) patients was higher in TPC group than NPC and PC groups at 1-3 month post-DEB-TACE (P = 0.018). As for safety profiles, the incidence of pain during DEB-TACE operation was lower in TPC group compared to NPC and PC groups (P = 0.005), while no difference of other adverse events was found during and 1 month post-DEB-TACE treatment among three groups.Conclusion:DEB-TACE treatment was equally efficient and tolerated in liver cancer patients with different times of previous cTACE treatments.
