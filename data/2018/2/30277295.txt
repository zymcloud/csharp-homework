Aim:The aim of this study was to clarify the utility of a no-touch pincer ablation procedure that uses bipolar electrodes to prevent intrasubsegmental tumor recurrence after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to surgical resection.Methods:We evaluated 175 consecutive patients with HCC (single nodule, tumor diameter â‰¤ 30 mm) who underwent surgical resection (146 received partial resection) and 313 patients who received RFA; 277 patients received touch ablation using a monopolar or bipolar RFA device, and 36 received no-touch ablation using a bipolar RFA device. Pretreatment arterial and portal phase dynamic computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images were classified into four enhancement patterns: Type 1 and Type 2 are homogeneous enhancement patterns without or with increased arterial blood flow, respectively; Type 3 is a heterogeneous enhancement pattern with a septum-like structure; and Type 4 is an irregularly shaped ring structure enhancement pattern.Results:Cumulative recurrence rates significantly differed between procedures (surgical resection, 7.5%; no-touch ablation, 2.9%; and touch ablation, 17.7% at the third year; P = 0.005). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that enhancement pattern type (Type 3: hazard ratio [HR], 2.95; P = 0.002; and Type 4: HR, 3.88, P = 0.002), treatment procedure (touch ablation: HR, 3.36; P Conclusion:The no-touch pincer ablation procedure has the potential to prevent intrasubsegmental recurrence after RFA for patients with HCC to the same degree as partial resection.
