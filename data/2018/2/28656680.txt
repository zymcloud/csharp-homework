Aim:Sorafenib is the recommended standard of care for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. However, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) is a treatment option in Asia. We recently developed the assessment for continuous treatment with HAIC (ACTH) score to guide decision-making for continuous HAIC treatment. The purpose of this study was to validate the utility of the ACTH score in a dedicated cohort.Methods:One hundred and thirty-one patients with advanced HCC were enrolled in this study (90 in the training group and 41 in the validation group). The point score (range, 0-3) was calculated as follows: Child-Pugh score before HAIC (A = 0, B = 1), α-fetoprotein (AFP) response (yes = 0, no = 1), and des-γ-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) response (yes = 0, no = 1). The AFP and DCP responses were assessed 2 weeks after HAIC induction; a positive response was defined as a reduction of ≥20% from the baseline.Results:The DCP response in the validation group was significantly associated with treatment response, and the median survival time (MST) was longer in patients with an ACTH score ≤1 (15.9 months) than in those with a score ≥2 (7.0 months; P = 0.002). Survival in all patients showed significant stratification according to the ACTH score; the MSTs associated with scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 points were 21.7, 14.4, 9.5, and 3.8 months, respectively.Conclusion:The ACTH score can aid in the therapeutic assessment and continued treatment planning of HCC patients receiving HAIC.
