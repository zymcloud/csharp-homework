Background & aims:We reported decreased nonprotein respiratory quotient (npRQ) after liver resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, whether liver resection volume affects energy metabolism in these patients is unclear. We aimed to examine the relationship between liver resection and energy metabolism indices.Methods:NpRQ was measured in 53 patients with HCC and seven with at the pre- and postoperative days. Patients were classified into four groups: Minor-lowICG group (n = 17): minor (subsegment or less) resection and low indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (ICGR15) (Results:Compared with the preoperative values, npRQ significantly decreased in the Minor-highICG and Major-lowICG groups and NEFA significantly increased in the Major-lowICG group at postoperative day 14. In single regression analysis, ΔnpRQ significantly correlated with HCV infection and ΔNEFA with resection volume, HCV infection, and ICGR15. In multiple regression analysis, ΔNEFA significantly correlated with resection volume after adjusting for age, etiology, and ICGR15.Conclusions:These results suggest that postoperative nutritional recovery is slower in major resection than in minor resection patients. Hence, nutritional care to prevent starvation is needed in major resection patients.
