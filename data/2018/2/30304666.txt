Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is currently the most commonly studied mycotoxin due to its great toxicity, its distribution in a wide variety of foods such as grains and cereals and its involvement in the development of + (hepatocellular carcinoma; HCC). HCC is one of the main types of liver cancer, and has become a serious public health problem, due to its high incidence mainly in Southeast Asia and Africa. Studies show that AFB1 acts in synergy with other risk factors such as hepatitis B and C virus leading to the development of HCC through genetic and epigenetic modifications. The genetic modifications begin in the liver through the biomorphic AFB1, the AFB1-exo-8.9-Epoxy active, which interacts with DNA to form adducts of AFB1-DNA. These adducts induce mutation in codon 249, mediated by a transversion of G-T in the p53 tumor suppressor gene, causing HCC. Thus, this review provides an overview of the evidence for AFB1-induced epigenetic alterations and the potential mechanisms involved in the development of HCC, focusing on a critical analysis of the importance of severe legislation in the detection of aflatoxins.
