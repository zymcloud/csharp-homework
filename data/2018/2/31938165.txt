Ube2s belongs to the ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzyme family of the ubiquitin system. Expression and function of Ube2s in human malignancies was largely unknown. Here we report our investigation of Ube2s expression in human non-tumor liver and hepatocellular carcinoma tissues using immunohistochemistry. Ube2s expression was detected in nuclear and cytoplasm. The positive rate of Ube2s in normal liver tissues was 19.2% (5/26). The positive rate of Ube2s expression in liver tissues with hepatocirrhosis (33.3% (6/18)) was higher than that in normal liver tissues (P100 ng/ml), advanced TNM stages (II+III), higher ABCL stages (B+C) in hepatocellular carcinoma (PP<0.05). These results indicate that Ube2s may be involved in oncogenesis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma and may be a potential cancer marker and therapy target.
