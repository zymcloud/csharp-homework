The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in pregnancy is rare but is typically aggressive, with a 1-year survival rate of 23%. One of the complications of HCC is spontaneous rupture, resulting in haemoperitoneum. A 36-year-old pregnant Chinese immigrant who was positive for hepatitis B virus and in her first trimester presented to the emergency department of Wyong Hospital, Hamlyn Terrace, New South Wales, Australia, with severe epigastric and right upper quadrant pain and haemodynamic instability. Spontaneous rupture of a heterotopic pregnancy was initially suspected. However, histopathological staining of the lesions excised during surgery revealed HCC. To our knowledge, this is the first case of spontaneous rupture of HCC with haemoperitoneum during pregnancy in Australia. As developed countries receive global migrants, similar cases may be seen in the future. Epidemiological studies suggest that immigrants from China and Vietnam have the highest incidence of chronic hepatitis B virus carrier status.
