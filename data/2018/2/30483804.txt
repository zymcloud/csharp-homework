Docetaxel is a front‑line standard‑of‑care chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of cancers. However, the underlying function and mechanism of docetaxel in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are uncertain. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the effects of docetaxel on cell apoptosis and SOX2 expression in cultured human HCC stem cells. After human HCC stem cells were treated with docetaxel, cell proliferation was assessed by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) method, the cell apoptotic rate was evaluated by flow cytometry, the expression of CD133 and sex determining region Y‑box 2 (SOX2) was determined by RT‑PCR and immunohistochemistry, and the protein levels of CD133, SOX2, phosphoinositide 3‑kinases (PI3K), AKT and phosphorylated AKT (p‑AKT) were analyzed by western blotting. The results indicated that SOX2 and CD133 were highly expressed in patients with HCC while their expression was significantly decreased after patients with HCC were treated with docetaxel. In vitro, docetaxel inhibited the proliferation while it enhanced the apoptosis of human CD133‑expressing HCC stem cells. Furthermore, lower expression of p‑AKT and SOX2 were revealed in the presence of docetaxel. Notably, docetaxel‑inhibited SOX2 expression and growth of human CD133‑expressing HCC stem cells were partially restricted following the block of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway using the inhibitor LY294002. The present study collectively indicated that docetaxel promoted apoptosis and upregulated SOX2 expression of human HCC stem cells through the suppression of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
