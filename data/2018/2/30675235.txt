The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of paeonol on the apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and to explore the possible mechanism of its effect. During the experiment, the human hepatoma (Huh7) cell line was cultured and treated with different concentrations of paeonol. A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to detect the effects of paeonol at different concentrations on the proliferation of Huh7 cells after 24 h, and the optimal concentration of paeonol was selected for follow-up experiments. Huh7 cells were divided into the blank control group (C group), parthenolide [(an inhibitor of nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)] group (CE group), paeonol group (PO group), and paeonol + tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (an activator of NF-κB) group (PN group). The effect of paeonol on the apoptosis of Huh7 cells was detected via flow cytometry and Hoechst staining, respectively. The expression levels of NF-κB and protein apoptosis inhibitor-5 (p-API-5) were detected by semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot analysis, respectively, and the activity of NF-κB in cells was measured by NF-κB p65/50. After determination of the effects of paeonol at different concentrations on Huh7 cells by MTT assay, it was found that paeonol at the concentration of 200-800 µM could inhibit the proliferation of Huh7 cells (P
