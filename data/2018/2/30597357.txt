Many advances have developed in the pathology of liver tumors in the recent decade. Examples of these advances include the use of glutamine synthetase in the diagnosis of focal nodular hyperplasia, subtyping of hepatocellular adenomas using molecular and immunohistochemical methods, the unraveling of the fusion transcript between the DNAJB1 gene and the PRKACA gene in fibrolamellar carcinoma, and the more unified classification and terminology in intrahepatic bile duct tumors and their precursor lesions. Nevertheless, challenges still remain, e.g., the differential diagnosis between well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatocellular adenoma; distinction among poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma and metastatic neoplasm; terminology of the combined hepatocellular carcinoma-cholangiocarcinoma, etc. This review aims to address updates in the pathologic diagnosis and clinical relevance of tumors of the liver and intrahepatic bile ducts in adults and their differential diagnosis and diagnostic pitfalls.
