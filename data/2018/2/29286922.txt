Background:Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The most serious consequence of CHC is HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Objective:To illustrate the clinical significance of lncRNA HEIH expression in serum and exosomes in the development of HCV-related HCC.Methods:Thirty-five CHC, twenty-two HCV-induced cirrhosis and ten HCV-related HCC patients in Huzhou Central Hospital from January 2016 to September 2016 were recruited in the present study. Basic patient information, clinical serological indicators, and clinical imaging data were investigated and analyzed. Serum samples were collected from patients after receiving informed consent. Exosomes were extracted from the serum, and electron microscopy was used to observe the ultrastructure of exosomes. Quantitative PCR was used to detect lncRNA HEIH gene expression in serum and exosomes.Results:The changes in the ALT, GGT, HDL, INR, Alb and AFP levels in the patients with HCV-induced cirrhosis and HCV-related HCC were statistically significant. In patients with HCV-related HCC, lncRNA-HEIH expression in serum and exosomes was increased, but the ratio of lncRNA-HEIH expression in serum versus exosomes was decreased compared to patients with CHC.
