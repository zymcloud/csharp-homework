Changes in TCA cycle enzymes or respiratory activity are possible mechanisms of aerobic glycolysis that contributes to tumor progression. To clarify whether the decrease of succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB) alters energy metabolism, induces the Warburg effect and results in tumor malignancy, SDHB expression was examined and modulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cells, respectively. SDHB level was often decreased in malignant HCC cells and tissues. Furthermore, the reduced SDHB expression was associated with advanced tumor stage and poor survival rate. Moreover, silencing of SDHB altered energy metabolism switched from aerobic respiration to glycolysis, resulted in the Warburg effect, and enhanced cell proliferation and motility. In contrast, the SDHB overexpression deregulated bioenergetic metabolism and decreased cell growth and migration. In mouse xenograft models, subcutaneous implantation and tail vein injection with SDHB knockdown cells resulted in a larger tumor volume and accelerated cancer metastasis, respectively. A mutation or decrease in SDHB induced the switch from aerobic respiration to glycolysis. This metabolic alteration was associated with tumor cell dedifferentiation, proliferation, motility and overall patient survival in HCC.
