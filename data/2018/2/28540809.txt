Background:The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic outcome of percutaneous computed tomography (CT)-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for extrahepatic oligometastases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Institutional review board approval was obtained for this retrospective study, and all patients provided written informed consent. Between April 2004 and December 2015, 116 oligometastases (diameter, 5-50 mm; 20.3 ± 10.4) in 79 consecutive HCC patients (73 men and 6 women; average age, 50.3 years ±13.0) were treated with RFA. We focussed on patients with 1-3 extrahepatic metastases (EHM) confined to 1-2 organs (including the lung, adrenal gland, bone, lymph node and pleura/peritoneum) who were treated naïve with curative intent. Survival, technical success and safety were evaluated. The log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyse the survival data.Results:No immediate technical failure occurred, and at 1 month, the technique effectiveness rate was determined to be 95.8%. After a median follow-up time of 28.0 months (range, 6-108 months), the 1-, 2- and 3-year overall survival (OS) rates were 91, 70 and 48%, respectively, with a median survival time of 33.5 months. Time to unoligometastatic progression (TTUP) of less than 6 months (p Conclusions:CT-guided RFA for oligometastatic HCC may provide favourable efficacy and technical success with a minimally invasive approach.
