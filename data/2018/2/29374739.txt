Background:Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an alternative to hepatic resection and one of the major therapeutic options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we investigated the long-term outcomes of RFA as an initial treatment for HCC.Patients and methods:From January 2000 to December 2014, we treated 1,043 patients with RFA for HCC at the Kumamoto University Hospital; 327 of these patients (31.4%) were treated for primary HCC. After exclusion of 75 patients who underwent combined therapy, data for 252 patients were examined. We retrospectively analyzed the long-term outcomes of RFA and identified factors of poor prognosis.Results:The median platelet count, prothrombin activity and indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min were 9.1×104/μl, 83% and 26%, respectively. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 69% and the median survival time was 7.0 years. The 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate was 17%, and the median RFS was 2.0 years. A multivariate analysis revealed that age >80 years [hazard ratio (HR)=7.76, p=0.011], tumor diameter >2 cm (HR=1.68, p=0.047) and multiple tumors (HR=1.87, p=0.014) were independent prognostic factors for poor OS. For RFS, des-γ-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) ≥40 mAU/ml (HR=1.47, p=0.038) and multiple tumors (HR=1.63, p=0.0056) were independent prognostic factors. Local recurrence at the ablated site occurred in 33/252 patients (13%), and in 33/372 tumors (8.9%).Conclusion:Although our cohort included patients with relatively worse liver function, a favorable 5-year survival rate 69% was obtained by RFA. DCP ≥40 mAU/ml and multiple HCCs contribute to a higher risk of recurrence. Patients with these factors should therefore be followed-up intensively.
