Objectives:To assess the efficacy of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) with and without adjunctive embolisation in managing cardiofundal varices bleeding.Methods:The retrospective study comprised 82 patients (54 men; mean age 53.9 years; mean Model of End-stage Liver Disease score 9.3) with cardiofundal varices bleeding who underwent TIPS creation from 2011 to 2015. Variceal rebleeding, the outflow tracts of varices, overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and post-procedure varices patency were assessed.Results:Gastrorenal shunt was present in 92.7% of patients (n = 76). Embolisation was performed in 67.1% of patients (n = 55). The 1- and 2-year variceal rebleeding rates in the TIPS combined with embolisation group were significantly lower than those in the TIPS alone group (3.8% and 13.4% vs 13.0% and 28.0%, respectively; p = 0.041). No significant differences between the two groups were found in the cardiofundal varices patency, overt HE or survival (p > 0.05).Conclusions:The results suggest that TIPS combined with embolisation can reduce the risk of variceal rebleeding for patients with cardiofundal varices.Key points:• TIPS combined with embolisation reduces the risk of rebleeding in treating cardiofundal varices. • TIPS combined with embolisation could not completely occlude cardiofundal varices. • TIPS combined with embolisation could not prevent the development of hepatic encephalopathy.
