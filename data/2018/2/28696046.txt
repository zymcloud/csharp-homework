Aim:The prognostic value of lymphocyte infiltration into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still controversial, and it has not been reported in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-positive or non-B non-C (NBNC) HCC. The aim of this study is to assess the prognostic significance of lymphocyte infiltrate in tumor for HBV-positive and NBNC HCC patients.Methods:This study investigated 145 HBV-positive or NBNC patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC between January 2001 and May 2009. Cumulative recurrence rate, overall survival (OS), and clinicopathological parameters were analyzed according to lymphocyte infiltration in tumor.Results:In patients with low lymphocyte infiltration, the 5-year recurrence rate was higher and OS was poor (86.4 and 44.1%, respectively) than that of the patients with high lymphocyte infiltration (55.3 and 83.7%, respectively). Multivariate analyses revealed that independent risk factors for recurrence were low albumin value (hazard ratio [HR] 2.33, P = 0.009), high American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) T stage (HR 2.31, P Conclusions:Lymphocyte infiltrate in tumor is significantly associated high recurrence rate and poor overall survival. Evaluation of the infiltrating lymphocyte could improve the prediction of prognosis in HCC patients after curative resection.
