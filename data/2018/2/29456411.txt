Aim:To investigate the utility of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) kinetics in chronic hepatitis B patients during long-term entecavir treatment.Methods:This retrospective study included treatment-na√Øve chronic hepatitis B patients who received at least 2 years of consecutive entecavir treatment. Patients were followed up at three to six month intervals with liver biochemistry, hepatitis B virus DNA, and abdominal sonography. In hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients, HBeAg levels were assessed every three to six month until results became negative. Serum HBsAg levels were determined at the baseline, one-year and five-year time points. Liver cirrhosis was diagnosed through liver biopsy, imaging examinations, or clinical findings of portal hypertension. Hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed by histological examination or dynamic image studies.Results:A total of 211 patients were enrolled. The median treatment time was 5.24 (2.00-9.62) years. Multivariate analysis showed that lower baseline HBsAg levels were associated with an earlier virological response, earlier hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion, and earlier biochemical response in HBeAg-positive patients (cut-off value: 4 log IU/mL) and an earlier virological response in HBeAg-negative non-cirrhotic patients (cut-off value: 2.4 log IU/mL). Although HBsAg levels decreased slowly during long-term entecavir treatment, higher HBsAg decrease rates were found in the first year for HBeAg-positive non-cirrhotic patients, and patients with higher baseline HBsAg levels. More favorable clinical outcomes were not observed by a rapid HBsAg decline per se, but depended on lower baseline HBsAg levels.Conclusion:Baseline HBsAg can be used to predict treatment responses. HBsAg levels and decrease rates should be considered together according to disease status while interpreting HBsAg changes.
