Previous studies have reported that microRNAs regulate gene expression and transcription. miR-21 have been identified to play a role in many types of cancer. KLF5 functions as a tumor inhibitor in certain cancers. However, the role of KLF5 plays in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially concerning the relationship between miR-21 and the KLF5 gene remains to be determined. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), western blot analysis, as well as luciferase reporter and Transwell assays were used to determine the expression of miR-21 and KLF5 in Huh 7, SK-HEP-1, LO-2, and HCC tissues. In HCC cells and tissues, the upregulation of miR-21 was identified. HCC cell migratory and invasive abilities significantly increased because of miR-21 overexpression. KLF5 expression was inhibited by miR-21 by targeting its 3'-UTR. KLF5 overexpression alleviated the effect induced by miR-21 on the migratory and invasive ability of the Huh 7 cells. The results therefore show that, HCC cell migration and invasion is significantly suppressed by miR-21 via targeting KLF5. The newly identified miR-21/KLF5 axis provides a useful therapeutic biomarker for HCC treatment.
