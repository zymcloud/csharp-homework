Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent cancers. It has been demonstrated that various cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in HCC development. Here, we analyzed the miRNA profile in HCC tissues by Solexa sequencing, and we identified a novel microRNA, miR-HCC1, which is upregulated in HCC tissues. Further experiments showed that miR-HCC1 promoted HCC cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro, and migration and invasion resulting from the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Nuclear factor I/X (NFIX), which inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion in HCC cells, was identified as a direct and functional target of miR-HCC1. Furthermore, lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1), a transcription factor, was shown to bind the promoter of miR-HCC1 and activate its expression. Collectively, these results indicate that LEF1-upregulated miR-HCC1 functions as an oncogene through the negative regulation of NFIX expression, which links the LEF1/miR-HCC1/NFIX axis to contribute to cell proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells and could provide novel insights into miRNA function and hepatocarcinogenesis and potential biomarkers for HCC.
