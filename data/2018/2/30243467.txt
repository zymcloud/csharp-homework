Background:ABO-incompatible (ABO-I) living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has been reported to have acceptable outcomes in the era of rituximab-based prophylaxis. However, the outcomes of ABO-I LDLT for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain to be elucidated. This study aimed to clarify the impact of ABO-Incompatibility on oncologic outcomes of LDLT for HCC.Methods:Patients with HCC who underwent ABO-I LDLT were randomly matched by 1:2 ratio to those who underwent ABO-compatible (ABO-C) LDLT according to propensity score. HCC recurrence and patient survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.Results:Between January 2012 and December 2015, a total of 160 patients underwent LDLT for HCC confirmed by pathology analysis of liver explants. Thirty-nine consecutive patients underwent ABO-I LDLT for HCC, and 78 ABO-C LDLT patients were selected by propensity score matching, which made no significant difference between the two groups in baseline, perioperative, and tumor characteristics. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates in the ABO-I and ABO-C LDLT groups were 76.9%, 68.5%, 63.6% and 74.4%, 70.5%, 70.5%, respectively (p = 0.77). The site distribution of initial recurrence showed no significant difference between the two groups. The overall survival rates over the same period in the ABO-I and ABO-C LDLT groups were 82.1%, 73.5%, 73.5% and 92.2%, 80.3%, 80.3%, respectively (p = 0.34).Conclusions:ABO-I LDLT, having no adverse impact on oncological outcomes, can be a feasible transplant option for HCC.
