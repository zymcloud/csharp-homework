Background:Laparoscopic major hepatectomy (LMH) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with cirrhosis remains controversial due to limited reports in the literature. This study analyzed the perioperative and oncological outcomes of LMH for HCC with cirrhosis compared with open major hepatectomy (OMH).Methods:A retrospective analysis of patients with cirrhosis who underwent major hepatectomy for HCC between January 2015 and January 2017 was performed. Patients were divided into the LMH group and the OMH group. Short-term and oncological outcomes were compared before and after 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM).Results:A total of 103 HCC patients who received major liver resection were enrolled. There were 36 (35.0%) patients in the LMH group and 67 (65.0%) patients in the OMH group. After 1:1 PSM, well-matched 32 patients in each group were evaluated. Significant differences were observed in operative time (median, 255 vs. 200 min, p Conclusions:LMH for HCC patients with liver cirrhosis showed comparable results in terms of postoperative morbidity and oncological outcomes compared with traditional open procedure. LMH may serve as a safe and feasible alternative for selected HCC patients with cirrhosis.
