Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most important cause of adult liver transplantation in China. HCC recurrence after liver transplantation is a common clinical problem. It is imperative to explore its metastasis and recurrence mechanism and to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies. This article describes the basic prevention and treatment strategies for recurrent HCC after liver transplantation. During the pre-transplant period, the clinical and pathological information of HCC, such as tumor staging, general morphology, pathological features, tumor markers and tumor molecular biological characteristics, should be collected and analyzed carefully in order to determine the risk of recurrent HCC; Design and implement a comprehensive program of prevention and treatment. Currently, sorafenib and capecitabine are common candidate drugs for prevention and control of recurrence of HCC after liver transplantation. Substitution of m-TOR inhibitors for CNI-like drugs can be used as an immunosuppressive drug to prevent and control recurrence of HCC. HCC recurrence after liver transplantation will significantly reduce the cure rate, but active treatment often can effectively control the progression of the disease and improve the prognosis. However, available effective measures to prevent the progress of HCC can also be used to treat HCC recurrence after liver transplantation. Surgical treatment is preferred for recurrent lesions that can be resected, and local treatment is available for recurrent lesions that cannot be resected. Drug treatment can inhibit tumor growth to a certain extent, but it is difficult to achieve a satisfying prognosis by single drug, commonly used as adjuvant therapy.
