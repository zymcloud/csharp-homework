Background:Hemorrhage during the liver transection is the major hazard for laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH). We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a 915-MHz microwave device used in LH.Methods:Data were retrospectively analyzed regarding 60 patients who underwent LH with or without 915-MHz microwave coagulation at our center from January 2016 to June 2016. 30 patients underwent the 915-MHz microwave-assisted LH (MW group), and 30 patients otherwise were considered as control group.Results:No perioperative mortality was observed. Intraoperative blood loss amounts in microwave group and control group were 26.83 ml and 186.33 ml, respectively (P < 0.001). The durations of parenchyma transaction (55.17 vs. 70.83 min, P < 0.001), blood occlusion (2.17 vs. 25.33 min, P < 0.001), and operation (120.67 vs. 148.00 min, P < 0.001) were much shorter in microwave group compared with control group. Lower incidence of postoperative complications (0.0 vs. 14.3%, P = 0.038) and shorter length of postoperative hospital stay (6.00 vs. 7.23 days, P = 0.027) were also noted in the microwave group, compared with the control group.Conclusion:915-MHz microwave-assisted LH was found to be safe and efficient.
