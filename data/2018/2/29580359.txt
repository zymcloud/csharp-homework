Both radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and surgical resection (SR) are radical treatment recommended for early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a palliative treatment for intermediate HCC, and TACE+RFA combined therapy is considered superior to TACE or RFA alone for management of early HCC. This systematic review compared the efficacy and safety of TACE+RFA combined therapy with SR for early HCC. Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for literatures related with our topic. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoint was the recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate; safety was measured by the rate of major complications. The effect sizes of OS, RFS, and local progression rates were expressed by odds ratio (OR), while the effect size of complications was presented using relative risk. TACE+RFA combined therapy and SR had a similar 1-year OS rate [OR: 1.84; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.82, 4.14; P > 0.05], 3-year OS rate (OR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.43, 1.67; P > 0.05), 1-year RFS rate (OR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.53, 1.11; P > 0.05), and 3-year RFS rate (OR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.48, 1.42; P > 0.05) for early HCC. However, the 5-year OS rate (OR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.73; P
