Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent primary hepatic cancer. Pathological features can define the biological behavior and prognosis. Medullary-like HCC is a very rare variant that has been described only twice in literature. In the present study, we report the case of a non-cirrhotic 72-year-old man, who presented two HCC lesions on routine screening for hepatitis C virus liver disease. Radiological imaging and biopsy showed two different subtypes: one classic HCC, which was treated with chemoembolization, and a second PET/CT-positive carcinoma with a PET/CT-positive metastatic coeliac lymph node, which was resected laparoscopically with a left lateral sectionectomy and extended lymphadenectomy. Histopathology revealed a medullary-like HCC; lymph node analysis confirmed the metastatic nature of the PET/CT-positive coeliac node and showed an incidental B-cell lymphoma in the hepatic pedicle lymph nodes. To the best of our knowledge this is the third case of medullary-like HCC described in the literature, and the first associated to a concomitant typical HCC.
