Despite technical difficulties, right lobe liver grafting is preferred in living donor liver transplantation because of the graft size. Re-exploration after living donor right lobe liver transplantation (LRLT) has never been separately analyzed. We aimed to analyze the incidence, causes, outcomes, and risk factors of re-exploration after LRLT. We reviewed medical records of 1016 LRLT recipients from October 2003 to July 2017 and identified recipients who underwent re-exploration within hospital stay. Separate analyses were also performed according to cause of re-exploration. The overall incidence of re-exploration was 17.0% (173/1016). The most common cause of re-exploration was bleeding (50%). Overall re-exploration was associated with clinical outcome, but different results were shown on analyses according to cause of re-exploration. Risk factors of re-exploration were underlying hepatocellular carcinoma and operative duration [Odds ratio (OR), 1.49; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05-2.12; P = 0.03, and OR, 1.002; 95% CI, 1.001-1.004; P = 0.0023, respectively]. Re-exploration after LRLT is relatively common, and is strongly associated with mortality and graft failure.
