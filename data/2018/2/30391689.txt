Objectives:Perioperative nutritional management is essential for early recovery after liver surgery. The aim of this study was to assess changes in amino acid levels in serum and urine after hepatectomy.Methods:Serum samples were collected from 16 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma before and 1, 3, and 14 d after hepatectomy (S0, S1, S3, and S14, respectively). Spot urine samples were collected before and 3 d after the hepatectomy (U0 and U3). Metabolites in the serum and urine were analyzed.Results:Compared with S0, insulin levels significantly increased in the S1 and S3 samples. Valine levels significantly decreased in S1 and S14, and leucine levels significantly decreased in S14. Phenylalanine levels significantly increased in S1 and S3, and tyrosine levels significantly increased in S1. The Fischer ratio (branched-chain/aromatic amino acids) significantly decreased in S1 and S3. In multiple regression analysis, changes in serum taurine levels were related to the white blood cell count in S1 and S3, and inversely related to alanine aminotransferase levels in S14. Changes in serum glutamine levels were negatively related to C-reactive protein levels in S3. Serum glutamine levels decreased in S3 and S14, and tended to increase in U3, suggesting a deficiency of glutamate resulting from the invasive surgical procedure.Conclusions:These findings highlight the usefulness of metabolome analysis for characterizing perioperative patterns after liver resection. The observed amino acid pattern, including the reduction in Fischer ratio, underscores the need for specialized nutritional support.
