Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease, and its detection in the general population has reached a global scale. Despite the fact that in the early stages the disease is characterized by a relatively mild period, the development during its natural course of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma causes deterioration of long-term forecast. Growing evidence indicates that NAFLD is a complex, multifaceted etiology, involving many factors, including genetic. In the present review, we focused on the genetic component of NAFLD, namely, the role of the PNPLA3 gene polymorphism in the development and course of the disease, and States its progression, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
