Hepatocholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-ICC) is a rare primary hepatic tumor defined by the presence of histological features of both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Its prevalence ranges from 1%-5% of all primary liver cancers. We report the case of a 55-year-old cirrhotic male patient admitted to our university hospital for dysphagia, revealing a 10 cm lower-third esophageal metastasis of an unresectable cHCC-ICC with stem-cell features. Computed tomography and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed multiple hepatic lesions combining features of both HCC and ICC, associated with synchronous bone metastasis. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses of biopsies from the esophageal lesion and the hepatic tumor confirmed the diagnosis of cHCC-ICC with a stem cell-subtype, according to the World Health Organization classification. After a multidisciplinary meeting, the patient was treated with chemotherapy. He received two cycles of a gemcitabine plus cisplatin regimen before bone progression, and he died 3 mo after the initial diagnosis.
