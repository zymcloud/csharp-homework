Background:To compare the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MeS) in cancer survivors returning to the community to that of non-cancer controls.Methods:We used baseline data from a nationwide cohort study. 5274 cancer survivors and 20,703 and 21,096 gender- and age-matched controls without and with chronic disease was included.Results:The prevalence of MeS was higher in cancer survivors compared to controls without chronic disease, but was lower than that in controls with chronic disease (25.7%, 18.8%, and 32.0%, respectively). The prevalence was 1.56-fold higher in cancer survivors (95% confidence interval = 1.45-1.69) than in controls without chronic disease. The prevalence of each MeS component was significantly higher in cancer survivors compared to controls without chronic disease. Compared to controls, the prevalence was higher in colorectal, breast, cervical, lung, thyroid, prostate, and bladder cancer survivors (OR range = 1.63-2.24, P-value < 0.05), but not in gastric and liver cancer survivors.Conclusions:MeS was generally more prevalent among cancer survivors than in controls without chronic disease, but with heterogeneities in cancer type. Because long-term care and comorbidity prevention are emerging issues in cancer survivors, MeS among those returning to normal life is concerning, and tailored management programs should be developed for specific cancer types.
