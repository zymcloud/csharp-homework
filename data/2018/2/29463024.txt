Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the critical stage of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The persistence of necroinflammatory lesions and fibrogenesis in NASH is the leading cause of liver cirrhosis and, ultimately, hepatocellular carcinoma. To date, the histological examination of liver biopsies, albeit invasive, remains the means to distinguish NASH from simple steatosis (NAFL). Therefore, a noninvasive diagnosis by serum biomarkers is eagerly needed. Here, by a proteomic approach, we analysed the soluble low-molecular-weight protein fragments flushed out from the liver tissue of NAFL and NASH patients. On the basis of the assumption that steatohepatitis leads to the remodelling of the liver extracellular matrix (ECM), NASH-specific fragments were in silico analysed for their involvement in the ECM molecular composition. The 10 kDa C-terminal fragment of the ECM protein vitronectin (VTN) was then selected as a promising circulating biomarker in discriminating NASH. The analysis of sera of patients provided these major findings: the circulating VTN fragment (i) is overexpressed in NASH patients and positively correlates with the NASH activity score (NAS); (ii) originates from the disulfide bond reduction between the V10 and the V65 subunits. In conclusion, V10 determination in the serum could represent a reliable tool for the noninvasive discrimination of NASH from simple steatosis.
