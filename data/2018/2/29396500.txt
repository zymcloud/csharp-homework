Cancer-specific promoter driven replication of oncolytic adenovirus (Ad) is cancer-specific, but shows low transcriptional activity. Thus, we generated several chimeric Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) promoter variants, containing reconstituted enhancer and silencer regions, to preferentially drive Ad replication in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Modified AFP promoter, containing 2 enhancer A regions and a single enhancer B region (a2bm), showed strong and HCC-specific transcription. In AFP-positive HCCs, gene expression was 43- to 456-fold higher than those of control AFP promoter lacking enhancers. a2bm promoter was further modified by inserting multiple hypoxia-responsive elements (HRE) to generate Ha2bm promoter, which showed stronger transcriptional activity than a2bm promoter under hypoxic conditions. Ha2bm promoter-regulated oncolytic Ad (Ha2bm-d19) showed a stronger antitumor and proapoptotic effect than did a2bm promoter-regulated oncolytic Ad (a2bm-d19) in HCC xenograft tumors. Systemically administered Ha2bm-d19 caused no observable hepatotoxicity, whereas control replication-competent Ad, lacking cancer specificity (d19), induced significant hepatic damage. Ha2bm-d19 caused significantly lower expression of interleukin-6 than d19, showing that HCC-targeted delivery of Ad attenuates induction of the innate immune response against Ad. This chimeric AFP promoter enabled Ad to overcome the hypoxic tumor microenvironment and target HCC with high specificity, rendering it a promising candidate for the treatment of aggressive HCCs.
