Aim:To compare intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM)-derived parameters with conventional diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) parameters in predicting the histological grade of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to evaluate the correlation between the parameters and the histological grades.Methods:A retrospective study was performed. Sixty-two patients with surgically confirmed HCCs underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with twelve b values (10-1200 s/mm2). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), pure diffusion coefficient (D), pseudo-diffusion coefficient (D*), and perfusion fraction (f) were calculated by two radiologists. The IVIM and conventional DWI parameters were compared among the different grades by using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of distinguishing between low-grade (grade 1, G1) and high-grade (grades 2 and 3, G2 and G3) HCC. The correlation between the parameters and the histological grades was assessed by using the Spearman correlation test. Bland-Altman analysis was used to evaluate the reproducibility of the two radiologists' measurements.Results:The differences in the ADC and D values among the groups with G1, G2, and G3 histological grades of HCCs were statistically significant (P < 0.001). The D* and f values had no significant differences among the different histological grades of HCC (P > 0.05). The ROC analyses demonstrated that the D and ADC values had better diagnostic performance in differentiating the low-grade HCC from the high-grade HCC, with areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.909 and 0.843, respectively, measured by radiologist 1 and of 0.911 and 0.852, respectively, measured by radiologist 2. The following significant correlations were obtained between the ADC, D, and D* values and the histological grades: r = -0.619 (P < 0.001), r = -0.628 (P < 0.001), and r = -0.299 (P = 0.018), respectively, as measured by radiologist 1; r = -0.622 (P < 0.001), r = -0.633 (P < 0.001), and r = -0.303 (P = 0.017), respectively, as measured by radiologist 2. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) values between the two observers were 0.996 for ADC, 0.997 for D, 0.996 for D*, and 0.992 for f values, which indicated excellent inter-observer agreement in the measurements between the two observers.Conclusion:The IVIM-derived D and ADC values show better diagnostic performance in differentiating high-grade HCC from low-grade HCC, and there is a moderate to good correlation between the ADC and D values and the histological grades.
