Introduction:Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the foremost treatment option for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, rapid and aggressive recurrence of HCC often occurs after RFA due to epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. Although combination of RFA with sorafenib, a molecular targeted agent, could attenuate the recurrence of HCC, application of this molecular targeted agent poses a heavy medical burden and oral administration of sorafenib also brings severe side effects.Materials and methods:In this study, we prepared an apatinib microcrystal formulation (Apa-MS) that sustainably releases apatinib, a novel molecular targeted agent, for advanced HCC treatment. We injected apatinib solution or Apa-MS into subcutaneous HCC tumors.Results:It was found that Apa-MS exhibited slow apatinib release in vivo and in turn inhibited the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of HCC cells for extended time. Moreover, in rodent HCC model, Apa-MS enhanced the antitumor effect of RFA treatment.Conclusion:Based on these results, we conclude that Apa-MS, a slow releasing system of apatinib, allows apatinib to remain effective in tumor tissues for a long time and could enhance the antitumor effect of RFA on HCC.
