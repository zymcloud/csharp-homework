Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide and has poor prognosis. Specially, patients with HCC usually have poor tolerance of systemic chemotherapy, because HCCs develop from chronically damaged tissue that contains considerable inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Since HCC exhibits highly heterogeneous molecular characteristics, a proper in vitro system is required for the study of HCC pathogenesis. To this end, we have established two new hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA-secreting HCC cell lines from infected patients.Methods:Based on these two new HCC cell lines, we have developed chemosensitivity assays for patient-derived multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTSs) in order to select optimized anti-cancer drugs to provide more informative data for clinical drug application. To monitor the effect of the interaction of cancer cells and stromal cells in MCTS, we used a 3D co-culture model with patient-derived HCC cells and stromal cells from human hepatic stellate cells, human fibroblasts, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells to facilitate screening for optimized cancer therapy.Results:To validate our system, we performed a comparison of chemosensitivity of the three culture systems, which are monolayer culture system, tumor spheroids, and MCTSs of patient-derived cells, to sorafenib, 5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin, as these compounds are typically standard therapy for advanced HCC in South Korea.Conclusion:In summary, these findings suggest that the MCTS culture system is the best methodology for screening for optimized treatment for each patients with HCC, because tumor spheroids not only mirror the 3D cellular context of the tumors but also exhibit therapeutically relevant pathophysiological gradients and heterogeneity of in vivo tumors.
