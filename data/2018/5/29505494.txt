Background:Rising alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a potential marker of worse prognosis after liver transplant (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but prior studies relied on only 2 data points and were imprecise in assessing AFP slope. The aim of this study was to examine the association between AFP slope and post-LT HCC recurrence, with AFP slope estimated from multiple data points over time.Methods:Our cohort included 336 patients undergoing LT with Model for End Stage Liver Disease exception for HCC within Milan criteria from 2003 to 2013. Most (98%) had pre-LT locoregional therapy. AFP slope was estimated by fitting a regression line to the AFP levels over time.Results:The 1- and 5-year post-LT survivals were 94% and 77% and 1- and 5-year recurrence-free probabilities were 95% and 86%, respectively. In univariate analysis, HCC recurrence was significantly associated with microvascular invasion (hazard ratio [HR], 13.1; PMilan criteria (HR, 8.9; P7.5 (HR, 3.0; P=0.03) were significantly associated with HCC recurrence. AFP slope greater than 7.5 was also associated with microvascular invasion (odds ratio, 6.8; P=0.008).Conclusions:AFP slope increasing greater than 7.5 ng/mL per month despite locoregional therapy is associated with post-LT HCC recurrence and may serve as a surrogate for microvascular invasion. These findings support incorporating changes in the AFP into candidate selection for LT.
