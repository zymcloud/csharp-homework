Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the major causes of tumor death; thus, the identification of markers related to its diagnosis and prognosis is critical. Previous studies have revealed that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is involved in tumor invasion and metastasis, and the forkhead box protein C2 (FOXC2) has been shown to promote tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and EMT. In the present study, we examined the clinicopathological significance of FOXC2 and EMT-related markers in clinical HCC specimens and identified factors related to the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC.Methods:The expression of FOXC2 and EMT-related markers was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 84 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma.Results:A high expression of FOXC2 was observed in 26 of 84 cases, and expression was significantly correlated with background liver cirrhosis, poor tumor differentiation, high serum AFP, and elevated cell proliferation markers. In addition, this high expression was related to the induction of the Cadherin switch and vimentin expression and was an independent predictor for poor prognosis.Conclusion:The high expression of FOXC2 in HCC is correlated with tumor malignancy and poor prognosis, suggesting that FOXC2 may be an important prognostic factor for HCC.
