The current work presents the synthesis and biological evaluation of new series of coumarin hydrazide-hydrazone derivatives that showed in vitro broad spectrum antitumor activities against resistant pancreatic carcinoma (Panc-1), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and leukemia (CCRF) cell lines using doxorubicin as reference standard. Bromocoumarin hydrazide-hydrazone derivative (BCHHD) 11b showed excellent anticancer activity against all tested cancer cell lines. Enzyme assays showed that BCHHD 11b induced apoptosis due to activation of caspases 3/7. Moreover, 11b inhibited GST and CYP3A4 in a dose dependent manner and the induced cell death could be attributed to metabolic inhibition. Moreover, 11b microarray analysis showed significant up- and down-regulation of many genes in the treated cells related to apoptosis, cell cycle, tumor growth and suppressor genes. All of the above presents BCHHD 11b as a potent anticancer agent able to overcome drug resistance. In addition, compound 11b was able to serve as a chemical carrier for 99mTc and the in vivo biodistribution study of 99mTc-11b complex revealed a remarkable targeting ability of 99mTc into solid tumor showing that 99mTc-11b might be used as a promising radiopharmaceutical imaging agent for cancer.
