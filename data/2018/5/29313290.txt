Background:Chronic HBV plays an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesis. Previously, most studies have been focusing on HBV DNA levels before the primary curative hepatectomy. However, the association of virus level before repeat hepatectomy with the degrees of inflammation and fibrosis on histopathology and prognosis has not been surveyed.Methods:From January 2002 to December 2009, all patients who were seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were enrolled and assigned into four groups based on their HBV DNA levels before the primary and repeat hepatectomies. The cancer prognoses of these four groups of patients after the first and second operations were assessed and compared. The disease-free survival and overall survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors for the primary and repeat hepatectomies.Results:For the 385 patients in this study, a low level of serum HBV DNA before repeat hepatectomy, but not primary hepatectomy, was significantly associated with improvement in prognosis, in terms of tumor recurrence, liver fibrosis, and liver-related mortality.Conclusion:The levels of HBV DNA before hepatectomies were crucial prognostic risk factors of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Surveillance of serum HBV DNA levels at multiple time points, rather than at a single time point, and antiviral therapy to suppress the virus to a low level had beneficial effects for these patients.
