Hepatopancreatoduodenectomy (HPD) is usually indicated for the resection of locally advanced bile duct (BD) cancer or gallbladder (GB) cancer. Previous studies have demonstrated a favorable survival rate in BD cancer patients after HPD if R0 resection is achieved. By contrast, the benefit of HPD for GB cancer remains controversial. This study aimed to analyze the outcomes of GB and BD cancer after HPD. Between January 2004 and December 2013, a total of 22 patients underwent HPD for BD (n = 14) or GB cancer (n = 8). We analyzed the survival, mortality, morbidity, and prognostic factors. After HPD, the mortality rate was 4.5 per cent and the morbidity rate was 68.2 per cent. Pancreatic fistula occurred in 50.0 per cent of the patients (grade A, 40.9%; grade B, 9.1%). Liver failure did not occur. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates for BD cancer patients were 57.1, 17.9, and 17.9 per cent and those for GB cancer patients were 62.5, 25.0, and 25.0 per cent, respectively (P = 0.768). In BD cancer, significant prognostic factors were tumor size, portal vein invasion, multiple lymph node metastases, and operation time. Furthermore, BD cancer patients with three or more of risk factors showed poorer survival than those with fewer than three risk factors. HPD for GB and BD cancer can be performed with acceptable mortality and morbidity rates. GB cancer patients who underwent HPD showed comparable survival rates compared with BD cancer patients. Long-term survival can be achieved in selected patients with BD cancer.
