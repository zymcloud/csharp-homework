Methionine sulfoxide reductase B1 (MsrB1) is a member of the selenoprotein family, which contributes to the reduction of methionine sulfoxides produced from reactive oxygen species (ROS) by redox processes in energy pathways. However, few studies have examined the role of MsrB1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We observed that MsrB1 is highly expressed in HCC tissues and that its expression correlated with the prognoses of patients with HCC after hepatectomy. In vitro, knockdown of MsrB1 inhibits HCC cell growth by MTT and EdU proliferation assay, and MsrB1 interference enhances H2O2/trx-induced apoptosis. We observed that phosphorylation of the key proteins of the MAPK pathway, namely, ERK, MEK, and p53, was inhibited, but PARP and caspase 3 were increased, thus infecting mitochondrial integrity. In vivo, MsrB1 knockdown effectively inhibited tumor growth. Furthermore, MsrB1 knockdown reduced HCC cell migration and invasion in a transwell assay through inhibition of cytoskeletal rearrangement and spread. This change was linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inhibition resulting from increases in E-cadherin expression and decreases in expression in TGF-Î²1, Slug, MMP-2/9, and so on. MsrB1 regulates HCC cell proliferation and migration by modulating the MAPK pathway and EMT. Thus, MsrB1 may be a novel therapeutic target with respect to the treatment of HCC.
