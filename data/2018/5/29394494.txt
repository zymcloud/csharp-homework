The proteasomal system is a promising target for cancer treatment. Quercetin (Que), a flavonoid compound with antitumor ability, displays the inhibitory effect on proteasome activity. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are ill defined. The present study found that Que treatment significantly reduced the chymotrypsin-like protease activity of proteasome whereas the trypsin- and caspase-like protease activities remained unchanged in HepG2 cancer cells, along with activation of p38 MAPK and JNK and reduction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Que-reduced proteasome activity could not be reverted by inhibition of p38 MAPK and JNK signaling pathway. In addition, MEK1 overexpression or knockdown upregulated or downregulated the chymotrypsin-like protease activity of proteasome, respectively. Both Que and MEK1/ERK1/2 inhibitor attenuated the expression levels of proteasome β subunits. These results indicate that Que-induced suppression of MEK1/ERK1/2 signaling and subsequent reduction of proteasome β subunits is responsible for its inhibitory impacts on proteasome activity.
