Background/aim:Tumor recurrence complicates more than half of patients at 5 years after primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resection. Repeat open liver resection (ROLR) is the standard procedure for patients eligible for repeat resection, whereas laparoscopic repeat liver resection (RLLR) has been proposed as an alternative approach. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate studies reporting on outcomes of RLLR for recurrent HCC (rHCC).Materials and methods:A comprehensive search of the literature was undertaken.Results:A total of 11 studies, 6 non-comparative and 5 comparative (RLLR versus ROLR), which reported outcomes for 165 patients who underwent RLLR, were included in our review. RLLRs were associated with reduced blood loss, shorter hospital stay, lower conversion to ROLR and lower morbidity rates.Conclusion:Selected patients with rHCC who undergo RLLR, benefit in terms of short-term outcomes. Larger prospective trials will elucidate the impact of RLLR on long-term outcomes and establish treatment guidelines.
