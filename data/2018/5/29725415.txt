As a non-histone chromatin-associated protein, high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) performs a pivotal function in various human diseases, including autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Overexpression of HMGB1 has been demonstrated in numerous types of cancer, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the underlying mechanism of HMGB1 function in lung cancer remains to be elucidated. The present study aimed to analyze, and summarize the role and mechanism of HMGB1 in lung cancer by retrieving available literature regarding HMGB1 in association with lung cancer. It provides comprehensive information on the association of HMGB1 with the carcinogenesis and progression of lung cancer, and discusses the molecular mechanism of these processes. HMGB1 may induce tumorigenesis, metastasis and chemotherapy resistance in lung cancer. Overall, it is evident that HMGB1 serves an important role in the development and progression of lung cancer, and this review warrants further investigation into HMGB1 as a novel target for cancer therapy.
