Sarcomas are a group of malignant tumors originating from mesenchymal tissue with a variety of cell subtypes. Despite several major treatment breakthroughs, standard treatment using surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy has failed to improve overall survival. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore new strategies and innovative therapies to further improve the survival rates of patients with sarcomas. Pathological angiogenesis has an important role in the growth and metastasis of tumors. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) play a central role in tumor angiogenesis and represent potential targets for anticancer therapy. As a novel targeted therapy, especially with regard to angiogenesis, apatinib is a new type of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively targets VEGFR-2 and has shown encouraging anticancer activity in a wide range of malignancies, including gastric cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and sarcomas. In this review, we summarize the preclinical and clinical data for apatinib, focusing primarily on its use in the treatment of sarcomas.
