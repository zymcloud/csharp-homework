Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most important causes of cancer deaths worldwide. Gene therapy is a novel approach for treating HCC. A safe and efficient gene delivery method, using viral or non-viral vectors, is a crucial factor for developing a successful HCC gene therapy. Among non-viral vectors, cationic solid lipid nanoparticles (cSLN) have advantages such as biocompatibility and transfection efficiency. In this study, novel cSLN were prepared, characterized and complexed with a plasmid (shNUPR1) capable of inhibiting the expression of the NUPR1 gene, which is involved in HCC growth and chemoresistance. The particles resulted biocompatible, as confirmed by haemolysis and cytotoxicity assays, and was able to protect the shNUPR1 plasmid from degradation by DNase I. We also demonstrated, by carrying out transfection and immunofluorescence studies, that the particles efficiently delivered the shNUPR1 plasmid into HCC cells, causing the downregulation of NUPR1-regulated genes and NUPR1 protein expression. These results suggest that the cSLN obtained could be proposed for further in vivo studies as novel transfection vectors for HCC gene therapy, having shown excellent in vitro transfection efficiency and biocompatibility.
