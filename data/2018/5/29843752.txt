Background:To report our experience with SBRT in primary and secondary liver tumors.Methods:We retrospectively analysed 55 patients (70 lesions) with a median follow-up of 10 months (range 1-57) treated from 2011 to 2016. All patients had not been eligible for other local treatment options. Median age was 64 years and 64% were male. 27 patients (36 lesions) suffered from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, Child A:78%, Child B:18%, Child C:4%), 28 patients (34 lesions) had oligometastatic liver disease (MD). Treatment planning was based on 4D-CT usually after placement of fiducials. Dose and fractionation varied depending on localization and size, most commonly 3 Ã— 12.5 Gy (prescribed to the surrounding 65%-isodose) in 56% and 5x8Gy (80% isodose) in 20% of the treated lesions.Results:Local recurrence was observed in 7 patients (13%) and 8 lesions (11%), resulting in estimated 1- and 2-year local control rates (LC) of 91 and 74%. Estimated 1- and 2-year rates of Freedom from hepatic failure (FFHF) were 42 and 28%. Number of lesions was predictive for LC and FFHF in the entire cohort. Estimated 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) was 76 and 57%. OS was significantly affected by number of treated lesions and performance status. In the HCC subgroup, pretreatment liver function and gender were also predictive for OS. Maximum acute non-hepatic toxicity was grade 1 in 16% and grade 2 in 10% of the patients. Three HCC patients (11%) developed marked deterioration of liver function (grade 3/4).Conclusions:SBRT resulted in high local control and acceptable survival rates in patients with HCC or MD not amendable to other locally-ablative treatment options with limited toxicity. Care should be taken in HCC patients with Child B cirrhosis.
