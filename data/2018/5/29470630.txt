Purpose:Treatment of malignancies invading the hepatic veins/inferior vena cava is a surgical challenge. An ante situm technique allows luxation of the liver in front of the situs to perform tumor resection. Usually, cold perfusion and veno-venous bypass are applied. Our experience with modified ante situm resection relying only on total vascular occlusion is reported.Methods:Retrospective analysis on an almost 15-year experience with ante situm resection without application of cold perfusion or veno-venous bypass RESULTS: The ante situm technique was applied on eight patients. Five individuals were treated due to intrahepatic cholangiocellular cancer and one case each for mixed cholangio-/hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal liver metastasis, and pheochromocytoma. Trisectorectomy (n = 4), left hemihepatectomy, right hepatectomy, atypical resection, or mesohepatectomy (each n = 1) were performed, combined with dissection of suprahepatic/retrohepatic vena cava/hepatic veins. Venous reconstruction was achieved by reimplantation of hepatic veins with/without vascular replacement using allogeneic donor veins or PTFE grafts. Median total vascular occlusion of the liver was 23 min. Severe morbidity occurred in three patients (Dindo-Clavien > 3A). R0 status was achieved in six cases with a median overall survival of 33.5 months.Conclusions:Ante situm liver resection can be applied without cold perfusion nor veno-venous bypass with acceptable morbidity and mortality. However, this procedure remains challenging even for the experienced hepato-pancreato-biliary surgeon.
