Purpose:To compare utilization and effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and surgical resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The 2004-2015 United States National Cancer Database was queried for HCC patients treated by RFA and surgical resection. Patients were 1:1 propensity score matched. Duration of hospital stay, unplanned readmission rates, and overall survival (OS) were compared in the matched cohort via multivariable regression models.Results:Eighteen thousand two hundred ninety-six patients were included (RFA, n = 8211; surgical resection, n = 10,085). RFA was more likely in young male whites with high degree of hepatic fibrosis, high bilirubin levels, high INR, and multifocal HCC; resection was more likely in those with private insurance, high income, high cancer grade and stage, and larger HCC. RFA rates varied between 32.3% (East South Central) and 58.5% (New England). Post-treatment outcomes were superior for RFA versus resection regarding duration of hospital stay (median 1 vs. 5d, p 65 years old (5-year OS 21.9% vs. 26.5%, p = 0.47), and for HCC Conclusion:RFA for HCC shows substantial variation by geography, socioeconomic factors, liver function, and tumor extent. RFA offers superior post-treatment outcomes versus surgical resection and may be an alternative for older patients with cirrhosis and/or small HCC.Key points:• Duration of hospital stay, unplanned readmissions, and 30-/90-day mortality are lower for RFA versus surgical resection. • RFA and surgical resection show similar survival in severe hepatic fibrosis. • In HCC
