Objectives:To determine the degree of relationship between iodine concentrations derived from dual-energy CT (DECT) and perfusion CT parameters in patients with advanced HCC under treatment.Methods:In this single-centre IRB approved study, 16 patients with advanced HCC treated with sorafenib or radioembolization who underwent concurrent dynamic perfusion CT and multiphase DECT using a single source, fast kV switching DECT scanner were included. Written informed consent was obtained for all patients. HCC late-arterial and portal iodine concentrations, blood flow (BF)-related and blood volume (BV)-related perfusion parameters maps were calculated. Mixed-effects models of the relationship between iodine concentrations and perfusion parameters were computed. An adjusted p value (Bonferroni method) Results:Mean HCC late-arterial and portal iodine concentrations were 22.7±12.7 mg/mL and 18.7±8.3 mg/mL, respectively. Late-arterial iodine concentration was significantly related to BV (mixed-effects model F statistic (F)=28.52, pConclusions:In advanced HCC lesions, DECT-derived late-arterial iodine concentration is strongly related to both aBF and BV, while portal iodine concentration mainly reflects BV, offering DECT the ability to evaluate both morphological and perfusion changes.Key points:• Late-arterial iodine concentration is highly related to arterial BF and BV. • Portal iodine concentration mainly reflects tumour blood volume. • Dual-energy CT offers significantly decreased radiation dose compared with perfusion CT.
