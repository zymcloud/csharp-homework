Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide with a great potential for metastatic spread. Hepatocellular carcinoma often arises in people with underlying viral hepatitides or liver cirrhosis and may present in various ways including abdominal pain, liver mass, and signs of hepatocellular decompensation. Many tumors may have metastasized to other organs such as the lungs, lymph nodes, bone, and adrenal glands at the time of diagnosis. However, it is uncommon for HCC to present purely due to its metastasis, such as spinal cord compression from vertebral metastasis. Here, an unusual presentation of a sudden cardiovascular collapse due to medullary and cervical cord infarction from compression of the cervical cord is presented. The importance of clinical investigations, the usefulness of postmortem computed tomography scans, and the examination of the cervical spine and cervical cord in people with no obvious cause of death after standard autopsy procedures are emphasized.
