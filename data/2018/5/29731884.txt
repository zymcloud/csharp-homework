The aim of the present study was to determine the expression profile of microRNA 638 (miR-638) and sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to investigate their association with clinicopathological features and survival. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to investigate miR-638 and SOX2 expression in 78 patients with HCC. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses were performed in order to determine SOX2 protein expression in HCC samples. Combined with the clinical postoperative follow-up data, the expression of miR-638 and SOX2 and the association between this and the prognostic values of patients with HCC were statistically analyzed. The results of the present study confirmed that miR-638 expression in tumor tissues was significantly downregulated (P0.05). Notably, follow-up analysis revealed that patients with HCC with low miR-638 expression and high SOX2 expression tended to have a significantly shorter postoperative survival time (P
