Background:Sorafenib has shown survival benefits in patients with advanced HCC; however, limited data are available on its role in OLT recipients with advanced HCC in the explant.Aim:Evaluate the role of preemptive sorafenib therapy on HCC recurrence and survival after OLT with advanced HCC on explant pathology.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the outcome after OLT of all HCC recipients with advanced HCC in the explant pathology from 04/2006 to 12/2012 based on preemptive treatment with sorafenib.Results:During the observation period, 217 HCC recipients underwent OLT; 50 explants revealed advanced HCC. After exclusion of 5 patients who were lost to follow-up, 45 LT recipients were finally included for analysis. Recipients were grouped as sorafenib Gr (N = 25) and nonsorafenib Gr (N = 20). Both recurrence-free survival (RFS) (P = .67) and overall survival were similar between groups (P = .53) on Kaplan-Meier analysis. Additionally, sorafenib use was neither associated with HCC recurrence-free survival (HR 0.74, 95% CI [0.32-1.70]; P = .48) nor overall survival (HR 0.92, 95% CI [0.39-2.15], P = .84) on multivariate Cox proportional hazard model with sorafenib use as time-varying covariates.Conclusion:Preemptive treatment with sorafenib in OLT recipients with high-risk features in explant does not improve HCC recurrence-free or overall survival.
