Aim:To evaluate the safety and efficacy of sorafenib plus transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment for intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Sixty-seven patients with intermediate-stage [Barcelona Clinic liver cancer stage B (BCLC-B)] HCC who were treated with sorafenib plus TACE or TACE alone between 2009 and 2011 were included in the study. Follow-up was until 2014 or patient death. Two groups were defined in the experiment: The experimental group, treated with sorafenib plus TACE, and the control group, treated with standard TACE alone.Results:The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the median overall survival (mOS) of the experimental group was 35.2 mo, while that of the control group was 22.0 mo (P < 0.05). Sorafenib plus TACE showed higher incidence rates of rash, hand-foot syndrome (HFS), and hypertension (P < 0.05) than TACE treatment alone.Conclusion:Sorafenib plus TACE treatment for BCLC-B HCC significantly prolonged the mOS of patients compared to TACE treatment alone. The most common toxicities with sorafenib were rash (31.6%), HFS (39.5%) and hypertension (31.6%), but there were no intolerable adverse events. The Cox multivariate analysis showed that the survival of patients with BCLC-B HCC depended on the Child-Pugh classification, tumor diameter, and treatment with sorafenib plus TACE compared to TACE alone.
