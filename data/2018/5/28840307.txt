Purpose:To analyze the feasibility of 2D-perfusion angiography (2D-PA) for the quantification of perfusion reduction following transarterial chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE).Methods:Overall, 24 DEB-TACE procedures in 19 patients were included. To quantify changes in tumor perfusion following DEB-TACE using 2D-PA, the acquired digital subtraction angiography (DSA) series were post-processed. A reference region-of-interest (ROI) in a main hepatic artery and two, distal target ROIs in embolized tumor tissue and in non-target liver parenchyma were placed in corresponding areas on DSA pre- and post-DEB-TACE. The time to peak (TTP), peak density (PD), and the area under the curve (AUC) were assessed and the ratios reference ROI/target ROIs were calculated.Results:In the embolized tumor, the 2D-PA ratios changed significantly (p 0.05). PDtumor/PDinflow differed significantly to PDparenchyma/PDinflow pre-DEB-TACE (p < 0.0001), likewise AUCtumor/AUCinflow to AUCparenchyma/AUCinflow (p < 0.0001) with higher values in tumor tissue. The post-DEB-TACE ratios of AUC decreased significantly in the tumor tissue compared to the non-target liver parenchyma (p < 0.05).Conclusion:2D-PA offers an objective approach to quantify the immediate perfusion reduction of embolized tumor tissue following DEB-TACE and may therefore be used to monitor peri-interventional stasis and to quantify technical success.
