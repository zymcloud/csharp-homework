Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most fatal cancer types worldwide. HCC cells were proved to overexpress c-Src and Sgk1, a tyrosine and a serine-threonine kinase, respectively, whose role is crucial for the development and progression of the tumor. Pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives are a class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors that have shown good activity against HepG2. HCC cells were also proved to overexpress plasmin, which is localized on the cell surface bound to its receptors. In this study, a tripeptide with sequence d-Ala-Phe-Lys, which binds a specific reactive site of plasmin, was synthesized and characterized. This tripeptide was used to decorate liposomes encapsulating three selected pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines. Liposomes bearing tripeptide have been characterized, not showing remarkable differences with respect to the corresponding tripeptide-free liposomes. In vitro HepG2 cell uptake profiles and cytotoxicities showed that the presence of the tripeptide on the liposomal membrane surface improves the cell-penetrating ability of liposomes and increases the activity of two of the three tested compounds.
