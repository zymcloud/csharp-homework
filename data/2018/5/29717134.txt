The chronic inflammatory microenvironment within or surrounding the primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) site promotes oncogenic transformation as well as contributes to the development of metastasis. G3BP stress granule assembly factor 1 (G3BP1) was found to be involved in the regulation of multiple cellular functions. However, its functions in RCC have not been previously explored. Here, we first showed that the expression of G3BP1 is elevated in human RCC and correlates with RCC progression. In cultured RCC cells, knockdown of G3BP1 results in inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, consistently with the alteration of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell proliferative markers, including Cadherins, Vimentin, Snail, Slug, c-Myc, and cyclin D1. Remarkably, knockdown of G3BP1 dramatically impaired the signaling connection of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 stimulation and downstream STAT3 activation in RCC, thus eventually contributing to the disruption of IL-6-elicited RCC migration and metastasis. In addition, in vivo orthotopic tumor xenografts results confirmed that knockdown of G3BP1 suppressed RCC tumor growth and metastasis in mice. Collectively, our findings support the notion that G3BP1 promotes tumor progression and metastasis through IL-6/G3BP1/STAT3 signaling axis in RCC.
