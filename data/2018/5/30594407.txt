Background:The role of liver resection for multinodular (≥3 nodules) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear, especially among patients with severe underlying liver disease. We sought to evaluate surgical outcomes among patients with cirrhosis and multinodular HCC undergoing liver resection.Methods:Using a multicenter database, outcomes among cirrhotic patients who underwent curative-intent resection of HCC were examined stratified according to the presence or absence of multinodular disease. Perioperative mortality and morbidity, as well as overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were compared between the two groups.Results:Among 1066 cirrhotic patients, 906 (85.0%) had single- or double-nodular HCC (the non-multinodular group), while 160 (15.0%) had multinodular HCC (the multinodular group). There were no differences in postoperative 30-day mortality and morbidity among non-multinodular versus multinodular patients (1.8% vs. 1.9%, P = 0.923, and 36.0% vs. 39.4%, P = 0.411, respectively). In contrast, 5-year OS and RFS of multinodular patients were worse compared with non-multinodular patients (34.6% vs. 58.2%, and 24.7% vs. 44.5%, both P Conclusions:Liver resection can be safely performed for multinodular HCC in the setting of cirrhosis with an overall 5-year survival of 34.6%. Tumor number ≥5, total tumor diameter ≥8 cm and microvascular invasion were independently associated with decreased OS and RFS after resection in cirrhotic patients with multinodular HCC.
