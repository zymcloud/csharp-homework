Purpose of review:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) affects a significant portion of patients with hepatitis C. The use of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents has transformed the disease outcomes in this patient group.Recent findings:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) response to DAAs can be affected by the presence of HCC, whereas DAA therapy may affect the risk of HCC recurrence in patients with a history of HCC.Summary:Emerging data are demonstrating lower sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in patients with HCC compared with patients without HCC. Conflicting studies have also suggested that rates of HCC recurrence in patients with a history of HCC can potentially be increased or decreased on DAA therapy. This review will provide a brief overview of these data and inform practitioners on important considerations to make when prescribing DAA therapy for patients with HCV and HCC.
