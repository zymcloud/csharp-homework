Background:Sorafenib is recommended for the first-line treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the median progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with HCC and major portal vein tumor thrombosis treated with sorafenib monotherapy is no more than 3 months. A prospective single-arm phase II study was conducted to determine whether adding hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin to sorafenib could improve on these results.Methods:Thirty five patients were treated with sorafenib 400 mg orally twice a day, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 HAI on day 1, leucovorin 400 mg/m2 HAI on days 1, and 5-fluorouracil 2800 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2, repeated every 21 days. The primary end point was the 3-month PFS rate.Results:The 3-, 6-, and 12-month PFS rates were 82.9, 51.4, and 22.9%, respectively. The median PFS and overall survival was 6.7 and 13.2 months, respectively. The objective response rate was 40%, and the disease control rate was 77.1% by RECIST criteria. Five (14.3%) patients achieved conversion to complete resection after the study treatment, and one of them experienced a pathological complete response. Treatment-related deaths did not occur. Grade 3-4 toxicities consisted of increases in aspartate aminotransferase (31.4%), hand-foot syndrome (17.1%), thrombocytopenia (14.3%), and neutropenia (8.6%).Conclusions:The combination treatment met the pre-specified end point of a 3-month progression free survival rate exceeding 65% and was clinical tolerable. The merits of this approach need to be established with a phase III trial. Clinical trial number http://ClinicalTrials.gov (No. NCT02981498).
