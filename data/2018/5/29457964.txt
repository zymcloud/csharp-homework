Purpose To determine the outcomes after initial therapy in patients with chronic liver disease and retrospectively assigned Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS; version 2014) category 4 (LR-4) and 5 (LR-5) nodules at gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MR imaging. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 260 patients with a single LR-4 (n = 132) or LR-5 (n = 128) nodule who were assigned a LI-RADS category were included. Patients were identified between January 2012 and December 2012, and were initially treated by resection, liver transplant, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), or transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system. Follow-up continued until August 31, 2016. The incidences of local tumor recurrence (ILRs) and distant tumor recurrence (IDRs) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were compared between the LR-4 and LR-5 patients. For each category, ILRs, IDRs, and RFS were compared across the four treatments. Results LR-5 patients were more frequently treated by surgical resection than LR-4 patients (72.7% [93 of 128] vs 41.7% [55 of 132], respectively; P Â© RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.
