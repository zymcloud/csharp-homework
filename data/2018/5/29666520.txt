Basella is an important green leafy vegetable species of Chenopodiaceae family and is known for its medicinal properties. Hydroxy-benzoic acids, hydroxy-cinnamic acids and flavones groups were identified and characterized from the aqueous stem extracts of B. alba and B. rubra species. Higher values of phenolics as well as antioxidant activity were noted from B. alba species extracts. The evaluation of the cytoxicity of these extracts on A431 (epidermoid carcinoma), Hep G2 (hepatocellular carcinoma) and MG 63 (osteosarcoma) cells indicated anti-proliferative activity against all the cell lines. B. alba extract showed higher anti-proliferative activity (37.95-84.86%). Chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay revealed inhibition of neo-vessels formation. Significant suppression was found with extracts of B. alba at 7 mg/ml compared to that of B. rubra. This is the first study to report the anti-angiogenic activity of Basella species. These studies indicate that Basella sps can be used as a source of natural antioxidants and can be of high significance in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries.
