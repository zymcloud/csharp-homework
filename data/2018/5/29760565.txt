Background:The aim of this investigation was to identify candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and molecular pathways associated with tumor protein p53 (TP53) expression status in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), clarify their potential mechanisms, and generate SNP-to-gene to pathway hypothesis.Materials and methods:Identify candidate Causal SNPs and Pathways (ICSNPathway) was used to perform pathway analysis based on the results of our previous genome-wide association study of TP53 expression status in 387 HBV-related HCC patients.Results:Through the ICSNPathway analysis, we identified 18 candidate SNPs and 10 candidate pathways that are associated with TP53 expression status in HBV-related HCC. The strongest mechanism involved the modulation of major histocompatibility complex, class II, DP beta 1 (human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-DPB1-rs1042153), major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ beta 1 (HLA-DQB1-rs1130399, HLA-DQB1-rs1049056, HLA-DQB1-rs1049059, and HLA-DQB1-rs1049060), and major histocompatibility complex, class II, DR beta 1 (HLA-DRB1-rs35445101). SNPs consequently affected regulatory roles in all the candidate pathways except hematopoietic cell lineage pathways. Association analysis using the GSE14520 data set, Gene Multiple Association Network Integration Algorithm, and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins suggests that all genes of the candidate SNPs were associated with TP53. Survival analysis showed that the collagen type VI alpha 3 chain (COL6A3) rs111231885 and COL6A3-rs113155945 and COL6A3 block 4 CC haplotypes with TP53 negative status may have protective effects in HBV-related HCC patients after hepatectomy.Conclusion:Our pathway analysis identified 18 candidate SNPs and 10 candidate pathways that were associated with TP53 expression status in HBV-related HCC. Among these candidate SNPs, the genetic variation of COL6A3 may be a potential prognostic biomarker of HBV-related HCC.
