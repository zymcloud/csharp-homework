Background:The current study aims to investigate the impact of baseline characteristics on the outcomes of sorafenib-treated advanced Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in the setting of a clinical trial.Methods:This is a secondary analysis of the comparator arm (sorafenib arm) of the NCT00699374 study which is a phase III multicenter study conducted between 2008 and 2010. The univariate probability of overall and progression-free survival was assessed among different patient subsets through Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank testing. Multivariate analysis of factors affecting overall and progression-free survival was then conducted through Cox regression analysis.Results:All patients within the comparator (sorafenib) arm were included in the analysis (N = 544 patients). In multivariate analysis, prior hepatectomy (P = 0.028), prior locoregional treatment (P = 0.048), grade 1 ALBI score (P Conclusion:Within a cohort of highly selected advanced HCC patients, baseline patient-, liver-, and disease-centered variables play an important role in predicting patient outcomes. This information is important in terms of therapeutic decision-making and patient counseling.
