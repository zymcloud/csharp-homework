Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 39 (ARHGEF39), also called C9orf100, is a new member of the Dbl-family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Although ARHGEF39 has been proven to regulate tumor progression in hepatocellular carcinoma, the downstream signaling pathway of ARHGEF39 and its clinical associations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are currently unknown. In the present study, using MTT, colony formation, flow cytometry, mice xenografts, wound healing, and transwell assays, we showed that ARHGEF39 promoted tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, ARHGEF39 promoted the expression of Cyclin A2, Cyclin D1, and MMP2 by activating Rac1, leading to increased phosphorylation of P38 and ATF2. Treatment with a P38 inhibitor counteracted the effect of ARHGEF39 overexpression on the increase in Cyclin A2, Cyclin D1, and MMP2 expression. Moreover, the elevated levels of p-P38 and p-ATF2 caused by ARHGEF39 overexpression could be inhibited by expression of a dominant negative Rac1 mutant (T17N). In addition, the inhibition of the expression of p-P38 and p-ATF2 by ARHGEF39 RNAi could be restored by the expression of a constitutively active Rac1 mutant (Q61L). A similar impact on cell growth and invasion was observed after ARHGEF39 overexpression combined with the P38 inhibitor, Rac1 T17N, or Rac1 Q61L. Using immunohistochemistry, ARHGEF39 expression was observed to correlate positively with larger tumor size in clinical samples from 109 cases of NSCLC (P = 0.008). The Kaplan-Meier test revealed that ARHGEF39 expression significantly affected the overall survival of patients with NSCLC (52.55 ± 6.40 months vs. 64.30 ± 5.40 months, P = 0.017). In conclusion, we identified that ARHGEF39 promotes tumor growth and invasion by activating the Rac1-P38-ATF2 signaling pathway, as well as increasing the expression of Cyclin A2, Cyclin D1, and MMP2 in NSCLC cells. ARHGEF39 may be a useful marker to predict poor prognosis of patients with NSCLC.
