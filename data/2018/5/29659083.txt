A 48-year old man with no history of liver disease or alcohol addiction developed jaundice, itching and dark urine without any symptom of abdominal pain.A CT examination revealed the presence of a liver mass extending between segments 4, 5 and 8 that was found to be an acinar cell carcinoma at biopsy. The primary hepatic origin was confirmed mainly excluding a primary pancreatic tumor by diagnostic work-up.Since the lesion was considered unresectable at the time of the diagnosis, the patient underwent to Xeloda and oxaliplatin neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with progressive reduction in size of the mass as a sign of good response to therapy.
