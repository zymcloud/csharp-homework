Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been investigated as a novel class of regulators of cellular processes, including cell growth, apoptosis and carcinogenesis. lncRNA BRAF-activated non-protein coding RNA (BANCR) has recently been revealed to be involved in tumorigenesis of numerous types of cancer, including papillary thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. However, the expression profiles and biological relevance of lncRNA BANCR in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not yet been reported. In the present study, the expression level of BANCR in tumor tissues and para-cancerous tissues was determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCC, and its association with clinicopathological characteristics of patients was analyzed. The results demonstrated that the expression level of BANCR was significantly reduced in tumor tissues in comparison with in para-cancerous tissues (P
