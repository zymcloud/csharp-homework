Background and objective:To compare the survival outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) who received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) before or after intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).Methods:During the study period, the survival outcomes of HCC patients with PVTT who underwent TACE before (TACE-RT) or after IMRT (RT-TACE) were compared. Using propensity score matching (PSM), matched pairs of patients were compared.Results:There were 76 patients in the TACE-RT group and 36 patients in the RT-TACE group. Using a 2:1 matching, 75 patients were included into this study after PSM: 50 patients in the TACE-RT group and 25 patients in the RT-TACE group. Before PSM, patients in the RT-TACE group showed significantly better survival when compared with the TACE-RT group (median survival, 13.2 months vs.7.4 months; P = 0.014) for patients with main trunk PVTT, and after PSM, the corresponding median survival was 13.2 months vs.7.4 months (P = 0.020). When compared with TACE-RT, RT-TACE had a significantly lower rate of worsening in liver function (9.5% vs. 33.3%, P = 0.044) for patients with main trunk PVTT.Conclusions:For HCC patients with main trunk PVTT, IMRT followed by TACE yielded better survival outcomes and liver function when compared to TACE followed by IMRT.
