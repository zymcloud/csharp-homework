Background:Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and mismatch repair gene mutation (MMR) status are emerging biomarkers in immunotherapy. MMR status and TILs have significant clinical implications with regard to treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. We designed a study to determine the frequency and prognostic utility of TILs and MMR in advanced unresectable noncolorectal gastrointestinal (NCGI) malignancies.Methods:This is a retrospective cohort study of patients who were diagnosed with advanced noncolorectal gastrointestinal tumors. Biopsy specimens were tested for MMR status by immunohistochemistry along with evaluation of TILs. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to determine the impact of TILS and MMR on survival.Results:We analyzed 146 patients; the mean age at diagnosis was 66.4 ± 11.2 years. 65.8% patients were male, and 62.3% patients had stage 4 disease. All cases had proficient MMR status. The percentage of patients with TILs >5 was 50.7%. There was no statistically significant difference in median overall survival (OS) by TILs when stratified by stage of tumor. When stratified by type of tumor, median OS by TILs level was significantly different for hepatocellular cancers (⩽5 TILs, 86 days versus >5 TILs 312 days, P = .031).Conclusions:Our study suggests that MMR-deficient tumors are quite rare in advanced NCGI malignancies. More than 5 TILs per high power field, evaluated simply on a routine hematoxylin and eosin-stained glass slide confer a better prognosis to most noncolorectal gastrointestinal malignancies, especially hepatocellular carcinoma. This has immense clinical utility with regard to eligibility for immunotherapy.
