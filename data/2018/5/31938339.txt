We set out to investigate biological functions and potential molecular mechanisms of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC cell line Bel-7404 was cultured and transfected with antisense to the ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1-AS1). Viability and mobility were detected by MTT and wound healing assays. Additionally, enrichment analysis and functional networks of UCHL1-AS1 related genes in HCC were performed. Results showed that high level UCHL1-AS1 could effectively inhibit HCC cell migration. However, there was no significant correlation between overexpressed UCHL1-AS1 and HCC proliferation. Meanwhile, BMP4, CALM3, and HRAS were selected from 204 genes that related to UCHL1-AS1. All of these hub genes play critical roles in HCC occurrence and development. Thus, underlying molecular mechanisms among hub genes and UCHL1-AS1 in HCC might be valuable for prognosis and treatment.
