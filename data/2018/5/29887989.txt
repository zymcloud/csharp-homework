Quantitative 2D and 3D contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) was assessed to evaluate early transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment response. Seventeen patients scheduled for TACE for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma participated in the study. 2D and 3D CEUS were performed for each patient at three time points: prior to TACE, 1-2 weeks post TACE, and 1 month post TACE. Peak-intensities of the tumor and surrounding liver tissue were calculated from 2D and 3D data before and after TACE and used to evaluate tumor treatment response. Residual tumor percentages were calculated from 2D and 3D CEUS acquired 1-2 weeks and 1 month post TACE and compared with results from MRI 1 month post TACE. Nine subjects had complete response while 8 had incomplete response. Peak-intensities of the tumor from 3D CEUS prior to TACE were similar between the complete and incomplete treatment groups (p=0.70), while 1-2 weeks (pvs. incomplete response to TACE as early as 1-2 weeks post treatment.
