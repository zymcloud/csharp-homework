Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer. In the current study, genome-wide miRNA-Seq and mRNA profiles in 318 LIHC patients derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analysed to identify miRNA-based signatures for LIHC prognosis with survival analysis and a semi-supervised principal components (SPC) method. A seven-miRNA signature was confirmed for overall survival (OS) prediction by comparing miRNA profiles in paired primary tumour and solid tumour normal tissues. Thereafter, a linear prognostic model that consisted of seven miRNAs was established and used to divide patients into high- and low-risk groups according to prognostic scores. Subsequent Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the seven-miRNA signature correlated with a good predictive clinical outcome for 5-year survival in LIHC patients. Additionally, this miRNA-based prognostic model could also be used for OS prognosis of LIHC patients in early stages, which could guide the future therapy of those patients and promote the OS rate. Moreover, the seven-miRNA signature was an independent prognostic factor. In conclusion, this signature may serve as a prognostic biomarker and guide LIHC therapy, and it could even be used as an LIHC therapeutic target in the future.
