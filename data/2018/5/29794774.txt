The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of 2 different embolic agents, namely gelatin sponge particle (GSP) and Lipiodol, for transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).We retrospectively reviewed 87 consecutive patients with unresectable HCC who underwent Lipiodol TACE with lobaplatin and 87 consecutive patients with unresectable HCC who underwent GSP TACE with lobaplatin between January 2013 and June 2017 in our institution as the initial treatment. Both groups were compared considering the clinical and laboratory outcomes and imaging findings before and after TACE. Tumor response and adverse events were also evaluated.There was significant difference in the rate of complete and overall response between the groups (P = .029 and .001, respectively), specifically when the tumor size was >5 cm (P = .001). The disease control rate was significantly better in the GSP group than in the Lipiodol group (94.3% vs. 86.4%, P = .011). The response differences in higher stages were significant between the 2 groups (P = .035 and .007, respectively). The grades of adverse events were also significantly different between the groups (P = .000).GSP-as an embolic agent in TACE for HCC-could significantly increase the rate of tumor response 1 month after treatment, especially in large tumors, without any significant increase in severe adverse events, when compared to Lipiodol.
