Background:Chemerin, a known chemoattractant, participates in multiple biological events. However, its role in cancer remains largely unknown.Methods:Chemerin expression was evaluated by real-time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. Forced expression, RNAi, immunoprecipitation, etc. were used in function and mechanism study. Mouse models of extrahepatic and intrahepatic metastasis were employed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of chemerin.Results:Chemerin expression was significantly downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma, and associated with poor prognosis of HCC patients. Forced expression of chemerin inhibited in vitro migration, invasion and in vivo metastasis of HCC cells. Administration of chemerin effectively suppressed extrahepatic and intrahepatic metastases of HCC cells, resulting in prolonged survival of tumour-bearing nude mice. Chemerin upregulated expression and phosphatase activity of PTEN by interfering with PTEN-CMKLR1 interaction, leading to weakened ubiquitination of PTEN and decreased p-Akt (Ser473) level, which was responsible for suppressed migration, invasion and metastasis of HCC cells. Positive correlation between chemerin and PTEN, and reverse correlation between chemerin and p-Akt (Ser473) were also observed in HCC clinical samples and intrahepatic mouse model in vivo.Conclusions:Our study has revealed the suppressive role and therapeutic potential of chemerin in HCC metastasis, providing both a prognostic marker and drug candidate for HCC.
