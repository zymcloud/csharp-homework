Two or more histologically distinct malignancies diagnosed during the same hospital admission are uncommon, but they do exist. Cases with synchronous primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma are rarely seen. This is a case report of a 56 years old Caucasian female with the chief complaint of jaundice over a duration of 10 days. CT imaging findings revealed a 3.5 cm ill-defined pancreatic head mass and a 1.5 cm liver mass in the segment 5. EUS-FNA cytology showed pancreatic head ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Liver biopsy revealed a well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The patient underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy and the pathology revealed a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma extending into peripancreatic soft tissue, portal vein and vascular groove with perineural invasion. This is a unique and challenging case with the coexistence of a primary PDAC and a primary HCC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of synchronous PDAC and HCC in the English literature. The diagnosis and treatment of the two entities are discussed.
Synchronous carcinomas; endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA); hepatocellular carcinoma; pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
