Objective:The imaging-guided percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) ablation of adrenal metastases is a relatively new treatment procedure, compared to the more widespread application of the technique for the treatment of liver and renal cancers. The present study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the CT-guided percutaneous RF ablation of adrenal metastases in a cohort of patients.Methods:33 patients with 38 adrenal metastases who received percutaneous CT-guided RF ablation between 2012 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. The average diameter of the treated adrenal metastases was 3.0 ± 1.6 cm. The treatment outcomes, including presence of residual tumours, technical success rate, recurrence rate, and complications, were evaluated. Patients were followed up for every 3 months to monitor the progression of the disease.Results:Postoperative CT images showed the lack of tumour enhancement in 30 tumours (30/38 tumours, technical success rate = 78.9%), and residual disease was found in 7 tumours (7/37 tumours, 18.9%). The rate of residual disease was significantly lower in the group with tumour size <3 cm than the group with tumour size ≥3 cm (p = 0.025). The severe complication rate was 4.3%, and the mild complication rate was 48%, with intraoperative hypertensive crisis as the most frequently observed complication (27.3%). The follow-up data showed that 76.3% of patients had recurrence-free survival in 27.4 months.Conclusion:The current study demonstrated that radiofrequency ablation is a relatively safe and effective treatment for controlling adrenal metastases, especially for patients with tumour size <3 cm. Advances in knowledge: Surgical resection of the adrenal metastases was advocated as one of the treatment options for patients. The present study showed that radiofrequency ablation is a relatively safe and effective treatment for controlling adrenal metastases.
