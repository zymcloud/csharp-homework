Purpose:To evaluate a pumping emulsification device that can improve the physiochemical properties and stability of lipiodol emulsion for conventional transarterial chemoembolization.Materials and methods:A pumping emulsification device constructed of a glass membrane with a hydrophobic surface with pore size of 50 μm in diameter was placed between two syringe adaptors. Epirubicin solutions were mixed with lipiodol with pumping exchanges using the emulsification device or a three-way cock. The ratios of epirubicin solution to lipiodol were 1:2 or 1:1. A total of 120 emulsions were created.Results:The emulsification device showed significantly higher percentages of water-in-oil when compared with the three-way cock (97.9 % vs. 68.9 % in 1:2 ratio, and 82.1 % vs. 17.8 % in 1:1 ratio, p Conclusion:The emulsification device can form a high percentage of water-in-oil emulsion with stable droplets sizes and viscosities. This developed device is promising to increase therapeutic effects in conventional transarterial chemoembolization.Key points:• We developed new device for transarterial chemoembolization for liver cancer. • The device can improve the physiochemical properties of lipiodol emulsion. • The device can increase the therapeutic effects in conventional transarterial chemoembolization.
