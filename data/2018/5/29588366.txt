Liver tumor-initiating cells (TICs) form small subsets of cells in hepatocellular tumors and account for tumorigenesis, metastasis, recurrence, and drug resistance. Recently, we found that the transcription factor Zic family member 2 (ZIC2) is highly expressed in liver TICs and required for their self-renewal. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying self-renewal of liver TICs remain unclear. Here, using expression profiling and CRISPR-interference assays with clinical samples of human liver cancers, we identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), lncZic2, that is located near the ZIC2 locus and was highly expressed in liver cancer and liver TICs. We found that lncZic2 is required for the self-renewal of liver TICs in a ZIC2-independent manner. lncZic2 drove the expression of myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) and MARCKS-like 1 (MARCKSL1), whose expression levels were increased during liver tumorigenesis and liver TIC self-renewal. Mechanistically, lncZic2 interacted with BRM/SWI2-related gene 1 (BRG1) and recruited this transcriptional regulator to the promoters of the MARCKS and MARCKSL1 gene, which activated expression of these genes. Moreover, we noted that depletion of lncZic2 and BRG1 decreases MARCKS and MARCKSL1 expression and diminishes liver TIC levels. In conclusion, lncZic2 is required for the self-renewal of liver TICs by up-regulating MARCKS and MARCKSL1 gene expression via the transcription factor BRG1. Our findings suggest that the lncZic2-BRG1-MARCKS/MARCKSL1 signaling cascade might be a potential target for eliminating liver TICs in the management of liver cancer.
