Aim:Liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been recommended only for patients with a single tumor without portal hypertension. We aimed to validate this treatment strategy that is based on by the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system.Methods:Patients undergoing liver resection were divided into two groups: patients with single HCC without portal hypertension (Group 1) and those with at least one factors of portal hypertension and multiple tumors, up to three lesions each â‰¤3 cm (Group 2). We compared survival and postoperative complications between the two groups.Results:The median overall and recurrence-free survival periods of patients in Group 1 (n = 695) were 8.5 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.6-9.0) and 2.4 years (2.2-2.7), respectively, and were significantly longer compared with those of patients in Group 2 (n = 197) (5.6 years [95% CI, 4.8-6.7], P = 0.001, and 1.9 years [1.6-2.1], P Conclusions:Patients with HCC with portal hypertension and/or multiple tumors could be candidates for liver resection due to the safety of the procedure.
