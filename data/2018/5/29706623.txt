Deubiquitinases (DUBs) play essential roles in normal cell proliferation and tumor growth. However, the molecular mechanisms of DUBs on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains largely unknown. In this study, based on analysis of several HCC datasets, we found that the USP21 gene, which encodes a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family, is highly amplified and overexpressed in HCCs, with the extent of this up-regulation significantly correlating with poor clinical outcomes. Inhibition of USP21 in HCC cell lines decreased cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, cell cycle progression, and in vivo tumor growth. Conversely, ectopic expression of USP21 transformed the normal human hepatocyte line HL-7702 and increased the tumorigenicity of the HCC cell line MHCC97L. Mechanistically, USP21 stabilized MEK2 by decreasing its polyubiquitination at Lys48, thereby activating the ERK signaling pathway. Importantly, MEK2 partially mediated the optimal expression of USP21-mediated oncogenic phenotypes. These findings indicate that USP21-mediated deubiquitination and stabilization of MEK2 play a critical role in HCC development.
