The objective of this study was to evaluate the value of real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasound in differential diagnosis of malignant liver tumors. Sixty patients pathologically diagnosed with liver cancer from May 2016 to May 2017 were selected as the subjects. All patients received ultrasonic diagnosis followed by the observation on dynamic contrast enhancement of the image and the analysis on perfusion characteristics and difference in contrast-enhanced ultrasound results in patients with different types of liver cancer. The signal during the arterial phase of 21 patients with well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma increased, including 12 cases of slow withdrawal of portal venous phase. The relative height of artery of 30 patients with middle-low differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma increased along with the speed at which the contrast media was washed out at the end of the portal phase. In 9 patients with intrahepatic bile duct cancer, the enhancement of the arteries was slightly increased in the periphery of the tumor and low enhancement was found in the portal venous phase. There were some differences in the timing and the intensity of the enhancement of the ultrasound signals with 3 different types of diseases (P < 0.05). There are obvious differences in real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasound features of patients with different types of malignant liver tumor, which may provide references for clinical diagnosis.
