The chronic infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the most potent risk factor for the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The association of intestinal microbiota alteration with progressive liver disease has been investigated in recent studies. Overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria of gram-negative species and, in particular, a significant increase in the fecal count of Escherichia coli (E. coli) are characterized in the presence of HCC. This study was conducted to describe the characteristics of the intestinal microbiota related to the presence of HCC in HBV-carrier patients. The available literature indicates the colonization of E. coli as principal source of portal vein lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in the gut may contribute to the carcinogenesis process by inducing chronic inflammation. This understanding could help to predict the clinical outcomes in HBV-carrier patients and innovative strategies to reduce the virulence of liver disease from intestinal dysbiosis.
