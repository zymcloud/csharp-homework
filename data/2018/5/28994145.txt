Background and aim:The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) algorithm is the standard system for clinical management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Data on adherence to this therapeutic paradigm are scarce. This field practice study aimed to provide a description of HCC cirrhotic patients in Southern Italy, to evaluate the adherence to BCLC guidelines and its impact on patients' survival.Methods:We analyzed the region-wide Italian database of Progetto Epatocarcinoma Campania, which includes data of HCC cirrhotic patients, prospectively collected from January 2013 to December 2015 in 16 regional centers.Results:Overall, 1008 HCC patients were enrolled: 70.6% patients received therapies recommended by BCLC algorithm, while 29.4% underwent different treatments. Among patients who were treated in adherence to guidelines, a higher rate of diagnosis on surveillance programs, better liver function, lower rate of alpha-fetoprotein > 200 ng/mL, more early-stage and monofocal HCC, lower frequency of nodules > 5 cm, portal vein thrombosis and metastases were observed. The overall survival was evaluated according to HCC stage and no differences between groups and patients managed differently were found. The multivariate analysis showed that non-adherence to treatment guidelines was independently associated to the BCLC stage B, Child-Pugh classes B and C, and the presence of neoplastic thrombosis and metastases.Conclusion:Adherence to BCLC algorithm in field practice was high in early and end-stage HCC patients, but it was poor in intermediate and advanced patients.
