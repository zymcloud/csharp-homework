Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the major subtype of primary liver cancers. HCC is typically diagnosed late in its course. With respect to cancer, the genomic actions of vitamin D are mediated through binding to the Vitamin D Receptor (VDR), which allows it to modulate the expression of genes in a cell-and tissue-specific manner. Epigenetics is a rapidly evolving field of genetic study applicable to HCC. Changes in DNA methylation patterns are thought to be early events in hepatocarcinogenesis. Curcumin has great potential as an epigenetic agent. Accordingly, the current study has been designed to study the methylation status of VDR gene promoter for the first time in HCC aiming to find its clinical significance and potential screening role in chronic Liver Disease (CLD). Additionally, we aimed to investigate, the effect of Curcumin on HCC cell line, aiming to discover new therapeutic targets through epigenetics. This study was conducted on 45 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver tissue blocks including 15 HCC samples (group A), 15 CLD samples (group B) and 15 apparently normal tissue taken from around benign lesions (group C). Methylation Specific Restriction Digestion and qPCR were done on all samples after DNA extraction. The percentage of VDR gene promoter methylation was significantly higher in the HCC group compared to both CLD and control groups (p
