Objective:Although the role of microRNA-17 (miR-17) has been identified as a tumour biomarker in various studies, its prognostic value in cancers remains unclear. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to analyse and summarise the relationship between the miR-17 status and clinical outcome in a variety of human cancers.Design:Systematic review and meta-analysis.Data sources:PubMed, Web of Science and Embase from the first year of records to 15 May 2017.Outcomes:The patients' survival results were pooled, and pooled HRs with 95% CIs were calculated and used for measuring the strength of association between miR-17 and the prognosis of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, osteosarcoma, glioma, T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and colon cancer. Heterogeneity, publication bias and subgroup analysis were also conducted.Results:A total of 1096 patients were included in this meta-analysis from 12 articles. The results indicated that the increased expression of miR-17 played an unfavourable role in overall survival in various human carcinomas with the HR of 1.342 taking into account the publication bias. In subgroup analysis, HR of ethnicity (non-Asian HR=1.48 and Asian HR=1.40), disease (digestive system HR=1.36 and blood system cancer (HR=2.38) were significant with PConclusions:miR-17 may be a useful biomarker in predicting the clinical outcome of human cancers, but due to the limitations of the current studies, further verification of the role of miR-17 in human malignancies is urgently needed.Prospero registration number:CRD42017065749.
