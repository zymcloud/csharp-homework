Background:Interferon-free regimens are associated with high sustained virological response; however, associated adverse effects have yet to be fully reported.Aim:To evaluate the adverse effects associated with the different direct-acting antiviral drug (DAA) regimens in Egyptian patients.Methods:This multicenter retrospective study included all adverse effects during and after treatment with DAA regimens of 149 816 chronic hepatitis C treated Egyptian patients. Patients received sofosbuvir (SOF)/ribavirin (RBV) (n = 21 835), SOF/simeprevir (n = 24 215) SOF/daclatasvir (DCV) (n = 58 477), SOF/DCV/RBV (n = 45 188) and paritaprevir/ombitasvir/ritonavir/RBV (n = 101). The duration of treatment varied between 12 and 24 weeks. All changes in the treatment regimens, discontinuation, mortality, and serious side effects were reported.Results:Adverse effects developed in 2475 (1.7%) (mean age [54 Â± 9], male gender [53%]) patients. Serious side effects developed in 68% of these patients, and SOF/RBV was the most common causing regimen (73%, P Conclusion:Adverse effects associated with DAAs are few, anaemia being the most common. SOF/RBV regimen showed the highest rate of side effects while SOF/DCV showed the least.
