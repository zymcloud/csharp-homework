Increasing numbers of evidences have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are implicated in metastasis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, their detailed expression levels and actual functions in HCCs have not been fully clarified yet. Results from our recent study revealed that some miRNAs were particularly related to metastasis of HCCs. As one of these newly found miRNAs, miR-501-3p showed to highly involve into metastatic process of HCCs. Here we reported that the expression of miR-501-3p was decreased in both metastatic HCC cell lines and tissue samples from HCC patients with recurrence and metastasis. Downregulation of miR-501-3p correlated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in the HCC patients. Results of functional analyses revealed that overexpression of miR-501-3p in HCCLM3 cancer cells inhibited their proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while miR-501-3p loss in PLC/PRF/5 cancer cells facilitated all these cellular activities. In addition, Lin-7 homolog A (LIN7A) was directly targeted by miR-501-3p to mediate the suppression effects on metastasis in HCC cells. miR-501-3p suppresses metastasis and progression of HCCs through targeting LIN7A. This finding suggests that miR-501-3p could be used as a potential prognostic predictor as well as a potential therapeutic tool for HCC therapies.
