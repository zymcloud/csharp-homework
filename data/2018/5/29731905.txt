WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5) serves an important role in various biological functions through the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. Aberrant expression of WDR5 has been observed in various types of human cancer, including prostate cancer, breast cancer and leukemia. However, the role of WDR5 expression and its clinical implications in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely unknown. The present study investigated the WDR5 expression pattern in HCC. It was demonstrated that the mRNA and protein levels of WDR5 were upregulated in HCC cancer tissues compared with normal adjacent tissues using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Furthermore, the elevated WDR5 protein level was significantly associated with the histological grade (P=0.038), tumor size (P=0.023), tumor-node-metastasis stage (P=0.035) and reduced long-term survival time. Additionally, it was demonstrated through the shRNA-mediated knockdown of WDR5 in HCC cells in vitro that WDR5 expression promotes cell proliferation using an MTT assay. Taken together, the results suggested that WDR5 overexpression may have an oncogenic effect in HCC, and may be a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC.
