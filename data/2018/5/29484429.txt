Mounting evidence has shown that miR-23b-3p, which is associated with cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis, acts as a biomarker for diagnosis and outcomes in numerous cancers. However, the clinicopathological implication of miR-23b-3p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Our study evaluated the role of miR-23b-3p in HCC and investigated its potential application as a marker for preliminary diagnosis and therapy in HCC. High-throughput data from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were collected and analyzed. One hundred and one tissue sections of HCC were paired with adjacent non-cancerous HCC as further supplements. miR-23b-3p expression was detected using quantitative real-time PCR. Additionally, the relationship between miR-23b-3p expression and HCC progression and Time-to-recurrence (months) was explored. Ten algorithms were applied to predict the prospective target genes of miR-23b-3p. Next, we conducted bioinformatics analysis for further study. miR-23b-3p expression was pronouncedly decreased in HCC tissues in contrast with their paired adjacent non-cancerous HCC (P35). In conclusion, this study provides impressive illumination of the potential role of miR-23b-3p in HCC tumorigenesis and progression. Furthermore, miR-23b-3p may act as a predictor of HCC and could be a new treatment target.
