Accumulating evidence highlights the fact that long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve as critical factors in the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The dysregulation of lncRNA KCNQ1 opposite strand/antisense transcript 1 (KCNQ1OT1) has been reported in numerous human benign diseases. However, the role of KCNQ1OT1 in human HCC remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of KCNQ1OT1 was abnormally increased in HCC tissues. The ectopic high expression of KCNQ1OT1 was associated with liver cirrhosis, a larger tumor size, an advanced TNM stage, and a worse overall survival and tumor‑free survival. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we report that KCNQ1OT1 knockdown results in a decreased cell viability and colony formation ability, and an increased rate of apoptosis in vitro. The results from our in vivo results demonstrated that KCNQ1OT1 silencing attenuated tumor growth by impairing cell proliferation. Additionally, we found that KCNQ1OT1 exerted its effects partly by relying on the microRNA‑504 (miR‑504)‑mediated regulation of cyclin‑dependent kinase 16 (CDK16), in addition to the regulation of the glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)/β‑catenin/Bcl‑2 signaling pathway. The present study revealed the functions and mechanisms of action of lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 regarding its role in promoting the growth of HCC. Thus, lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 may prove to be a potential therapeutic target for human HCC.
