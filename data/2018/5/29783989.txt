Background:SDF1/CXCR4 and AnnexinA7 play important roles in many physiological and pathological conditions, but the molecular association between them in cancer cells has not been studied thus far.Methods:The expression changes of SDF1/CXCR4 were detected by gene transcriptome sequencing, qRT-PCR, Western blotting, cytoimmunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry in mouse hepatocarcinoma F/P cells, AnnexinA7 downregulated expression F (FA7DOWN) cells, AnnexinA7 overexpression P (PA7UP) cells, AnnexinA7 unrelated sequence F (FSHUS) cells, empty vector P (PNCEV) cells and normal liver cells in vitro and in vivo.Results:SDF1 and CXCR4 were co-expressed in hepatocarcinoma cells. SDF1 was localized mainly in the cytoplasm of cells, while CXCR4 was mainly localized in the cell membrane. Both in vitro and in vivo, expression levels of SDF1/CXCR4 in F and P cells were higher than in normal liver cells, and expression levels of SDF1/CXCR4 in F cells with high lymphatic metastatic potential were higher than those in P cells with low lymphatic metastatic potential. Expression of SDF1 was higher than that of CXCR4 in P cells and normal liver cells, while expression of CXCR4 was higher than that of SDF1 in F cells. Expression levels of SDF1/CXCR4 were completely consistent with AnnexinA7 regulation. After the AnnexinA7 gene was downregulated or upregulated, expression levels of SDF1/CXCR4 in FA7DOWN/PA7UP cells were lower or higher than those in FSHUS/PNCEV cells. Furthermore, CXCR4 was more sensitively modulated by AnnexinA7 regulation than SDF1.Conclusions:High co-expression of SDF1/CXCR4 is a molecular characteristic of hepatocarcinoma cells, especially those with high lymphatic metastatic potential. AnnexinA7 positively regulates expression levels of SDF1/CXCR4, in particular CXCR4, and AnnexinA7 is a functional regulator of SDF1/CXCR4.
