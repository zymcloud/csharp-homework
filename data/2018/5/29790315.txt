Hepatocellular carcinoma is a common primary malignancy of hepatocytes that has caused many fatalities globally. To manage the increasing cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, natural products like mushrooms have been tested for their anti-oxidant, anti-tumour and therapeutic properties. This study aimed to investigate the effect of Agaricus bisporus on progression of chemically induced carcinogenesis in mice. Carcinogenesis was induced in experimental and positive group of mice. Development and progression of carcinogenesis was monitored by quantifying levels of Lactate dehydrogenase, total sialic acid and by histological analysis. The results of the study showed that, unlike lactate dehydrogenase, the levels of sialic acid consistently decreased throughout the experimental period in mice that were fed on mushroom extracts compared to the positive control. Histological analysis also showed protection of the hepatocytes from carcinogenesis progression. Overall, the results from tumour markers and histological analysis, showed that addition of Agaricus bisporus extracts to diet slowed down progression of carcinogenesis and these extracts therefore may be useful as supplementary diet to conventional cancer therapies.
