Introduction:The results of the earlier published studies on the association between KIF1B (rs17401966) polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk are inconclusive. Hence, we performed this meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between KIF1B (rs17401966) polymorphism and HCC risk.Methods:Databases including PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library and bibliographies of relevant papers were screened to identify relevant studies published up to March 25, 2018. Pooled ORs and 95% CIs were calculated to evaluate the association. The subgroup analysis was conducted based on ethnicity, age, region and environment. A total of 19 studies from 11 eligible articles published from 2010 to 2016, with 8,741 cases and 10,812 controls, were included.Results:The pooled results indicated that the association between KIF1B (rs17401966) polymorphism and the decreased HCC risk was significant. Subgroup analysis stratified by ethnicity showed the same association in Chinese, but not in non-Chinese population. When stratified by age, both old and young patients showed a decrease in HCC risk. When stratified by region, we detected the same association in Chinese in southern China. Similarly when stratified by environment, we observed the same association in Chinese in inland areas; however, no statistically significant association was observed in those in coastal areas.Conclusion:This meta-analysis suggested that KIF1B (rs17401966) polymorphism could decrease HCC risk in Chinese and in overall population, but not in non-Chinese. This association remained significant in Chinese in southern China and inland areas, but not in those in northern and central China and coastal areas. Further large-scale multicenter studies are warranted to confirm these findings.
