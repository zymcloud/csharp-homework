The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of the morphofunctional state of the vascular endothelium in the operative treatment of liver cancer on complications, outcomes and the probability of long-term complications. We examined 39 patients with liver cancer, the mean age of the group was 62.4Â±3.0 years. II clinical stage was diagnosed in 43.6%, and IIIA stage in 56.4%. The content of deceased endotheliocytes in the blood, von Willebrand factor was determined, a doppler-echocardiographic test with reactive hyperemia (endothelium-dependent vasodilatation - EDVD) was performed. Significant differences in the indices of the state of the vascular endothelium in patients with liver cancer with a control group were revealed. Disturbances in the state of the vascular endothelium in patients with developed complications and subsequently diagnosed relapses and metastases were significantly higher than without complications. In the distribution of patients, depending on the degree of endothelial dysfunction before the operation, it was found that the incidence of early and distant oncological complications in marked changes significantly exceeds that in a subgroup with moderate changes.
