Objective: To investigate the correlation between postoperative peripheral blood neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and recurrence and prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: The clinicopathological and follow-up data of 344 patients with HCC who underwent radical liver resection from May 2010 to April 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Of the 344 patients, 104 had early recurrence and 84 had late recurrence. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the NLR predicted area under the curve (AUC) of early recurrence was 0.622 (P<0.001), the optimal cut-off value was 2.41. The AUC of late recurrence was 0.634 (P=0.001), the optimal cut-off value was 2.15. Cox multivariate analysis showed the serum concentration of hepatitis B surface antigen (HR=2.508, 95% CI: 1.311-4.798), microvascular invasion (HR=2.422, 95% CI: 1.239-4.734), Milan criteria (HR=2.373, 95% CI: 1.427-3.948) and postoperative NLR (HR=2.285, 95% CI: 1.379-3.788) were independent risk factors of early recurrence after HCC resection. Postoperative NLR (HR=2.927, 95% CI: 1.630-5.255), liver cirrhosis (HR=2.531, 95% CI: 1.291-4.962) and serum concentration of albumin (HR=2.257, 95% CI: 1.251-4.073) were independent risk factors of late recurrence after HCC resection. The median recurrence-free survival (RFS) of the 344 patients was 45.0 months, and the median overall survival (OS) was 63.2 months. ROC curve analysis showed that the postoperative NLR predicted 5-year survival AUC was 0.689 (P<0.05), with an optimal cutoff of 2.29. Cox multivariate analysis showed microvascular invasion (HR=2.247, 95% CI: 1.534-3.291), postoperative NLR (HR=2.217, 95% CI: 1.653-2.974), and liver cirrhosis (HR=1.685, 95% CI: 1.168-2.431), Milan criteria (HR=1.679, 95% CI: 1.238-2.277), serum concentration of hepatitis B surface antigen (HR=1.623, 95% CI: 1.102-2.392), serum concentration of albumin (HR=1.43, 95% CI: 1.066-1.918) were independent factors of RFS after HCC resection, while microvascular invasion (HR=3.862, 95% CI: 2.407-6.197), Barcelona staging (HR=2.864, 95% CI: 1.600-5.125), postoperative NLR (HR=2.688, 95% CI: 1.782-4.055), liver cirrhosis (HR=2.039, 95% CI: 1.184-3.514), serum concentration of albumin (HR=1.81, 95% CI: 1.204-2.720) were independent factors of OS. Conclusions: For HCC patients who receive radical liver resection, postoperative NLR ≥2.29 implicates poor prognosis. Moreover, postoperative NLR ≥2.41 suggests early recurrence, while NLR ≥2.15 suggests late recurrence.
