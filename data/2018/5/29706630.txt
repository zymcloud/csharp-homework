Hepatocellular carcinoma is the sixth most common cancer and gives rise to numerous deaths around the world every year. However, the molecular mechanism that controls hepatocarcinogenesis remains largely unknown. Here we found out an uncharacterized long noncoding RNA named lncAKHE. We found that lncAKHE was highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. lncAKHE depletion remarkably impaired the abilities of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma while promgoogoting cell apoptosis. Moreover, higher expression level of lncAKHE in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues was associated with more clinical severity and lower survival rates. Mechanistically, lncAKHE cooperated with YEATS4 to enhance the activation of NOTCH2 signaling which is usually abnormally upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma. In conclusions, our study showed that lncAKHE may promote tumor progression in HCC and serve as a novel target for HCC treatment.
