The present study aimed to illustrate the association of the expression of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2A (UBE2A) with the clinicopathological parameters and prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression levels of UBE2A mRNA and protein in a total of 276 HCC tissues and six liver cell lines was detected by fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Statistical analysis was also performed to assess the association of the expression of UBE2A with the clinicopathological parameters and prognosis by the GraphPad Prism and SPSS version 21.0 software. UBE2A mRNA and protein were highly expressed in HCC tissues compared with those in the adjacent normal tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that UBE2A protein was more strongly stained in the 276 paraffin-embedded HCC tissues as compared with the 63 adjacent normal tissue. Statistical analysis also demonstrated that UBE2A expression was significantly associated with histological differentiation, TNM stage and vascular invasion of HCC (P
