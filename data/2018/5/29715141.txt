Aim:To compare toxicity, response, and survival outcomes of patients with hepatic metastases from breast cancer who underwent transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or radioembolization (TARE).Materials and methods:A retrospective review was carried out of all patients who underwent TACE or TARE for liver-dominant breast cancer metastases between January 2006 and March 2016 at an academic medical center in the United States.Results:Seventeen patients in the TACE group and 30 patients in the TARE group received 32 TACE and 49 TARE treatments, respectively. Median follow-up was 9 months. Both groups had similar background variables. More all-grade adverse events were seen in the TACE group (71% vs. 44%; p=0.02). Median overall survival in the TACE group was 4.6 months compared to 12.9 months in the TARE group (p=0.2349). Treatment type was not an independent prognostic factor.Conclusion:TARE is better tolerated than TACE for the treatment of liver-dominant breast cancer metastasis. There was a trend towards improved survival with TARE; however, it did not approach statistical significance. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings.
