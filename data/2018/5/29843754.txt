Immune checkpoints include stimulatory and inhibitory checkpoint molecules. In recent years, inhibitory checkpoints, including cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), have been identified to suppress anti-tumor immune responses in solid tumors. Novel drugs targeting immune checkpoints have succeeded in cancer treatment. Specific PD-1 blockades were approved for treatment of melanoma in 2014 and for treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer in 2015 in the United States, European Union, and Japan. Preclinical and clinical studies show immune checkpoint therapy provides survival benefit for greater numbers of patients with liver cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, two main primary liver cancers. The combination of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies is being evaluated in phase 1, 2 or 3 trials, and the results suggest that an anti-PD-1 antibody combined with locoregional therapy or other molecular targeted agents is an effective treatment strategy for HCC. In addition, studies on activating co-stimulatory receptors to enhance anti-tumor immune responses have increased our understanding regarding this immunotherapy in liver cancer. Epigenetic modulations of checkpoints for improving the tumor microenvironment also expand our knowledge of potential therapeutic targets in improving the tumor microenvironment and restoring immune recognition and immunogenicity. In this review, we summarize current knowledge and recent developments in immune checkpoint-based therapies for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma and attempt to clarify the mechanisms underlying its effects.
