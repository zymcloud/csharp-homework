Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of most common solid cancers worldwide. Sorafenib is indicated as a treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the clinical efficacy of sorafenib has been severely compromised by the development of drug resistance, and the precise mechanisms of drug resistance remain largely unknown. Here we found that a cell surface molecule, CD24, is overexpressed in tumor tissues and sorafenib-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. Moreover, there is a positive correlation between CD24 expression levels and sorafenib resistance. In sorafenib-resistant HCC cell lines, depletion of CD24 caused a notable increase of sorafenib sensitivity. In addition, we found that CD24-related sorafenib resistance was accompanied by the activation of autophagy and can be blocked by the inhibition of autophagy using either pharmacological inhibitors or essential autophagy gene knockdown. In further research, we found that CD24 overexpression also leads to an increase in PP2A protein production and induces the deactivation of the mTOR/AKT pathway, which enhances the level of autophagy. These results demonstrate that CD24 regulates sorafenib resistance via activating autophagy in HCC. This is the first report to describe the relationships among CD24, autophagy, and sorafenib resistance. In conclusion, the combination of autophagy modulation and CD24 targeted therapy is a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of HCC.
