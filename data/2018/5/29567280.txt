Hepatocellular carcinoma is the third most frequent cause of cancer death worldwide, particularly in Asia and Africa. Most cases complicate an underlying liver cirrhosis due to hepatitis B or C chronic virus infection or alcoholic abuse. But, following the current epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes, it appears that these diseases, associated in metabolic syndrome, are responsible for non alcoholic fatty liver disease at risk of HCC frequently before the stage of cirrhosis. Recent hypotheses consider that in the near future, cancer deaths due to HCC will overpass in USA those due to breast or colorectal cancers. Governments should develop policies to prevent obesity, type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome as well as fight against alcoholism and hepatitis B and C virus infections.
