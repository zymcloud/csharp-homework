Viral hepatitis infection is a major global issue and a leading cause of liver disease and associated deaths. Over time, patients infected with hepatitis B (HBV) or C virus (HCV) develop cirrhosis and, eventually, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). For this reason, they need to be constantly monitored. Current Asian guidelines recommend the determination of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) together with liver ultrasounds every six months to detect HCC nodules. However, both methods have several limitations, and other biomarkers have been studied for monitoring cirrhosis, including SCCA-IgM, an immune-complex formed by Squamous Cell Carcinoma Antigen and IgM. To date, SCCA-IgM has been validated as a novel biomarker for liver diseases only in European populations. The aim of our study was to analyze SCCA-IgM as a biomarker to monitor cirrhosis evolution in an Asian cohort of patients and to compare its performance to that of AFP. We analyzed the concentration of AFP and SCCA-IgM in serum samples obtained from a group of Asian adult patients with cirrhosis or HCC and a control group of patients admitted for gastrointestinal disorders. In untreated patients and similarly to AFP, SCCA-IgM levels were significantly higher in patients with cirrhosis compared to those with HCC. In addition, SCCA-IgM, but not AFP serological levels, were significantly lower in HCC patients who were treated with surgical resection compared to those who received a different therapy.
