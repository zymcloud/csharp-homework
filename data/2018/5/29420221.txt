Purpose: The survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after curative resection is usually poor. We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in HBV-related HCC patients with an intermediate (a single tumor larger than 5 cm without microvascular invasion) or high risk (a single tumor with microvascular invasion, or two or three tumors) of recurrence.Experimental Design: In this randomized phase 3 trial, 280 eligible patients were assigned to adjuvant TACE (n = 140) or no adjuvant treatment (control; n = 140) groups. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and safety. Multivariable Cox-proportional hazards model was used to determine the independent impact of TACE on patients' outcomes.Results: Patients who received adjuvant TACE had a significantly longer RFS than those in the control group [56.0% vs. 42.1%, P = 0.01; HR, 0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.49-0.93]. Patients in the adjuvant TACE group had 7.8% higher 3-year OS rate than the control group (85.2% vs. 77.4%; P = 0.04; HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36-0.97). The impact of adjuvant TACE on RFS and OS remained significant after controlling for other known prognostic factors (HR, 0.67; P = 0.01 for RFS; and HR, 0.59; P = 0.04 for OS). There was no grade 3 or 4 toxicity after adjuvant TACE.Conclusions: For patients with HBV-related HCC who had an intermediate or high risk of recurrence after curative hepatectomy, our study showed adjuvant TACE significantly reduced tumor recurrence, improved RFS and OS, and the procedure was well tolerated.
