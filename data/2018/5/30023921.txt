Nowadays, tumor hypoxia has become a more predominant problem for diagnosis as well as treatment of cancer due to difficulties in delivering chemotherapeutic drugs and their carriers to these regions with reduced vasculature and oxygen supply. In such cases, external physical stimulus-mediated drug delivery, such as ultrasound and magnetic fields, would be effective. In this work, the effect of simultaneous exposure of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound and static magnetic field on colon (HCT116) and hepatocellular (HepG2) carcinoma cell inhibition was assessed in vitro. The treatment, in the presence of anticancer drug, with and without magnetic carrier, significantly increased the reactive oxygen species production and hyperpolarized the cancer cells. As a result, a significant increase in cell inhibition, up to 86%, was observed compared to 50% inhibition with bare anticancer drug. The treatment appears to have relatively more effect on HepG2 cells during the initial 24 h than on HCT116 cells. The proposed treatment was also found to reduce cancer cell necrosis and did not show any inhibitory effect on healthy cells (MC3T3). Our in vitro results suggest that this approach has strong application potential to treat cancer at lower drug dosage to achieve similar inhibition and can reduce health risks associated with drugs.
