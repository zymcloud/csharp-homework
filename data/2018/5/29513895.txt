Background and objectives:Prophylactic antibiotics are frequently administered for transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In patients without previous biliary instrumentation, infection risk from TACE is low. We hypothesized that there is a negligible rate of infection in these patients without prophylactic antibiotics.Methods:We reviewed consecutive patients undergoing TACE between 7/1/2013-6/15/2016. All patients had an intact Sphincter of Oddi, received no peri-procedural antibiotics, and had 30+ days follow-up. Level of arterial selection was recorded. Baseline Child-Pugh (CP) and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) scores were recorded. The primary outcome measure was the absence of clinical or imaging findings of hepatic abscess within 30 days.Results:A total of 171 patients underwent 235 TACE procedures. CP scores were A (n = 109), B (n = 47), and C (n = 15). BCLC scores were 0 (n = 1), A (n = 108), B (n = 47), and C (n = 15). TACE was performed segmentally (n = 208) or lobar (n = 27). Three patients died of non-infectious causes before 30 days. No hepatic abscesses developed in evaluable patients: 0/232 infusions.Conclusions:In patients with HCC and an intact Sphincter of Oddi, TACE was performed safely without prophylactic antibiotics. The majority of the patients were BCLC and CP A/B. Additional study of BCLC and CP C patients is warranted.
