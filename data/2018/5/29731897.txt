The immune system serves an important function in Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and the complement system is a major component of innate immunity. However, the regulatory effect of HBV on complement proteins has not yet been fully elucidated. The present study focused on investigating the impact of HBV on the expression of complement proteins C3 and C4. A total of 226 patients with a clinical diagnosis of HBV infection were enrolled in the study, including 153 with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 73 with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), whereas 116 healthy individuals were included as a control group. Immunoturbidimetric detection was performed to determine the levels of complement C3 and C4 in the serum of the patients with HBV and the control group. The results revealed that the mean ± standard deviation C3 and C4 content was 1.223±0.237 and 0.226±0.052 g/l for the control group, 0.687±0.150 and 0.145±0.070 g/l for the patients with CHB, and 0.829±0.332 and 0.174±0.088 g/l for the patients with HCC, respectively. The levels of complement C3 and C4 in the patients with CHB or HCC were significantly lower than the control group (Pin vitro and in vivo, which may lay the foundation for revealing the pathogenesis of HBV.
