Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers and it usually develops from a background of liver fibrosis or inflammation. The crosstalk between tumor cells and stromal cells plays an important and stimulating role during tumor progression. Previously we found in a krasV12-induced zebrafish HCC model that oncogenic hepatocytes activate hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) by up-regulation of serotonin and activate neutrophils and macrophages by up-regulation of cortisol. In the present study, we found a novel signaling transduction mechanism between oncogenic hepatocytes and HSCs. After krasV12 induction, fibrinogen was up-regulated in oncogenic hepatocytes. We reasoned that fibrinogen may bind to integrin αvβ5 on HSCs to activate HSCs. Consistent with this notion, pharmaceutical treatment using an antagonist of integrin αvβ5, cilengitide, significantly blocked HSC activation and function, accompanied by attenuated proliferation of oncogenic hepatocytes and progression of liver fibrosis. On the contrary, adenosine 5'-diphosphate, an agonist of αvβ5, activated HSCs significantly that further stimulated the tumor progression and liver fibrosis. Interestingly, in human liver disease samples, we detected an increased level of fibrinogen during tumor progression which indicated the potential role of fibrinogen signaling in HCC progression. Thus, we concluded a novel interaction between oncogenic hepatocytes and HSCs through the fibrinogen related pathway in both the zebrafish HCC model and human liver disease samples.
