Activation of invariant NKT (iNKT) cells manifests antiviral immune responses in vivo. However, clinical trials have failed to show consistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA reduction postadministration of iNKT cell-specific agonist α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer). In this study, we aimed to investigate HBV infection-related iNKT cell defects and explore iNKT cell-based therapeutic potential for chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Liver specimens from 30 HBV-infected hepatocellular carcinoma patients were collected for CD1d/hepatitis B surface Ag (HBsAg) staining and/or intrahepatic iNKT cell assay. Two hundred and six chronic HBV-infected patients (including 130 CHB patients) were enrolled in the study of circulating iNKT cell frequency and function. We found that liver and hepatoma tissue that positively stained for HBsAg had higher CD1d expression as compared with HBsAg negatively stained counterparts. The elevated CD1d expression in infected tissue is supposed to facilitate the iNKT cell-based antiviral effects locally. However, iNKT cell defects that related with disease progression suggested iNKT cells attenuated their effects during chronic HBV infection. The residual iNKT cells in CHB patients showed aberrant activation and hyporesponsiveness to α-GalCer. Exogenous IL-2 fully rescued α-GalCer-induced expansion of iNKT cells from CHB patients, and synergistic effects of IL-2 and IL-15 helped to recover the CD1d-dependent IFN-γ production. In conclusion, our results highlight the increased CD1d expression in HBV-infected liver and differential iNKT cell defects associated with disease progression during chronic HBV infection. The reversibility of iNKT cell defects suggests protective immune responses could be partially recovered in CHB.
