Tumor-specific delivery of cytotoxic agents remains a challenge in cancer therapy. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) deliver their payloads to tumor cells that overexpress specific tumor-associated antigens-but the multi-day half-life of ADC leads to high exposure even of normal, antigen-free, tissues and thus contributes to dose-limiting toxicity. Here, we present Adnectin-drug conjugates, an alternative platform for tumor-specific delivery of cytotoxic payloads. Due to their small size (10 kDa), renal filtration eliminates Adnectins from the bloodstream within minutes to hours, ensuring low exposure to normal tissues. We used an engineered cysteine to conjugate an Adnectin that binds Glypican-3, a membrane protein overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma, to a cytotoxic derivative of tubulysin, with the drug-to-Adnectin ratio of 1. We demonstrate specific, nanomolar binding of this Adnectin-drug conjugate to human and murine Glypican-3; its high thermostability; its localization to target-expressing tumor cells in vitro and in vivo, its fast clearance from normal tissues and its efficacy against Glypican-3-positive mouse xenograft models.
