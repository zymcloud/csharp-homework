This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) treatment in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C liver cancer patients. In 39 patients with BCLC stage C liver cancer, after the first cycle of DEB-TACE, 2 (5.1%) and 24 (61.5%) patients achieved complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) to give an overall objective response rate (ORR) of 66.7%. With respect to the second cycle of therapy, the ORR was higher in patients receiving DEB-TACE compared with those receiving cTACE (57.1% vs. 11.1%). After the first cycle of DEB-TACE treatment, the percentages of abnormal albumin (ALB), total protein (TP), total bilirubin (TBIL), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) worsened at 1 week and recovered at 1 month. The number of patients with abnormal aspartate aminotransferase (AST) did not increase at 1 week but elevated at 1 month. After the second cycle of DEB-TACE or cTACE treatment, no difference was observed between cTACE and DEB-TACE in terms of all adverse events (AEs) at all visits, and most of the AEs did not change after the second cycle in both groups. The most common AEs after the first and second treatment cycles were pain, fever, and nausea/vomiting. These results demonstrate that DEB-TACE offers patients with BCLC stage C liver cancer a clinically active short-term treatment that is safe and relatively well tolerated.
