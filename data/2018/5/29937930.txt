Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common tumor worldwide. The relationship between the gene methylation accumulation and HCC has been widely studied. In our study, we used the Sequenom EpiTYPER assay to investigate the methylation levels of the RASA3 in 164 HCC samples and paired adjacent non-cancerous tissues, and the association between methylation level and clinicopathological features. The methylation level of the RASA3 in HCC samples was found significantly lower than that in the adjacent non-cancerous tissues (P
