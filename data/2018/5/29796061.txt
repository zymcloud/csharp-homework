Background:The impact of different anti-virus regimens on prognosis of Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) related cirrhosis remains to be explored. We aim to investigate whether CHB-related HCC patients receiving nucleoside analogue regimen or not have a different prognosis.Methods:242 CHB-related compensated cirrhosis patients from 2008 June to 2011 December were included in our study and attributed into groups based on their anti-virus regimens containing adefovir (ADV) or not. The clinical parameters and virological response between ADV-containing regimen group and non-ADV containing regimen groups were reviewed and compared. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development were analyzed and compared between two groups.Results:127 patients received anti-virus regimen containing ADV and 115 patients received anti-virus regimen without ADV. The cumulative risk of HCC development among patients treated with ADV-contained therapy was significantly lower than that observed in patients with non-ADV-contained therapy (p<0.05). Multivariate analysis indicated that ADV-containing regimen treatment was significantly associated with lower probability of HCC development, (hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% confidence interval range, 0.07-0.45, p<0.05).Conclusion:Both anti-virus regimens were effective in reducing serum HBV DNA. Regimen containing ADV decreased the incidence of HCC development in CHB patients with compensated cirrhosis.
