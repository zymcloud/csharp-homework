Aim:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the endovascular implantation of 125I seed under ultrasound and x-ray guidance combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT).Patients & methods:The study included 134 pathologically proven or clinically confirmed primary HCC patients with PVTT in our hospital from January 2013 to June 2015.Results & conclusion:Compared with the TACE treatment alone, the combination therapy of 125I seed implantation with TACE significantly prolonged the median survival time and improved the 6-, 12- and 18-month survival rates for HCC patients with PVTT. In addition, the type III PVTT and tumor size were independent predictors for poor prognosis of HCC patients with PVTT.
