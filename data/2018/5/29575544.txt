Background:This study was conducted to assess the adverse reactions caused by multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment of gastrointestinal tumors.Methods:We carried out a retrospective study of drug-related adverse reactions in 115 patients who were treated with sorafenib, sunitinib, and imatinib for primary hepatocellular carcinoma or gastrointestinal stromal tumors from October 2003 to March 2012 at the Peking University International Hospital.Results:The total incidence of adverse reactions of sorafenib, sunitinib, and imatinib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors was > 80%. The main adverse reactions of sorafenib were hypertension in 38 patients (33.3%) and diarrhea in 28 patients (24.4%). Sunitinib was associated with higher incidence and greater grade 3-4 toxicity. The common toxicities were skin color changes in 105 patients (90.9%), hand-foot skin reactions in 65 patients (54.6%), and leukopenia (63.6%), hypertension (22.7%), proteinuria (22.7%), liver function impairment (22.7%), and hypomagnesemia (27.3%). While imatinib was well tolerated, it was associated with the highest number of adverse reactions, including skin color change (55.6%) and edema (38.9%). Hypophosphatemia (4.4%) and hoarseness (2.2%) only occurred in the sorafenib treatment group.Conclusions:The adverse reactions of multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatments are generally mild to moderate, and most patients can tolerate these without the need for further intervention. Some serious adverse reactions may be alleviated by discontinuing the drugs or by administering symptomatic treatment.
