Background:Hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS) is used to quantify total and regional liver function. Transient elastography (TE) provides a non-invasive alternative to percutaneous biopsy to assess liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. This study aims to determine the correlation between HBS and histopathology of liver parenchyma, and to compare these with TE in patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Patients who underwent surgery for HCC between 2000 and 2016 after preoperative HBS were included. Non-tumorous liver tissue was evaluated for inflammation, steatosis, ballooning, siderosis and fibrosis. Correlation analysis was performed between HBS results and histopathological scoring. These were also compared with TE and surgical outcomes.Results:71 patients underwent preoperative HBS of whom 24 also had TE. HBS correlated with portal and lobular inflammation as well as fibrosis. TE correlated with portal and lobular inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis. A significant correlation was found between HBS and TE. No association was found with overall postoperative morbidity and mortality.Conclusion:HBS and TE show a moderate to strong correlation. HBS and TE share discriminatory features of histopathological scoring and show a weak to moderate correlation with hepatic inflammation and fibrosis.
