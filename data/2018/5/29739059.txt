Background:Long non-coding RNA PVT1, as an important carcinogenic lncRNA, is highly expressed in many malignant tumors and suggests a poorer prognosis. It can promote the occurrence and development of cancers by affecting cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis. This article reviews the progress of lncRNA PVT1 on cancer therapy, in order to facilitate the in-depth study of lncRNA PVT1 acting as a promising target for therapy in cancers.Methods:We extracted all relevant studies of lncRNA PVT1 on the treatment of cancers by searching electronic databases Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science from inception to November 30, 2017.Results:Accumulating vigorous evidence has shown that lncRNA PVT1 performs a significant carcinogenic activity in various cancers, for instance, negatively modulating miRNA as a ceRNA or a molecular sponge to exert tumor-promoting effect. Based on the critical role of lncRNA PVT1 in the pathogenesis of cancers, numerous studies have already demonstrated that lncRNA PVT1 might serve as a potential therapeutic target for various cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, breast cancer, glioma, etc.Conclusions:Numerous studies have indicated that lncRNA PVT1 will most likely become a novel target for cancer therapy with the deepening systematic research.
