Background:To evaluate the benefits of arterial phase imaging and parenchymal blood volume (PBV) maps acquired by C-arm computed tomography during TACE procedure in comparison to cross-sectional imaging (CSI) using CT or MRI.Methods:From January 2014 to December 2016, a total of 29 patients with HCC stage A or B (mean age 65 years; range 47 to 81 years, 86% male) were included in this study. These patients were referred to our department for TACE treatment and received peri-interventional C-arm CT. Dual phase findings of each lesion in terms of overall image quality, conspicuity, tumor size and feeding arteries were compared between arterial phase imaging and PBV using 5-point semi-quantitative Likert-scale, whereby pre-interventional CSI served as reference standard.Results:A significantly higher overall image quality of the PBV maps compared to arterial phase C-arm CT acquisitions (4.34 (±0.55) vs. 3.93 (±0.59), p = 0.0032) as well as a higher conspicuity of HCC lesions (4.27 ± 0.74 vs. 3.83 ± 1.08, p Conclusion:The combination of PBV maps and arterial phase images acquired by C-arm CT during TACE procedure enables precise detection of the majority of HCC lesions and tumor feeding arteries and has therefore the potential to improve patient outcome.
