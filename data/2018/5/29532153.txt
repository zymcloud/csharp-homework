Purpose:MBRI-001 is a novel synthetic derivative of plinabulin. In this study, our purpose is to investigate the inhibition effects of MBRI-001 on human hepatocellular carcinoma as monotherapy or in combination with sorafenib.Methods:HCCLM3 and Bel-7402 cell lines were used for activity evaluation in vitro. The anti-proliferative activity of MBRI-001 was assessed by MTT assay. The morphological change of microtubules was determined by immunofluorescence assay. The cell cycle was measured by flow cytometer. The expression of cyclin B1 (CCNB1) was analyzed by RT-qPCR and western blotting assays. The antitumor activities in vivo were evaluated with human HCC xenograft mice model.Results:Our data demonstrated that MBRI-001 had better anti-proliferative activities than that of plinabulin against HCCLM3 and Bel-7402 cell lines. MBRI-001 inhibited the formation of microtubules and induced G2/M arrest with the downregulation of CCNB1. In vivo orthotopic mice model demonstrated that MBRI-001 significantly inhibited the growth of HCCLM3 with the apoptosis and necrosis observed in tumor. The combination treatment of MBRI-001 with sorafenib in subcutaneous mice model exhibited a higher antitumor inhibition rate at 72.0%, in comparison with MBRI-001 or sorafenib as monotherapy at 40.7% or 47.7%, respectively.Conclusion:MBRI-001 had better inhibition effects on microtubules and human hepatocellular carcinoma than that of plinabulin. The combination treatment of MBRI-001 and sorafenib exhibited a higher antitumor effect, which could provide a new strategy to treat HCC in the future.
