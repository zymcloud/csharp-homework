Coughing is a very common condition, accounting for frequent visits in general practice. In this case report, we found the cause of persisting cough to be hepatocellular carcinoma, located in close proximity to the diaphragm. After the tumor had been treated with chemoembolization the coughing disappeared. After the common causes for persistent cough has been ruled out, the clinician could consider other, rarer, conditions as the cause of the coughing, including affection of the diaphragm.
