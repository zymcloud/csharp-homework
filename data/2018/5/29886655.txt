Objective: To investigate the expression and clinical significance of KIAA1199 in primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: A total of 136 cases of primary hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and paired adjacent tissues were collected. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to detect the expression of KIAA1199 in primary hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and paired adjacent tissues. The relationship between KIAA1199 and clinicopathological parameter of primary hepatocellular carcinoma was analyzed. Results: The positive rate of KIAA1199 in primary hepatocellular carcinoma was 82.3% (112/136), which was higher than that in paired para-cancerous tissues (14.7%, 20/136). High expression of KIAA1199 was significantly correlated with age, cirrhosis history, tumor size, tumor number, degree of differentiation, TNM staging and microvenous invasion (MVI) (P<0.05), but without gender, drinking alcohol hobby, hepatitis history, family genetic history, tumor location (P>0.05). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that high KIAA1199 expression was associated with poor survival (P<0.01). In addition, Cox proportional hazards model showed that the expression of KIAA1199 was related to age, cirrhosis history, tumor size, tumor number, degree of differentiation, TNM staging and MVI (P<0.05). Conclusion: The expression of KIAA1199 is up-regulated in primary hepatocellular carcinoma, which is significantly correlated with the clinicopathological features and prognosis, high expression of KIAA1199 increased the risk of death in patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma.
