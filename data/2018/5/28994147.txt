Background and aim:We confirmed the clinical utility of a three-dimensional navigation system during transarterial chemoembolization.Methods:We evaluated 128 tumors in 91 patients enrolled between May 2015 and August 2016. We evaluated the accuracy of the three-dimensional navigation imaging system for all tumors. We compared the patients who were able to undergo route detection using three-dimensional navigation with previously treated patients who underwent transarterial chemoembolization without using three-dimensional navigation (n = 21). For 38 patients who underwent super-selective microcatheter insertion after a feeding artery was identified by three-dimensional navigation, we confirmed the relationship between the tumors and contrasted liver parenchyma and divided the computed tomography hepatic arteriography findings into four grades. Grade 1: an overlap of > 5 mm, grade 2: an overlap between 0 and 5 mm, grade 3: the borders of the tumor within the liver parenchyma but in contact with the edges, and grade 4: a tumor outside the borders of the liver parenchyma.Results:Using the three-dimensional navigation system, we identified a tumor-feeding artery in 125/128 tumors (97.6%). Furthermore, this system allowed us to significantly reduce the volume of contrast media and the radiation exposure dose in patients undergoing an evaluation. We identified 15 grade 1 tumors (39.5%), 3 grade 2 tumors (7.9%), 11 grade 3 tumors (28.9%), and 9 grade 4 tumors (23.7%) according to our definitions.Conclusion:The three-dimensional navigation is useful not only for patients but also for surgeons who have relatively little experience.
