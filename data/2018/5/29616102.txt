Reliable animal models are required for the in vivo study of the molecular mechanisms and effects of chemotherapeutic drugs in hepatocarcinoma. In vivo tracing techniques based on firefly luciferase (FLuc) may optimize the non-invasive monitoring of experimental animals. The present study established a murine Hepa1-6-FLuc cell line that stably expressed a retrovirus-delivered FLuc protein gene. The cell morphology, proliferation, migration and invasion ability of Hepa1-6-FLuc cells were the same as that of the Hepa1-6 cells, and thus is suitable to replace Hepa1-6 cells in the construction of hepatocarcinoma animal models. No differences in subcutaneous tumor mass and its pathomorphology from implanted Hepa1-6-FLuc cells were observed compared with Hepa1-6 control tumors. Bioluminescence imaging indicated that the Luc signal of the Hepa1-6-FLuc cells was consistently strengthened with increases in tumor mass; however, the Luc signal of Hepa1-6-AdFLuc became weaker and eventually disappeared during tumor development. Therefore, compared with the transient expression by adenovirus, stable expression of the FLuc gene in Hepa1-6 cells may better reflect cell proliferation and survival in vivo, and provide a reliable source for the establishment of hepatocarcinoma models.
