Early identification and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is very important for improving the prognosis and survival rate of the patient. To enhance the visualization and treatment efficiency of HCC, a theranostic agent has been developed that combines photoacoustic/fluorescence imaging with photothermal therapy for cancer. We report the synthesis of multifunctional theranostic SP94-modified polypyrrole (PPy)-BSA-ICG nanoparticles by a simple method. The multifunctional theranostic agent helped to combine two modes of imaging modalities, i.e. photoacoustic and near infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging, together with photothermal therapy. These nanoparticles exhibited an excellent stability in physiological solutions (PBS, pH 7.4 at 37 Â°C), a higher tumor accumulation as compared to the unmodified nanoparticles, and minimal nonspecific uptake by other normal organs such as liver and spleen. Most importantly, the nanoparticles could effectively kill the tumor through photothermal therapy with no tumor recurrence upon a single laser irradiation event. These results indicate that SP94-modified PPy-BSA-ICG is potentially a promising theranostic agent for image-guided cancer therapy as it overcomes the limitations of each of the imaging modalities and thus improves the therapeutic efficiency and reduces the side effects.
