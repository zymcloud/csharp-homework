This case represents the challenge and creativity necessary when treating patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who have been exposed to multiple lines of therapy. At present, treatment with immune checkpoint inhibition has stabilized and improved the metastatic disease of this patient with the exception of hepatic lesions. This isolated progression within the liver led the employment of radioembolization, which successfully treated those metastases. This is the first documented case of metastatic renal cell carcinoma controlled with concurrent use of immune checkpoint inhibition and radioembolization for both extrahepatic and hepatic metastases, respectively. This case can be construed as a potential example of the abscopal effect and may provide the basis for understanding this type of response in select patients.
