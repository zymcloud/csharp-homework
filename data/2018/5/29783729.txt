Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a polyphenol present in many human dietary foods. Several studies indicated a beneficial role of CGA in the prevention of cancer and an enhancement of chemotherapy when combined with CGA in the treatment of human hepatocarcinoma (HCC). Drug toxicity, resistance and subsequent disease progression represent a problem in HCC management, although treatment with the multikinase inhibitor Regorafenib improved overall survival. This study focused on the evaluation of the effects of combined treatment using both low Regorafenib concentrations and CGA as natural compound in HCC cells. The analysis of cell proliferation by Ki67 staining and cell cycle progression showed that CGA enhanced Regorafenib-mediated cell growth inhibition. Moreover, CGA potentiated the apoptotic effect of Regorafenib by the activation of the pro-apoptotic Annexin V, Bax and Caspase 3/7 and the inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl2 and Bcl-xL. Combined treatments were also effective in inhibiting cell motility. The mechanisms underlying the positive effects of combining CGA and Regorafenib were also addressed and an increased inhibition of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)and PI3K/Akt/mTORC (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling was observed. Overall, these data demonstrated that co-treatment with Regorafenib and CGA enhanced Regorafenib action, reducing its cytotoxicity in HCC cells. In conclusion, this drug combination could be considered as a safe and more effective approach in HCC therapy.
