RAD51-associated protein 1 (RAD51AP1) is a member of the multiprotein complexes postulated to carry out RAD51-mediated homologous recombination and DNA repair in mammalian cells. In the present study, we showed that hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A directly bound RAD51AP1 and increased the protein level of RAD51AP1 through modulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We also demonstrated that RAD51AP1 protein levels were increased in the liver tissues of HCV-infected patients and NS5A-transgenic mice. Importantly, NS5A impaired DNA repair by disrupting the RAD51/RAD51AP1/UAF1 complex and rendered HCV-infected cells more sensitive to DNA damage. Silencing of RAD51AP1 expression resulted in a decrease of viral propagation. We further demonstrated that RAD51AP1 was involved in the assembly step of the HCV life cycle by protecting viral RNA. These data suggest that HCV exploits RAD51AP1 to promote viral propagation and thus that host DNA repair is compromised in HCV-infected cells. Overall, our findings provide mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of HCV infection.IMPORTANCE Chronic infection with HCV is the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying HCV-induced HCC are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that the HCV NS5A protein physically interacts with RAD51AP1 and increases the RAD51AP1 protein level through modulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. HCV coopts host RAD51AP1 to protect viral RNA at an assembly step of the HCV life cycle. Note that the RAD51 protein accumulates in the cytoplasm of HCV-infected cells, and thus the RAD51/RAD51AP1/UAF1-mediated DNA damage repair system in the nucleus is compromised in HCV-infected cells. Our data may provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of HCV-induced pathogenesis.
