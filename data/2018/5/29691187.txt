A 66-year-old female patient was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma accompanied by neuropathic pain induced by a metastatic tumor that compromised root and spinal canal. Although her pain was relieved following medical treatment, breakthrough pain occurring 1-2 times a day was still distressing. Neuropathic pain in her right lower limb caused discomfort and irritability and decreased her quality of life. We had limited options to adjust her prescription drug regime, due to the side effect of these drugs. Although acupuncture therapy was only performed at her home once a week, the efficacy was outstanding. The patient did not report any further instances of breakthrough pain, and she did not require additional bolus morphine. She could comfortably live in her familiar surroundings with her family and did not require any emergency room visits or admission into the hospital during the last month of her life. She had excellent quality of life in the terminal period of her life, and could even participate in a family function during this time. The present case report suggests that acupuncture may have a role in treating neuropathic pain induced by bone metastasis in patients with advanced cancer across clinical and in-home settings.
