Long non-coding RNA (lnc)TCF7 has been reported to promote the self‑renewal of human cancer stem cells, and enhance the aggressiveness of human non‑small cell lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma cells. However, the effect of lncTCF7 on colorectal cancer (CRC) tumorigenesis and progression is currently unclear. In the present study, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction results demonstrated that lncTCF7 expression was higher in CRC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues and was significantly associated with tumor size, differentiation degree, tumor‑node‑metastasis grade, lymph node metastasis and invasion depth. In addition, lncTCF7 demonstrated a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing CRC, as determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Furthermore, lncTCF7 silencing in SW‑620 and HT29 CRC cell lines inhibited the proliferation, cell cycle, migration and invasion of cells, as determined by Cell Counting Kit‑8 assays, propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry, wound healing assays and Transwell invasion assays, respectively; however, Annexin V/PI double staining and flow cytometry indicated that lncTCF7 silencing did not significantly affect the apoptosis of CRC cells. These results indicate that lncTCF7 may predict the progression, and promote the growth and metastasis, of CRC, and may therefore be a novel diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for CRC treatment.
