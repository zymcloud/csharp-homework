We describe a 52-year-old female patient who presented with a 9.5-cm fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC). The patient was initially unsuitable for surgical resection and therefore underwent transarterial chemoembolization followed by selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with Yttrium-90 to downsize the tumour. Following SIRT, the tumour decreased in volume from 350 to 20 cm3 allowing curative (R0) resection with an extended left hepatectomy and reconstruction of IVC. This is the first reported case of FL-HCC treated with SIRT in which, due to the good SIRT response, the patient was downsized to allow curative resection.
