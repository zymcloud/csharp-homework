Purpose:The aim of this study is to investigate the inhibition of cancer growth by pterostilbene through Metastasis-Associated Protein 1 (MTA1) and the histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) complex in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We investigate the antitumor effects of pterostilbene (PTER) in HCC. The SMMC-7721 hepatoma cell line was cultured and treated with PTER for different time depending on the experiment. After treatment, we tested the cellular expression of proteins by Western blot and the expression of MTA1 mRNA by real-time PCR. And the immunoprecipitation was performed to confirm the acetylation in PTEN. Animal models have been established to confirm the anti-cancer effects of PTER.Results:PTER treatment could downregulate the expression of MTA1, and HDAC1 and elevates the Ac-PTEN ratio in tumors. The results suggest that PTER can decrease the expression of MTA1 and destabilize the MTA1/HDAC1 complex allowing acetylation/activation of PTEN on Lys402 site. The expression of MTA1 may be linked to cell apoptosis and invasion in HCC.Conclusion:We demonstrated that PTER suppressed the growth, and invasion of HCC and was effective in regulating the levels of the MTA1/HDAC1/NuRD complex, promoting PTEN acetylation and apoptosis in HCC. Our findings suggest that the novel epigenetic nature of PTER anticancer activity opens up new avenues for primary chemoprevention, as well as anticancer and antimetastatic treatment.
