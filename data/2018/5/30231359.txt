The incidence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rising. It is one of the most common cancers worldwide and accounts for substantial morbidity and mortality. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are the most important etiologies of HCC, and effective screening and management strategies are crucial to reduce the HCC risk. For HBV, which accounts for the majority of HCC cases, most infections were acquired via perinatal and early horizontal transmission. Universal vaccination of newborns has led to a decline in HCC incidence compared with the pre-vaccination era. Effective antiviral therapies with nucleos(t)ide analogues or pegylated interferon reduced the incidence of HCC. For HCV, the emergence of effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents has substantially improved cure rates; therefore all patients with HCV should be considered for DAA treatment. The most important obstacle in eliminating HCV is access to therapy. For NAFLD, the global incidence is increasing rapidly, thus its impact on HCC incidence may be explosive. Progression to HCC in NAFLD happens particularly in those with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and exacerbated by metabolic syndrome, or PNPLA3 gene polymorphism. Lifestyle changes are imperative while drug therapy has yet to demonstrate substantive protective effects on HCC prevention. For management of HCC, early diagnosis via imaging surveillance among persons with HCC risk factors remains the most important strategy to identify early-stage disease appropriate for resection or transplantation.
