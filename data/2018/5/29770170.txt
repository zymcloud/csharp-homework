Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Sorafenib is the only food and drug administration (FDA) approved as first line systemic treatment in HCC. Regorafenib and nivolumab are the only FDA approved second line treatment after progression on sorafenib. We will discuss all potential first and second line options in HCC. In addition, we also will explore sequencing treatment options in HCC, and examine biomarkers that can potentially predict benefits from treatments such as immune checkpoint inhibitor. This minireview summarizes potential treatments in HCC based on clinical trials that have been published in manuscript or abstract format from 1994-2018.
