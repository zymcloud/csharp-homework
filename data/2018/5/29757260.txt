Retinoids exert antitumor effects through the retinoic acid receptor &alpha; (RAR&alpha;). In the present study, we sought to identify the factors involved in the RAR&alpha;-mediated transcriptional regulation of the tumor suppressor gene and the tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI2) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) was used in the in vitro experiments. Cell invasiveness was measured using trans-well invasion assay. ATRA significantly increased TFPI2 expression through RAR&alpha; in a human HCC cell line known as HuH7. TFPI2 was vital in the ATRA-mediated suppression of HuH7 cell invasion. The musculo-aponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog B (MAFB) significantly enhanced the activation of the TFPI2 promoter via RAR&alpha; while MAFF inhibited it. The knockdown of RAR&alpha; or MAFB counteracted the ATRA-mediated suppression of HuH7 cell invasion while the knockdown of MAFF inhibited the invasion. TFPI2 expression in HCC tissues was significantly downregulated possibly due to the decreased expression of RAR&beta; and MAFB. Patients with HCC expressing low MAFB and high MAFF levels showed the shortest disease-free survival time. These results suggest that MAFB and MAFF play critical roles in the antitumor effects of retinoids by regulating the expression of retinoid target genes such as TFPI2 and can be promising for developing therapies to combat HCC invasion.
