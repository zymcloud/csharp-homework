This study was conducted to estimate the preventing and sensitizing efficiency of Alpinia officinarum rhizome extract (AORE) in an experimental model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) +/- cisplatin. HCC was induced by a single intraperitoneal (i.p) dose of diethylnitrosamine (DENA, 200mg/kg). After 14 days, phenobarbitone (PB, 0.05%) was added to drinking water for 14 weeks to promote hepatocarcinogenesis. Cisplatin (CP) was given in a dose of 1.5 mg/kg (i.p), twice a week, alone or with AORE (400 mg/kg daily, orally) for 21 days. AORE was tried as a protective before the induction of HCC for three weeks as well. Results revealed that DENA/PB elevated hepatic indices as ALT and AST and total bilirubin with declining serum total protein. It increased oxidative stress, as hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) with depressed hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) contents, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities. This was accompanied by an increase in hepatic expression of antioxidant genes (thioredoxin and glutaredoxin). Hepatocarcinogenesis was detected by histopathological changes in liver sections and the elevation of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level. Treatment with CP partially restored altered hepatic functions and oxidative stress markers. It also showed a partial decrease in the expression of antioxidant genes, improving histopathological changes in the liver and AFP level in serum. The treatment with AORE alone or AORE+CP enhanced hepatic function and oxidative stress markers. It also caused a decrease in the expression of antioxidant genes and improved histopathological changes in liver and serum AFP level. This effect is more potent than the treatment with CP alone. Our study suggested that AORE can be used as a promising natural chemoprevention or a chemosensitizing agent against hepatocarcinogenesis.
