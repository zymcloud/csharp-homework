This study aimed to elucidate the temporal change and determinants for the risk of HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis B continuously receiving NUC. Through analysis of the national healthcare database in Taiwan, we screened a total of 65 426 infected patients receiving entecavir or tenofovir for at least 3 months and excluded those with lamivudine, adefovir or telbivudine exposure, malignancy, end-stage renal failure or a diagnosis of HCC within 3 months of starting treatment. Eligible patients (N = 27 820) were followed until HCC occurrence, completion of the allowed 3-year regimen or 31 December 2013. During a median follow-up of 25.1 (12.1-35.6) months, 802 patients developed HCC, with 1-, 2- and 3-year cumulative incidence of 1.82% (95% CI, 1.66-1.99%), 3.05% (95% CI, 2.82-3.28%) and 4.06% (95% CI, 3.77-4.36%), respectively. HCC annual incidence decreased with an adjusted IRR of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.66-0.80) per yearly interval and was associated with cirrhosis (IRR, 10.07; 95% CI, 6.00-16.90 in age
