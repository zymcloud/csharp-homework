T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (Tim-3), mediating immune exhaustion in tumor microenvironment, has become a promising target for tumor therapy. However, the exact mechanisms for tumor cell-intrinsic Tim-3 in tumor development and its potential contribution in Tim-3-targeted therapy strategy have not been elucidated yet. In this study, we showed that human liver cancer tissues contained high ratio of Tim-3-expressing hepatocytes, and cytokines rich in tumor microenvironment and HBV involved in Tim-3 upregulation in malignant hepatocytes. We demonstrated that hepatocyte-specific Tim-3 overexpression enhances tumor cell growth, whereas Tim-3 inhibition on malignant hepatocytes by anti-Tim-3 antibodies or RNAi suppresses tumor growth both in vitro and in Tim-3 knockout mice. Mechanistically, the hepatocyte-Tim-3 receptor activates NF-ÎºB phosphorylation, which in turn stimulates IL-6 secretion and STAT3 phosphorylation. Our results identify tumor cell-intrinsic functions of Tim-3 in tumorigenesis and suggest that blocking Tim-3 in tumor cells might contribute to the clinical efficacy of anti-Tim-3 antibody treatment in the future tumor therapy.
