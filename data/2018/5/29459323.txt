The tumor vasculature with unique characteristics offers an attractive target for anti-cancer therapy. Herein, we put forward a novel antitumor therapeutic mechanism based on the gadofullerene nanocrystals (GFNCs), the agent we have previously shown to efficiently disrupt tumor vasculature by size-expansion with assistance of radiofrequency (RF). However, the tumor vascular disrupting mechanism of RF-assisted GFNCs treatment was not further studied. In the present work, a rapid tumor blood flow shutdown has been observed by the vascular perfusion imaging in vivo and vascular damages were evident 6 h after the RF-assisted GFNCs treatment. Importantly, a significant down-expression of tumor vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) treated by RF-assisted GFNCs was further investigated, which caused vascular collapse, blood flow shut-down and subsequent tumor hemorrhagic necrosis. These findings set forth a systematic mechanism on the superior anti-tumor efficiency by RF-assisted GFNCs treatment.
