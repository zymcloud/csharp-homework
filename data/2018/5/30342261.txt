Background & aims:Despite increased risks for adverse effects in patients with cirrhosis, little is known about opioid prescriptions for this population. We aimed to assess time trends in opioid prescribing and factors associated with receiving opioids among patients with cirrhosis.Methods:Among Veterans with cirrhosis, identified using national Veterans Health Administration data (2005-2014), we assessed characteristics of patients and their prescriptions for opioids. We calculated the annual proportion of patients receiving any opioid prescription. Among opioid recipients, we assessed prescriptions that were long-term (>90 days' supply), for high doses (>100 MME/day), or involved combinations of opioids and acetaminophen or benzodiazepine. We evaluated patient characteristics independently associated with long-term and any opioid prescriptions using mixed-effects regression models.Results:Among 127,239 Veterans with cirrhosis, 97,974 (77.0%) received a prescription for an opioid. Annual opioid prescriptions increased from 36% in 2005 to 47% in 2014 (P Conclusion:Among Veterans with cirrhosis, 36%-47% were prescribed opioids in each year. Mental health disorders and hepatic decompensation were independently associated with long-term opioid prescriptions.
