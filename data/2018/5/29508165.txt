Background:Hospice provides integrative palliative care for advance-staged hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, but hospice utilization in HCC patients in the USA is not clearly understood.Aims:We examined hospice use and subsequent clinical course in advance-staged HCC patients.Methods:We conducted a retrospective study on a national, Veterans Affairs cohort with stage C or D HCC. We evaluated demographics, clinical factors, treatment, and clinical course in relation to hospice use.Results:We identified 814 patients with advanced HCC, of whom 597 (73.3%) used hospice. Oncologist management consistently predicted hospice use, irrespective of HCC treatment [no treatment: OR 2.25 (1.18-4.3), treatment: OR 1.80 (1.10-2.95)]. Among patients who received HCC treatment, hospice users were less likely to have insurance beyond VA benefits (47.2 vs. 60.0%, p = 0.01). Among patients without HCC treatment, hospice users were older (62.2 [17.2] vs. 60.2 [14.0] years, p = 0.05), white (62.1 vs. 52.9%, p = 0.01), resided in the Southern USA (39.5 vs. 31.8%, p = 0.05), and had a performance score â‰¥ 3 (41.9 vs. 31.8%, p = 0.01). The median time from hospice entry to death or end of study was 1.05 [2.96] months for stage C and 0.53 [1.18] months for stage D patients.Conclusions:26.7% advance-staged HCC patients never entered hospice, representing potential missed opportunities for improving end-of-life care. Age, race, location, performance, insurance, and managing specialty can predict hospice use. Differences in managing specialty and short-term hospice use suggest that interventions to optimize early palliative care are necessary.
