Objective:To investigate the impact of long noncodingRNA (lncRNA) colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (CRNDE) on hepatocellular cancer (HCC) cell propagation, invasion, and migration by mediating miR-203/ BCAT1 axis.Methods:Microarray analysis was based on 25 pairs of HCC cancerous tissues and adjacent tissues. The expression levels of CRNDE, miR-203, and BCAT1 in HCC tissues were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The liver cell line L-02 and HCC cell lines HepG2 and Huh-7 were utilized to assess the regulatory eï¬€ects of CRNDE and miR-203 on HCC progression in vitro. Western blot was used to qualify BCAT1 protein expression level. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated using CCK-8 and flow cytometry analysis, whereas cell invasion and migration assay were performed by the Transwell assay. The relationship among CRNDE, miR-203, and BCAT1 was validated by dual luciferase assay. Tumor Xenograft study was established to verify the pathological effect of CRNDE on HCC development in vivo.Results:The expression levels of the CRNDE and BCAT1 were upregulated in HCC tissues and cells, whereas miR-203 was downregulated in HCC. Knockdown of CRNDE or miR-203 overexpression would inhibit HCC cell propagation and metastasis, and induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, miR-203 was negatively correlated with CRNDE, the same as miR-203 with BCAT1. Dual luciferase assay showed that miR-203 was an inhibitory target of CRNDE, and BCAT1 was directly targeted by miR-203 as well.Conclusion:LncRNA CRNDE could enhance HCC tumorgenesis by sponging miR-203 and mediating BCAT1. LncRNA CRNDE might facilitate HCC cell propagation, invasiveness, and migration through regulating miR-203/ BCAT1 axis.
