Objectives:Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) has been suggested to reflect the tumor grades of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs); i.e., it can be used as a biomarker to predict the patients' prognosis. To verify its feasibility as a biomarker, the present study sought to determine how the ADC values of HCC are affected by a tumor's histopathologic grade and arterial vascularity.Materials and methods:From 131 consecutive patients, 141 surgically resected HCCs (16 well-differentiated [wd-HCCs], 83 moderately-differentiated [md-HCCs], and 42 poorly-differentiated HCCs [pd-HCCs]) were subjected to a comparison of the tumors' arterial vascularity (non-, slightly-, or markedly-hypervascular) determined on dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the ADC was measured retrospectively.Results:The pd-HCCs (1.05±0.16 × 10-3 mm2/s) had a significantly lower ADC than md-HCCs (1.16±0.21 × 10-3 mm2/s; p = 0.010), but there was no significant difference compared to wd-HCCs (1.11±0.18 × 10-3 mm2/s; p = 0.968). The mean ADC was significantly higher in markedly hypervascular lesions (1.20±0.20 × 10-3 mm2/s) than in nonhypervascular lesions (0.95±0.14 × 10-3mm2/s; pConclusion:Although pd-HCC constantly shows low ADCs regardless of arterial vascularities, ADCs cannot stably stratify histopathologic tumor grades due to the variable features of wd-HCCs; and the ADC should be used with caution as a tumor biomarker of HCC.
