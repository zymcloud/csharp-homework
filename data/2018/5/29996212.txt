Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common digestive system tumors. Its occurrence and development are considered as multi-factorial and multi-step process. Recent studies have shown that wingless-related integration (Wnt) pathway plays an important role in the HCC progression and is associated with malignant transformation of hepatocytes, HCC metastasis, drug resistance and liver cancer stem cells. This article analyzes the expression of key signaling molecules in Wnt pathway and its value in diagnosis, prognosis and targeted therapy, and outlines the research progress of Wnt pathway targeted drugs for the treatment of HCC, with a view to providing targeted therapy research for HCC reference.
