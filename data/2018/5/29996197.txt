Patients with chronic liver disease often have varying degrees of hepatic fibrosis, and further exacerbations can lead to cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis, but there are still many limitations. In recent years, non-invasive assessments for liver fibrosis/cirrhosis have gained rapid development. Of these techniques, two different approaches have been validated in clinical practice: imaging methods based on the measurement of liver stiffness, and biological methods based on the serum biomarkers. The two different approaches can complement each other. Current non-invasive assessments for liver fibrosis/cirrhosis tend to be reliable for the detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, but often lack to distinguish the different early stage of liver fibrosis. Further improving the accuracy of non-invasive assessments might play an important role for clinical management of liver diseases.
