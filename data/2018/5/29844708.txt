While some reports are available regarding metachronous gastric metastasis from renal cell carcinoma after treatment, there are few reports of primary lesion detection based on the diagnosis of a gastric metastatic lesion. The patient in this case was an 80-year-old woman who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy after having developed anorexia 2 months earlier. A submucosal tumor with central umbilication was found in the gastric greater curvature. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed a solid and hypoechoic mass with hypervascularity on color Doppler imaging that proliferated mainly within the submucosal layer. There was partial exposure of the tumor on the superficial layer. Biopsy was performed, as a neuroendocrine tumor was suspected; however, histopathological findings with immunostaining revealed gastric metastasis from clear renal cell carcinoma. Subsequently, contrast enhanced computed tomography showed right renal cell carcinoma and liver metastasis. Thus, molecularly targeted drug treatment was initiated by the Department of Urology. Our findings indicate that a primary lesion can be identified and prognosis can be assumed based on biopsy of the gastric metastatic lesion. Immunostaining of biopsy samples collected endoscopically could help achieve definite diagnosis.
