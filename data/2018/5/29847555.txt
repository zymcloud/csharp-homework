Background and aims:Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can advance, if untreated, to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver failure and liver-related death. In the United States, NASH affects approximately 2-5% of the population and an additional 10-30% have NAFLD. The number of drugs in development for NASH is growing steadily, along with nonclinical models to support prediction of clinical success. Here we evaluate gemcabene, a first-in-class clinical candidate for dyslipidemia, for its potential utility, based on its combined lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory efficacy in clinical trials, in a preclinical model of NASH.Methods:Gemcabene was evaluated in the STAM™ murine model of NASH. Gemcabene intervention in mice made diabetic with streptozotocin and fed a high fat high-caloric diet was assessed for changes in plasma, and hepatic histological and mRNA markers of lipid metabolism and inflammation.Results:Gemcabene significantly downregulated hepatic mRNA markers of inflammation (TNF-α, MCP-1, MIP-1β, CCR5, CCR2, NF-κB), lipogenesis and lipid modulation (ApoC-III, ACC1, ADH-4, Sulf-2), and fibrosis (TIMP-1 and MMP-2). These effects are important for the prevention of steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning (i.e., the components of the NAFLD Activity Score or NAS), and inhibition of fibrosis progression, and were observed following treatment with gemcabene.Conclusions:These non-clinical findings corroborate with existing clinical data to support the clinical evaluation of gemcabene as a potential new treatment for NASH.
