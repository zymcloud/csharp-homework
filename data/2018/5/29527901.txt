Pancreatic panniculitis is a rare skin manifestation associated with pancreatic conditions. This condition has similar characteristics to those of other panniculitis types and its course parallels the triggering condition and may occasionally precede it. We report the case of a female patient with asymptomatic pancreatic panniculitis; the etiologic study identified a pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma with liver metastases.
