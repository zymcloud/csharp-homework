Renal cell carcinoma is the most common renal tumour in adult that often metastasises to the lung, liver or bone. Head and neck lesions are uncommon with no early warning signs and presents with overt metastases at primary presentation in 25%-30% of reported cases. The incidence of haemangiomas that suggest malignancy are similar to that of bone metastasis. Calvarial haemangiomas usually present as asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on imaging or postmortem examination. We report a case where an initial diagnosis of benign tumour of the skull was made based on clinical presentation and calvarial haemangioma on CT head but was confirmed as metastatic clear cell carcinoma of the kidney after histopathological results. Skull metastases are rare and present late in the course of the disease. It is unusual for metastatic lesion to be the primary presentation in a clinically silent renal cell carcinoma.
