Accumulating studies supported that lncRNAs played important roles in tumorigenesis. LncRNA HOXA11-AS was a novel lncRNA that has been proved to involved in several tumours. However, the role of HOXA11-AS in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be explained. In our study, we showed that HOXA11-AS expression was up-regulated in the HCC tissues, and the higher expression of HOXA11-AS was associated with the advanced stage in the HCC samples. In addition, we indicated that the expression of HOXA11-AS was up-regulated in HCC cell lines (Hep3B, SMMC-7721, MHCC97-H and BEL-7402) compared with normal liver cell lines (HL-7702). Overexpression of HOXA11-AS promoted HCC proliferation and invasion and induced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and knockdown of HOXA11-AS suppressed the HCC cell proliferation and invasion. However, we showed that miR-214-3p expression was down-regulated in the HCC tissues and cell lines. Ectopic expression of miR-214-3p suppressed HCC cell proliferation and invasion. Furthermore, we indicated that overexpression of HOXA11-AS decreased the miR-214-3p expression and the expression of miR-214-3p was negatively related with the HOXA11-AS expression in HCC samples. Ectopic expression of HOXA11-AS increased HCC proliferation and invasion and induced EMT through inhibiting miR-214-3p expression. These data suggested that HOXA11-AS/miR-214-3p axis was responsible for development of HCC.
