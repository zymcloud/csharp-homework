Purpose To retrospectively investigate the safety and efficacy of sorafenib combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) (hereafter, TACE-RFA) in the treatment of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (rHCC) with portal vein tumor thrombosis, extrahepatic metastases (advanced hepatocellular carcinoma), or both after initial hepatectomy. Materials and Methods The study was centrally approved by the ethics committee of three tertiary medical centers in China. From January 2010 to January 2015, 207 consecutive patients with advanced rHCC after initial hepatectomy received sorafenib combined with TACE-RFA (combination group, n = 106) or sorafenib alone (sorafenib group, n = 101) at the three medical centers. Overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP) were compared between the two groups. Complications were assessed. Survival curves were constructed with the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared with the log-rank test. Results Baseline characteristics were balanced between the two groups. No treatment-related death occurred in either group. The toxicity profile in the combination group was similar to that in the sorafenib group. After treatment, median OS (14.0 vs 9.0 months, respectively; P Â© RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.
