In what is considered to be "a global problem," liver cancer has tripled in incidence in the United States over the past 20 to 30 years, and is now present in 7 per 100,000 Americans. Thus, screening for disease should be at the forefront to effectively treat high-risk populations. At the 2018 NCCN 23rd Annual Conference, Dr. Anne M. Covey discussed the updated NCCN Guidelines for the screening and diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, which place ultrasound as the most cost-effective and least toxic primary screening option, with a screening interval of approximately 6 months for individuals considered to be at high risk.
