Background/aims:We investigated whether inflammatory markers such as neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) independently and in combination would be significant prognostic factors for survival in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.Methods:A total of 497 patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who received neoadjuvant or definitive chemoradiotherapy from 2005 to 2015 were evaluated. We divided the patients into groups according to the median values of NLR and PLR: NLR＜1.89 (n=156), NLR≥1.89 (n=341), PLR ＜149 (n=248) and PLR ≥149 (n=249).Results:For NLR ＜1.89 and ≥1.89 groups, respectively, the 1-year overall survival (OS) rates were 73.2% and 60.8% (p＜0.001) and 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 43.9% and 31.3% (p＜0.001). For PLR ＜149 and ≥149 groups, respectively, the 1-year OS rates were 68.1% and 61.3% (p=0.029) and 1-year PFS rates were 37.9% and 32.5% (p=0.027). Patients with both high NLR and high PLR showed the worst OS and PFS rates compared with those with both lower NLR and lower PLR.Conclusions:Elevated pretreatment NLR and PLR independently and in combination significantly predicted poor OS and PFS.
