Background:LncRNA TUG1 has been reported to be highly expressed in CRC samples and cells and promoted metastasis by affecting EMT, indicating a poor prognosis for colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we determined the underlying mechanism for tumor oncogenesis of lncRNA TUG1 in CRC metastasis.Methods:The expressions of miR-600 and KIAA1199 in 76 CRC patients and CRC cells and CRC metastatic tissues were determined using qRT-PCR. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins were determined using western blot. CRC cell metastasis was assessed by colony formation, wound healing and transwell assay. Luciferase reporter gene assay was used to confirm miR-600 binding to KIAA1199 3'UTR.Results:Our data showed that lncRNA TUG1 was upregulated in CRC cells, miR-600 was downregulated in CRC tissues, cell lines and CRC metastatic tissues, and low miR-600 expression predicted a poor clinical prognosis. Overexpression of miR-600 suppressed CRC cell migration/invasion and EMT-related proteins in vitro, inhibited tumor volume and weight, and decreased the number of CRC liver metastasis in vivo. KIAA1199 was upregulated in CRC tissues, and was negatively regulated by miR-600. KIAA1199 overexpression promoted CRC cell migration and invasion, which reversed the inhibition effect of miR-600 mimic on migration and invasion of CRC cells. Moreover, TUG1 negatively regulated miR-600, and inhibition of TUG1 suppressed CRC cell migration and invasion and EMT-related proteins via regulating miR-600.Conclusion:Our study proved that TUG1 promoted KIAA1199 expression to accelerate EMT and metastasis of CRC cell through inhibition of miR-600 expression.
