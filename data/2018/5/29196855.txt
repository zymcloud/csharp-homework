Objectives:To assess the clinical feasibility of US-US image overlay fusion with evaluation of the ablative margin in radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Fifty-three patients with 68 HCCs measuring 0.9-4.0 cm who underwent RFA guided by US-US overlay image fusion were included in this retrospective study. By an overlay of pre-/postoperative US, the tumor image could be projected onto the ablative hyperechoic zone. Therefore, the ablative margin three-dimensionally could be shown during the RFA procedure. US-US image overlay was compared to dynamic CT a few days after RFA for assessment of early treatment response. Accuracy of graded response was calculated, and the performance of US-US image overlay fusion was compared with that of CT using a Kappa agreement test.Results:Technically effective ablation was achieved in a single session, and 59 HCCs (86.8 %) succeeded in obtaining a 5-mm margin on CT. The response with US-US image overlay correctly predicted early CT evaluation with an accuracy of 92.6 % (63/68) (k = 0.67; 95 % CI: 0.39-0.95).Conclusion:US-US image overlay fusion can be proposed as a feasible guidance in RFA with a safety margin and predicts early response of treatment assessment with high accuracy.Key points:• US-US image overlay fusion visualizes the ablative margin during RFA procedure. • Visualizing the margin during the procedure can prompt immediate complementary treatment. • US image fusion correlates with the results of early evaluation CT.
