Research advances and analysis in the non‑protein coding part of the human genome have suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are associated with tumor initiation, growth and metastasis. Accumulating studies have demonstrated that a class of miRNAs and lncRNAs are dysregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and closely associated with tumorigenesis, diagnosis and prognosis. In the present study, integrative analysis of published data on multi‑level Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and a bioinformatics computational approach were used to predict regulatory mechanism networks among differentially expressed mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs. Firstly, nine microarray expression data sets of mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs associated with HCC were collected from GEO datasets. Secondly, a total of 628 mRNAs, 15 miRNAs, and 49 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in this integrative analysis. Following this, mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA regulatory or co‑expression networks were constructed. From the construction of the regulatory networks, five miRNAs and ten lncRNAs were identified as key differentially expressed noncoding RNAs associated with HCC progression. Finally, the regulatory effects of ten lncRNAs and miRNAs were validated. The study provides a novel insight into the understanding of the transcriptional regulation of HCC, and differentially expressed lncRNAs targeted and regulated by miRNAs were identified and validated in HCC specimens and cell lines.
