Rationale:Gallbladder perforation is a relatively uncommon complication of alcoholic liver cirrhosis and may happen with or without gallstones.Patient concerns:Here we report a 52-year-old male patient who was diagnosed as gallbladder perforation with chronic liver cirrhosis and asymptomatic gallstones. The patient was admitted with acute and severe abdominal pain during weight-bearing physical labor. He had a history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis but no chronic abdominal pain or gallstones. The patient presented with localized peritoneal irritation, and abdominal puncture showed non-clotting blood. A preliminary clinical diagnosis was made as hepatocellular carcinoma rupture based on imaging findings. However, this diagnosis changed to gangrenous cholecystitis with gallbladder perforation by the laparotomy examination.Diagnoses:He was diagnosed with gangrenous cholecystitis with gallbladder perforation.Interventions and outcomes:The patient performed well postoperatively.Lessons:This case suggests that gallbladder perforation should be considered as a potential cause of acute abdominal pain even without evidence of gallstones. Early examination with a laparotomy examination can help achieve a timely diagnosis.
