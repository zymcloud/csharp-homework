Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Tumor recurrence and metastasis are major factors that contribute to the poor outcome of patients with HCC. However, it is difficult to predict the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Trafficking Protein Particle Complex 4 (Trappc4), is associated with tumorigenesis. The present study aimed to detect Trappc4 expression in HCC and its association with clinicopathological patient data. More importantly, this study reveals the relationship between Trappc4 and the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. A total of 148 HCC tissues were assessed for expression of Trappc4 mRNA and protein with (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) RT-PCR (n=36), Western blotting (n=4) and immunohistochemistry (n=148), respectively. The data show that Trappc4 mRNA and protein are expressed at low levels in HCC tissues compared to adjacent tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 148 cases of HCC showed different degrees of positive expression. Statistical analysis showed that expression of Trappc4 was associated with histological differentiation, TNM stage, and vascular invasion (P < 0.05), but did not correlate with the patient's age, gender, tumor size (P > 0.05). Most importantly, HCC patients with low expression of Trappc4 had shorter survival time compared to patients with high expression. Trappc4 might be involved in the pathogenesis of HCC and could be an important prognostic marker in HCC patients.
