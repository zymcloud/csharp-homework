Background:Pueraria candollei var. mirifica is a medicinal plant that is promoted as a "Champion Product" by the Government of Thailand. This plant has been reported to relieve postmenopausal symptoms, prevent and reverse bone loss, inhibit the growth of breast cancer, and alleviate cardiovascular diseases in preclinical and clinical studies. However, there is little information on the oral bioavailability and tissue distribution of puerarin with respect to its pharmacodynamic activities. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of puerarin, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination, in rats. Moreover, this is the first study to examine the tissue distribution of puerarin in the hippocampus, femur, tibia, and mammary gland.Methods:Adult female rats were administered puerarin at 1 mg/kg intravenously or 5 and 10 mg/kg orally. Blood, tissue, urine, and feces were collected and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.Results:Puerarin reached a maximum concentration in the blood of 140-230 Î¼g/L within 1 h of oral dosing, and had an absolute oral bioavailability of approximately 7%. Following intravenous administration, puerarin was widely distributed in several tissues, including the hippocampus, heart, lung, stomach, liver, mammary gland, kidney, spleen, femur, and tibia. Approximately 50% of the intravenous dose was excreted as glucuronide metabolites via the urinary route.Conclusions:The absolute oral bioavailability of puerarin was approximately 7% at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg. Puerarin was widely distributed to several organs related to the diseases of aging, including the hippocampus, femur, tibia, and mammary gland. Glucuronides were the major metabolites of puerarin and were mainly excreted in the urine. These results are useful for the development of puerarin and Pueraria candollei var. mirifica as phytopharmaceutical products.
