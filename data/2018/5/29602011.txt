Objective:To determine the clinical efficacy of TACE with platinum versus anthracyclines for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients using a meta-analysis.Methods:We conducted a systematic review of the literature in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library database to discover relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. Data on therapeutic response, adverse event and overall survival rate from studies that compared TACE with platinum versus anthracyclines for HCC patients was extracted for pooled estimation. Subgroup analysis was used if further investigation was needed. The Q statistic and the I2 index statistic were used to assess heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated using Egger's test.Results:Four RCTs and seven observational studies containing 1405 patients were included in this meta-analysis. After comparing RCTs and observational studies separately, the pooled estimation results indicated that no significant difference existed between platinum and anthracyclines regarding therapeutic response, adverse event and overall survival rate. Furthermore, Egger's test revealed bias in pooled estimation of survival rate among RCTs.Conclusions:Based on current results, we concluded that TACE with platinum revealed similar clinical efficacy compared with anthracyclines. And more relative studies in this field were expected in the future.
