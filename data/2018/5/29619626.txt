Purpose:Laparoscopic liver resection is widely used for liver tumors, but its utility in patients with cirrhosis remains controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the surgical outcomes of laparoscopic liver resection in patients with liver cirrhosis with specific reference to a difficulty scoring system.Methods:From January 2010 to March 2016, the outcomes of laparoscopic liver resection in 95 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Surgical outcomes were analyzed to identify differences between the liver cirrhosis and non-liver cirrhosis groups; these groups were further stratified to high and low difficulty scores. The surgical outcomes of both groups were compared according to the difficulty scores.Results:Overall, 53/95 (55.8%) patients were diagnosed with liver cirrhosis. There were no significant differences in surgical duration, blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, and morbidity between groups, although liver function was worse in the liver cirrhosis group than in the non-liver cirrhosis group. Multivariate analysis showed that the difficulty score was an independent predictor of increased blood loss. In particular, blood loss in cirrhotic patients was significantly greater with a high difficulty score than with a low difficulty score.Conclusions:The safety profile of laparoscopic liver resection was the same in patients with and without liver cirrhosis. However, patients with liver cirrhosis and a high difficulty score require extra attention, because of a higher risk for perioperative blood loss.
