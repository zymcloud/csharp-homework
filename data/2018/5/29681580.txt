Cancer has become the leading cause of death and a major burden to public health in China. The current study analyzed the composition, incidence, mortality, and temporal trends for some major cancer types among permanent residents in Luwan district of Shanghai from 2002 to 2011, so as to provide data for cancer research. Data were collected from the database of cancer registration and management system in Shanghai. Number of new cases, number of deaths, incidence, and mortality of each cancer type were calculated. The incidence and mortality rates were standardized. Temporal trends in the incidence and mortality were assessed using average annual percent change. There were 12,843 new cancer cases and 8,331 deaths from cancer in Luwan from January 2002 to December 2011. Age-standardized incidence rates by Segi's standard were 229.46 and 205.05 per 100,000 population for males and females, respectively. For males, the most commonly diagnosed cancers were lung, colorectal, stomach, liver, prostate, bladder, pancreas, kidney, lymphoma, and esophageal cancers; for females, they were breast, colorectal, lung, stomach, thyroid, liver, ovary, pancreas, uterus, and brain cancers. The incidence rates for all cancers combined increased significantly for both males and females from 2002 to 2011 (p < 0.05 for both). Age-standardized mortality rates were 147.04 and 90.62 per 100,000 population for males and females, respectively. The mortality rates have stayed stable during the 10-year period for both males and females (p > 0.05 for both). Our results suggest that cancer incidence and mortality rates in Luwan district of Shanghai vary by age, sex, tumor type. The increasing trends in cancer incidence call for effective prevention and control measures in the district. The significance of cancer registration for disease surveillance and management needs to be further advocated.
