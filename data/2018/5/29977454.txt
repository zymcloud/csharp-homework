Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies, which causes serious financial burden worldwide. This study aims to investigate the potential mechanisms contributing to HCC and identify core biomarkers. The HCC gene expression profile GSE41804 was picked out to analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were carried out using DAVID. We constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to visualize interactions of the DEGs. The survival analysis of these hub genes was conducted to evaluate their potential effects on HCC. In this analysis, 503 DEGs were captured (360 downregulated genes and 143 upregulated genes). Meanwhile, 15 hub genes were identified. GO analysis showed that the DEGs were mainly enriched in oxidative stress, cell cycle, and extracellular structure. KEGG analysis suggested the DEGs were enriched in the absorption, metabolism, and cell cycle pathway. PPI network disclosed that the top3 modules were mainly enriched in cell cycle, oxidative stress, and liver detoxification. In conclusion, our analysis uncovered that the alterations of oxidative stress and cell cycle are two major signatures of HCC. TOP2A, CCNB1, and KIF4A might promote the development of HCC, especially in proliferation and differentiation, which could be novel biomarkers and targets for diagnosis and treatment of HCC.
