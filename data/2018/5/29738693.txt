Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic hepatic disease associated with excessive accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes. As the disease progresses, oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the development of hepatic lipid peroxidation. Cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), a subtype of the cytochrome P450 family, has been shown to be a vital modulator in production of reactive oxygen species. However, the exact role of CYP1A1 in NAFLD is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CYP1A1 on lipid peroxidation in oleic acid (OA)-treated human hepatoma cells (HepG2). We found that the expression of CYP1A1 is elevated in OA-stimulated HepG2 cells. The results of siRNA transfection analysis indicated that CYP1A1-siRNA inhibited the lipid peroxidation in OA-treated HepG2 cells. Additionally, compared with siRNA-transfected and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP)-OA-induced HepG2 cells, overexpression of CYP1A1 by BaP further accelerated the lipid peroxidation in OA-treated HepG2 cells. These observations reveal a regulatory role of CYP1A1 in liver lipid peroxidation and imply CYP1A1 as a potential therapeutic target.
