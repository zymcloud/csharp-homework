While the combination therapy of ribavirin (RBV) and sofosbuvir (SOF) is effective in genotype 2 HCV infection, the predictors of treatment efficacy and posttreatment changes in Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) and liver stiffness (markers of hepatocellular carcinoma), remain unclear. In this study, 302 patients with chronic HCV genotype 2 infection were treated with SOF (400 mg) plus RBV (400-1000 mg; based on body weight) for 12 weeks. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of treatment, as well as measured serum AFP, liver stiffness, and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP, a surrogate marker of steatosis) at baseline and within 48 weeks of treatment completion. The intention-to-treat analysis showed a sustained virological response (SVR) rate of 95.7%. None of the patients discontinued treatment due to side effects. Multivariate analysis identified pretreatment (no treatment with interferon), level of AFP (AFP;
HCV genotype 2; controlled attenuation parameter; liver stiffness; ribavirin; sofosbuvir.
