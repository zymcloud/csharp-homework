Background:a prolonged non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) condition can lead to advanced stages of liver disease and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.Aim:to evaluate analytical, anthropometric and dietary factors associated with the presence of fibrosis as this is the factor that most influences survival and evolution.Methods:seventy-six patients with liver biopsy-diagnosed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were included. Biopsies were scored considering the NASH criteria of Kleiner. Analytical, anthropometric and dietary (survey) parameters were obtained. NAFLD-FS is a non-invasive fibrosis index and was assessed for each patient. Leptin, adiponectin, resistin and TNF-alpha serum levels were determined.Results:fifty-six patients were male (73.7%) and the mean age was 44.5 Â± 11.3 years of age (19-68). Thirty-nine (51.3%) (F1-F2: 84.6%; F3-4: 15.4%) patients had fibrosis in the liver biopsy. Seventeen females (85%) had fibrosis versus 22 males (39%), which was statistically significant by univariate analysis (p Conclusions:gender and HOMA-IR were the only independent factors associated with fibrosis. NAFLD-FS could be considered as an accurate scoring system to rule out advanced fibrosis.
