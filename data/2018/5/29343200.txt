CD31 immunoreactivity has been reported in human nonendothelial tumors of both epithelial and mesenchymal origin. This study examined CD31 immunoreactivity of 347 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal, nonneoplastic, and neoplastic canine tissues. CD31 expression was considered positive if at least 10% of the cell population had membranous reactivity. Labeling with the CD31 antibody (clone JC/70A) was observed in 16 samples of normal organs (liver, kidney, lymph node), 6 of 6 specimens of hepatic nodular hyperplasia, 3 of 3 hepatic regenerative nodules, 1 of 4 anal sac carcinomas, 6 of 6 hemangiosarcomas, 18 of 20 hepatocellular carcinomas, 1 of 6 mammary carcinomas, 3 of 5 plasmacytomas, 18 of 53 renal cell carcinomas, and 1 of 5 cutaneous histiocytomas. CD31 expression did not correlate with case outcome in hepatocellular or renal cell carcinomas. Although distinguishing hemangiosarcoma from other neoplasms is typically straightforward, pathologists should be aware of potential cross-reactivity when relying on CD31 immunohistochemistry for diagnosis, particularly in small biopsy samples or when faced with an epithelioid or poorly differentiated vascular neoplasm.
