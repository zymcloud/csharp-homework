Dysregulation of the neddylation pathway is related to various cancers. However, the specific role of the neddylation pathway in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains largely unclear. In this study, the neddylation pathway in HCC and adjacent noncancerous liver (ANL) tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western blotting, and qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction). The results showed that the entire neddylation pathway, including NEDD8 (the IHC staining of NEDD8 represents the global-protein neddylation), E1 NEDD8-activating enzymes (NAE1 and UBA3), E2 NEDD8-conjugating enzymes (UBE2F and UBE2M), E3 NEDD8-ligases (MDM2, RBX1 and RNF7), and deneddylation enzymes (COPS5, UCHL1 and USP21), was overactivated in HCC. Furthermore, the upregulation of NEDD8 in HCC was correlated with aggressive characteristics and was an independent risk factor for overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with HCC after hepatectomy. The upregulation of NAE1, UBE2M, and UCHL1 in HCC was associated with aggressive characteristics and poor OS and RFS in patients with HCC after hepatectomy. In conclusion, our research reveals that the entire neddylation pathway is overactivated in HCC and associated with clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients with HCC.
