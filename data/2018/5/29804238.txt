Purpose of review:The introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has revolutionized HIV infection management, resulting in improved outcomes and survival for people living with HIV (PLWH). However, as PLWH are living longer and aging, non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs) represent a significant source of morbidity and mortality in the HIV-infected population. Here, we review the epidemiology of NADCs in PLWH.Recent findings:Cancer mortality among PLWH is much higher than that among the general population. Up to 10% of deaths among PLWH have been attributed to NADCs. Furthermore, PLWH have an increased risk for specific NADCs, including lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, head and neck cancers, anal cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma. In the past decade, the incidence rates of AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs) have been decreasing while the incidence rates of NADCs have been increasing. In particular, the incidence of specific NADCs are changing at different rates. For example through 2010, the incidence rates for anal, liver, and prostate cancers among PLWH had increased, while incidence rates for lung cancer had decreased and incidence rates for colorectal cancer remained relatively stable over time. However, as early ART becomes more prevalent and the percentage of PLWH over 50 increases, these trends may evolve further. Incidence of NADCs should be expected to increase further as the PLWH population continues to age. Screening and prevention for these cancers among the HIV-infected population should be emphasized.
