In this study, preoperative serum levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) were determined in 216 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who underwent hepatic resection to investigate a possible contribution of IGF-1 to the increased risk for HCC recurrence and mortality. During January 2010 and December 2013, 216 HCC patients receiving hepatectomy were recruited. The primary endpoint was the HCC recurrences within the 3-year follow-up. The secondary endpoint was all-cause mortality. The multivariate analyses with Cox regression model were applied to explore the clinical significance of IGF-1 serum levels and associated parameters on death and recurrence of HCC patients. The IGF-1 levels of included patients were determined, with a median value of 75.5 ng/mL (IQR, 40.3-93.0 ng/mL). The preoperative serum level of IGF-1 was negatively correlated with tumor size, Child-Pugh class, or tumor stage (P
