Background:Endoscopic surgery has been successfully applied in treatment of degenerative spinal disease, but few studies have assessed its use in treating sacral metastasis. We report a successful full endoscopic interlaminar approach for sacral nerve root decompression of a sacral metastatic tumor.Case description:An 80-year-old man with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma presented with buttock pain with radiation to the right lower leg for 1 week. There was also decreased muscle power of the right lower extremity. Lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging revealed metastasis of the sacral spine and right iliac bone with S1 exiting nerve root compression. S1 nerve root decompression via a full endoscopic interlaminar approach under local anesthesia was performed. Under fluorescence guidance, a working sleeve with a beveled opening was placed in the interlaminar space of L5-S1. We entered the sacral canal and identified the S1 exiting nerve root. A laminotomy was performed from the internal edge of the right sacral laminae toward the lateral recess. During decompression of the nerve root, buttock and leg pain improved gradually. There was almost complete resolution of leg pain after surgery, and the patient recovered the ability to walk. Visual analog scale score for pain decreased from 8 to 2 after 3 months of follow-up.Conclusions:For patients with sacral metastasis without spinal instability or difficulty lying in prone position under local anesthesia, the full endoscopic interlaminar approach for nerve root decompression of sacral metastasis may be a suitable method.
