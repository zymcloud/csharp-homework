The patient was a 50-year-old female with an initial diagnosis of a single hepatocellular carcinoma in liver cirrhosis. The tumor was located in the posterior liver segment (S7) and measured 5 cm with a rapid growth rate and portal invasion. The pre-treatment Child-Pugh (C-P) was grade A (six points). The total prescribed dose of carbon-ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) was 60 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) given in 4 fractions. Thereafter, tumor shrinkage and rapid decrease of the serum alpha-fetoprotein level were observed. At 1-year follow-up a new lesion was diagnosed in the left lobe and the underlying liver failure had worsened to C-P grade B (eight points). Thus, she was recommended to undergo living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT). The postoperative course was uneventful. At pathological examination, no viable tumor cells in the region treated with C-ion RT were detected. At the time of the last follow-up, the patient was in overall good general condition with no signs of tumor recurrence.
