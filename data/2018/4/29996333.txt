Portal hypertension refers to a series of clinical manifestations caused by elevated pressure of the portal vein system, which can cause portal hypertension by causing portal venous obstruction and / or increased blood flow. A typical clinical manifestation in patients with decompensated cirrhosis is portal hypertension. A severe complication of portal hypertension is esophagogastric varices bleeding, refractory ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. The effective reduction of portal pressure can reduce the incidence of complications, improve the prognosis and reduce the mortality. At present, the commonly used clinical methods for reducing portal hypertension include drug therapy, minimally invasive interventions, surgical treatment, and liver transplantation. This article reviews the current status of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine for portal hypertension.
