Background:Age-associated conditions are increasingly common among persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH). A longitudinal investigation of their accrual is needed given their implications on clinical care complexity. We examined trends in the co-occurrence of age-associated conditions among PLWH receiving clinical care, and differences in their prevalence by demographic subgroup.Methods:This cohort study was nested within the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design. Participants from HIV outpatient clinics were antiretroviral therapy-exposed PLWH receiving clinical care (ie, ≥1 CD4 count) in the United States during 2000-2009. Multimorbidity was irreversible, defined as having ≥2: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, hypercholesterolemia, end-stage liver disease, or non-AIDS-related cancer. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing demographic subgroups were obtained by Poisson regression with robust error variance, using generalized estimating equations for repeated measures.Results:Among 22969 adults, 79% were male, 36% were black, and the median baseline age was 40 years (interquartile range, 34-46 years). Between 2000 and 2009, multimorbidity prevalence increased from 8.2% to 22.4% (Ptrend < .001). Adjusting for age, this trend was still significant (P < .001). There was no difference by sex, but blacks were less likely than whites to have multimorbidity (aPR, 0.87; 95% CI, .77-.99). Multimorbidity was the highest among heterosexuals, relative to men who have sex with men (aPR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01-1.34). Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia most commonly co-occurred.Conclusions:Multimorbidity prevalence has increased among PLWH. Comorbidity prevention and multisubspecialty management of increasingly complex healthcare needs will be vital to ensuring that they receive needed care.
