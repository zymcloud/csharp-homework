An increasing amount of evidence indicates that the inhibition of β adrenergic signaling can result in the inhibition of tumor growth. However, the role of propranolol in liver cancer and the underlying mechanism remain to be elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the role of propranolol in liver cancer cell lines and provide evidence for further clinical study. Propranolol was added at different concentrations to HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 liver cancer cells and HL‑7702 normal human liver cells. The proliferation of the cell lines was monitored by live‑cell imaging at a range of time intervals. Immunofluorescence using DAPI and Hoechst 33342/propidium iodide (PI) staining, Annexin V‑FITC/PI double‑staining flow cytometry, western blotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to investigate the effect of propranolol on liver cancer cell apoptosis. The proliferation of HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells was inhibited by 40 and 80 µmol/l propranolol. However, the proliferation of HL‑7702 cells was not affected by
