Background and objectives:Recent studies have suggested that sidedness of origin from colorectal adenocarcinomas is a predictor of survival, however the impact of this factor in patients with resected colon cancer liver metastases (CLM) is not clear. So, in this study, we compared clinic and pathologic characteristics and long-term survival of patients with resected CLM according to the primary tumor location.Methods:This is a retrospective analyzes of a prospective database. Patients with resected CLM from 1998 to 2012 were included. Right colon included tumors from cecum to middle transverse colon, and left colon included tumors from splenic flexure to sigmoid.Results:One hundred fifty-one patients were included, 27 right colon and 124 left colon. In the latter group, there were more patients with synchronous disease (67.7 × 6.2%, P = 0.026) and a higher CEA (22.0 × 11.7 ng/mL, P = 0.001). However, K-Ras mutation was more frequent in right sided tumors (75.0 × 24.1%, P = 0.001). There was no difference in long term survival in both groups in this series even when adjusted for the confounding variables.Conclusion:Sidedness do not seem to be a predictor of long term survival in patients with resected colon cancer liver metastases.
