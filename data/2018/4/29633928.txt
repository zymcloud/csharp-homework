Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma is a rare primary malignant liver neoplasm. Benefits from liver transplant for patients with fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma have not yet been reported. Here, we report a 19-year-old female patient who presented with abdominal pain. A computed tomography scan revealed bilobar and multiple solid lesions with the largest measuring 15 cm in diameter on the right lobe of her liver. Her blood alpha-fetoprotein level and viral hepatitis markers were normal. A fine-needle biopsy of the largest lesion detected fibrolamellar heptocellular carcinoma. Because no distant metastasis was evident and the carcinoma was unresectable, a right lobe living-donor liver transplant with hilar lymph node dissection was performed. A pathology report revealed poorly differentiated fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma, and further testing indicated microvascular invasion and hilar lymph node metastasis. The largest tumor measured 12 cm. She was discharged on postoperative day 14. During postoperative month 22, multiple vertebral metastases were detected, and she died with diffuse metastasis during postoperative month 26. Our patient, with poor prognostic criteria such as hilar lymph node metastasis, microvascular invasion, and poor differentiation, had 22 months of tumor-free survival and 26 months of overall survival after having undergone living-donor liver transplant.
