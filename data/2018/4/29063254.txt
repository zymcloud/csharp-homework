Objectives:To evaluate the image quality and lesion conspicuity of virtual-monochromatic-imaging (VMI) with dual-layer DECT (DL-DECT) for reduced-iodine-load multiphasic-hepatic CT.Methods:Forty-five adults with renal dysfunction who had undergone hepatic DL-DECT with 300-mgI/kg were included. VMI (40-70-keV, DL-DECT-VMI) was generated at each enhancement phase. As controls, 45 matched patients undergoing standard 120-kVp protocol (120-kVp, 600-mgI/kg, and iterative reconstruction) were included. We compared the size-specific dose estimate (SSDE), image noise, CT attenuation, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between protocols. Two radiologists scored the image quality and lesion conspicuity.Results:SSDE was significantly lower in DL-DECT group (p Conclusions:For multiphasic-hepatic CT with 50% iodine-load, DL-DECT-VMI at 40- to 55-keV provides equivalent or better image quality and lesion conspicuity without increasing radiation dose compared with standard 120-kVp protocol.Key points:• 40-55-keV yields optimal image quality for half-iodine-load multiphasic-hepatic CT with DL-DECT. • DL-DECT protocol decreases radiation exposure compared with 120-kVp scans with iterative reconstruction. • 40-keV images maximise conspicuity of hepatocellular carcinoma especially at hepatic-arterial phase.
