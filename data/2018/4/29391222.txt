Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) increases the risk of various liver injuries, ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis and cirrhosis, and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ample evidence has suggested that aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is functionally involved in the activation of cellular stress, inflammation and fibrogenesis in hepatic cells, including hepatocytes, Kupffer and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), at different pathological stages of NAFLD and liver fibrosis. Here, we overview recent findings on the potential role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, including lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, metabolic inflammation and fibrogenesis. We critically assess the literatures on both human subjects and animal models of NAFLD and liver fibrosis with miRNA dysregulation and their mechanisms of actions in liver damage. We further highlight the potential use of miRNA mimics or antimiRNAs as therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD and liver fibrosis.
