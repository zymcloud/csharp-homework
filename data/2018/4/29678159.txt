Background:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma(sHCC) who were ineligible for surgery or ablation therapies.Methods:From March 2011 to December 2012, 28 cases with sHCC which were ineligible or refused surgical resection, transplantation or local ablation were treated with CyberKnife SBRT. Median size of tumors was 2.1 cm (range:1.1-3.0 cm), a dose of 10-15Gy per faction was given over 3-6 consecutive days, resulting in a total dose of 35-60Gy.Results:The median follow-up period was 36 months, with the response rate of complete response (CR) in 17 cases, partial response (PR) in 8 cases, stable disease (SD) in 2 cases and progressive disease (PD) in one case. Overall response rate was 89.28%. Overall survival rates in 1, 2 and 3 years were 92.86, 85.71 and 78.57%, respectively. Local control rates in 1, 2 and 3 years were 96.43, 92.86 and 89.28%, respectively. No grade â‰¥ 3 hepatic toxicity was observed.Conclusion:CyberKnife treatment was a safe and effective option for sHCC, which had shown good local control, high overall survival rates and low toxicity. CyberKnife SBRT could be served as an alternative treatment for patients with sHCC which is unsuitable for surgical treatment or local ablation.
