BACKGROUND The objective of this study was to explore the role of SIX1 in paclitaxel (TAX) resistance of HepG2 cells via reactive oxygen species (ROS) and autophagy pathway. MATERIAL AND METHODS Hepatoma cell line HepG2 was treated with SIX1 knockdown or/and TAX. Cell growth was detected by MTT assay and colony formation assay. Cell apoptosis was evaluated with flow cytometry. ROS levels were detected using flow cytometry (stained with DCFH2-DA). Western blot was conducted to detect the expression of SIX1 and autophagy-related proteins. RESULTS TAX suppressed the proliferation of HepG2 cells in a time/dose-dependent manner, and upregulated the expression of SIX1. SIX1 siRNA increased TAX sensitivity of HepG2 cells and upregulated cell ROS levels. SIX1 siRNA combined with TAX treatment activated autophagy of HepG2 cells. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) partially attenuated SIX1 siRNA-induced ROS level increases, and autophagy inhibitor 3-MA notably enhanced SIX1 siRNA-induced cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS Knockdown of SIX1 increased cell ROS levels and autophagy, promoted cell apoptosis, and enhanced TAX sensitivity of HepG2 cells.
