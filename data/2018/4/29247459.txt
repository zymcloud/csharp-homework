For the purpose of providing new insights for high-efficiency radiochemotherapy of hepatoma, a radioimmunotherapy and chemotherapy combinatorial therapy albumin nanospheres 131 I-antiAFPMcAb-DOX-BSA-NPs was designed and prepared. It was obtained in a high radiolabeling yield approximately 65% with the radiochemical purity of over 98%. The transmission electron microscope showed that the nanospheres obtained in good monodispersion with a diameter of approximately 230 nm. The doxorubicin (DOX) loading capacity of the DOX-BSA-NPs nanoparticles was determined to be approximately 180 μg/mg and 95.79 ± 3.89%. DOX was released gradually in 6 days. In vivo tumor-growth inhibition experiments showed that after treating with 131 I-antiAFPMcAb-DOX-BSA-NPs for 14 days, the tumor volume decreased more obvious than that of other 2 time points and the control groups. All the results indicated that the radiolabeled immune albumin nanospheres 131 I-antiAFPMcAb-DOX-BSA-NPs could significantly inhibit the hepatoma tumor growth with the strategy of combinatorial radioimmunotherapy and chemotherapy.
