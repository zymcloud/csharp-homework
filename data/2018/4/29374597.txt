Ghrelin (GHRL) has important implications for liver disease. It has anti-inflammatory effects, regulates cell proliferation, modulates the fibrogenic response and protects liver tissue. Genetic variations in the GHRL gene may play a crucial role in the development of chronic hepatitis (CH), liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, we examined the association of GHRL gene polymorphisms (rs26312 and rs27647), and its serum level to virologic responses to combined sofosbuvir and Simeprevir therapy for a course of 12 successive weeks in Egyptian chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients.Methods:Human genomic and clinical data were collected from 100 Egyptian participants in this study, 90 HCV patients who received sofosbuvir and Simeprevir and 10 non-HCV healthy subjects. Genotyping of GHRL rs26312 and rs27647, were determined with the TaqMan qRT-PCR allele detection assay. The serum GHRL concentrations were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Results:GHRL polymorphisms (rs26312 and rs27647) genotype distributions and allele frequencies did not differ between HCV patients and normal healthy subjects or between patient groups when compared according to the therapeutic response. In addition, we found significant lower serum GHRL levels in CHC patients compared with the healthy controls. However, there was no significant association of the GHRL rs26312 and rs27647 polymorphisms with GHRL levels in CHC patients. We conclude that GHRL SNPs (rs26312 and rs27647) do not affect response to combined sofosbuvir and Simeprevir treatment in chronic Egyptian HCV patients.
