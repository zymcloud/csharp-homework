The high heterogeneity of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) complicates stratification of HCC patients for treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a comprehensive panel of HCC biomarkers related to tumour behaviour and cancer prognosis. Resected HCCs from 251 patients were stained for hepatic progenitor cell (HPC) markers epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), delta-like 1 homolog (DLK1), and cytokeratin 19 (CK19). Staining patterns were analysed for their prognostic association with relapse-free survival and overall survival. α-Fetoprotein (AFP), lectin-reactive α-fetoprotein (AFP-L3), and des-γ-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) were assessed as indicators of HPC protein expression. Expression pattern of HPC markers correlated with tumour malignancy indicated by high AFP/AFP-L3 serum levels, more frequent vascular invasion, and poorer tumour differentiation. EpCAM expression, DCP ≥300 mAU/ml, age ≥60, and Child-Pugh score grade B or C were independent prognostic factors of poor outcome and were used in a new scoring system for HCC prognosis after operation. Expression of two or more HPC markers was a significant predictor of poor HCC outcome and serum levels of AFP/AFP-L3 correlated with the expression of HPC proteins. Our study paved the way for further elucidation of the association among HPC markers, serum tumour markers, and HCC clinical outcome for precision medicine.
