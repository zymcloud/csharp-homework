Natural killer (NK) cell-mediated tumor cell eradication could inhibit tumor initiation and progression. However, the factors that regulate NK cell-mediated cancer cell eradication remain unclear. We determined that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells exhibit transcriptional down-regulation of NK group 2D (NKG2D) ligands and are largely resistant to NK cell-mediated eradication. Because the down-regulation of NKG2D ligands occurred at the transcriptional level, we tested 32 chemical inhibitors of epigenetic regulators for their ability to re-express NKG2D ligands and enhance HCC cell eradication by NK cells and found that Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) was a transcriptional repressor of NKG2D ligands. The inhibition of EZH2 by small-molecule inhibitors or genetic means enhanced HCC cell eradication by NK cells in a NKG2D ligand-dependent manner. Collectively, these results demonstrate that EZH2 inhibition enhances HCC eradication by NK cells and that EZH2 functions, in part, as an oncogene by inhibiting immune response.
