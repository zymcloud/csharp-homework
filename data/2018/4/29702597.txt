Corosolic acid is one of the pentacyclic triterpenoids isolated from Lagerstroemia speciose and has been reported to exhibit anti-cancer and anti-proliferative activities in various cancer cells. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of corosolic acid in cancer cell death. Corosolic acid induces a decrease of cell viability and an increase of cell cytotoxicity in human renal carcinoma Caki cells. Corosolic acid-induced cell death is not inhibited by apoptosis inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor), necroptosis inhibitor (necrostatin-1), or ferroptosis inhibitors (ferrostatin-1 and deferoxamine (DFO)). Furthermore, corosolic acid significantly induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, but antioxidants (N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and trolox) do not inhibit corosolic acid-induced cell death. Interestingly, corosolic acid induces lipid oxidation, and &alpha;-tocopherol markedly prevents corosolic acid-induced lipid peroxidation and cell death. Anti-chemotherapeutic effects of &alpha;-tocopherol are dependent on inhibition of lipid oxidation rather than inhibition of ROS production. In addition, corosolic acid induces non-apoptotic cell death in other renal cancer (ACHN and A498), breast cancer (MDA-MB231), and hepatocellular carcinoma (SK-Hep1 and Huh7) cells, and &alpha;-tocopherol markedly inhibits corosolic acid-induced cell death. Therefore, our results suggest that corosolic acid induces non-apoptotic cell death in cancer cells through the increase of lipid peroxidation.
