Purpose:To test the hypothesis that same-day discharge of selected transarterial chemoembolization patients would not increase 30-day readmission rate compared with overnight observation.Materials and methods:With institutional review board approval, 193 hepatocellular carcinoma patients who underwent transarterial chemoembolization from July 2013 to June 2016 were reviewed. Treatment was conventional/lipiodol transarterial chemoembolization with 50 mg doxorubicin/10 mg mitomycin-c/particles or drug-eluting embolics transarterial chemoembolization with 50-75 mg doxorubicin/vial. At 3 hours, patients tolerating oral intake and not requiring intravenous analgesics were considered for discharge. The primary outcome measure was 30-day readmission for observation versus discharge using chi-squared (χ2) analysis. The secondary aim was to identify baseline or treatment variables independently associated with readmission, including Child-Pugh class, medically managed encephalopathy or ascites, patient age (<65 vs ≥65), tumor number (1 or >1), and level of embolization (segmental vs lobar).Results:Patients underwent 261 transarterial chemoembolization procedures. The 30-day readmission rate was not significantly different between observed patients (n = 179, 9.0%) and discharged patients (n = 82, 13.8%; P = .33). Readmission was not related to the selected agent (conventional/lipiodol-transarterial chemoembolization, 11.0% vs drug-eluting embolics transarterial chemoembolization, 7.5%; P = .36). Baseline variables associated with readmission were Child-Pugh B/C (χ2 = 7.9, P 1), and level of embolization (segmental vs lobar) were not predictive of readmission (all P > .05).Conclusions:Same-day discharge after transarterial chemoembolization does not increase the risk of 30-day readmission. Child-Pugh B/C patients, as well as those with ascites or encephalopathy, have the highest risk of readmission.
