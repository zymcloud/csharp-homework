Background:Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is known to provide potential biomarkers for predicting clinical outcome, but its value in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has not been fully evaluated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical applicability of quantitative analysis of multiplex KRAS mutations in cell-free DNA from patients with PDAC.Methods:A total of 106 patients with PDAC were enrolled in this prospective study. The concentration and fraction of KRAS mutations were determined through multiplex detection of KRAS mutations in plasma samples by use of a droplet digital PCR kit (Bio-Rad).Results:KRAS mutations were detected in 96.1% of tissue samples. Eighty patients (80.5%) harbored KRAS mutations in cfDNA, with a median KRAS mutation concentration of 0.165 copies/Î¼L and a median fractional abundance of 0.415%. Multivariable analyses demonstrated that the KRAS mutation concentration [hazard ratio (HR), 2.08; 95% CI, 1.20-3.63] and KRAS fraction (HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.02-2.95) were significant factors for progression-free survival. KRAS mutation concentration (HR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.05-3.67) also had prognostic implications for overall survival. Subgroup analyses showed that KRAS mutation concentration and fractional abundance significantly affected progression-free survival in resectable PDAC (P = 0.016). Moreover, when combined with the cancer biomarker CA19-9, the KRAS mutation concentration in cfDNA showed additive benefits for the prediction of overall survival.Conclusions:This study demonstrates that multiplex detection of KRAS mutations in plasma cfDNA is clinically relevant, providing a potential candidate biomarker for prognosis of PDAC.
