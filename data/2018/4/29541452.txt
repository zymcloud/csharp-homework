Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most common and fatal cancers. It is a multistage and multifactorial carcinoma, in which a number of factors serve roles in its initiation and progression. Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), considered to serve a role in various cancers, have recently been identified to have significant contributions to HCC tumorigenesis. Recent studies suggest that snoRNAs have a critical role in the pathogenesis of HCC. Moreover, detailed studies have demonstrated that various snoRNAs are involved in a range of biological processes associated with HCC, including initiation, proliferation, tumor growth, the cell cycle, apoptosis and metastasis. In the present review, an overview of recent studies to date has been provided, focusing on the association of snoRNAs with HCC. Based on the findings, further studies focusing on the association of snoRNAs with HCC are required to verify the diagnostic and therapeutic capacities of snoRNAs in HCC.
