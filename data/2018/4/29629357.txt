Clinical outcomes of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) have not been established in terms of HCC recurrence and MM deterioration after LDLT. A 51-year-old man with chronic hepatitis B was diagnosed with HCC and MM. Since the patient also had decompensated liver cirrhosis (LC), he underwent LDLT prior to autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) to prevent fulminant hepatitis due to HBV reactivation. The patient received Epstein-Barr virus prophylaxis and a triple immunosuppressive regimen of tacrolimus, everolimus, and steroid after LDLT. Autologous PBSCT was performed 7 months after LDLT. He showed a complete response to treatment of MM without post-LT complications or HCC recurrence. In conclusion, LDLT could be adapted for treatment of MM patients with combined HCC and decompensated LC because it is an effective strategy of preventing HBV reactivation and HCC recurrence after induction therapy of MM.
