Background:There is no consensus about remnant liver regeneration associated with middle hepatic vein (MHV) resecting.Methods:Seventy-five patients who underwent hemihepatectomy were retrospectively analysed with respect to remnant liver regeneration. The liver remnant volume (LRV) and each sectional volume were postoperatively measured with multidetector computed tomography at day 7 and months 1, 2, 5, and 12 after the operation.Results:In right hemihepatectomy cases, the regeneration rate of LRV in the MHV preservation group was significantly higher than that of the MHV resection group at months 5 and 12. In particular, the regeneration rate of remnant segment IV peaked at day 7 and was shrunk after 1 month, and was significant higher in the MHV preservation group. In left hemihepatectomy cases, the regeneration rate of LRV at month 12 was significantly higher in the MHV preservation group. The regeneration rate of the remnant anterior section peaked at 1 month and was shrunk.Conclusion:In this study, the MHV should be preserved or reconstructed whenever possible during hepatic hemihepatectomy. Hepatic regeneration in the MHV perfusion region becomes poor within 7 days to 1 month after surgery (UMIN000023714).
