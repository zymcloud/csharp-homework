Purpose:To address the feasibility of infusion of yttrium-90 (90Y) glass microspheres directly through the right inferior phrenic artery (RIPA).Materials and methods:From November 2015 to May 2017, 20 patients underwent 90Y radioembolization through the RIPA. When the systemic-to-pulmonary shunt was demonstrated on C-arm computed tomography (CT) of the RIPA, prophylactic embolization by polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles was performed prior to infusion of 90Y glass microspheres. Follow-up CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for pulmonary complications. Tumor response was determined by the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.Results:Nine (45%) patients had systemic-to-pulmonary shunts on C-arm CT images of the RIPA. The feeder of the systemic-to-pulmonary shunt was the azygoesophageal branch (n = 7) and the anterior branch (n = 2). The mean activity of 90Y glass microspheres infused into the RIPA was 0.49 GBq (range, 0.19-1.55 GBq). No patient had symptomatic radiation pneumonitis or cutaneous complications during follow-up. Seven patients had focal atelectasis (n = 5), focal ground-glass opacity (n = 2), and/or a small amount of pleural effusion (n = 2) on follow-up image. Best tumor response fed by the RIPA was complete response (n = 4), partial response (n = 9), stable disease (n = 2), progressive disease (n = 4), and unevaluable (n = 1).Conclusion:The administration of 90Y glass microspheres through the RIPA may be safe after embolization of a systemic-to-pulmonary shunt identified on C-arm CT.
