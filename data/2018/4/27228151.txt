The simultaneous occurrence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm and liver cirrhosis needing surgical treatment is extremely rare. There is still controversy regarding the timing of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and liver transplantation and regarding optimal treatment of the aneurysm. Here, we describe a 70-year-old white male patient who presented with end-stage liver disease secondary to chronic hepatitis C with a solitary hepatocellular carcinoma measuring 5.5 cm in diameter in the right liver lobe. A pretransplant work-up resulted in discovery of a 6.7-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm. The decision was made to perform orthotopic liver transplantation with simultaneous aneurysm repair. The patient was initially explored through a median laparotomy. The liver transplant was performed first with the graft prepared on the back table using a standard procedure. The liver graft was transplanted using a "piggy-back" technique with end-to-side caval and end-to-end portal vein anastomosis. The arterial anastomosis was performed with an end-to-end anastomosis between the donor's proper hepatic artery and the recipient's common hepatic artery. The bile duct anastomosis was performed with an end-to-end anastomosis. A midline incision was extended to the pubis. After proximal and distal vascular control of the infrarenal aorta, resection of the abdominal aortic aneurysm was performed followed by reconstruction with an InterVascular 22-mm prosthesis using 3.0 Prolene in a running fashion. Eight days after surgery, the patient was discharged and remained well during the 2-year follow-up. Although rare, in a patient with end-stage liver disease and abdominal aortic aneurysm, a simultaneous liver transplantation and aneurysm repair procedure represents the safest treatment solution.
