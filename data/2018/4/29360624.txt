Background:Dietary factors, tobacco, and alcohol use have been identified as important factors of rising various cancer incidence in several northeastern states of India. However, little is known about the factors associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in this region. The aim of the paper was to identify the factors associated with HCC in the northeast region.Methods:A case-control study was conducted in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim, two northeastern states of India, including 104 histologically-confirmed cases of HCC and same number (104) of age and sex matched control enrolled. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors associated with HCC.Results:A statistically significant association was demonstrated between HCC and alcohol consumption, consumption of 'Sai-mod' (OR 2.77, CI 1.57-4.87) a homemade alcohol beverage, and with HBV (OR 7.97, CI 3.36-18.94). Positive synergism index (S = 3.04) was observed between HBV and alcohol consumption to risk of HCC. Higher intake of processed meat (OR 2.56, CI 1.09-6.03) and processed fish (OR 2.24, CI 1.02-4.95) were found associated with increased risk of HCC; and decreased risk of HCC with fresh fish, fruits, and milk.Conclusions:Strong relationship between different dietary factors, alcohol beverage with HCC suggests that control on dietary and drinking habit will be an important strategy to combat HCC in this region. Risk factors identified in this study will help to plan more effectively targeted risk reduction strategies and programs in this region.
