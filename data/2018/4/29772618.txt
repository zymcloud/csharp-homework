The patient was an 88-year-old male. He was referred to the Department of Internal Medicine because of total body itching and jaundice in July 2011. The serum bilirubin level was elevated, and the serum CA19-9 level was also elevated to 266. 6 U/ml. Computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed a solid tumor between the hepatic hilus and common bile duct, and choler cytodiagnosis was class V ; adenocarcinoma. The patient was diagnosed with hilar cholangiocarcinoma and received conservative treatment with endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) due to his advanced age. The patient was then referred to our department because CT revealed right hydronephrosis and thickening of the right side of the bladder wall, which had not been detected on admission in October 2011. Cystoscopy revealed a broad-based edematous tumor on the right side of the bladder. Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) was performed. The histological diagnosis was moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. Immunohistostaining using CA19-9 was performed, and cancer cells were positive. The final histology led to a diagnosis of metastasis of cholangiocarcinoma to the bladder. The patient died of liver failure in March 2012.
