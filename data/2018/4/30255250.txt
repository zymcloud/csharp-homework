Objectives:To validate new diagnostic criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging (Gd-EOB-MRI) using hypointensity on the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) as an alternative to washout in combination with ancillary features.Methods:This retrospective study included 288 patients at high risk for HCC with 387 nodules (HCCs, n=292; non-HCCs, n=95) showing arterial phase hyper-enhancement (APHE) ≥1 cm on Gd-EOB-MRI. Imaging diagnoses of HCCs were made using different criteria: APHE plus hypointensity on the portal venous phase (PVP) (criterion 1), APHE plus hypointensity on the PVP and/or transitional phase (TP) (criterion 2), APHE plus hypointensity on the PVP and/or TP and/or HBP (criterion 3), and criterion 3 plus non-LR-1/2/M according to the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) v2017 considering ancillary features (criterion 4). Sensitivities and specificities of those criteria were compared using McNemar's test.Results:Among diagnostic criteria for HCCs, criteria 3 and 4 showed significantly higher sensitivities (93.8% and 92.5%, respectively) than criteria 1 and 2 (70.9% and 86.6%, respectively) (p values 0.999) and significantly lower than criterion 1 (97.9%, p=0.002).Conclusions:In the non-invasive diagnosis of HCCs on Gd-EOB-MRI, HBP hypointensity may be used as an alternative to washout enabling a highly sensitive diagnosis with little loss in specificity if it is used after excluding nodules considered to be benignities or non-HCC malignancies based on characteristic imaging features.Key points:• Gd-EOB-MRI enhancement and ancillary features can be used to diagnose HCC. • Exclusion of LR-1/2/M improves specificity when HBP hypointensity is used.
