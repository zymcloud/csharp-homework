Background:Leptin (LEP) and LEP receptor (LEPR) polymorphisms may be associated with the development of cancer.Methods:In this study, we selected five functional LEP and LEPR single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and conducted a case-control study to determine the relationship of LEP and LEPR polymorphisms with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in Eastern Chinese Han population. There were 584 HCC cases and 923 cancer-free controls included in our study. HCC patients and controls were fully matched by age and sex. SNPscanâ„¢ genotyping method was used to analyze the genotyping of LEP rs2167270 G>A, rs7799039 A>G, LEPR rs6588147 G>A, rs1137100 G>A, and rs1137101 G>A SNPs.Results:We found that LEP rs7799039 A>G and rs2167270 G>A polymorphisms were associated with the susceptibility of HCC in this population (LEP rs7799039 A>G: GG vs AA: adjusted odds ratio [OR]=2.03, 95% CI, 1.22-3.38, P=0.006 and GG vs AA/AG: adjusted OR=1.97, 95% CI, 1.20-3.22, P=0.007; rs2167270 G>A: AA vs GG: adjusted OR=2.03, 95% CI, 1.10-3.75, P=0.024 and AA vs GG/GA: adjusted OR=2.01, 95% CI, 1.10-3.68, P=0.023). However, LEPR rs6588147 G>A polymorphism decreased the risk of HCC (GA vs GG: adjusted OR=0.62, 95% CI, 0.45-0.86, P=0.005 and AA/GA vs GG: adjusted OR=0.64, 95% CI, 0.47-0.88, P=0.007).Conclusion:This case-control study highlights that LEP rs7799039 A>G and rs2167270 G>A polymorphisms increase the susceptibility to HCC; however, LEPR rs6588147 G>A polymorphism may be a protective factor for HCC in Eastern Chinese Han population.
