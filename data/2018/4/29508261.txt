Recent advances in highly conformal radiotherapies greatly extend the indications for radiotherapy of liver tumors. However, because of poor tolerance to hepatic radiation, estimation of the intensity of irradiation of the liver is important, particularly for a cirrhotic liver. Knowledge of radiation-induced hepatitis is important for understanding how to optimize hepatic radiation therapy. Pathological changes of the irradiated liver, which include perivenular fibrosis, sinusoidal obstruction, and damage to Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, can be visualized using clinical imaging techniques. This review article discusses and illustrates the pathological and radiological changes of hepatic tumors and the surrounding parenchyma of the irradiated liver.
