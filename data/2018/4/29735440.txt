Objective:To investigate the effect of chloroquine in inducing apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and explore the possible mechanism.Methods:MTT assay and flow cytometry were used to evaluate chloroquine-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells, respectively. The ATP levels in chloroquine-treated cells were detected using an ATP assay kit. PCR and Western blotting were used to detect the expression levels of miR-26b and Mcl-1 in the cells, respectively.Results:Chloroquine inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Treatments with 80 µmol/L chloroquine for 24, 48, and 72 h induced survival rates of (71.59∓0.2)%, (45.40∓0.5)%, and (26.34∓1.4)% in the cells. Treatments with chloroquine at 40, 80, and 160 µmol/L for 5 h resulted in obviously lowered intracellular ATP levels in the cells to 87.80%, 71.29%, and 38.02% of the control level, respectively. At 80 µmol/L, chloroquine significantly increased the expression of miR-26b and down-regulated the expression of Mcl-1 in HepG2 cells, and the application of the miR-26b inhibitor increased the cellular expression of Mcl-1.Conclusion:s Chloroquine can inhibit the cell proliferation, reduce ATP level and induce apoptosis in HepG2 cells possibly through miR-26b-mediated regulation of Mcl-1.
