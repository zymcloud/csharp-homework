Patients with HCV infection can develop decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), even liver failure. As a result, efficient antiviral treatment is very essential to prevent HCV-related disease progression. Newly developed direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) have shown safety profile, favorable tolerability, and relatively short duration, which provide an opportunity to expand the number of patients who can be treated for HCV infection. There is a need for further clinical observation and summaries for DAAs in a real world. In the era of DAAs, special patients with HCV infection still get lots of attention from doctors. This review aims at the application of DAAs in patients with HCV infection, combined with chronic kidney diseases, hepatocellular carcinoma, HBV/HCV co-infection, HIV/HCV co-infection, post liver transplantation, pregnancy, children, lymphoma and retreatment.
