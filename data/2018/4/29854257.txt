Cancer stage information is important for clinical research. However, they are not always explicitly noted in electronic medical records. In this paper, we present our work on automatic classification of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stages from free-text clinical and radiology notes. To accomplish this, we defined 11 stage parameters used in the three HCC staging systems, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC), and Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP). After aggregating stage parameters to the patient-level, the final stage classifications were achieved using an expert-created decision logic. Each stage parameter relevant for staging was extracted using several classification methods, e.g. sentence classification and automatic information structuring, to identify and normalize text as cancer stage parameter values. Stage parameter extraction for the test set performed at 0.81 F1. Cancer stage prediction for AJCC, BCLC, and CLIP stage classifications were 0.55, 0.50, and 0.43 F1.
