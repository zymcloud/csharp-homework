Purpose:To determine the necessity of preprocedural biliary drainage prior to chemoembolisation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with bile duct invasion.Materials and methods:The study included 52 patients who received chemoembolisation for unresectable HCC invading bile duct and causing hyperbilirubinemia (>3 mg/dL). Patients were divided into three groups according to biliary drainage and its effect: effective drainage (n=21), ineffective drainage (n=17), and non-drainage (n=14). Thirty-day mortality, length of hospitalisation, adverse events recorded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), survival, and tumour response was compared among three groups.Results:Thirty-day mortality rates were 14.3% (n=3), 17.6% (n=3), and 7.1% (n=1) for effective, ineffective, and non-drainage groups, respectively, and did not differ significantly among groups (p=0.780). The mean length of hospitalisation was shorter in non-drainage group compared to ineffective drainage group (12.1±11.4 vs 34.1±29.6 days, p=0.012). Mean differences in CTCAE grade for laboratory parameters before and after chemoembolisation were not significantly different among three groups. Survival among three groups was not significantly different (p=0.239-0.825). The tumour response was also not significantly different among three groups (p=0.679).Conclusion:Biliary drainage may not be mandatory prior to chemoembolisation in patients with HCC invading the bile duct.Key points:• Chemoembolisation without biliary drainage can be performed for icteric HCC. • Chemoembolisation without biliary drainage is not accompanied by increased adverse events. • Preprocedural biliary drainage may not be mandatory for chemoembolisation for icteric HCC.
