The 1981 Lancet paper by Beasley et al., "Hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatitis B virus. A prospective study of 22707 men in Taiwan" is a seminal publication that clearly demonstrated that chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), as measured by seropositivity for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), preceded the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In doing so, this study paved the way for liver cancer prevention efforts through the implementation of hepatitis B vaccination programs. In this commentary, we will describe the discovery of HBV, which led to the study by Beasley et al.; summarize the major findings of the Beasley paper and its implications; discuss the importance of well-designed cohort studies for prevention activities; and consider the ramifications of the Beasley study and the work that has followed since.
