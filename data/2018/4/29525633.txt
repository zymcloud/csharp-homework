Objective:To investigate the correlation between the expression of PD-L1 and HIF-1α in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue and further analyze the association with clinical parameters and the prognostic value of coexpression in HCC patients.Methods:We assessed the expression of PD-L1 and HIF-1α by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue from 90 HCC patients who underwent curative hepatectomy. The results were validated in an independent cohort of additional 90 HCC patients.Results:PD-L1 and HIF-1α exhibited in tumor tissue high expression rates of 41.11% (37/90) and 43.33% (43/90), respectively, and their expressions were positively correlated (r = 0.563, P Conclusion:We demonstrated that HCC patients with co-overexpression of PD-L1 and HIF-1α in tumor tissue had a significantly higher risk of recurrence or metastasis and death compared with others. Therefore, more frequent follow-up is needed for patients with co-overexpression of PD-L1 and HIF-1α. At the same time, a combinational therapy with HIF-1α inhibitors in conjunction with PD-L1 blockade may be beneficial for HCC patients with co-overexpression in the future.
