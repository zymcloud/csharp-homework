Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common tumors, so far, there still aren't good therapeutic methods. Looking for new targets makes a top priority. In this study, we found a OCT4 pseudogene, POU5F1B was significantly upregulated in HCC cells and tissues, patients with high POU5F1B had shorter survival time compared to patients with low POU5F1B expression. POU5F1B overexpression promoted HCC proliferation, while its knockdown inhibited HCC proliferation determined by MTT assay, soft agar growth assay, BrdU incorporation assay, and cell cycle assay. Mechanism analysis suggested POU5F1B could activate AKT, AKT inhibition in HCC cells with POU5F1B overexpression significantly inhibited cell proliferation compared to cells only with POU5F1B overexpression, suggesting POU5F1B promoted HCC proliferation by activating AKT. Finally, we analyzed the relationship between POU5F1B expression and AKT activity in HCC tissues, and found POU5F1B expression was positive correlated with activated AKT. Taken together, our findings suggested POU5F1B promoted HCC proliferation by activating AKT, and provided a new target for HCC therapy.
