Aim:This study aimed to identify the relationship between loss of skeletal muscle mass and clinical factors such as osteoporosis in patients with chronic liver disease.Methods:The subjects were 112 patients (85 men and 27 women) with hepatocellular carcinoma who were scheduled to undergo hepatectomy. Skeletal muscle reduction was diagnosed according to the cut-off level of the skeletal mass index (SMI) for Asians (men 2 , women <5.4 kg/m2 ). Osteoporosis was diagnosed according to T-score â‰¤-2.5 standard deviation. The SMI and T-score were assessed using the results of dual-energy X-ray absorption. Peak oxygen consumption (PeakVO2 ), an index of exercise tolerance, was evaluated using the cardiopulmonary exercise test. The characteristics of patients with low SMI (low SMI group) were compared with those of patients whose SMI was not low (control group). Outcomes are presented as median (interquartile range).Results:The T-score was significantly lower in the low SMI group (control vs. low SMI -1.1 [1.8] vs. -1.6 [1.9], P = 0.049). T-score positively correlated with SMI (r = 0.409, P 2 was significantly decreased in the low SMI group (17.7 [6.3] vs. 14.4 [4.5], P = 0.006). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, T-score (odds ratio [OR], 3.508; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.074-11.456; P = 0.038) and PeakVO2 (OR, 3.512; 95% CI, 1.114-11.066; P = 0.032) were significantly related to SMI, independent of age and sex.Conclusions:Skeletal muscle reduction in chronic liver disease is closely related to exercise tolerance and osteoporosis, and these factors are believed to be associated with physical inactivity in daily life.
