The mainstay of treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma is locoregional therapy including percutaneous ablation and transarterial chemo- and radioembolization. While monitoring for tumor response after transarterial chemoembolization is crucial, current imaging strategies are suboptimal. The standard of care is contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography imaging performed at least 4 to 6 weeks after therapy. We present a case in which contrast-enhanced ultrasound identified a specific extra-hepatic collateral from the gastroduodenal artery supplying residual viable tumor and assisting with directed transarterial management.
