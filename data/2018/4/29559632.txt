Overexpression of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), a key molecule of glucose metabolism in cytoplasm, has been found in various tumors. Emerging evidence has suggested that PFKFB3 is also located in the nucleus and apparent in regulatory functions other than glycolysis. In this study, we found that PFKFB3 expression is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth and located mainly in the nucleus of tumor cells. PFKFB3 overexpression was associated with large tumor size (p = 0.04) and poor survival of patients with HCC (p = 0.027). Knockdown of PFKFB3 inhibited HCC growth, not only by reducing glucose consumption but also by damaging the DNA repair function, leading to G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis. In animal studies, overexpression of PFKFB3 is associated with increased tumor growth. Mechanistically, PFKFB3 silencing decreased AKT phosphorylation and reduced the expression of ERCC1, which is an important DNA repair protein. Moreover, PFK15, a selective PFKFB3 inhibitor, significantly inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft model of human HCC. PFKFB3 is a potential novel target in the treatment of HCC.
