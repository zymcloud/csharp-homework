The medical importance of Zika virus (ZIKV) was fully highlighted during the recent epidemics in South Pacific islands and Americas due to ZIKV association with severe damage to fetal brain development and neurological complications in adult patients. A worldwide research effort has been undertaken to identify effective compounds to prevent or treat ZIKV infection. Fruits and vegetables may be sources of compounds with medicinal properties. Flavonoids are one class of plant compounds that emerge as promising antiviral molecules against ZIKV. In the present study, we demonstrated that flavonoid isoquercitrin exerts antiviral activity against African historical and Asian epidemic strains of ZIKV in human hepatoma, epithelial, and neuroblastoma cell lines. Time-of-drug addition assays showed that isoquercitrin acts on ZIKV entry by preventing the internalisation of virus particles into the host cell. Our data also suggest that the glycosylated moiety of isoquercitrin might play a role in the antiviral effect of the flavonoid against ZIKV. Our results highlight the importance of isoquercitrin as a promising natural antiviral compound to prevent ZIKV infection.
