Background:Post-hepatectomy Liver Failure (PHLF) remains the primary cause of perioperative death. The kinetics of transaminase levels are usually measured as markers of hepatocellular injury following partial hepatectomy, but their correlation with PHLF and post-operative mortality is unclear. The aim of study was to compare the post-operative transaminase kinetics with short term survival in those patients that developed PHLF.Methods:A retrospective review of patients with HBV-related HCC and who developed PHLF was performed. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to analyze risk factors for postoperative delayed elevation of ALT (PDE-ALT) PHLF and lethal PHLF.Result:Of the 69 patients who developed PHLF 36 (52%) died. In those patients who died the mean ± SD ALT and AST rose from day (POD) 1-3 and continued to fluctuate with highly abnormal levels beyond day 3 with a mean ± SD peak ALT level beyond POD 3 of 1851 ± 1644 U/L (p Conclusions:The kinetics of the post-operative transaminases were significantly correlated with perioperative mortality in those patients who developed PHLF. PDE-ALT indicates an increased risk of death in HBV-related HCC patients with PHLF.
