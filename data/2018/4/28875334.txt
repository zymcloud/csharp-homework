Background:Historically, the benefit of liver resection for non-colorectal, non-neuroendocrine (NCNN) liver metastases has been controversial. This study aims to determine the preoperative prognostic factors of liver resection for NCNN liver metastases and validate the Adam score in an Asian population.Methods:Consecutive patients who underwent liver resection for NCNN liver metastases were identified retrospectively from a prospective liver resection database of the single institution between 2001 and 2014. Univariate Cox regression models were used to identify associations with outcome variables. Recurrence-free interval and overall survival were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank test.Results:Seventy-eight consecutive patients were identified, which met the study criteria. Univariate analysis demonstrated that adenocarcinoma histology of primary cancer, disease-free interval and number of nodules were significant predictors of survival. Four of the six components of Adam score were significant predictors of survival. These were the presence of extrahepatic metastases, R2 resection, disease-free interval and type of a primary tumour. The total Adam score was also a significant predictor of survival.Conclusion:Liver resection for NCNN liver metastases is a safe and viable treatment option in carefully selected patients. Significant preoperative prognostic factors include adenocarcinoma primary tumours, disease-free interval and number of nodules. The total Adam score was a good predictor of overall survival and can be used to risk stratify patients undergoing hepatic resection for NCNN liver metastases.
