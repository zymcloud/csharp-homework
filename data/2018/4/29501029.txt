One new 1,3-diphenylpropane (1) together with six known analogues (2-7) were firstly isolated from the stem and root bark of Daphne giraldii. Their structures were determined by comprehensive NMR and HRESIMS spectroscopic data analyses. All the isolates were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against two hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2 and Hep3B). Among them, compound 5 showed the most significant cytotoxicity against Hep3B cells, with an IC50 value of 17.21 μM. A further study demonstrated that 5 obviously induced apoptotic cell death as well as the inactivation of nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-κB p65) in Hep3B cells. In addition, BAY 11-7082 (BAY), a NF-кB inhibitor, was used to determine the role of NF-кB signaling in 5-treated Hep3B cells. The results suggested that BAY could enhance 5-induced apoptosis of Hep3B cells. In conclusion, the data provided that 5 might be a potential candidate for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma through NF-κB inhibition.
