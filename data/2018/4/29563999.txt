The proliferative activity of hepatic carcinoma cells is directly associated with tumorigenesis, tumor development, metastasis and invasion. A variety of cytokines and peptides serve important roles in the development of hepatic carcinoma. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of intermedin (IMD) on hepatic carcinoma cell proliferation and its mechanism of action. HepG2 hepatic carcinoma cell lines were treated with human recombinant IMD1-53 and its receptor antagonist IMD17-47. Cell proliferation was detected using a Cell Counting kit-8. The activation of the classical Wnt signaling pathway was demonstrated by the ratio of TOPflash:FOPflash luciferase activity. The expression of c-Myc and cyclin D1 downstream of the Wnt signaling pathway were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. It was demonstrated that IMD may promote the proliferation of HepG2 cells in a time-dependent manner, and that the IMD receptor antagonist IMD17-47 could eliminate this promotion. IMD may activate classical Wnt signaling pathway transcriptional activity and the mRNA levels of certain downstream target genes. Furthermore, blocking of the Wnt signaling pathway may inhibit IMD-induced HepG2 cell proliferation to a certain extent. IMD may promote hepatic carcinoma cell proliferation by binding with receptor antagonist IMD17-47 and activating the Wnt signaling cascade, thus providing a novel avenue for the treatment of hepatic carcinoma.
