Background:Paediatric liver allografts sometimes are allocated to adult recipients when there are no suitable paediatric recipients on the waiting list. However, debate exits regarding the reported outcomes of liver transplants using such small grafts.Methods:Records from adult patients undergoing liver transplantation between February 2010 and January 2016 who received whole grafts from paediatric (â‰¤ 13 years) donors or ideal deceased adult (18-35 years) donors were reviewed. Patient and graft survival, post-transplant liver function, and complications between the two groups were compared.Results:The baseline characteristics were comparable, except that the paediatric donor allografts had smaller size. The 3-month, 1-year, and 3-year rates of patient survival were 91.3%, 85.2%, and 85.2% in the paediatric donor group and 93.4%, 88.9%, and 85.0% in the adult donor group (P = 0.947), respectively. One patient receiving a paediatric allograft developed small-for-size liver syndrome post-transplantation. There was no difference in primary non-function, early allograft dysfunction, biliary complications, vascular complications, or infection between the two groups.Conclusion:Our study indicates that using paediatric donor livers in well-selected adult recipients is a safe procedure, considering there was no suitable paediatric recipient. However, the risk of portal hyperperfusion should be considered in clinical cases such as size-mismatched transplants.
