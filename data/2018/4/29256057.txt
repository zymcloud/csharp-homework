There is significant void in establishing validated non-invasive surrogate biomarkers of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis in chronic liver diseases (CLD). Golgi protein 73 (GP73) has been suggested as a potential serum marker for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, significant background of cirrhosis could have accounted for the elevation of serum GP73 in HCC. In this study, we have taken advantage of a well-defined extensive cohort of 3044 patients with either compensated cirrhosis (n = 1247), decompensated cirrhosis (n = 841) or pre-cirrhotic CLD (n = 956) and our ability to quantify serum GP73 to define the potential of serum GP73 as a biomarker of liver cirrhosis/fibrosis in CLD. The diagnostic value of GP73 was compared with aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), fibrosis index based on four factors (FIB-4) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM). Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to measure hepatic GP73 expression. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that serum GP73 had a good diagnostic potential for compensated cirrhosis regardless of etiology. The diagnostic performance of GP73 is better than APRI, FIB-4 and similar with LSM, especially in patients with severe inflammation, steatosis and cholestasis. Notably, in patients of autoimmune liver diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and viral hepatitis, serum GP73 also exhibited diagnostic value for advanced fibrosis as well as cirrhosis. Furthermore, there is also a gradual increase in GP73 expression with disease progression from mild fibrosis to cirrhosis. In conclusion, GP73 is an effective and reliable serological marker for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis and prediction of appearance of cirrhosis.
