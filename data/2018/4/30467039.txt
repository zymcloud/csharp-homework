Background:Portal vein embolization has been used worldwide to induce hypertrophy of the future liver remnant and to reduce the risk of hepatic insufficiency and death after major hepatectomy. However, whether disease progression after portal vein embolization can affect long-term oncologic outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma is uncertain.Methods:From a total of 107 patients who underwent portal vein embolization and subsequent hepatectomy between 2000 and 2016, 57 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled. We evaluated their long-term oncologic outcomes and investigated whether the disease progression between portal vein embolization and subsequent hepatectomy affected survival.Results:The 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival after hepatectomy were 74.5% and 31.7%, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that tumor number before hepatectomy ≥3 (hazard ratio 3.59, P = .019), des-γ-carboxy prothrombin >200 mAU/mL (hazard ratio 3.36, P = .045), and red blood cell transfusion (hazard ratio 11.03, P = .0008) were independent prognostic factors for overall survival. Male sex (hazard ratio 3.74, P = .029), bilobar tumor distribution (hazard ratio 3.65, P = .004), and red blood cell transfusion (hazard ratio 6.22, P = .0026) were independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival. Disease progressions after portal vein embolization, including increases in tumor size, tumor number, α-fetoprotein, lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of α-fetoprotein, and des-γ-carboxy prothrombin, were observed in 22.8%, 14.0%, 29.8%, 19.3%, and 47.4% of patients, respectively. Only an increase of tumor number significantly decreased the disease-free survival rate after hepatectomy in a univariate analysis, and none of the variables affected overall survival.Conclusion:Disease progression after portal vein embolization did not affect long-term survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma if the planned subsequent hepatectomy could be completed.
