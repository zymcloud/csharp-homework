Purpose:To identify factors benefiting from computed tomography during hepatic arteriography (CTHA) in addition to dynamic CT studies at the preoperative evaluation of the hypervascularity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:We retrospectively divided 45 patients with HCC, who underwent both dynamic CT (dCT) and CTHA, into two groups based on the number of hypervascular HCCs identified on dCT and CTHA studies. In group A, the number of HCCs identified by dCT and CTHA was the same and additive CTHA had not been indicated. In group B, fewer HCCs were counted on dCT than on CTHA images, indicating that additive CTHA studies had been appropriate. We compared the patient characteristics, the serum alpha-fetoprotein level, and the tumor-liver contrast (TLC) of the main tumor on dCT scans of both groups. To identify factors alerting to the benefit of additional CTHA studies, we performed univariate logistic regression analysis. Statistically significant parameters were subjected to receiver operating characteristic analysis for obtaining the optimal cutoff value indicative of the benefit of CTHA.Results:Univariate analysis identified only the TLC of the main tumor on dCT images as a significant factor for the benefit of CTHA images (P Conclusion:Evaluation of the TLC of the main tumor on dCT scans identifies patients in whom additive CTHA studies are beneficial.
