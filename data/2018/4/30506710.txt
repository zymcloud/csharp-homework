Objectives:Hepatocarcinoma is one of the most lethal cancers, leading to a 5-year survival rate as low as 30% due to recurrence and metastasis. The treatment of liver cancer includes surgery and medication, of which, the former is more effective. However, surgical resection is applicable in less than 40% of patients. Therefore, it is imperative to find effective medication options for liver cancer therapy.Methods:In this study, we found that two natural products, geraniol and lupeol, had antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects on the hepatocarcinoma cell lines SMMC7721 and HepG2. We also detected a lower expression level of Bcl-2 and upregulation of BAX and caspase in the presence of geraniol and lupeol.Results:Furthermore, geraniol or lupeol also altered the phosphorylation level of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, P38, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases, suggesting involvement in mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling.Conclusions:This study provided direct evidence to support the effect of geraniol and lupeol in hepatocarcinoma cell growth and apoptosis, which indicated the potential application of these two natural products in anti-liver cancer therapy.
