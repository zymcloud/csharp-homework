Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks among the most common primary cancers of the liver. The major risk factor for the formation of HCC is liver cirrhosis. The grade of cirrhosis as well as the extent of the tumor itself, can play an important role in the treatment options and patient prognosis. An operation aimed at an R0 resection is the treatment of choice for patients in an early stage of the disease and is associated with favorable long-term and recurrence-free survival. Liver transplantation offers an even better long-term survival rate after 5 years for selected patients with HCC meeting the Milan criteria as the underlying cirrhosis, the major risk factor for HCC recurrence, is simultaneously treated. Local tumor ablation is the least invasive curative surgical treatment, however, it is associated with an increased local recurrence rate; therefore, the early detection of tumors is of essential importance. As tumor-associated symptoms tend to arise only in advanced tumor stages, it is indispensable to identify patients with typical risk factors and to provide closely monitored screening examinations.
