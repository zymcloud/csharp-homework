Hepatitis C virus (HCV), known as the leading cause of liver cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, has been affecting more than 150 million people globally. The HCV non-structure 3 (NS3) protease protein domain plays a key role in HCV replication and pathogenesis; and is currently a primary target for HCV antiviral therapy. Through unbiased molecular dynamics simulations which take advantage of the novel highly mobile membrane mimetic model, we constructed the membrane-bound state of the protein domain at the atomic level. Our results indicated that protease domain of HCV NS3 protein can spontaneously bind and penetrate to an endoplasmic reticulum complex membrane containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). An amphipathic helix Î±0 and loop S1 show their anchoring role to keep the protein on the membrane surface. Proper orientation of the protein domain at membrane surface was identified through measuring tilt angles of two specific vectors, wherein residue R161 plays a crucial role in its final orientation. Remarkably, PIP2 molecules were observed to bind to three main sites of the protease domain via specific electrostatic contacts and hydrogen bonds. PIP2-interaction determines the protein orientation at the membrane while both hydrophobic interplay and PIP2-interaction can stabilize the NS3 - membrane complex. Simulated results provide us with a detailed characterization of insertion, orientation and PIP2-interaction of NS3 protease domain at membrane environment, thus enhancing our understanding of structural functions and mechanism for the association of HCV non-structure 3 protein with respect to ER membranes.
