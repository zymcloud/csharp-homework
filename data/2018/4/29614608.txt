Objective: Incidence of primary liver cancer (PLC) in China is mostly related to chronic infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Qidong was one of the endemic areas with high incidence of PLC in China before 2000. We conducted a series of studies regarding on PLC etiological prevention during the past decades to develop better primary prevention strategies for PLC. Methods: Qidong Hepatitis B Intervention Study was conducted in 1983-1990. A total of 41 182 newborns were randomly assigned to vaccination group and 40 211 (97.64%) of them completed the three-dose, 5 µg-plasma-derived hepatitis B (HB) vaccination series at age 0, 1, 6 month. Among them, 28 988 participants received one-dose 10 µg recombinant HB booster vaccination at age 10-14 years. A total of 41 730 newborns were randomly assigned to the control group. When they were at age 10-14 years, 23 368 participants received the catch-up vaccination with three-dose, 10 µg-recombinant HB vaccine. Two cross-sectional HBV serology surveys were conducted in 1996-2000 and 2008-2012. Information on PLC incidence and mortality of chronic liver diseases were collected through cancer registry and vital statistics until December 31, 2016. Cox proportional hazard models were employed to compute hazard ratio (HR) of PLC and other liver diseases for the participants with neonatal HB vaccination or catch-up vaccination, and the protective efficacy was also calculated. Results: During serologic survey in 1996-2000, a total of 22 689 participants in vaccination group and 12 395 participants in control group donated blood samples. The HBsAg seropositive rates in the vaccination group was 2.16% (491/22 689), which is significantly lower than that of control group (9.08%, 1 126/12 395) (χ2=896.61, P<0.001). During serologic survey in 2008-2012, a total of 17 386 participants in vaccination group and 18 060 participants in control group donated blood samples. The HBsAg seropositive rates in the vaccination group was 1.83% (319/17 386), which is still significantly lower than that of control group (6.77%,1 222/18 060) (χ2=518.05, P<0.001). By December 31, 2016, 4 cases of PLC in the vaccination group and 17 cases of PLC were identified in the vaccination and control group, respectively. The estimated efficacy of neonatal HB vaccination on HBsAg seroprevalence in childhood (at age 10-11 years), early adulthood (at age 19-28 years) and incidence rate of PLC at age below 33 years was 79% (95%CI: 76%-81%), 74% (95%CI: 71%-78%) and 79% (95%CI: 36%-93%), respectively. The estimated efficacy of three-dose, 10 µg-recombinant HB catch-up vaccination in early adulthood is 21% (95%CI: 11%-30%), which is significantly lower than that of neonatal HB vaccination. Conclusion: HB vaccination to neonates/infants is crucial against chronic HBV infection in childhood through young adulthood, and subsequently reduced the risk of PLC in young adults.
