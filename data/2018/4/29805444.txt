Objective:This study aimed at assessing the effects of transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) and antiviral therapy on improving the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after radical hepatectomy.Methods:This study reviewed the data of 120 patients with HCC who received either radical hepatectomy alone (control group), radical hepatectomy with postoperative TACE (TACE group) or radical hepatectomy with combined postoperative TACE, and antiviral therapy (combined group) from January 2000 to May 2015. To reduce the impact of the possible biases on the conclusion of this study to the minimum, the cases with similar demographic and clinicopathological characteristics were collected and 40 cases were assigned into each group. Recurrence, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) rates were compared.Results:Median follow-up period was 54.26 Â± 22.65 months with a range of 17-110 months. Recurrence after radical surgery was observed for 39 (97.5%) patients in the TACE group, 32 (80%) in the combined group, and 40 (100%) in the control group with median recurrence duration of 33, 43, and 16.5 months, respectively. Postoperative TACE with or without antiviral therapy significantly prolonged the DFS rate compared with radical hepatectomy alone (P = 0.000). TACE combined with antiviral therapy significantly extended the DFS rate compared with TACE alone (P = 0.008). Postoperative TACE with or without antiviral therapy also significantly prolonged the OS rate compared with radical hepatectomy alone (P = 0.000). In addition, antiviral therapy combined with TACE significantly extended the 5-year OS rate of patients compared with individual TACE and radical hepatectomy (67.5% versus 55% and 2.5%; P = 0.032).Conclusion:TACE is an appropriate therapy for HCC patients after radical hepatectomy. When combined with antiviral therapy, this treatment may further prolong the recurrence time and thus lead to high DFS and OS rates.
