Evidence indicates that exposure to heavy trace element might be a risk factor for liver carcinoma. Cadmium has been supposed to be a carcinogen that has a correlation with the risk of a number of cancers, including liver cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying Cadmium-induced malignant transformation in liver cells are not fully understood. In the present study, we aimed to screen the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that might play a role in both the Cadmium-related liver cell transformation and the development of liver cancer. Microarray-based gene expression profiles concerning liver carcinoma vs non-cancerous tissue (GSE64041) and Cadmium-treated liver cells vs controls (GSE8865 and GSE31286), respectively, were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Then, DEGs of each profile were calculated and screened. The intersection of each DEGs was obtained by Venn analysis. Afterwards, the possible roles of the selected genes in cancer development were evaluated by using Oncomine database and TCGA cohort analysis. Consequently, three DEGs, LRAT, SLC7A11, and ITGA2, were selected for further analysis. SLC7A11 and ITGA2, but not LRAT, were upregulated in liver cancer compared with those in normal tissues, respectively. After using a TCGA cohort analysis, results failed to show a significant correlation between SLC7A11 or ITGA2 expression and clinical parameters. However, the survival analysis showed that patients with high expression levels of SLC7A11 had a shorter overall survival time relative to those of the patients with low levels. In conclusion, SLC7A11 and ITGA2 might play a role in the Cadmium-induced liver cell damage or transformation, and the development of liver carcinoma. SLC7A11 might be a prognostic factor for patients with liver carcinoma. Future validation experiments are needed to verify the results.
