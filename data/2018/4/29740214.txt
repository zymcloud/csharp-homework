Background and aim:Beclin1 has been reported as a vital marker for a number of malignant tumors. However, the role of Beclin1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains inconclusive. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the correlation between Beclin1 and its clinicopathological and prognostic values in HCC.Methods:PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, Chinese CNKI, and Chinese WanFang databases were searched for published articles on Beclin1 expression in hepatocellular tissues. Standard-compliant articles were screened using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for strict quality control of the literature. The correlation of Beclin1 expression with the clinicopathological features and survival outcomes was analyzed. Pooled odds ratios and hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using STATA14.2.Results:Eleven articles with 1,279 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Positive Beclin1 expression was found to be correlated with alpha fetoprotein, liver cirrhosis, and vascular invasion, but not with gender, age, HBsAg, size of tumor, number of tumors, differentiation, and TNM stage. Positive Beclin1 expression was also associated with favorable 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates.Conclusion:Our meta-analysis indicated that positive Beclin1 expression was negatively related to alpha fetoprotein, liver cirrhosis, and vascular invasion in HCC. Beclin1 could be used as a prognostic biomarker for HCC.
