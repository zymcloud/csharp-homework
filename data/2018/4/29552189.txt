Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) serves a primary function in metastasis and recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, in order to evaluate the analytical performance and clinical value of the liquid biopsy-based platform, a novel integrated subtraction enrichment and immunostaining-fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH®) platform was applied to analyze CTCs in patients with HCC undergoing liver transplantation (LT). In total, 30 patients with HCC undergoing LT and 10 healthy volunteers were enrolled. CTCs in peripheral blood that were obtained from each patient prior to LT and 3 months thereafter were detected using the iFISH® platform, and CellSearch® system was performed for each subject for comparison. Using iFISH® and CellSearch®, the percentage of CTCs in patients with pre-operative HCC were 70.00% and 26.67%, respectively. CTCs counted using iFISH® (iFISH-CTCs) were increased compared with CellSearch® (Cellsearch-CTCs) (P<0.01). A significant decrease in iFISH-CTCs was observed 3 months following LT (3.04±0.93/7.5 to 1.0±0.53/7.5 ml, P<0.05). Furthermore, patients with lower preoperative iFISH-CTCs level (<5/7.5 ml) had markedly increased recurrence-free survival compared with iFISH-CTCs (>5/7.5 ml, 15 vs. 5.5 months; P<0.01. iFISH® platform exhibits an increased analytical sensitivity, and may be used as a dynamic monitoring tool for CTCs, and CTCs may be a good prognostic indicator for patients with HCC undergoing LT.
