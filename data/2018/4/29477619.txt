Purpose:The impact of transarterial chemoembolization after initiation of sorafenib (SOR) has not been prospectively compared with SOR alone in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The objective of this study was to assess whether SOR + transarterial chemoembolization provides benefit over SOR alone in this setting.Materials and methods:A retrospective cohort study with propensity matching using data from patients prescribed SOR for HCC at Veterans Health Administration hospitals from 2007 to 2015. The primary outcome was overall survival from the time of SOR prescription and stratified by receipt of transarterial chemoembolization within 90 days of SOR initiation.Results:A total of 4,896 patients received SOR for HCC, of whom 232 (4.7%) underwent transarterial chemoembolization within 90 days. Patients receiving transarterial chemoembolization + SOR were highly selected, being younger and with less significant hepatic dysfunction, earlier Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage (P 50,000/Î¼L, and >3 tumors with or without macrovascular invasion, without local invasion or metastases.Conclusions:Patients with unresectable HCC started on systemic therapy with SOR appear to benefit from adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization. Optimal application of multimodal therapy in this setting should be prospectively investigated.
