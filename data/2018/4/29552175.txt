The hepatic VX2 carcinoma model in rabbits is widely used for the preclinical study of hepatocellular carcinoma. In the present study, a modification was made to the conventional method to establish the animal model, as the conventional method gives rise to frequent tumor seeding due to the drop-out of tumor fragments. In order to evaluate each distinct method of establishing the model, the rabbits were divided into two groups: Group A (the conventional method; n=20) and group B (the modified method; n=20). All surgical details were recorded for reference. At 14 days post-surgery, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and autopsy were conducted. Microscopic morphology of tumor cells was observed using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cluster of differentiation (CD)31 were detected via immunochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In total, 19 rabbits in each group succeeded in model establishment. Throughout the surgery, group A experienced a longer surgery time compared with group B (group A vs. group B, 22.57±1.34 vs. 20.17±1.50 min; P
