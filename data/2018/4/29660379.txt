Recent advances have found irregular activities of the nervous system-associated factors in the development and progression of primary liver cancer. These factors contributed in the regulation of migration, proliferation, and apoptosis of cancer cells, and took a role in modulating invasion, metastasis, and recurrence after curative treatment. In clinical researches, neural-related factors were found to be significant prognostic factors, suggesting that the interactions between nervous system and primary liver cancer are indispensable in understanding underlying biological mechanisms. Herein, we reviewed up-to-date achievements in this area and the future perspectives of the interactions between the nervous system and primary liver cancer.
