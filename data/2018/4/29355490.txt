Development and progression of malignant tumors is in part characterized by the ability of a tumor cell to overcome cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion and to disseminate in organs distinct from that in which they originated. This study was undertaken to analyze the clinical significance of the expression of the following cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion molecules in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) and synchronous liver metastases: intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), E-cadherin, periostin, and midkine (MK). ICAM-1, E-cadherin, periostin and MK expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray containing 34 PDACs and 12 liver metastasis specimens. ICAM-1 expression was predominantly localized in the membranes of the cells and was found in weak to moderate intensities in PDACs and liver metastases. E-cadherin expression was absent in the majority of PDACs and corresponding liver metastases. The secreted proteins periostin and MK were expressed in various intensities in primary cancers and liver metastases. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of the analyzed markers were neither significantly associated with metastasis in PDACs nor with clinical outcome of patients. Our study shows that the expression of the cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion molecules ICAM-1, E-cadherin, periostin and MK was not significantly linked to metastatic disease in PDACs. Moreover, our study excludes the analyzed markers as prognostic markers in PDACs.
