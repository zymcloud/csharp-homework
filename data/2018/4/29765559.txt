Purpose:Substance P is a tachykinins family member with inflammatory effects. Higher circulating levels of substance P have been found in patients with liver diseases and in patients with higher severity of liver diseases. The objective of this study was to determine whether serum levels of substance P levels, prior to liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are associated with one-year LT mortality.Material and methods:In this observational retrospective unicenter study were included patients with LT for HCC. Serum levels of substance P were measured before LT. The end-point of the study was one-year mortality after LT.Results:We found that one-year survivor patients (n = 127) showed a lower age in liver donors (p = 0.03) and lower levels of serum substance P levels (p = 0.003) than non-survivor patients (n = 15). Logistic regression analysis showed that serum levels of substance P (levels) were associated with one-year mortality (Odds Ratio = 1.011; 95% CI = 1.004-1.018; p = 0.002) controlling for the age of the LT donor.Conclusions:We believe that our study is the first study reporting data on circulating levels of substance P previously to LT for HCC, and an association between elevated levels of serum substance P before LT and mortality during the first year of LT.
