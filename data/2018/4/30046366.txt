Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mainly composed of the pseudoglandular pattern is very rare. We present a case of pseudoglandular HCC that was hyperechoic on ultrasound, with strongly high signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging and weak arterial contrast enhancement. Computed tomography hepatic arteriography showed corona enhancement. Radiologists should keep in mind this combination of multimodal radiological findings for pseudoglandular HCC.
