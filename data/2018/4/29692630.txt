Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of death from cancer, with increasing prevalence worldwide. The mortality rate of HCC is similar to its incidence rate, which reflects its poor prognosis. At present, the diagnosis of HCC is still mostly dependent on invasive biopsy, imaging methods, and serum Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) testing. Because of the asymptomatic nature of early HCC, biopsy and imaging methods usually detect HCC at the middle-late stages. AFP has limited sensitivity and specificity, as many other nonmalignant liver diseases can also result in a very high serum level of AFP. Therefore, better biomarkers with higher sensitivity and specificity at earlier stages are greatly needed. Since metabolic reprogramming is an essential hallmark of cancer and the liver is the metabolic hub of living systems, it is useful to investigate HCC from a metabolic perspective. As a noninvasive and nondestructive approach, metabolomics provides holistic information on dynamically metabolic responses of living systems to both endogenous and exogenous factors. Therefore, it would be conducive to apply metabolomics in investigating HCC. In this review, we summarize recent metabolomic studies on HCC cellular, animal, and clinicopathologic models with attention to metabolomics as a biomarker in cancer diagnosis. Recent applications of metabolomics with respect to therapeutic and prognostic evaluation of HCC are also covered, with emphasis on the potential of treatment by drugs from natural products. In the last section, the current challenges and trends of future development of metabolomics on HCC are discussed. Overall, metabolomics provides us with novel insight into the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic evaluation of HCC.
