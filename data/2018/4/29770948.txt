Biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following curative resection are not currently sufficient for prognostic indication of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic performance of osteopontin (OPN), matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7), and pregnancy specific glycoprotein 9 (PSG9) in patients with HCC. A total of 179 prospective patients with HCC provided plasma before hepatectomy. Plasma OPN, MMP7, and PSG9 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Correlations between plasma levels, clinical parameters, and outcomes (OS and DFS) were overall analyzed. High OPN ( ⩾ 149.97 ng/mL), MMP7 ( ⩾ 2.28 ng/mL), and PSG9 ( ⩾ 45.59 ng/mL) were prognostic indicators of reduced OS (P
