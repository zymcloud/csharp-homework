Dysregulation of lipid metabolism is common in cancer cells, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) stimulate lipid biosynthesis through transcriptional activation of lipogenic enzymes. However, SREBPs' roles and potential interacting partners in cancer cells are not fully defined. Using a biochemical approach, we found here that pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) physically interacts with the nuclear form of SREBP-1a (nBP1a), by binding to amino acids 43-56 in nBP1a. We also found that PKM2 activates SREBP target gene expression and lipid biosynthesis by stabilizing nBP1a proteins. Using a competitive peptide inhibitor to block the formation of the SREBP-1a/PKM2 complex, we observed that this blockade inhibited lipogenic gene expression. Of note, nBP1a phosphorylation at Thr-59 enhanced the binding to PKM2 and promoted cancer cell growth. Moreover, we show that PKM2 phosphorylates Thr-59 in vitro Lastly, in human patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, nBP1a phosphorylation at Thr-59 was negatively correlated with clinical outcomes. Together, our results reveal that nBP1a/PKM2 interaction activates lipid metabolism genes in cancer cells and that Thr-59 phosphorylation of SREBP-1a plays an important role in cancer cell proliferation.
