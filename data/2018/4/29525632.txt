Spontaneous tumor hemorrhage (TH) is frequently observed in solid tumors including human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TH implies fast-growing and worse tumor immunological microenvironment; however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. CLEC1B is a signature gene highly associated with tumor progression. PD-L1 expression is a key biomarker predictive of immune checkpoint therapies, which showed astonishing effect on various types of tumor. We assume that, in HCC, TH may closely associate with the expression of these two molecules. In this study, 136 patients with HCC were enrolled. qRT-PCR showed that CLEC1B expression is significantly lower in HCC tumor tissue. Immunohistochemistry of HCC tissue microarrays demonstrated that PD-L1high and CLEC1Blow expressions were significantly correlated with TH and clinicopathological features indicating worse HCC progression. According to univariate/multivariate analysis, a combination of PD-L1high and CLEC1Blow expression was an independent prognostic factor indicating the poor outcome. The prognostic value of PD-L1high and CLEC1Blow was validated by Cox proportional-hazard analyses. Collectively, tumor with TH is closely associated with CLEC1Blow & PD-L1high expression, which may imply high response of PD-L1/PD-1 immune checkpoint therapies. CLEC1B may be a potential therapeutic target for PD-L1/PD-1 immunotherapy. PD-L1high and CLEC1Blow can be a valuable prognosis factor implying worse clinical outcomes.
