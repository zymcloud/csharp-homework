It has been widely reported that patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDXs) are more similar to tumor tissues than conventional cancer cell lines. Kinetochore-associated protein 2 (KNTC2) is known to be upregulated specifically in tumor tissues of cancer patients and is recognized as a potential target for cancer therapy. Previously, in vivo antitumor activities of KNTC2 short interfering RNA encapsulated into a lipid nanoparticle (KNTC2-LNP) were reported in orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma mouse models. However, it remains unclear whether KNTC2-LNP exhibits antitumor activities against lung cancer PDXs. In the present study, the antitumor activities of KNTC2-LNP were clarified in a three-dimensional culture system and a subcutaneous tumor model of lung cancer PDX, LC-60, which was resistant to erlotinib. Growth inhibitory activities of KNTC2-LNP were associated with knockdown activities. Furthermore, KNTC2-LNP also exhibited in vivo antitumor activity against another lung cancer PDX, LC-45, which was sensitive to erlotinib. These results suggest that KNTC2 is a promising target for patients with lung cancer.
