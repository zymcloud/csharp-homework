The choice of surgical treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) depends on several prognostic variables, among which histological features, like microvascular invasion and tumor grade, are well established. This study aims to identify the tissue miRNAs predictive of recurrence after liver resection in "histologically advanced" HCC. We selected 54 patients: 15 retrospective resected patients without recurrence (group A), 19 retrospective resected patients with HCC recurrence (group B), and 20 prospective patients (group C), with 4 recurrence cases. All selected HCC were "histologically advanced" (high Edmondson grade and/or presence of microvascular invasion). A wide spectrum of miRNAs was studied with TaqMan Human microRNA Arrays; qRT-PCR assays were used to validate results on selected miRNAs; immunohistochemistry for IGF2 was applied to study the mechanism of miR-483-3p. As a result, a significant differential expression between group A and B was found for 255 miRNAs. Among them we selected miR-483-3p and miR-548e (P
