Purpose:Radioembolization is an alternative palliative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, we examine the uptake differences between tumor tissue phenotypes and present a cross-section of the absorbed dose throughout a liver tissue specimen.Methods and materials:A patient with hepatocellular carcinoma was treated with 90Y radioembolization followed by liver tissue resection. Gamma camera images and autoradiographs were collected and biopsy tissue samples were analyzed using a gamma well counter and light microscopy.Results:An analysis of 25 punched biopsy tissue samples identified 4 tissue regions: Normal tissue, viable tumor tissue with and without infarcted areas, and tumor areas with postnecrotic scar tissue. Autoradiography and biopsy tissue sample measurements showed large dose differences between viable and postnecrotic tumor tissue (159 Gy vs 23 Gy).Conclusions:Radioembolization of 90 yttrium with resin microspheres produces heterogeneous-absorbed dose distributions in the treatment of unifocal hepatic malignancies that could not be accurately determined with current gamma camera imaging techniques.
