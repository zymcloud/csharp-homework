Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) which represented a new two-steps liver resection procedures has been considered a revolutionary innovation for liver surgery technique in recent 10 years, it was first discovered by Professor Lang in Germany in 2007.The first step of the classic surgical procedures for portal vein ligation and liver parenchyma, until the future liver remnant (FLR) increased to a sufficient remnant then resect the right three-leaf liver.With the development of ALPPS, the method of hepatic parenchyma separation and isolation materials have been modified, which improves the safety of operation.ALPPS can speed up the regeneration of FLR in short period of time and therefore accurate assessment of FLR and liver reserve function preoperatively, which also can effectively prevent postoperative liver failure.However, it still remains controversy due to the high incidences of mobility and mortality perioperatively, how to solve this problem and chose the indications is the key.In China, 80% of liver cancer patients are associated with liver cirrhosis which the potential of FLR regeneration is limited. Whether ALPPS is applicable to the liver cancer patients in China remains to be further investigated, looking forward to a large number report of cases to give a more objective assessment.
