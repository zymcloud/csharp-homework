Introduction: The World Health Organization has categorized Helicobacter pylori as a carcinogen for gastric cancer, which causes human mortality worldwide. A number of studies have shown that H. pylori affects cell signaling in gastric epithelial cells and changes the expression of some proteins such as proinflammatory cytokines. Bacterial infections may alter sirt1 and sirt2 genes expression in inflammatory tissues and cancer cells. In this study, sirt1 and sirt2 genes expression in gastric cancers was surveyed with reference to H. pylori status. Methods: Stomach biopsies were collected from 50 gastric cancer patients, 25 H. pylori-positive and 25 H. pylori-negative as determined by the urea rapid test. Tumor grade was determined by a pathologist. After total RNA extraction from gastric cancer biopsy samples and cDNA synthesis, sirt1 and sirt2 genes expression levels were determined by Real Time PCR and ΔΔCT methods. Results: There was no statistically significant link between H. pylori infection and sirt1 (P<0.899) and sirt2 (P<0.169) genes expression in gastric epithelial cells. However, pathologic findings showed that there is a statistically significant relationship between sirt1 gene expression and the tumor grade (P<0.024). Discussion: A statistically significant association was found between sirt1 gene expression and tumor grade of gastric cancers that could be due to effects on progression of cancer cells infected with H. pylori.
