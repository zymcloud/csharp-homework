A 64-year-old woman who had chronic type C viral hepatitis was referred with a liver tumor detected by magnetic resonance imaging(MRI). She had a history of rheumatoid arthritis which was treated by methotrexate. Ethoxybenzyl-MRI(EOBMRI) showed a low signal in the T1-weighted imaging, a high signal in the T2-weighted imaging and a low signal in the hepatobiliary phase. The tumor was 7 millimeters in diameter at S4, and exhibited enhancement in the arterial phase and wash out in the portal phase by contrast enhanced CT. Imaging findings suggested hepatocellular carcinoma, and we performed partial hepatectomy of S4. Histopathological examination confirmed reactive lymphoid hyperplasia(RLH)of liver. RLH of liver is a rare benign lesion and it is necessary to consider RLH as a differential diagnosis of the liver tumor.
