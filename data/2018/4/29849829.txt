This prospective observational study aimed at investigating the role of procalcitonin (PCT) in diagnosing bacterial infection and guiding antibiotic therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with fever after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and/or radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Ninety-seven cases (84 patients) were enrolled. Serum PCT, C-reactive protein (CRP), and white blood cell (WBC) counts were measured on the day of fever onset (day 0) and days 1, 3, 5, and 7 of fever. Empirical antibiotics were initiated only if PCT was â‰¥0.5 ng/mL or specific infection foci were suspected. An infectious cause was found in nine cases. PCT on day 0 of fever was significantly higher in patients with bacterial infection than in those without infection (P = 0.035). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for PCT was 0.715 (95% confidence interval, 0.538-0.892) and was higher than that for CRP (0.598 (0.368-0.828)) or WBC counts (0.502 (0.307-0.697)). In patients undergoing TACE and/or RFA, a significantly lower number of antibiotics were prescribed during the study period than during the prestudy period (P < 0.001). In conclusion, PCT might be a biomarker for diagnosing infection and guiding antibiotic treatment to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use in patients with fever after TACE and/or RFA.
