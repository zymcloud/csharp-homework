Sensitive and accurate detection of tumor markers is critical to early diagnosis, point-of-care and portable medical supervision. Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is an important clinical tumor marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the concentration of AFP in human serum is related to the stage of HCC. In this paper, a label-free electrochemical aptasensor for AFP detection was fabricated using AFP-aptamer as the recognition molecule and thionin/reduced graphene oxide/gold nanoparticles (TH/RGO/Au NPs) as the sensor platform. With high electrocatalytic property and large specific surface area, RGO and Au NPs were employed on the screen-printed carbon electrode to load TH molecules. The TH not only acted as a bridging molecule to effectively capture and immobilize AFP-aptamer, but as the electron transfer mediator to provide the electrochemical signal. The AFP detection was based on the monitoring of the electrochemical current response change of TH by the differential pulse voltammetry. Under optimal conditions, the electrochemical responses were proportional to the AFP concentration in the range of 0.1-100.0 μg/mL. The limit of detection was 0.050 μg/mL at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The proposed method may provide a promising application of aptamer with the properties of facile procedure, low cost, high selectivity in clinic.
