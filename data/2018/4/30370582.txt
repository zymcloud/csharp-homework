Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as the third leading cancer-caused deaths, prevails with high mortality, and affects more than half a million individuals per year worldwide. A former study revealed that microRNA-221 (miR-221) was involved in cell proliferation of liver cancer and HCC development. The current study aims to evaluate whether miR-221 targeting SOCS3 affects HCC through JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway. A series of miR-221 mimic, miR-221 inhibitor, siRNA against SOCS3, and SOCS3 plasmids were introduced to SMMC7721 cells with the highest miR-221 expression assessed. The expression of JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway-related genes and proteins was determined by Western blot analysis. Cell apoptosis, viability, migration, and invasion were evaluated by means of flow cytometry, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, and transwell assays, respectively. HCC xenograft in nude mice was performed to measure HCC tumor growth. miR-221 was found to be highly expressed but SOCS3 was poorly expressed in HCC tissues. miR-221 expression was correlated with lymph node metastasis (LNM) and tumor node metastasis (TNM) of HCC, and SOCS3 expression was correlated with LNM, differentiation and TNM of HCC. SOCS3 is a target gene of miR-221. MiR-221 mimic or si-SOCS3 exposure was found to induce cell viability, migration, and invasion, and reduce apoptosis. MiR-221 inhibitor was observed to have inhibitory effects on HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover, the expression of JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway was suppressed by miR-221 inhibitor. Downregulated miR-221 expression could promote its target gene SOCS3 to inhibit the proliferation, invasion and migration of HCC cells by repressing JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway.
