COX-2 and YAP are shown to be highly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and frequently upregulated during tumor formation. However, despite their importance, whether there is a mutual interaction between COX-2 and YAP and how they regulate each other are not clear. In this paper, we showed that COX-2 overexpression in HCC cell lines resulted in increased levels of YAP mRNA, protein, and its target genes. COX-2 promoted proliferation of HCC cell lines, and knockdown of YAP antagonized this effect. In addition, our results indicated that EP2 and Wnt/β-Catenin mediate the transcriptional induction of YAP by COX-2. On the other hand, YAP increased COX-2 expression at the level of transcription requiring intact TEAD binding sites in the COX-2 promoter. Collectively, these findings indicated that COX-2 is not only a stimulus of YAP but also a target of Hippo-YAP pathway, thus forming a positive feedback circuit, COX-2-PGE2-EP2-Gαs-β-catenin-YAP-COX-2. In a further study, we showed that inhibition of YAP and COX-2 acted synergistically and more efficiently reduced the growth of HCC cells and tumor formation than either of them alone, suggesting that dual governing of YAP and COX-2 may lead to the discovery of promising therapeutic strategies for HCC patients via blocking this positive feedback loop.
