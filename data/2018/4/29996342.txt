Objective: To investigate the imaging diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of primary hepatic neuroendocrine tumors. Methods: The clinical features, imaging manifestations, histopathological and immunohistochemical findings and interventional therapy of 6 patients identified with pathologically confirmed primary hepatic neuroendocrine tumors were retrospectively analyzed, and the related literatures were reviewed. Results: All 6 patients presented with symptoms of abdominal pain. 4 patients had solitary hepatic mass and 2 patients had multiple hepatic masses. Magnetic resonance imaging showed low signal intensity on T1 weighted imaging, high signal intensity on T2 weighted imaging and clear boundary; the arterial phase of enhancement scan was uneven and enhanced, and portal venous phase or delayed phase showed continuous enhancement, surrounded by ring enhanced capsule. A pathological diagnosis was primary neuroendocrine tumor of the liver. After interventional treatment, 6 patients had some therapeutic effects. Among them, 4 patients underwent multiple interventional therapies, followed by 4 years of follow-up has shown satisfactory results. Conclusion: Primary hepatic neuroendocrine tumors are very rare and their imaging manifestations are specific. Eventually, relies on pathological and immunohistochemical diagnosis. Transarterial chemoembolization therapy can bring satisfactory results in the treatment of primary hepatic neuroendocrine tumor.
