The case of a 64-year-old man with spontaneous acute abdominal bleeding is presented. Under suspicion of an atypical hepatocellular carcinoma an extended left hemihepatectomy was performed. Histological diagnosis after surgical therapy revealed a primary hepatic choriocarcinoma. During follow-up within 5 months several metastases were detected. Because of the number and localization of the metastases, there was no further curative surgical option and palliative systemic chemotherapy was initiated. Primary choriocarcinoma of the liver is an important differential-diagnosis in hypervascularized lesions of the liver. This tumor-entity is highly aggressive, with rapid tendency for metastatic spreading. This correlates with the poor prognosis of 12 months after tumor-detection.
