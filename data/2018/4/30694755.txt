Background:Antithrombin (AT) is not only a major regulator of hemostasis, but it shows anti-inflammatory properties as well. We aimed to investigate whether AT-insufficient mice increase susceptibility to liver tumorigenesis.Methods:We induced the development of liver tumor in AT-insufficient (AT+/-) mice and wild-type (AT+/+) mice by treating them with diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and CCl4. The development of liver tumors and liver inflammation were compared between these mouse groups. Following this, AT was administered to the AT-insufficient mice treated with DEN and CCl4.Results:Tumor size and the number of DEN and CCl4-induced liver tumors significantly increased in AT-insufficient mice compared with the wild-type mice. Serum transaminase levels, cell death, and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 in liver were increased in AT+/-. Furthermore, hepatic neutrophil infiltrations and serum interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor-Î± levels were significantly elevated in AT-insufficient mice. The levels of 8-OHdG, oxidative DNA damage marker, in liver were significantly increased in AT-insufficient mice. Administration of AT led to a significant decrease in DEN- and CCl4-induced liver injury and inflammation in AT-insufficient mice, compared with the wild-type group.Conclusions:AT insufficiency led to increased susceptibility to liver tumorigenesis by increasing hepatic inflammation.
