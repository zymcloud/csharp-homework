Purpose Our previous phase I trial suggested feasibility of addition of leucovorin (LV) to S-1 and gemcitabine therapy in advanced pancreatic cancer. The aim of this phase II trial was to assess the efficacy and toxicity of gemcitabine, S-1 and LV (GSL) combination therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer. Methods Chemotherapy-na√Øve patients with histologically or cytologically proven advanced pancreatic cancer were enrolled. Gemcitabine was administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 by 30 min infusion on days 1, S-1 40 mg/m2 orally twice daily and LV 25 mg orally twice daily on days 1 to 7 every 2 weeks. Primary end point was progression free survival (PFS). Results A total of 49 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (19 locally advanced and 30 metastatic) were enrolled. Overall response rate and disease control rate were 32.7% and 87.8%. The median PFS and overall survival (OS) were 10.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.4-13.5) and 20.7 (95% CI 13.0-NA) months with 1-year survival rate of 73.4%. Major Grade 3-4 toxicities were neutropenia (22.4%) and stomatitis (14.3%). No toxicity related death was observed. Conclusions In this single center, phase II trial, gemcitabine, S-1 and LV combination therapy was tolerable and can potentially be a treatment option for advanced pancreatic cancer.
