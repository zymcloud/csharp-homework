Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major contributor to cancer-related deaths due to its often late stage diagnosis. Our previous study showed that dermcidin (DCD) may have the potential to be used as a serum biomarker for HCC for more timely diagnoses.Materials and methods:In this study, we measured serum DCD and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels in 87 HCC patients; 33 liver cirrhosis (LC); and 44 normal controls (NC), evaluated the relationship between DCD levels and clinicopathological parameters.Results:Serum DCD levels in HCC patients (27.03 ng/mL) were significantly higher than in LC patients (24.78 ng/mL, p Conclusions:Our results showed that serum DCD levels were significantly increased in HCC patients and in cancerous tissue. DCD could potentially be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis of HCC.
