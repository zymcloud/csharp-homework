Purpose of review:The purpose of this review is to summarize the prevalence and clinical implications of the isolated anti-HBc serologic profile in HIV-infected individuals. We highlight the rare but important issue of HBV reactivation in the setting of HCV therapy and describe an approach to management.Recent findings:The isolated anti-HBc pattern, a profile that most often indicates past exposure to HBV with waning anti-HBs immunity, is found commonly in HIV-infected individuals, particularly those with HCV. Some large cohort studies demonstrate an association with advanced liver disease, while others do not. Conversely, meta-analyses have found an association between occult HBV infection (a component of the isolated anti-HBc pattern) and advanced liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma in HIV-uninfected individuals. In HIV-uninfected individuals with anti-HBc positivity, HBV reactivation has been reported in patients receiving HCV therapy. This phenomenon is likely the result of disinhibition of HBV with HCV eradication. In HIV-infected patients, the long-term liver outcomes associated with the isolated anti-HBc pattern remain to be fully elucidated, supporting the need for large cohort studies with longitudinal follow-up. HBV reactivation during HCV DAA therapy has been well-described in HIV-uninfected cohorts and can inform algorithms for the screening and management of the isolated anti-HBc pattern in this population.
