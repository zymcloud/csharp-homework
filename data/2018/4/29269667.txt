A 76-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma associated with alcoholic cirrhosis was hospitalized for lightheadedness and melena. He had undergone multiple surgeries and had been treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and sorafenib. Neither upper nor lower gastrointestinal endoscopy detected the source of bleeding. Oral double-balloon enteroscopy revealed a mass lesion in the upper jejunum, 20 cm from the Treitz ligament on the anal side, which was identified as the source of bleeding. Subsequently, a biopsy was performed. A histopathological examination detected a hepatocellular carcinoma, and a final diagnosis of jejunal metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma was established.
