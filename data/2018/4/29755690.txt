Background:The methylation level of long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) is a good surrogate marker of the global DNA methylation level. The relationship between LINE-1 methylation level and prognosis in primary liver cancer (PLC) patients remains unclear.Results:LINE-1 methylation levels were significantly lower in HCC and cHCC-CC tissues, but not in ICC tissues, than those in noncancerous liver parenchyma (HCC: p < 0.0001; cHCC-CC: p < 0.001; and ICC: p = 0.053). HCC cases with hypomethylated LINE-1 had significantly shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) (log-rank, p = 0.008); however, this was not observed for the cHCC-CC or ICC cases. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed a significantly higher HCC recurrence rate in the group with hypomethylated LINE-1 (hazard ratio, 1.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.58; p = 0.025).Conclusions:The genome-wide DNA hypomethylation status estimated via LINE-1 methylation levels might be indicative of poor RFS in patients with HCC but not ICC or cHCC-CC.Methods:We evaluated the level of LINE-1 methylation in 321 cases of curatively resected PLC {231 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 19 combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) and 71 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC)} via pyrosequencing of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues and examined its prognostic value.
