Recent studies have shown that circular ribonucleic acids have differential expression in some diseases. This study compared the expression levels of five circular ribonucleic acids between patients of primary hepatic carcinoma following liver transplantation and healthy individuals for searching a new diagnostic biomarker about primary hepatic carcinoma. We chose differentially expressed targeted circular ribonucleic acids according to fold change ≥2.0 or ≤-2.0 between circular ribonucleic acids microarray of perioperative liver transplantation and normal controls. Then we used the Arraystar home-made micro-ribonucleic acid target prediction software based on TargetScan and miRanda to predict circular ribonucleic acid/micro-ribonucleic acid interactions. And we assess the expression levels of hsa_circ_100571, hsa_circ_400031, hsa_circ_102032, hsa_circ_103096, and hsa_circ_102347 in the peripheral blood of normal controls and liver transplantation patients before transplantation and on the first, third, and seventh days after transplantation by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We chose five circular ribonucleic acids, two of which have been correlated with micro-ribonucleic acid-related carcinoma recurrence after liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma and analyzed their expression with 2-△△Ct method. The expression level of hsa_circ_100571 and hsa_circ_400031 on day 1 after liver transplantation was higher than pre-transplantation (p < 0.01), and these levels showed a declining trend on post-transplantation. The expression level of hsa_circ_102032 and hsa_circ_103096 on day 1 after liver transplantation was lower than pre-transplantation (p < 0.01) and decreased on post-transplantation. There were the significantly different expressions between the post-transplantation day 7 and normal control (p < 0.01). The expression level of hsa_circ_102347 on day 1 after liver transplantation was lower than pre-transplantation (p < 0.01). This expression showed a declining trend on post-transplantation, and the postoperative day 7 level was similar to normal control (p > 0.05). Five types of circular ribonucleic acid-related micro-ribonucleic acids had varying degrees of upregulation and downregulation between perioperative transplantation of primary hepatic carcinoma patients and normal controls; the hsa_circ_102347 is most likely to have association with primary hepatic carcinoma.
