Previous studies have revealed that HURP (also known as DLGAP5 or KIAA0008) is overexpressed in many types of human cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, squamous cell bladder cancer, and transitional cell carcinoma, indicating that HURP is a putative oncoprotein that promotes carcinogenesis through various molecular mechanisms. However, the role of HURP in the pathogenesis of non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been reported. In the present study, we investigated the prognostic value of HURP among NSCLC patients through the GEO database. The online tool of KM‑plotter was used to identify the correlation of HURP expression and the survival of NSCLC patients. We found the HURP expression at the mRNA level was correlated with the clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis of NSCLC patients. HURP was highly expressed in aggressive NSCLC cells, and its higher expression was associated with shorter survival. Further cytological experiments revealed that the silencing of HURP caused cell cycle arrest and inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC cells. Transwell assay showed that HURP shRNA inhibited cell migration and invasion in vitro. The bioinformatic analysis suggests that HURP promotes carcinogenesis in multiple manners. Taken together, we revealed the prognostic value of HURP in NSCLC patients and HURP may be a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC.
