The authors describe a 31-year-old man admitted due to progressive weight loss, diarrhea and massive hepatomegaly. Laboratory data showed anemia (haemoglobin 11.7 g/dl), abnormal liver tests (total bilirubin 1.4 g/dl, aspartate aminotransferase 70 U/l, alanine aminotransferase 37 U/l and alkaline phosphatase 520 U/l). Abdominal ultrasound (US) displayed a large heterogeneous liver with a segment IV 25 mm nodule. Magnetic resonance revealed a 4 cm pancreatic tail mass and several liver nodules consistent with metastasis. The patient underwent an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with fine needle aspiration (FNA) from the pancreatic mass and liver metastasis with cytological evaluation consistent with a pancreatoblastoma, later confirmed through a percutaneous US-guided liver biopsy. During the inpatient period, liver function deteriorated and acute kidney injury developed. Severe progressive cachexia was observed. The patient was discharged on renal replacement therapy and palliative care. Death occurred 3 months after diagnosis. Pancreatoblastoma is an uncommon pancreatic malignant epithelial cancer of the pancreas, typically occurring in the paediatric population. Adult pancreatoblastoma is extremely rare, with about 40 cases reported in the literature and generally presenting a more aggressive biologic and clinical behaviour. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice, but most cases are detected in advanced stages. This case underlines the ability to establish a pancreatoblastoma cytology-based diagnosis with EUS-FNA, and confirms the associated poor outcome.
