Background:Portal hypertension is a major complication of liver cirrhosis. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt is effective in treatment of portal hypertension. However, decreased parenchymal portal venous flow after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt insertion favours ischaemic liver injury which has been discussed to induce hepatocarcinogenesis causing hepatocellular cancer.Aim:This study aimed to explore the association between transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement and the development of hepatocellular cancer.Methods:A total of 1338 consecutive liver cirrhosis patients were included in this retrospective study between January 2004-December 2015. Data were analysed with regard to development of hepatocellular cancer during follow-up. Binary logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses were conducted for the assessment of risk factors for hepatocellular cancer development. In a second step, to rule out confounders of group heterogeneity, case-control matching was performed based on gender, age, model of end-stage liver disease score and underlying cause of cirrhosis (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, alcoholic liver disease and viral hepatitis).Results:Besides established risk factors such as older age, male gender and underlying viral hepatitis, statistical analysis revealed the absence of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt insertion as a risk factor for hepatocellular cancer development. Furthermore, matched-pair analysis of 432 patients showed a significant difference (p = 0.003) in the emergence of hepatocellular cancer regarding transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement versus the non-transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt cohort.Conclusion:In patients with end-stage liver disease, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt insertion is significantly associated with reduced rates of hepatocellular cancer development.
