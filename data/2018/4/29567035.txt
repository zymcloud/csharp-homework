Background:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can cause chronic HBV infection, which may lead to advanced cirrhosis and liver cancer. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk HBV infection as an occupational hazard. Hepatitis B vaccination of HCWs is recommended by WHO, but the status of hepatitis B vaccination among HCWs in China is seldom reported.Methodology:We conducted a cross-sectional study in 22 hospitals of 3 developed cities in China. We interviewed managers in infectious diseases and occupational health departments, and at least 40 HCWs per hospital.Results:We interviewed 929 HCWs; 80.8% were vaccinated against hepatitis B and 96.7% were willing to be vaccinated; 38.2% of HCWs reported having at least one needle stick or sharps injury. Three hospitals provide free hepatitis B vaccination for HCWs; hospitals with a hepatitis B vaccination policy, more HCWs reported being vaccinated (91.7% vs 79.0%, P < 0.001). HCWs in high risk departments (P = 0.011), with more knowledge of hepatitis B vaccine (P < 0.001), and with fewer working years (P = 0.002) were more likely to be vaccinated against HBV. Infectious diseases and occupational health managers had positive attitudes towards hepatitis B vaccination.Conclusions:Hepatitis B vaccination was well accepted among HCWs. Hospital provision of free vaccine, greater HCW knowledge of HBV, and working in higher-risk settings were associated with being vaccinated. A national policy of offering hepatitis B vaccine to HCWs should be considered in China. Provision of free hepatitis B vaccine for HBsAb negative HCWs may be acceptable. Education about HBV and hepatitis B vaccine may help promote policy implementation.
