Clausena excavata Burm f. is used by traditional healers to treat cancer patients in South East Asia. The use of the plant and its compounds is based on Asian folklore with little or no scientific evidence supporting the therapeutic efficacy The current study aimed to determine the effect of pure clausenidin isolated from C. excavata on caspase-8-induced cell death as well as angiogenesis in the HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. Caspase-8 and extrinsic death receptor protein expression was determined using spectrophotometry and protein profile arrays, respectively. Ultrastructural analysis of clausenidin-treated cells was conducted using transmission electron microscopy. In addition, anti-angiogenic effects of clausenidin were investigated by Western blot analysis. Clausenidin significantly (p
