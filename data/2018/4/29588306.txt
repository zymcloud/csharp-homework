Background: Rates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are markedly higher for baby boomers compared with other birth cohorts, and they are now recommended for universal one-time screening. This study examines HCV screening rates and predictors for four birth cohorts [born <1945, born 1945-1965 (baby boomers), born 1966-1985, and born >1985] of a nationally representative sample over time.Methods: We used data from the 2013-2015 National Health Interview Surveys, an annual weighted survey of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population. We assessed HCV screening prevalence stratified birth cohort with bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses.Results: There were 15,100 participants born <1945, 28,725 baby boomers, 28,089 born 1966-1985, and 13,296 born >1985 in the final analytic sample. Screening was 11.5%-12.8% for baby boomers. The second youngest birth cohort was similar to baby boomers (13.7%-14.9%), whereas the older birth cohort was screened less. After excluding participants who typically have higher rates of HCV screening than the general population, we developed a multivariable model of the general population. In the final model for baby boomers the odds of HCV screening increased significantly with each subsequent year (OR=1.20; 95% CI=1.05-1.38 and OR=1.31; 95% CI=1.13-1.52). HCV screening was also significantly associated with age, gender, and race/ethnicity in baby boomers.Conclusions: While HCV screening is increasing over time, these increases are minimal and there is substantial room for improvement.Impact: Future research should develop interventions to increase HCV screening with special focus on groups demonstrating significantly lower screening rates, such as Hispanics and females.
