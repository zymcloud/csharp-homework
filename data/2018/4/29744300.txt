Sorafenib is an inhibitor of a variety of tyrosine kinase receptors used to treat various cancers including hepatocellular, renal cell and thyroid carcinoma. It has been shown to change various targets associated with osteosarcoma, but the detailed mechanism remains unclear. In order to identify key genes, enriched pathways and important modules during the exposure of human osteosarcoma cells to sorafenib, data for gene expression profiles (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE53155) were downloaded from the GEO database. In total, 61 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by the R bioconductor packages. Functional and enrichment analyses of DEGs were performed using the DAVID database. These revealed that DEGs were enriched in biological processes, molecular function and KEGG pathway of inflammatory immune response and angiogenesis. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed by string and visualized in cytoscape, and eight genes were selected as hubs: IL8,CXCL2,PTGS2,FOS,CXCL1, C3,EHMT2 and PGF. Subsequently, only one cluster was identified by mcode, which consisted of six nodes (CXCL1,CXCL2,PTGS2,FOS, C3 and PGF) and nine edges. PGF was the seed gene in this cluster. In conclusion, the results of this data mining and integration should help in revealing new mechanisms and targets of sorafenib in inhibiting osteosarcoma.
