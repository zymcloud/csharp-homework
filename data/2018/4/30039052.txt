Objective:Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) can measure the changes in tumor blood flow, vascular permeability and interstitial and intravascular volume. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of DCE-MRI in prediction of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging B or C hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) response after treatment with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) followed by sorafenib therapy.Methods:Sorafenib was administered four days after TACE of BCLC staging B or C HCC in 11 patients (21 lesions). DCE-MRI was performed with Gd-EOB-DTPA contrast before TACE and three and 10 days after TACE. DCE-MRI acquisitions were taken pre-contrast, hepatic arterial-dominant phase and 60, 120, 180, 240, 330, 420, 510 and 600 seconds post-contrast. Distribution volume of contrast agent (DV) and transfer constant Ktrans were calculated. Patients were grouped by mRECIST after one month or more post-TACE into responders (complete response, partial response) and non-responders (stable disease, progressive disease).Results:DV was reduced in responders at three and 10 days post-TACE (p = 0.008 and p = 0.008 respectively). DV fell in non-responders at three days (p = 0.025) but was not significantly changed from pre-TACE values after sorafenib. Sensitivity and specificity for DV 10 days post-TACE were 88% and 77% respectively.Conclusion:DV may be a useful biomarker for early prediction of therapeutic outcome in intermediate HCC.
