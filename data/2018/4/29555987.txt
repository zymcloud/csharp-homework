βII-Spectrin (β2SP), a Smad3/4 adaptor protein during transforming growth factor (TGF) β/Smad signal pathway, plays a critical role in suppressing hepatocarcinogenesis. Dedifferentiation is a distinctive feature of cancer progression. Therefore, we investigated whether the disruption of β2SP contributed to tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through the dedifferentiation. Down-regulation of β2SP in hepatocytes was observed in cirrhotic liver and HCC. The level of β2SP expression was closely associated with the differentiation status of hepatocytes in rat model of hepatocarcinogenesis and clinical specimens. Transgenic expression of β2SP in HCC cells promoted the differentiation of HCC cells and suppressed the growth of HCC cells in vitro. Efficient transduction of β2SP into liver CSCs resulted in a reduction in colony formation ability, spheroid formation capacity, invasive activity, chemo-resistance properties, tumorigenicity in vivo. In addition, β2 spectrin exerted its effect through β catenin in liver CSCs. In conclusion, β2 spectrin repressed the properties of liver CSCs through inducing differentiation; thus, strategies to restore its levels and activities would be a novel strategy for HCC prevention and differentiation therapy.
