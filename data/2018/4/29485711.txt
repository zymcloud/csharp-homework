Background:Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis is a leading indication for liver transplantation (LT) worldwide. Access to effective HCV treatment is inequitable globally. We aimed to analyze whether the introduction of effective HCV treatment caused an impact in LT trends in a middle-income country.Methods:Cross-sectional analysis of all adult patients who were listed/received a LT in Argentina for HCV, alcohol-related liver disease (ALD), or autoimmune hepatitis/primary biliary cirrhosis (AIH/PBC) from 2007 to 2017. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to identify changes in the cumulative incidence rates in waiting list (WL) registration, WL mortality, and LT.Results:Liver transplantation WL for HCV increased significantly between 2007 and 2014, with an annual percentage change (APC) +7.8%, P = .01, followed by a downward slope from 2014 to 2017 with an APC -9.8%, P = .1. There were no significant changes in WL mortality. LT trends remained stable. LT for HCV without MELD exception points for HCC decreased (APC -6.6%, P = .01), whereas LT for HCV with HCC exception points increased (APC +11.1, P = .01) during the study period.Conclusion:Waiting list and LT for HCV without HCC decreased, whereas LT for HCV and HCC increased; this may be related to selective antiviral treatment access for patients with advanced fibrosis.
