Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a significant health problem worldwide, and is the leading cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplantation in the United States. The management of HCV has changed significantly over the last 5 years, as treatments have become simpler and more efficacious. Medication efficacy is now greater than 90%, with a high barrier to resistance and few side effects. This review is a collaboration between primary care and hepatology providers to explore all aspects of HCV management: acute versus chronic HCV infection, transmission and testing, and diagnosis and treatment. Specific medications for the treatment of HCV infection are considered, and patient and medication factors including genotype, liver disease status, and comorbidities affecting medication choice are discussed. This is a new era for the management of HCV infection, and interested primary care physicians, family doctors, and general internists can be at the forefront of diagnosis, management, and treatment of HCV.
