Eph receptor‑A1 (EphA1) was the first member of the erythropoietin producing hepatocellular carcinoma (Eph) family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Although the roles of EphA1 in the tumorigenesis of various human cancers have been investigated, few studies have focused on ovarian carcinoma. The present study aimed to explore the profile of EphA1 expression in ovarian carcinomas, to analyzed the association between EphA1 expression and clinicopathologic parameters, and to investigate the roles of overexpressed EphA1 in ovarian cancer cells. EphA1 protein was detected in ovarian cancer cell lines and in a set of formalin‑fixed tissues, including normal fallopian tube, ovarian benign serous cystadenoma, borderline serous tumors and serous carcinoma. Ovarian cancer cell lines HO8910 and A2780 were transiently transfected with EphA1‑pCMV6‑GFP plasmid, and the proliferation and apoptosis of cells were measured. The association between EphA1 expression and clinicopathological parameters was statistically analyzed. EphA1 expression was negative in HO8910 and weakly positive in A2780 cells. The proliferation rate was significantly reduced in ovarian cancer cells after transfection with EphA1 plasmid compared with cells transfected with mock plasmid or untreated cells, but no obvious alteration in apoptosis was detected among these groups. EphA1 expression was positively detected in all normal fallopian tubes (10/10, 100%) and ovarian benign serous cystadenomas (12/12, 100%) as well as in some borderline serous tumors (9/15, 60%) and ovarian serous carcinomas (33/76, 43.42%). EphA1 expression was associated with grade of ovarian serous carcinomas, with loss of EphA1 more often observed in high‑grade tumors (P=0.016) and high Ki67 index tumors (P=0.007). These data suggest that EphA1 might be a useful marker for distinguishing low grade from high‑grade ovarian serous carcinoma.
