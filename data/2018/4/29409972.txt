Obesity is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is typically accompanied by higher levels of serum dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). However, the role of DPP4 in obesity-promoted HCC is unclear. Here, we found that consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) promoted HCC cell proliferation and metastasis and led to poor survival in a carcinogen-induced model of HCC in rats. Notably, genetic ablation of DPP4 or treatment with a DPP4 inhibitor (vildagliptin) prevented HFD-induced HCC. Moreover, HFD-induced DPP4 activity facilitated angiogenesis and cancer cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo, and vildagliptin prevented tumor progression by mediating the pro-angiogenic role of chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2). Loss of DPP4 effectively reversed HFD-induced CCL2 production and angiogenesis, indicating that the DPP4/CCL2/angiogenesis cascade had key roles in HFD-associated HCC progression. Furthermore, concomitant changes in serum DPP4 and CCL2 were observed in 210 patients with HCC, and high serum DPP4 activity was associated with poor clinical prognosis. These results revealed a link between obesity-related high serum DPP4 activity and HCC progression. Inhibition of DPP4 may represent a novel therapeutic intervention for patients with HCC.
