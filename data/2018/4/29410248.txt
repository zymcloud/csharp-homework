The TFCP2/Grainyhead family of transcription factors is divided into two distinct subfamilies, one of which includes the Grainyhead-like 1-3 (GRHL1-3) proteins and the other consists of TFCP2 (synonyms: CP2, LSF, LBP-1c), TFCP2L1 (synonyms: CRTR-1, LBP-9) and UBP1 (synonyms: LBP-1a, NF2d9). Transcription factors from the TFCP2/TFCP2L1/UBP1 subfamily are involved in various aspects of cancer development. TFCP2 is a pro-oncogenic factor in hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer and breast cancer, may be important in cervical carcinogenesis and in colorectal cancer. TFCP2 can also act as a tumor suppressor, for example, it inhibits melanoma growth. Furthermore, TFCP2 is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and enhances angiogenesis. TFCP2L1 maintains pluripotency and self-renewal of embryonic stem cells and was implicated in a wide variety of cancers, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer and thyroid cancer. Here we present a systematic review of current knowledge of this protein subfamily in the context of cancer. We also discuss potential challenges in investigating this family of transcription factors. These challenges include redundancies between these factors as well as their interactions with each other and their ability to modulate each other's activity.
