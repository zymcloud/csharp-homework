Background and aim:Direct acting antiviral has offered treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) recurrence post liver transplantation (LT) with an all-oral regimen for short duration, excellent safety profile, and high sustained virological response (SVR). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir (SOF)-based regimens in the real world among a cohort of Egyptian patients with recurrent HCV post living donor LT (LDLT).Methods:Patients with HCV-G4 recurrence post-LDLT were recruited from National Committee of Control of Viral Hepatitis, Egypt, from November 2014 to May 2017. They received different SOF-based regimens according to the treatment protocols available during this period. Patients' outcome and Adverse effects (AE) were evaluated.Results:One hundred ninety patients (170 males, mean age 56.8 ± 7.9 years) were included. Calcineurin inhibitors were the main immunosuppression used (173 patients). Out of 190, 119 (62.6%) received SOF/ribavirin (RBV), 38 (20%) SOF/simeprevir (SMV), 22 (11.6%) SOF/daclatasvir (DSV)/ ± RBV, and 11 (5.8%) received SOF/LDV/ ± RBV. Overall SVR12 was 89.5%, 84.9% in SOF/RBV group, 94.7% in SOF/SMV, 100% in SOF/DCV, and 100% in SOF/LDV with no statistically significant difference ( P = 0.104). The AE reported were as follows: anemia (n = 65, 34.4%) mainly in SOF/RBV group, transient hyperbilirubinemia during SOF/SMV in 13 patients (34%), mild Acute cellular rejection in eight patients (4.2%), and hepatocellular carcinoma in two patients (1%) mainly driven by underlying liver condition. Two deaths were unlikely related to HCV therapy.Conclusion:Different SOF-based regimens were effective with high SVR12 rates in a difficult-to-treat population, recurrent HCV post LDLT.
