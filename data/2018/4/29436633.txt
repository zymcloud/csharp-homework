In order to identify the potential pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) developing from cirrhosis, a microarray‑based transcriptome profile was analyzed. The GSE63898 expression profile was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, which included data from 228 HCC tissue samples and 168 cirrhotic tissue samples. The Robust Multi‑array Average in the Affy package of R was used for raw data processing and Student's t‑test was used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs). An enrichment analysis was then conducted using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery online tool, and the protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes and Cytoscape. Furthermore, the MCODE plug‑in of Cytoscape was used to conduct a sub‑module analysis. A total of 634 DEGs were identified between HCC and cirrhosis, of which 165 were upregulated and 469 were downregulated. According to the cut‑off criteria, the PPI network was constructed and Jun proto‑oncogene, AP‑1 transcription factor subunit (degree, 39), Fos proto‑oncogene, AP‑1 transcription factor subunit (degree, 34) and v‑myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (degree, 32) were identified as the hub nodes of the PPI network. Based on the sub‑module analysis, four specific modules were identified. In particular, module 1 was significantly enriched in the chemokine signaling pathway, and C‑X‑C motif chemokine ligand 12, C‑C motif chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and C‑C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) were three important proteins in this module. Module 4 was significantly enriched in chemical carcinogenesis, and cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily E member 1, cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member 9 (CYP2C9) and cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily A member 6 (CYP2A6) were three important proteins in this module. In conclusion, the present study revealed that CCR7, CCL5, CYP2C9 and CYP2A6 are novel genes identified in the development of HCC; however, the actual functions of these genes require verification.
