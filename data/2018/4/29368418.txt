Aim:Ileocolonic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are diagnosed as part of bowel cancer screening programmes (BCSPs). The aim of this study was to identify and characterize NETs diagnosed within the English BCSP, a double-screen programme that uses guaic faecal occult blood test (gFOBT) screening and colonoscopy, by interrogating the national colorectal screening database and validating the findings with individual BCSP centres.Method:The Exeter database was interrogated by running queries to identify participants with coded NETs (from the start of the programme in July 2006 - 1 December 2014). A written proforma was sent to the responsible BCSP clinician for validation and characterization.Results:During this period, 13 061 716 participants were adequately screened using gFOBTs, and 259 765 participants had definitively abnormal results. There were 146 unique participants with NET-related codes from 216 707 BCSP colonoscopies. The diagnosis rates per 100 000 colonoscopies were 29 rectal, 18 colonic and 11 ileal NETs. The majority of rectal NETs had Grade 1 (80%) and Stage T1 (85.1%) disease. Over half of ileal NETs (53.6%) in this study had invasive disease, with 85.2% having nodal and 36.1% having metastastatic disease.Conclusion:The current study highlights the rate of colorectal NETs diagnosed in the English BCSP. These data highlight a higher-than-anticipated incidence, and the potential additional benefit of BCSPs in identifying occult NETs.
