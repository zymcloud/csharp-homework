Background:Liver and lungs are the two most frequent sites of metastatic spread of colorectal cancer (CRC). Complete resection of liver and/or lung metastases is the only chance of cure, and several studies have reported an improved survival after an aggressive treatment. Nevertheless, CRC liver metastases (CLM) have been recognized as a pejorative factor for patients undergoing pulmonary metastasectomy. We report our experience with patients successively operated on for CRC hepatic and pulmonary metastasis (CPM) and seek to identify prognostic factors.Methods:All consecutive patients who had resection of CPM and CLM between 2001 and 2014 were enrolled in the study. Clinicopathological and survival data were retrospectively analysed.Results:Forty-six patients underwent resections of both CLM and CPM. Hepatic resection preceded pulmonary resection in most cases (91.3%). The median intervals between the resection of the primary tumour and the hepatic recurrence and between hepatic and pulmonary recurrences were 12 months [0-72] and 21.5 months [1-84], respectively. The mortality rate following CPM resection was 4.3%. After a median follow-up of 41.5 months [0-126], 35 patients recurred of whom 14 (40%) and 11(31.4%) could benefit from repeated resection of recurrent CLM and CPM, respectively. The median and 5-year overall survivals (OS) were 53 months and 49%, respectively. No prognostic factor was identified.Conclusion:An aggressive management of CLM and CPM, including repeated resections, may provide a long-term survival comparable to survival of patients with unique metastasectomy. The absence of prognostic factor may reflect the highly selected pattern of the eligible patients.
