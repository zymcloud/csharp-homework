Liver disease is a growing cause of death in the United Kingdom and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rising (http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/). The combination of an immunosuppressive environment within the liver and suboptimal host anti-tumour immune responses may account for the poor survival outcome of HCC. Understanding how tumours evade immune recognition coupled with new insights into the unique immunological environment within the liver will be critical to developing liver-specific immunotherapies.
