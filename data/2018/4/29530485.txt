Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), the two most common primary liver cancers, represent the second most common cancer-related cause of death worldwide, with most cases being diagnosed at an advanced stage. Recent genome-wide studies have helped to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis and genetic heterogeneity of liver cancers. This review of the genetic landscape of HCC and iCCA discusses the most recent findings from genomic profiling and the current understanding of the pathways involved in the initiation and progression of liver cancer. We highlight recent insights gained from metabolic profiling of HCC and iCCA. This knowledge will be key to developing clinically useful diagnostic/prognostic profiles, building targeted molecular and immunologic therapies, and ultimately curing these complex and heterogeneous diseases.
