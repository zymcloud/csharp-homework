As with other genitourinary malignancies, a variety of paraneoplastic syndromes have been revealed to occur in patients with prostate cancer. Stauffer's Syndrome is a well-described clinical syndrome which manifests via intrahepatic cholestasis in patients with renal cell carcinoma. Less common is intrahepatic cholestasis occurring in association with prostate cancer. The current case report discusses a 67-year-old man presenting with liver failure secondary to intrahepatic cholestasis co-existing with metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma. The patient's liver failure completely resolved with androgen-deprivation therapy suggesting an association between these two entities. The case report evaluates existing literature on this uncommon syndrome including the clinical presentation, natural history, and potential pathophysiology.
