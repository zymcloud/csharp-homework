Recently, increasing evidence has indicated that the presence of tumor infiltrating immune cells has shown predictive significance for many solid tumors. Present study was performed to evaluate the predictive value of stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for the presence of liver metastasis and overall survival in PDAC (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma) patients after complete resection and to explore the potential role of lymphocytes in PDAC. A total of 155 resectable patients with PDAC were enrolled in our study. Stromal TIL density was investigated in hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of surgical specimens and scored. The effect and possible mechanism of lymphocytes on cancer cells was evaluated using co-culture techniques and ELISA test. Stromal TIL negative status (HR = 2.80, 95% CI 1.75-4.48, P < 0.01) was not only an independent predictor of worse OS (HR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.80-4.06, P = <0.01) but also a significant independent predictor of liver metastasis. Higher CEA (P = 0.01) or CA19-9 (P = 0.01) levels were associated with low stromal TIL density. Stromal TIL negative patients appeared to develop tumors with a higher CEA (P = 0.01), larger diameter (P = 0.05) and advanced stage (P = 0.02). The co-culture experiment suggests that lymphocytes can inhibit pancreatic cancer cell proliferation. Further ELISA and cell culture test indicate that lymphocytes may cause pancreatic cancer cells apoptosis through TNF-alpha secretion. Our data suggest a potential favorable role of stromal TILs in predicting liver metastasis and overall survival of patients with PDAC after complete resection. Lymphocytes may inhibit the growth of PDAC through TNF-alpha secretion, which suggest a potential therapeutic approach against PDAC.
