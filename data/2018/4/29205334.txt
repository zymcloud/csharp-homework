Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2-Is) comprise a new class of antidiabetic agents that inhibit glucose reabsorption in the renal proximal tubules. Although a recent report demonstrated the potential ability of SGLT2-Is to attenuate cancer growth of SGLT2-expressing cancer cells, little is known about the effects of SGLT2-Is on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we investigate the anti-cancer properties of a SGLT2-I, canagliflozin, against human liver cancer cells. SGTL2 mRNA and protein expression were detected in Huh7 and HepG2 cells, although not in HLE as well as primary human hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells. Canagliflozin exerted antiproliferative effects on SGLT2-expressing Huh7 and HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner by inhibiting glycolytic metabolism including glucose uptake, lactate and intracellular ATP production. This agent also induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis with inhibited phosphorylation of ERK, p38 and AKT and cleavage of caspase3. Xenograft tumor growth assay showed that oral administration of canagliflozin (10 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced subcutaneous tumor burdens in a glycemic status-independent manner, and attenuated intratumor vascularization in Huh7- and HepG2-derived xenograft tumors in BALB/c nude mice. In vitro, canagliflozin suppressed the increased human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation and tubular formation which were observed in Huh7 or HepG2 co-cultures. By contrast, canagliflozin had no effect on tumor growth and intratumor angiogenesis in SGLT2-null HLE-derived xenograft models. These results indicate that SGLT2-I therapy is a potential new strategy for the treatment of HCC.
