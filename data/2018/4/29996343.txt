Objective: To explore the factors affecting the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) combined with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT), and to analyze the clinical value of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with iodine-125 seed implantation in such patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 53 patients with HCC combined with PVTT was performed. In the study group, 32 cases were treated with TACE combined with iodine-125 seed implantation, and 21 cases in the control group were treated with TACE combined with sorafenib. Survival analysis was carried out on eight factors such as gender, age, Child-Pugh classification, alpha fetoprotein level, portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) type, forms of liver tumor, extra-hepatic metastasis and treatment modalities. The efficacy of TACE combined with iodine-125 seed implantation and TACE combined with sorafenib was further compared. The χ (2) test was used to evaluate the efficacy of the two groups. A single factor survival analysis was calculated by Kaplan-Meier estimator and multifactor survival analysis by Cox proportional hazards model. Results: All 53 patients were successfully treated. The median tumor progression time (mTTP) and median overall survival (mOS) were 8 months and 11 months, respectively. The disease control rate (DCR) of the study group for PVTT was 93.8%, which was significantly higher than that of the control group (61.9%, χ (2) = 6.448, P = 0.011). The difference was statistically significant; the objective remission rate of the study group for PVTT was 75.0%. Significantly higher than 9.5% in the control group, P < 0.05, the difference was statistically significant; the DCR of the primary tumor in the study group was 50.0%, which was lower than the 70.0% of the PVTT in the control group, P = 0.231, the difference was not statistically significant. The progression of primary HCC lesions in patients with multivariate survival analysis: Child-Pugh grade A patients were compared to grade B [Hazard ratio (HR) = 0.236, P = 0.003]; no extra-hepatic metastasis (HR = 0.258, P = 0.002); and TACE combined with iodine-125 seed implantation group compared with TACE combined sorafenib group (HR = 0.372, P = 0.002), the differences were statistically significant. Multivariate survival analysis of patients with overall survival: AFP < 400 ng/mL vs. AFP≥400 ng/mL (HR = 0.389, P = 0.030); Child-Pugh grade A vs. B (HR = 0.263, P = 0.006); and no extra-hepatic metastasis (HR = 0.306, P = 0.006), the differences were statistically significant. Conclusion: TACE combined with iodine-125 seed implantation for the treatment of HCC with PVTT can effectively control the progression of PVTT and intrahepatic lesions and improve the prognosis of patients.
