Background:The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical safety and value of ethanol surgical field infiltration (ESFI), combined with distilled water peritoneal lavage (DWPL), after hepatectomy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rupture.Methods:Rat liver tissue samples were soaked in dehydrated ethanol for different soaking times, and 18 rats were assigned to three groups that underwent different soaking methods of the hepatectomy cut surface. We retrospectively reviewed 45 patients who underwent hepatectomy for treatment of ruptured HCC. Among these, EFSI combined with DWPL was used in 21 patients (DAW group), with only DWPL used in the other 24 patients (DW group). Clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups.Results:For in vitro experiments, the depth of coagulation degeneration and necrosis increased with the duration of soaking. For in vivo experiments, rats in all three groups survived until postoperative day 7 without significant postoperative complication. In patients, the rate of post-operation complication was comparable between the two groups (P = 0.398), with no between-group differences in liver function levels. The incidence of peritoneal dissemination was significantly higher for DW than DAW group (P = 0.037). Kaplan-Meier test identified dehydrated ethanol treatment as a significant factor of disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.036). On univariate analysis, dehydrated ethanol treatment was associated with better prognostic outcomes, although it was not retained as an independent factor of patient outcome.Conclusions:Dehydrated ethanol soaking of the cut surface of the hepatectomy could potentially lower the risk of metastasis and improve the effect of hepatectomy for ruptured HCC as well as showed potential therapeutic value for intraoperative iatrogenic rupture of HCC.
