Background:Microvascular invasion (MVI) is a powerful predictor of recurrence in patients who undergo liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of postoperative adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (PA-TACE) in HCC patients with MVI, and further select potential patients benefitting from PA-TACE.Methods:Patients who had HCC with MVI and underwent liver resection between September 2004 and December 2015 were identified for further analysis. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared between patients treated with and without PA-TACE. Propensity score matching analysis was used to minimize inter-group differences.Results:A total of 176 patients with HCC and MVI were included. In both the entire and propensity-matched cohorts, OS and DFS were higher in PA-TACE group than non-TACE group (all P Conclusion:PA-TACE could be beneficial for patients who have HCC with MVI beyond Milan criteria, but not for those within Milan criteria.
