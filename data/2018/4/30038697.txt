Nontarget embolization from transarterial liver-directed therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma is a rare complication. We present a case of flank skin ulceration after embolization of the inferior phrenic artery supplying tumor. This complication of inferior phrenic artery embolization underscores caution when using small particles to embolize extrahepatic supply to hepatocellular carcinoma.
