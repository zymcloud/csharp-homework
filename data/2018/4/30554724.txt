Background:The impact of the resection margin on survival outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma remains to be determined. This study aimed to examine the association between the width of resection margin and the presence of microvascular invasion in hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:We reviewed data on 2,508 consecutive patients who underwent liver resection for a solitary, hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma for operative morbidity, tumor recurrence, and overall survival.Results:Microvascular invasion was identified histologically in 929 patients (37.0%). A wide margin of resection (â‰¥1 cm, n = 384) resulted in better 5-year recurrence and overall survival versus a narrow margin of resection (Conclusion:The presence of microvascular invasion was associated with a worse prognosis after resection. A wide resection margin resulted in better long-term prognoses versus a narrow resection margin among patients with hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma with microvascular invasion.
