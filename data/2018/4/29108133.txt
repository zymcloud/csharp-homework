Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive tumor with limited systemic and locoregional modalities of treatment. Although microRNA (miRNA) based therapies have significant potential, their targeted delivery remains a major challenge. miR-199a-3p functions as an important tumor suppressor in HCC, which regulates various cellular processes. Recently, peptide-based nanoparticles (NPs) have been developed to deliver oligonucleotides including miRNA. Here, we describe the synthesis and characterization of arginine α,β-dehydrophenylalanine (RΔF) nanoparticles for the selective delivery of miR-199a-3p to restore dysregulated gene expression in HCC. Targeted delivery was achieved by conjugating lactobionic acid (LA) with RΔF NPs (RΔF-LA NPs), a ligand for the asialoglycoprotein receptor known to be overexpressed in HCC cell lines. RΔF-LA NPs condensed miR-199a-3p had an average size of ∼60nm and a zeta potential of ∼+2.54 mV. RΔF-LA/miR NPs were found to be stable in serum as well as against RNase attack. RΔF-LA/miR NPs showed an enhanced cellular uptake and an efficient delivery of miR-199a-3p leading to a significant increase in miR-199a-3p levels (over 500 fold). The increased miR-199a-3p levels remarkably suppressed cell proliferation and migration as well as induced cellular apoptosis and downregulation of the specific target gene (mTOR) in vitro. RΔF-LA/miR NPs showed high tumor/ low organ ratios after intravenous injection into HCC tumor bearing nude mice. RΔF-LA/miR NPs treated mice demonstrated>50% decline in tumor growth, which also corresponded well with suppression of mTOR protein expression, tumor cell proliferation and increased survival rate (P Conclusion:RΔF-LA/miR NPs showed significantly enhanced delivery of the miRNA which underscores their potential for further development as a therapeutic approach for HCC.
