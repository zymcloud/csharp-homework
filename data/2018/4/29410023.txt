Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains the third most common cause of cancer-related mortality. Resection and transplantation are the only curative treatments available, but are greatly hampered by high recurrence rates. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) are considered to be promising anticancer agents in drug development. Currently, four HDACIs have been granted Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for cancer. HDACIs have shown significant efficacy in hematological malignancies. However, they have limited effects in epithelial cell-derived cancers, including HCC, and the mechanisms of these are not elucidated. In this study, our results demonstrated that HDACIs were able to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) in hepatoma cells which are believed to trigger tumor cell invasion and metastasis. We found that HDACIs promoted the expression of Snail and Snail-induced EMT was critical for HDACI-initiated invasion and metastasis. We indicated that HDACIs upregulated Snail in two ways. Firstly, HDACIs upregulated Snail at the transcriptional level by promoting Smad2/3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, then combined with the promoter to activate the transcription of Snail. Secondly, we showed that HDACIs regulated the stabilization of Snail via upregulating the expression of COP9 signalosome 2 (CSN2), which combined with Snail and exposed its acetylation site, then promoted acetylation of Snail, thereby inhibiting its phosphorylation and ubiquitination to repress the degradation of Snail. All these results highlighted that HDACIs have limited effects in HCC, and the use of HDACIs combined with other targeted strategies to inhibit EMT, which explored in this study is a promising treatment method for treating HCC.
