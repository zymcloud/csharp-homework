Since I moved from the National Cancer Center to Shinshu University, I have been performing living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), which is the only way to save the life of patients with end-stage liver disease. In June 1990, we performed the first LDLT that case was the first successful case in Japan. The patient remains healthy and is enjoying a normal life still 28 years after the transplant. In 1993, we successfully performed adult-to-adult LDLT, which was the first successful case in the world. The patient enjoyed a normal life for 17 years until she died at 70 years of age. For small children, the left liver of adult donors is too large to close the abdomen. However, in adolescents or adults, even when the whole right liver is used, the volume of the graft is too small. The concept of the standard liver volume (SLV) has proven very important for this procedure and is calculated as follows: 706.2 Ã— body surface area + 2.4. We proposed a method for evaluating the congestion of the liver by Doppler ultrasound. In addition, we devised the right lateral sector graft. Over the years, we have contributed to LDLT in many ways and published many papers. We feel that our findings are quite useful not only for LDLT but also for other hepatectomy procedures.
