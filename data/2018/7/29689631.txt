Systemic chemotherapy using a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor is an established treatment for advanced-stage tumors in various organs. Comprehensive genomic analyses using next-generation sequencing technology revealed the intra- and intertumor heterogeneity of human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), and provided evidence for the use of therapeutic agents effective against multiple targets in tumor cells. Recently, the efficacy and safety of a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, lenvatinib, was confirmed by a randomized global phase III trial; thus, lenvatinib was approved as first-line therapy for HCC, providing a new therapeutic option for patients at an advanced stage. In this article, we introduce the application of molecular targeted therapy using lenvatinib and discuss future aspects of therapeutic options for advanced HCC.
