With unsatisfactory effects of systemic chemotherapy for treatment of unresectable or advanced hepatoma, local and sustained delivery of chemotherapeutic agents is becoming a promising solution. The in situ administered platforms increase the drug concentrations in tumor regions, decrease the side effects to organs, prevent the damage to vascular endothelium, and reduce the frequency of drug administration. The prevalent strategy based on minimally invasive transarterial chemoembolization oftentimes induces upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, liver failure, and liver abscess. In addition, integrating various antitumor drugs in one platform, especially the drugs with different hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties, and achieving sustained and/or sequential release profiles to synergistically inhibit cancer progression remain challenging. In this study, a local drug delivery system made of an emulsion-electrospun polymer patch was developed, which contained hydrophobic 10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) and hydrophilic tea polyphenols (TP) in the shell and core of the nanofiber, respectively. Due to this core-sheath structure, HCPT and TP exhibited sustained and sequential releases first with HCPT followed by TP. HCPT was used to suppress the proliferation and malignant transformation of hepatoma, whereas TP was aimed to decrease the levels of oxygen free radicals and further prevent the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. Our study presented the potential superiority of this class of core-sheath structured nanofiber membranes in localized treatment of both primary and advanced orthotopic hepatomas.
