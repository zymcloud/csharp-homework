Exosomes are emerging as essential vehicles mediated cross-talk between different types of cells in tumor microenvironment. The extensive exploration of exosomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) enhances our comprehension of cancer biology referring to tumor growth, metastasis, immune evasion, and chemoresistance. Besides, the versatile roles of exosomes provide reasonable explanations for the propensity for liver metastasis of gastric cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. The selective-enriched components, especially some specific proteins and noncoding RNAs in exosomes, have great potential as noninvasive biomarkers of HCC with high sensitivity and specificity. The characteristics of exosomes further inspire frontier research to interrupt intercellular malignant signals by controlling the biogenesis, release, or contents of exosomes.
