Background:Liver cancer continues to be a health priority in Australia, with the majority attributable to preventable causes, and certain populations at higher risk.Aims:Epidemiological assessment of incidence, trends and distribution to inform prevention, and reassessment of data in light of recent changes to registry case definitions.Methods:Reported cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Victoria, Australia, 1984-2013, were obtained from the Victorian Cancer Registry. Demographic characteristics were examined, incidence and survival assessed using Poisson and Cox regression, and geographic distribution mapped. Incidence was compared before and after inclusion of non-histologically confirmed cases in Registry data to assess impacts on incidence trends.Results:Diagnoses of HCC rose substantially between 1984 and 2013, increasing sixfold from 0.9 to 5.9 per 100 000. The rate of increase per year accelerated from 5.3% between 1984 and 2003 to 9.5% between 2004 and 2013. Cases were disproportionately male (80%), median age at diagnosis was 66 years and 53% were born overseas. Even during 2004-2013, 5-year survival was only 16%, although higher among younger people, metropolitan residents and people born overseas. Incidence showed strong geographic clustering. The proportion of cases diagnosed clinically increased from 1% during 1984-2004 to 43% in 2009-2013. The revised case definition added 993 cases (27.3% of total).Conclusion:Cases of HCC are becoming increasingly common, and revised incidence estimates highlight the impact of case definitions in the context of changing diagnostic approaches. The ongoing burden, disproportionate population distribution and low survival emphasise the importance of prevention and early detection as a public health imperative.
