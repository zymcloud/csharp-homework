Strawberry fruits are highly appreciated by consumers worldwide due to their bright red color, typical aroma, and juicy texture. While the biological activity of the complete fruit has been widely studied, the potential beneficial effects of the achenes (commonly named seeds) remain unknown. In addition, when raw fruit and achenes are consumed, the digestion process could alter the release and absorption of their phytochemical compounds, compromising their bioactivity. In the present work, we evaluated the protective effects against oxidative damage of nondigested and digested extracts from strawberry fruit and achenes in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. For that purpose, cells were treated with different concentration of the extracts prior to incubation with the stressor agent, AAPH (2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride). Subsequently, intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the percentage of live, dead, and apoptotic cells were determined. Our results demonstrated that all the evaluated fractions were able to counteract the AAPH-induced damage, suggesting that the achenes also present biological activity. The positive effects of both the raw fruit and achenes were maintained after the in vitro digestion process.
