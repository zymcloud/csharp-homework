Current clinicopathologic staging systems and serum biomarkers poorly discriminate tumor biology in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with high recurrence rates following curative-intent surgical resection and liver transplantation (LT). Identification of accurate biomarkers for improved prognostication and treatment selection is a critical unmet need. We sought to develop a novel "liquid-biopsy" assay capable of detecting HCC circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and characterizing phenotypic subpopulations with prognostic significance. Using HCC cell lines, a tissue microarray, and human blood samples, an antibody cocktail targeting the cell-surface markers asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), glypican-3, and epithelial cell adhesion molecule was optimized for HCC CTC capture using the NanoVelcro CTC Assay. The ability of HCC CTCs and vimentin (VIM)-positive CTCs (a subpopulation expressing an epithelial-to-mesenchymal phenotype) to accurately discriminate tumor stage, recurrence, progression, and overall survival (OS) was evaluated in a prospective study of 80 patients. Multimarker capture detected greater numbers of CTCs than any individual antibody alone for both cell line and patient samples (P
