Background:Although adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) is widely used after liver resection (LR) for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), surgical invasiveness may lead to delay in starting AC, which is preferably started within 8 weeks postoperative. We investigated whether laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) for CRLM facilitates AC start without delay.Methods:Between November 2014 and December 2016, 117 consecutive CRLM patients underwent LR followed by AC. LLR and OLR were performed in 30 and 87 patients, respectively. After propensity score matching on clinical characteristics, oncologic features, and type of resection, the time interval between liver resection and AC start was compared between LLR (n = 22) and OLR (n = 44) groups.Results:After propensity score matching, major LR was performed in 8/22 (36%) and 15/44 (34%) cases of LLR and OLR groups, respectively (P = 1.0). Clinical-pathological characteristic and intraoperative findings were comparable between two groups. There was no significant difference in postoperative complications between the two groups. The time interval between liver resection and AC start was significantly shorter in LLR than in OLR group (43 ± 10 versus 55 ± 18 days, P = 0.012). While 15/44 (34%) patients started AC after 8 weeks postoperative in OLR group, all patients in LLR group started AC within 8 weeks.Conclusions:LLR for CRLM is associated with quicker return to AC when compared to OLR. The delivery of AC without delay allows CRLM patients to optimize the oncologic treatment sequence.
