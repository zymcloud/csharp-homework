microRNA‑188 (miR‑188) acts as a tumor suppressor in various types of human cancer, including glioma, oral squamous cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the function and mechanism of miR‑188 in pediatric osteosarcoma (OS) have yet to be investigated. In the present study reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that miR‑188 expression was significantly downregulated in pediatric OS tissues and cell lines. miR‑188 overexpression markedly suppressed OS cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and induced cellular apoptosis. An in vivo assay demonstrated that miR‑188 overexpression inhibited tumor growth. miR‑188 targeted SOX4 to regulate its expression. miR‑188 expression was inversely correlated with SOX4 in pediatric OS tissues. SOX4 restoration abrogated the inhibitory effects of miR‑188 on OS cells. The results of the present study indicated that miR‑188 suppressed pediatric OS progression by targeting SOX4.
