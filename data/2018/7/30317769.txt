Objective: To construct the mmu-miR-155 eukaryotic overexpression vector pmR-155 and to investigate its effect on HBV replication and expression of PTEN in vivo. Methods: The mmu-mir-146a precursor gene fragment pre-mmu-mir-146a was amplified by PCR, then connected to the pmR-mCherry plasmid vector after double enzyme digestion, the accuracy of recombinant vector was verified by colony PCR、double enzyme digestion and sequencing; then the recombinant vector was transfected HBV transgene mice(Experimental Group)with hydrodynamics-based injection via vena caudalis, and pmR-mCherry plasmid、PBS were respectively transfected into the mice as Empty plasmid Group、Blank Group. The concentration of IFN-γ in the serum was detected by ELISA. The expression of SOCS1、PTEN mRNA in the liver was detected by qPCR at 30d post-transfectioned. The Western blot was performed to detect the changes in SOCS1、PTEN、HBX in the liver tissue at 30 d post-transfectioned. The results were analyzed with Student's t-test, or one-way analysis of variance and the least significant difference test. Results: the colony PCR、double enzyme digestion and sequencing verified that the gene was inserted into the pmR-mCherry vector. Compared with Blank Group, the expression of miR-155 in the Experimental Group was significantly increased(t = 8.90, P < 0.01); the concentration of IFN-γ in the Experimental Group was significantly increased(F = 26.58, P < 0.01); the mRNA(F(SOCS1 mRNA) = 19.72, P < 0.01; F(PTEN mRNA) = 7.38, P < 0.05) and protein(F(SOCS1) = 50.30, P < 0.01; F(PTEN) = 129.00, P < 0.01) expression of COCS1、PTEN was significantly decreased in the Experimental group and the protein of HBX was also significantly(F(HBX) = 77.97, P < 0.01). Conclusion: The pmR-155 eukaryotic overexpression vector is successfully constructed, this recombinant vector can express miR-155 stably; miR-155 can down-regulate cocs1、PTEN gene expression and up-regulate the expression of IFN-γ, it can inhibit the replication of HBV and a potential targets to treating hepatocellular carcinoma.
