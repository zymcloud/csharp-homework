Background:Programmed death ligand 1/2 (PD-L1/PD-L2) expression has been established as a prognostic factor for various solid tumors and as a predictive factor for PD-1 blockade therapy, but scant data on its role in gallbladder cancer (GBC). The aims of this study were to assess the expression of PD-L1/PD-L2 and the density of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from GBC samples and to quantify the association between survival prognosis and these factors.Methods:CD8+ TILs density and the expression of PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2 and CD133 were assessed using immunohistochemistry in tumor specimens from 66 patients with gallbladder adenocarcinoma. These indexes were correlated with the clinicopathological features.Results:The rate of PD-L1-positive (PD-L1+) was 54%, which included 18% positivity in tumor cells, and 36% in peritumoral immune stroma. High CD8+ TIL density (CD8high) was observed in PD-L1+ GBC, and PD-L1+ was positively associated with PD-L2+ expression. Regarding prognostic factors, PD-L1+ expression was related to worse overall survival (OS), and CD8high indicated better OS and progression-free survival (PFS). The combination of CD8high with PD-L1+ serves as a prognostic factor for improved OS (P < 0.001) and PFS (P = 0.014).Conclusion:Analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment based on CD8+ TIL and PD-L1 expression is a promising independent predictor for the clinical outcome of GBC patients.
