Given that Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling acts as a critical survival input for hypoxic cancer cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), disruption of YAP function and the maintenance of hypoxia is an attractive way to treat HCC. Utilizing a cell-based YAP-TEAD luciferase reporter assay and functional analyses, we identified CT-707, a China-FDA approved multi-kinase inhibitor under clinical trial with remarkable inhibitory activity against YAP function. CT-707 exhibited prominent cytotoxicity under hypoxia on HCC cells, which was attributable to the inhibition of YAP signaling. CT-707 arrested tumor growth in HepG2, Bel-7402, and HCC patient-derived xenografts. Mechanistically, the inhibitory activity of CT-707 on YAP signaling was due to the interruption of hypoxia-activated IGF1R. Overall, these findings not only identify CT-707 as a promising hypoxia-targeting agent against HCC, but they also unveil IGF1R as a new modulator specifically regulating hypoxia-activated YAP signaling.Significance: CT-707 may represent a novel clinical approach for patients with HCC suffering poor drug response due to intratumor hypoxia.
