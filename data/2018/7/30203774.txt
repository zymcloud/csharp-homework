Sorafenib is a new multi-target oral drug that inhibits many kinds of protein kinase small molecules to treat tumors. Currently, sorafenib is one of the drugs that permit systemic treatment of liver cancer in the middle stage. Although sorafenib has good therapeutic effect on liver cancer, the clinical effect of sorafenib alone in the treatment of liver cancer is limited. This study compared the efficacy of sorafenib, TACE (transcatheter arterial chemoembolization), and sorafenib combined with TACE in the treatment of liver cancer patients. The results showed that the curative effect of sorafenib combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization is better than that of hepatic artery chemoembolization or sorafenib orally. The total effective rate of combined treatment is 93.8%, while the effective rate of arterial chemoembolization and sorafenib is 64.1% and 72.2% respectively. Combined treatment can significantly prolong the total survival of the patients with liver cancer, which is significantly different from that of arterial chemoembolization or sorafenib alone.
