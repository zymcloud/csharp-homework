The long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) PVT1 plays vital roles in the tumorigenesis and development of various types of cancer. However, the potential expression profiling, functions and pathways of PVT1 in HCC remain unknown. PVT1 was knocked down in SMMC‑7721 cells, and a miRNA microarray analysis was performed to detect the differentially expressed miRNAs. Twelve target prediction algorithms were used to predict the underlying targets of these differentially expressed miRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to explore the underlying functions, pathways and networks of the targeted genes. Furthermore, the relationship between PVT1 and the clinical parameters in HCC was confirmed based on the original data in the TCGA database. Among the differentially expressed miRNAs, the top two upregulated and downregulated miRNAs were selected for further analysis based on the false discovery rate (FDR), fold‑change (FC) and P‑values. Based on the TCGA database, PVT1 was obviously highly expressed in HCC, and a statistically higher PVT1 expression was found for sex (male), ethnicity (Asian) and pathological grade (G3+G4) compared to the control groups (P
