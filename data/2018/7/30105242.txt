Purpose:The purpose of this study was to assess and compare diagnostic ability of LI-RADS (LR) v. 2017 and ESGAR guidelines in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis using MRI with hepatobiliary contrast agents.Methods:Seventy pathologically confirmed lesions in 32 patients (24 males and 8 females) who had MRI with hepatobiliary contrast done before surgery or biopsy were reviewed retrospectively. Six lesions were Results:For LR â‰¥ 4 sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC were 96%, 75%, 88.6%, and 85.5, respectively. For LR5 they were 74%, 95%, 80%, and 84.5, respectively. For ESGAR criteria with major and additional features, they were 88%, 75%, 84.3%, and 81.5, respectively. For ESGAR criteria only with major features they were 78%, 80%, 78.6%, and 79, respectively. AUC analysis revealed that overall diagnostic ability of LI-RADS was higher than ESGAR but the results did not show statistical significance.Conclusions:Both LI-RADS and ESGAR guidelines presented high diagnostic ability in HCC diagnosis of MRI studies with hepatobiliary contrast agents. More complex LI-RADS criteria performed better than ESGAR guidelines and it may justify extra effort that needs to be put in the report. However, the results were not statistically different and the simplicity of the ESGAR guidelines should also be taken into consideration.
