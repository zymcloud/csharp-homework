Tumor metastasis accounts for 90% of all cancer-related deaths. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) considered to be centrally important in acquired resistance to chemotherapy and in progression of tumors to secondary organs. One of the important mediators of metastatic progression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the metastasis associated protein 1 (MTA-1). We have earlier shown that in the context of HCC and normal liver cell lines, MTA-1 protein is actively stabilized in HCC cell lines and actively degraded in normal liver cells. We have also shown that TRIM25 is the E3 ligase that interacts with and degrades MTA-1 protein. The identity of the factor regulating expression of TRIM25 in normal liver cells and HCC is unknown. In the current work we elucidate that microRNA (miR)- 873 targets TRIM25 in HCC cells. Both metagenomic analysis and quantification of miR-873 and TRIM25 in 25 HCC patients revealed an inverse correlation between the two in HCC patients with high miR-873 and low TRIM25 expression, respectively. The expression pattern was mimicked in the normal liver cells THLE-2 and the HCC cell line, HuH6. In vitro luciferase reporter assays confirmed TRIM25 as the target of miR-873. Transient transfection of HuH6 cells with an anti-miR-873 antagomir significantly decreased both transwell motility in these cells. Furthermore, in in vivo xenograft assays treatment with anti-miR-873 antagomir significantly decreased hepatic nodules formation. Cumulatively, our data indicate that suppression of TRIM25 expression by high levels of miR-873 dictates MTA1 protein upregulation in HCC.
