Previous studies suggested that chromodomain helicase DNA-binding proteins (CHDs), including CHD 1-8, were associated with several human diseases and cancers including lymphoma, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, etc. To date, little research on CHD 9 in human cancers has been reported. In this study, we assessed the prognostic value of CHD 9 in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). We screened for CHD 9 expression using immunohistochemical analysis in 87 surgical CRC specimens and found that the expression was upregulated in 81.5% of the cases, while 7.4% were decreased; in the remaining 11.1% of the cases, levels were not altered. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with high CHD 9 expression had better prognosis than those with low CHD 9 expression (54.5 vs 32.1%, P=0.034). Subsequently, Cox multi-factor survival regression analysis revealed that expression of CHD 9 protein was an independent predictor for CRC, with a hazard ratio of 0.503 (P=0.028). In addition, we found that CHD 9 expression was positively correlated with MSH2 (rs=0.232, P=0.036). We speculated that CHD9 might be a putative tumor suppressor gene, and could inhibit the development of CRC by participating in DNA repair processes. Our findings suggest that CHD 9 could be a novel prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for CRC. Further studies are needed to detect the effect of CHD 9 on cellular function and the expression of mismatch repair genes.
