The most common sites for prostate cancer metastasis include bone, distant lymph nodes, liver and lungs. Renal metastasis of prostate cancer is a rarely seen pattern of invasion. In the current study, we described an 83-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer. He was admitted because of edema, hyperemia, warm and pain at left leg and inguinal region. In the further evaluation, a mass lesion at prostate region and conglomerate lymphadenopathy at left iliac vascular trajectory and a mass lesion at left kidney with heterogeneous contrast-enhancement were observed on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography scan. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy was performed in the lesion with radiologically suspect renal cell carcinoma. By evaluating histopathological features and immunohistochemical staining of the tumor, we decided that the lesion was metastasis from prostate cancer.
