Increasing evidences suggested that radiotherapy can paradoxically promote tumor invasion and metastatic processes, while its detailed mechanism is not well illustrated. Our present study found that radiation can promote the migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells via induction of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), which was evidenced by the results that radiation induced up regulation of vimentin while down regulation of E-Cadherin. As to the EMT-related transcription factors, radiation increased the expression of Snail, while not Slug, ZEB1 or TWIST. This was confirmed by the results that radiation increased the nuclear translocation of Snail in HCC cells. However, radiation had no effect on the expression or half-life of Snail mRNA. In HCC cells treated by cycloheximide (CHX, the translation inhibitor), radiation significantly increased the half-life of Snail protein, which suggested that radiation increased the expression of Snail via up regulation of its protein stability. Radiation increased the expression of COP9 signalosome 2 (CSN2), which has been reported to block the ubiquitination and degradation of Snail. Silence of CSN2/Snail can attenuate radiation induced cell migration and EMT of HCC cells. Collectively, our data suggested that radiation can promote HCC cell invasion and EMT by stabilization of Snail via CSN2 signals.
