Trans-arterial embolization is a commonly used therapy in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Current methods involve the careful placement of an intraarterial catheter and the deposition of embolizing particles. Gas embolotherapy has been proposed as an embolization method with the potential for high spatial resolution without the need for a catheter. This method involves vaporizing intravenouslyadministered droplets into gas bubbles using focused ultrasound - a process termed acoustic droplet vaporization. The bubbles can become lodged in the vasculature, thereby creating an embolus. Here, we initially demonstrate the feasibility of achieving significant targeted embolization with this method in the rat cremaster using intravital microscopy. The therapy was then tested in an ectopic xenograft mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma. Gas embolotherapy was shown to maintain the tumor volume at baseline over a twoweek treatment course while control groups showed significant tumor growth. These preliminary results demonstrate thatgas embolotherapy could serve as an effective noninvasive method for the management of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.
