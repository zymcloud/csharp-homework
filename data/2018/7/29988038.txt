Hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein contributes to the progression of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatic injury and diseases, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. Protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A) is a major serine/threonine phosphatase involved in regulating many cellular phosphorylation signals that are important for regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis. Does HBx target to PP2A-B56γ and therefore affect HBx-induced hepatotoxicity? In the present study, the expression of B56γ positively correlated with the level of HBx in HBV-infected primary human hepatocytes in human-liver-chimeric mice, HBx-transgenic mice, HBV-infected cells, and HBx-expressing hepatic cells. B56γ promoted p53/p21-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Mechanistically, B56γ was transactivated by AP-1, which was under the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced CREBH signaling in HBx-expressing hepatic cells. B56γ dephosphorylated p-Thr55-p53 to trigger p53/p21 pathway-dependent cell cycle G1 phase arrest, resulting in apoptosis of hepatic cells. In conclusion, this study provides a novel insight into a mechanism of B56γ mediating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of HBx-expressing hepatic cells and a basis for B56γ being a potential therapeutic target for HBV-infected hepatic cells.
