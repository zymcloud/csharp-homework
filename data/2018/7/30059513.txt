Convincing data that support routine use of preventive therapy against hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in radiotherapy (RT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence, clinical significance, and risk factors of HBV reactivation after RT. Medical records of 133 HBsAg (+) HCC patients who received radiotherapy from March 2009 to February 2016 were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: 1) non-antiviral group, those who did not receive antiviral therapy before RT (n = 27); and antiviral group (those who underwent antiviral therapy before RT) (n = 106). Factors related to HBV reactivation in HCC patients were evaluated. 17 (12.7%) of 133 patients developed HBV reactivation after RT. Patients in the antiviral group had significantly lower rates of HBV reactivation than those in the non-antiviral group (7.5% vs. 33.3%, p
