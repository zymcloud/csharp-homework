Background:Combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) is a rare form of primary liver tumor. A specific staging system for predicting survival in patients with cHCC-CC is not available. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of staging systems and inflammation-based scores to predict overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with cHCC-CC after surgical resection.Methods:The data from 99 patients with cHCC-CC after surgical resection from June 2000 and January 2017 were retrospectively collected. Patients were allocated into HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma)-dominant (IHD) group and ICC (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma)-dominant (IID) group based on radiological characteristics. Similarly, patients were also divided into HCC-dominant (PHD) group and ICC-dominant (PID) group based on pathological characteristics. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify variables associated with OS and PFS. The prognostic value of staging systems and inflammation-based scores were analyzed and compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.Results:The 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 82.6, 66.3, and 59.6%, respectively. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year PFS rates were 52.2, 38.1, and 31.5%, respectively. Independent prognostic factors identified by multivariate analyses included HCC-TNM staging system and tumor diameter both for OS and PFS analyses. HCC-TNM staging system displayed higher area under ROC curve (AUC) values than the other staging systems or inflammation-based scores.Conclusions:HCC-TNM staging system was able to adequately predict prognosis of patients with cHCC-CC after surgical resection, especially for patients with HCC-dominant characteristics in clinical practice.
