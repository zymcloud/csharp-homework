Recent preclinical studies have suggested an antifibrotic role for tricyclic antidepressants (TCA). Using the Electronically Retrieved Cohort of hepatitis C virus (HCV) Infected Veterans, we aimed to evaluate the impact of TCA use on fibrosis progression and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among HCV-infected persons. Subjects were categorized according to use of TCAs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or no antidepressants. TCAs or selective serotonin uptake inhibitors use was defined according to cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD), and categories were mutually exclusive. Subjects with HIV coinfection, hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) positivity, cirrhosis or HCC at baseline were excluded. Outcomes were liver fibrosis progression measured by APRI scores and incident HCC. We utilized Cox proportional hazards regression to determine predictors of cirrhosis, defined as APRI > 2, and incident hepatocellular carcinoma (iHCC). Among 128 201 eligible HCV+ persons, 4% received TCAs, 43% received selective serotonin uptake inhibitors, and 53% received no antidepressants. Fewer TCAs users had drug abuse (34% and 43%) and alcohol abuse (32% vs 42%) compared to selective serotonin uptake inhibitor users. After adjusting for age, baseline APRI score, diabetes, hypertension, alcohol use, drug abuse and HCV RNA levels, TCAs use was associated with decreased risk of cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.60, 0.99) and delayed time to development of cirrhosis, but not with decreased iHCC. In conclusion among a large cohort of HCV-positive Veterans, TCAs use was associated with decreased fibrosis progression and lower risk of developing cirrhosis. These data provide supportive evidence for the beneficial effects of TCAs on progression of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV infection.
