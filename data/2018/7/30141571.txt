Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major global health problem affecting 3-5 million people in the United States and over 100 million worldwide. Chronic HCV infection, which can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, also results in numerous other complications, including impairment of renal function. Because HCV is most often transmitted via parenteral exposure to blood or blood products, patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) treated with hemodialysis are at particular risk for infection. Historically, the medications available to treat HCV infection in these patients had significant side effects and were not particularly effective in generating a sustained virologic response. Since 2011, a number of direct-acting antiviral therapies have emerged that can lead to virological cure in the vast majority of patients, with low pill burden and few side effects. Here, we describe the biology and pathophysiology of HCV infection, and summarize current information on new therapies, with a particular focus on their application in patients with chronic kidney disease including ESRD.
