Delayed gastrointestinal metastasis is a rare complication of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We present the case of a patient who presented with melaena and microcytic anaemia 6 years after receiving an orthotopic liver transplant for hepatitis B-induced HCC. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a fungating gastric mass at the lesser curve and histology from biopsies confirmed metastatic recurrence of HCC in the stomach. The route of metastasis is likely due to iatrogenic seeding of tumour cells during pre-transplant endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Subsequent positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging failed to reveal further metastatic disease and the patient was managed with a total gastrectomy. This is the first reported description in the literature of needle-track metastasis in the stomach due to liver EUS-FNA for HCC.
