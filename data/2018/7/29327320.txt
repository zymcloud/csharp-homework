Forty-four endophytic fungal isolates obtained from marine sponge, Hyrtios erectus, were evaluated and screened for their hydrolase activities. Most of the isolates were found to be prolific producers of hydrolytic enzymes. Only 11 isolates exhibited maximum cellular contents of lipids, rhamnolipids, and protein in the fungal isolates under the isolation numbers MERVA5, MERVA22, MERVA25, MERVA29, MERVA32, MERVA34, MERV36, MERVA39, MERVA42, MERVA43, and MERVA44. These isolate extracts exhibit the highest reducing activities against carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes including α-amylase, α-glucosidase, β-glucosidase, β-glucuronidase, and tyrosinase. Consequently, based on morphological and cultural criteria, as well as sequence information and phylogenetic analysis, these isolates could be identified and designated as Penicillium brevicombactum MERVA5, Arthrinium arundinis MERVA22, Diaporthe rudis MERVA25, Aspergillus versicolor MERVA29, Auxarthron alboluteum MERVA32, Dothiorella sarmentorum MERVA34, Lophiostoma sp. MERVA36, Fusarium oxysporum MERVA39, Penicillium chrysogenum MERVA42, Penicillium polonicum MERVA43, and Trichoderma harzianum MERVA44. The endophytic fungal species, D. rudis MERVA25, P. polonicum MERVA43, Lophiostoma sp. MERVA36, A. alboluteum MERVA32, T. harzianum MERVA44, F. oxysporum MERVA39, A. versicolor MERVA29, and P. chrysogenum MERVA42 extracts, showed significant hepatitis C virus (HCV) inhibition. Moreover, D. sarmentorum MERVA34, P. polonicum MERVA43, and T. harzianum MERVA44 extracts have the highest antitumor activity against human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2).
