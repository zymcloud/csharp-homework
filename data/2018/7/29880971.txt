Objectives:Optimal adherence to nucleoside analogue treatment is necessary to achieve undetectable levels of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and to prevent cirrhotic complications. However, any large long-term follow-up study has not been investigated the effect of adherence to entecavir (ETV) treatment on specific liver-related events (LREs), namely, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cirrhotic complications, and mortality.Methods:This was a 10-year longitudinal observational study of treatment-naïve patients with CHB who received ETV treatment. The primary outcome was the cumulative probability of LREs. The cumulative level of adherence to medication was categorized as good (≥90%) or poor (Results:Data from 894 treatment-naïve CHB patients who received ETV were analyzed. Overall mean adherence rates were 89.1%. Patients with poor adherence had a higher risk of virologic breakthrough (VBT) (HR, 22.42; 95% CI, 19.57-52.52; P Conclusions:Poor adherence to medication was associated with a higher mortality and greater risk of HCC and cirrhotic complications, particularly among patients with liver cirrhosis.
