Purpose:To assess the radiopathologic correlation following Yttrium-90 transarterial radioembolization (TARE) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using variable radiodosimetry to identify imaging surrogates of histologic response.Methods:Twelve patients with HCC underwent ablative (â‰¥ 190 Gy) and/or non-ablative (Results:Complete pathologic necrosis (CPN) was observed in 7/12 tumors post-TARE. Ablative and non-ablative dosing resulted in CPN in 5/6 and 2/6 tumors, respectively. Hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging, the absence of hepatocyte-specific gadolinium contrast uptake, and plateau or persistent enhancement kinetics in the angiosome correlated with CPN and performed similarly to EASL and mRECIST criteria in predicting CPN.Conclusions:The absence of hepatocyte-specific contrast uptake, increased signal on T2-weighted sequences, and plateau or persistent enhancement in the angiosome may represent MRI surrogates of CPN following TARE of HCC. These findings correlated with EASL and mRECIST response criteria. Further investigation is needed to determine the role of these findings as possible adjuncts to conventional imaging criteria.
