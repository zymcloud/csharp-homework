Purpose:Metastatic breast cancer is resistant to many conventional treatments and novel therapeutic targets are needed. We previously isolated subsets of 4T1 murine breast cancer cells which metastasized to liver (4TLM), brain (4TBM), and heart (4THM). Among these cells, 4TLM is the most aggressive one, demonstrating mesenchymal phenotype. Here we compared secreted proteins from 4TLM, 4TBM, and 4THM cells and compared with that of hardly metastatic 67NR cells to detect differentially secreted factors involved in organ-specific metastasis.Method and results:Label-free LC-MS/MS proteomic technique was used to detect the differentially secreted proteins. Eighty-five of over 500 secreted proteins were significantly altered in metastatic breast cancer cells. Differential expression of several proteins such as fibulin-4, Bone Morphogenetic Protein 1, TGF-β1 MMP-3, MMP-9, and Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin were further verified using ELISA or Western blotting. Many of these identified proteins were also present in human metastatic breast carcinomas. Annexin A1 and A5, laminin beta 1, Neutral alpha-glucosidase AB were commonly found at least in three out of six studies examined here. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed that proteins differentially secreted from metastatic cells are involved primarily in carcinogenesis and TGF-β1 is the top upstream regulator in all metastatic cells.Conclusions:Cells metastasized to different organs displayed significant differences in several of secreted proteins. Proteins differentially altered were fibronectin, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7, and Procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 1. On the other hand, many exosomal proteins were also common to all metastatic cells, demonstrating involvement of key universal factors in distant metastatic process.
