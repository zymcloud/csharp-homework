Introduction:Extensive research has provided a link between HBV variants and the clinical complications of liver diseases. This study was performed to further investigate the relationship between HBV variants in preS, S and BCP/PC regions and disease progression in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) cases in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.Methodology:182 CHB patients were recruited for this study. HBV DNA was amplified by PCR in the PreS, S, and BCP/PC regions. Sequences were generated from 31 and 26 treated cases in PreS and S regions respectively and from 72 cases in the BCP/PC region.Results:The majority of cases (86.7%) were genotype D. Mutations at preS1-A2922C, X-A1624C and PC-G1887A were detected only in cases with either a high fibrosis score or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while mutations at positions PC-C1982A, PC-G1951T, X-C1628T and X-A1630G were detected more frequently in HCC cases, without reaching statistical significance. Seven deletions were detected in the PreS-region. No deletions were detected in the CCAAT box. The accumulation of mutations per sample in the preS1-2 and S regions were associated with elevated ALT (p Conclusion:Our results add to the knowledge about HBV genotype-D variants. The accumulation of mutations per sample and OBI seem to play a role in the progression of HBV infection. G1896A was associated with the HBeAg negativity. The preS deletions did not play a role in liver disease progression.
