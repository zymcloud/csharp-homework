Introduction:Long-term survival is still rarely achieved with current systemic treatment in patients with breast cancer liver metastases (BCLM). Extended survival after hepatectomy was examined in a select group of BCLM patients.Patients and methods:Hepatectomy for BCLM was performed in 139 consecutive patients between 1985 and 2012. Patients who survived < 5 years were compared to those who survived ≥ 5 years from first diagnosis of hepatic metastases. Predictive factors for survival were analyzed. Statistically cured, defined as those patients who their hazard rate returned to that of the general population, was analyzed.Results:Of the 139, 43 patients survived ≥ 5 years. Significant differences between patient groups (< 5 vs. ≥ 5 years) were mean time interval between primary tumor and hepatic metastases diagnosis (50 vs. 43 months), mean number of resected tumors (3 vs. 2), positive estrogen receptors (54% vs. 79%), microscopic lymphatic invasion (65% vs. 34%), vascular invasion (63% vs. 37%), hormonal therapy after resection (34% vs. 74%), number of recurrence (40% vs. 65%) and repeat hepatectomy (1% vs. 42%), respectively. The probability of statistical cure was 14% (95% CI 1.4-26.7%) in these patients.Conclusions:Hepatectomy combined with systemic treatment can provide a chance of long-term survival and even cure in selected patients with BCLM. Microscopic vascular/lymphatic invasion appears to be a novel predictor for long-term survival after hepatectomy for BCLM and should be part of the review when discussing multidisciplinary treatment strategies.
