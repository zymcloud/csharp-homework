Purpose:In this study, we compare an abbreviated screening MRI protocol (aMRI), utilizing only dynamic contrast-enhanced images, to a conventional liver MRI (cMRI) for the characterization of observations in at-risk patients.Materials and methods:164 consecutive HCC screening MRIs were retrospectively analyzed. Two sets of de-identified image sets were created: one with all acquired sequences including T2- and diffusion-weighted sequences (cMRI), and one with only T1-weighted precontrast and dynamic post-contrast images utilizing an extracellular gadolinium contrast agent (aMRI). Three readers assigned a LI-RADS score based on the lesion with the highest LI-RADS category using the aMRI and cMRI datasets during separate reads.Results:There was no change between the aMRI and cMRI LI-RADS categorization in 93%, 96%, and 96% of cases for readers 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In the majority of the discrepant cases, the score increased from LI-RADS 3 to LI-RADS 4 due to the presence of ancillary features on T2 and DWI. Kappa values for interobserver variability demonstrated fair-to-moderate LI-RADS agreement among the 3 readers.Conclusion:There was strong agreement between the abbreviated T1-only MRI protocol and a full liver MRI, with only 5% of cases changing LI-RADS categorization due to the inclusion of T2 and DWI. The estimated time to run this abbreviated MRI is approximately 7-10 min, possibly allowing for a more cost-effective screening MRI than our cMRIs.
