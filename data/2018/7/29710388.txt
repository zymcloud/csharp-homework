Both sorafenib and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTORi) have antitumor effects. This study aimed to evaluate their antitumor effects in liver transplantation (LT) recipients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence. We performed a laboratory study using sorafenib and mTORi and subsequently validated their survival benefit in a clinical LT setting. In the laboratory study, the HepG2.2.15 liver tumor cell line and 5 patient-derived graft HCC cell lines were used for in vitro cytotoxic studies. After treatment with everolimus and sorafenib, cell viability and apoptosis assays revealed noticeable cytotoxic effects with individual agents and augmented effects by combination therapy. An in vivo mouse study also demonstrated similar cytotoxic outcomes. In the clinical study including 232 LT recipients with HCC recurrence, the 3-month medication drop-out rate was 35.6% for sorafenib administration and 23.5% for mTORi administration. Postrecurrence survival rates were not different according to sorafenib administration (P = 0.17) but were significantly improved following mTORi administration (P
