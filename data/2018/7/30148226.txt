Liver resection (LR), liver transplantation (LT), transarterial chemoembolization, and local ablation therapy are the treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although LR, LT and local ablation therapy (only for small tumor) provide the best hope for cure, most patients with HCC have also chronic liver disease (CLD) backgrounds, including HCV-liver cirrhosis. Therefore, they are at high risk for development of postoperative complications-sometimes fatal-and metachronous multicentric recurrent tumors occurring from the preneoplastic CLD background. Appropriate treatment is selected for HCC patients, on the combined evaluations of tumor condition and liver function. However, not small number of patients cannot undergo any treatment option due to poor liver function and/or complicated tumor condition. After repeated treatments, it can happen more often. It is thought that the features of laparoscopic LR could lead to the expansion of the LR indication to those patients, in the settings of severe CLD, repeat LR and bridging to LT. In our experience, Child-Pugh (CP) score is one of the promising candidates as a selection indicator which correlates well to our indication criteria of surface small laparoscopic LR to severe CLD patients, patient's performance status, and prognosis. Portal hypertension should be also counted in the selection criteria.
