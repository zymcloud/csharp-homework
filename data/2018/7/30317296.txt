Objective:To determine the diagnostic accuracy of Glypican-3 in differentiating hepatocellular carcinoma from metastatic liver tumours while taking histopathology as the gold standard..Methods:The cross-sectional study was conducted at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan, from January 1 to June 30, 2016, and comprised cases of malignant liver tumours. Samples were collected from the pathology department. Glypican-3was applied on them. Tumours were classified as positive when they showed >5% positivity and negative when showing Results:Of the 240 patients, 143(59.58%) were males and 97 (40.42%) were females. Overall mean age was 54.65 Â± 13.46 years. On histopathology, 134 cases were hepatocellular carcinoma (55.83%) and 106 (44. 17%) cases turned out to be metastatic carcinoma. Glypican-3staining was positive in 116 (48.33%) cases and negative in 124(51.67%). Sensitivity was 82%, Specificity 94.33%, positive predictive value 94.82% and negative predictive value 80.64%. Diagnostic accuracy was 87.5%.Conclusions:Glypican-3 was found to be a highly sensitive and specific Immunohistochemistry stain distinguishing hepatocellular carcinoma from the clear majority of metastatic carcinomas of the liver.
