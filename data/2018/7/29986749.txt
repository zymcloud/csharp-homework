Objective:This study evaluates the occurrence of the various morphological subtypes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and their connections with some risk factors in Cameroonian patients. The database of the 360 liver biopsies received and associated medical records were reviewed for histological and demographic analysis. Archival formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded liver biopsy specimens or slide were re-evaluated in malignancies patients. HCC classification was determined according to the World Health Organization criteria.Results:Malignancies were confirmed in 24.7% (89/360) of liver biopsies. Primary liver tumors consisted in 80 cases of HCC and one case of hepatoblastoma. The distribution of the morphological variants of HCC was trabecular pattern (n = 45/80, 56.25%), acinar/pseudoglandular (32.5%) or scirrhous (11.2%). Remarkably, liver steatosis was present in 60.0% (48/80) of patients with HCC, most of them infected with hepatitis C virus (75.8%). Well-differentiated trabecular tumors were significantly associated with important fibrotic and necro-inflammatory activities in livers (P = 0.008) whereas acinar pattern was more frequent on fatty livers (P = 0.02). Our finding indicates that in Middle Africa the morphology of HCC subtypes correlates with changes affecting non-tumor liver tissue. Trabecular subtype is installed by strong liver injury whereas acinar pattern is more often associated with lipid metabolism defects.
