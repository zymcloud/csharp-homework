Background/aims:Some patients experience very late recurrence of HCC more than 5 years after initial therapy. We aimed to clarify the predictive factors for very late recurrence of HCC in such cases.Methods:Among 807 HCC patients undergoing surgical resection or ablative therapy with curative intent, the patients who survived for 5 years without any recurrence were reviewed. The prognosis and possible predictive factors for late recurrence were analyzed retrospectively.Results:A total of 184 patients survived for more than 5 years without recurrence. Among them, 61 patients experienced recurrence, at a median of 6 years after initial therapy. In univariate analysis, the pre-treatment aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, Child-Pugh class, and ALBI grade were not related to recurrence, but those at 5 years after treatment were significantly related to recurrence. By multivariate analysis, an ALBI grade of 2-3 at 5 years was an independent risk factor for recurrence (P Conclusions:The ALBI grade is an effective index of the variation in liver function after curative therapy and may be a useful prognostic factor for the long-term recurrence-free survival of HCC patients.
