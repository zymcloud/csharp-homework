Purpose:To retrospectively analyze the evolution of indeterminate hepatocellular nodules in cirrhotic patients on serial Gd-EOB-DPTA-enhanced MRI, and to identify predictors of HCC development.Materials and methods:This IRB approved study included 33 cirrhotic patients with 69 indeterminate hepatocellular nodules (mean diameter 1.1 cm) at baseline Gd-EOB-DPTA-enhanced MRI and a Gd-EOB-DPTA-enhanced-MRI follow-up of at least 2 years. Two radiologists evaluated size and signal intensity of each nodule at baseline and follow-up. Age, cirrhosis etiology, and HCC history were recorded. Data were compared between nodules that became HCCs at follow-up (HCC) and those that did not (no-HCC).Results:On follow-up, 5/69 nodules became HCCs and 64/69 showed indeterminate characteristics. HCC history was more frequently found in HCCs than in no-HCCs. Age, sex, and cirrhosis etiology were not significantly different between HCCs and no-HCCs. HCCs had a significantly greater baseline diameter and increase in size than no-HCCs. Hepatobiliary phase hypointensity was significantly more common in HCCs than in no-HCCs. Multivariate regression analysis showed that increase in size (OR 10.48; sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 81.2%; p Conclusion:Indeterminate hepatocellular nodules at Gd-EOB-DPTA-enhanced MRI in cirrhotic patients rarely became HCCs. Hepatobiliary phase hypointensity had a weak association with HCC development.
