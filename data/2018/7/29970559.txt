Background/aim:Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor-2 (EphA2) is overexpressed in ovarian cancer. The N-terminals of EphA2 are processed by membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) and can subsequently induce ligand-independent signal activation to promote motility, invasion, and metastasis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether EphA2 processing occurs in benign, borderline, and malignant ovarian tumours.Materials and methods:Overall 107 ovarian epithelial carcinomas (OECs; 47 serous, 24 endometrioid, 16 mucinous, and 20 clear cell), 54 ovarian borderline tumours (OBTs; 12 serous, 42 mucinous), and 45 adenomas (15 serous, 17 mucinous, and 13 endometriotic cysts) were evaluated. Expression and processing of EphA2 were semi-quantitatively analyzed. EphA2 processing was also investigated by immunoblotting.Results:EphA2 and MT1-MMP co-expression were detected. N-terminal EphA2 levels were significantly lower than those of C-terminal EphA2 in OECs and OBTs, but not in adenomas. Immunoblotting revealed processed fragments in OEC and OBTs.Conclusion:EphA2 processing by MT1-MMP is associated with malignant transformation in ovarian tumours.
