Structural changes in the liver of CBA mice were studied during the development of experimental hepatocarcinoma-29 inoculated into the hip. A decrease in the volume density of hepatocyte cytoplasm, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and lipid inclusions and an increase in the volume density of lysosomal structures during tumor growth were observed. All stages of intracellular autophagy were recorded by the method of electron microscopy. These stages included the appearance of autophagosomes, autophagolysosomes, and secondary lysosomes in the hepatocyte cytoplasm. Fragments of cytoplasm, glycogen rosettes, mitochondria, and fragments of endoplasmic reticulum with ribosomes were found in autophagosomes. The obtained data indicate the development of non-selective autophagy in the liver during distant tumor growth in aimed at the maintenance of intracellular homeostasis in hepatocytes and energy and trophic homeostasis of organism.
