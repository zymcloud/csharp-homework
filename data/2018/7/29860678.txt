Background:Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (EOB-MRI) is a diagnostic modality for liver tumors. Three-dimensional (3D) volumetric analysis systems using EOB-MRI data are used to simulate liver anatomy for surgery. This study was conducted to investigate clinical utility of a 3D volumetric analysis system on EOB-MRI to evaluate liver function.Methods:Between August 2014 and December 2015, 181 patients underwent laboratory and radiological exams as standardized preoperative evaluation for liver surgery. The liver-spleen contrast-enhanced ratio (LSR) was measured by a semi-automated 3D volumetric analysis system on EOB-MRI. First, the inter-evaluator variability of the calculated LSR was evaluated. Additionally, a subset of liver surgical specimens was evaluated histologically by using immunohistochemical staining. Finally, the correlations between the LSR and grading systems of liver function, laboratory data, or histological findings were analyzed.Results:The inter-evaluator correlation coefficient of the measured LSR was 0.986. The mean LSR was significantly correlated with the Child-Pugh score (p = 0.014) and the ALBI score (p < 0.001). Significant correlations were also observed between the LSR and indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (r = - 0.601, p < 0.001), between the LSR and liver fibrosis stage (r = - 0.556, p < 0.001), and between the LSR and liver steatosis grade (r = - 0.396, p < 0.001).Conclusion:The LSR calculated by a 3D volumetric analysis system on EOB-MRI was highly reproducible and was shown to be correlated with liver function parameters and liver histology. These data suggest that this imaging modality can be a reliable tool to evaluate liver function.
