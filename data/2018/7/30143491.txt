Background:Amino acids are increasingly being recognized as important signaling molecules in the pathogenesis of many diseases. We aim to establish a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detector (RP-HPLC-FLD) method for determination and quantification of hepatoma-associated DL-amino acids and to explore the relationship between amino acid concentrations and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:In this work, O-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) and N-isobutyryl-L-cysteine (NAC) served as the pre-column derivatization reagents which significantly shortened the detection time and improved the detection sensitivity. Chromatographic determination was achieved using a programmed gradient elution with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The eluted solution was monitored by a fluorescence detector with an excitation wavelength at 350 nm and an emission wavelength at 450 nm. Under the optimum conditions, an excellent quantification of DL-threonine, alanine, tyrosine, valine, methionine and phenylalanine was achieved.Results:Total analysis time was shortened to less than 25 min for one plasma sample and the linearity, recovery, intra- and inter-day precision were all meet the detection requirements of the DL-amino acids enantiomers in human plasma samples.Conclusions:The developed method demonstrates that DL-threonine, alanine, tyrosine, valine and methionine obtained from HCC patients' plasma samples have a close relationship with HCC. The method would be a potentially alternative tool for DL-amino acids detection in clinical samples.
