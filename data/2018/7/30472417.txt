Objective:We aimed to investigate HBx genetic elements correlated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) -related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and their impact on (a) HBV replicative efficiency, (b) HBx binding to circular covalently closed DNA (cccDNA), (c) apoptosis and cell-cycle progression, and (d) HBx structural stability.Methods:This study included 123 individuals chronically infected with HBV: 27 with HCC (77.9% (21/27) genotype D; 22.1% (6/27) genotype A) and 96 without HCC (75% (72/96) genotype D; 25.0% (24/96) genotype A). HepG2 cells were transfected by wild-type or mutated linear HBV genome to assess pre-genomic RNA (pgRNA) and core-associated HBV-DNA levels, HBx-binding onto cccDNA by chromatin immunoprecipitation-based quantitative assay, and rate of apoptosis and cell-cycle progression by cytofluorimetry.Results:F30V was the only HBx mutation correlated with HCC (18.5% (5/27) in HCC patients versus 1.0% (1/96) in non-HCC patients, p 0.002); a result confirmed by multivariate analysis. In vitro, F30V determined a 40% and 60% reduction in pgRNA and core-associated HBV-DNA compared with wild-type (p Conclusions:F30V was closely correlated with HBV-induced HCC in vivo, reduced HBV replicative efficiency by affecting HBx-binding to cccDNA and increased anti-apoptotic HBx activity in vitro. This suggests that F30V (although hampering HBV's replicative capacity) may promote hepatocyte survival, so potentially allowing persistent production of viral progeny and initiating HBV-driven hepatocarcinogenesis. Investigation of viral genetic markers associated with HCC is crucial to identify those patients at higher risk of HCC, who hence deserve intensive liver monitoring and/or early anti-HBV therapy.
