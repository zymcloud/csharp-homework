Different strategies of DAAs treatment are currently possible both pre- and postliver transplantation (LT). Clinical and economic consequences of these strategies still need to be adequately investigated; this study aims at assessing their cost-effectiveness. A decision analytical model was created to simulate the progression of HCV-infected patients listed for decompensated cirrhosis (DCC) or for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Three DAAs treatment strategies were compared: (i) a 12-week course of DAAs prior to transplantation (PRE-LT), (ii) a 4-week course of DAAs starting at the time of transplantation (PERI-LT) and (iii) a 12-week course of DAAs administered at disease recurrence (POST-LT). The population was substratified according to HCC presence and, in those without HCC, according to the MELD score at listing. Data on DAAs effectiveness were estimated using a cohort of patients still followed by 11 transplant centres of the European Liver and Intestine Transplant Association and by data available in the literature. In this study, PRE-LT treatment strategy was dominant for DCC patients with MELD20 and for those with HCC. Sensitivity analyses confirmed PRE-LT as the cost-effective strategy for patients with MELD≤20. In conclusion, PRE-LT treatment is cost-effective for patients with MELD≤20 without HCC, while treatments after LT are cost-effective in cirrhotic patients with MELD>20 and in those with HCC. It is worth reminding, though, that the final choice of a specific regimen at the patient level will have to be personalized based on clinical, social and transplant-related factors.
