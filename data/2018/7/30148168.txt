Objective:This study aimed to evaluate the links between CYP450 family genes in tumor tissues and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) outcomes.Methods:Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases GSE14520 and GSE36376 were used to identify differential expressed CYP450 genes between tumor and nontumor tissues and related to HCC clinicopathological features and survivals.Results:Seven CYP450 genes including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, and CYP4A11 were downregulated in tumor tissues, which were validated in both GSE14520 and GSE36376. HCC patients with CYP2A6 and CYP2C8 low levels in tumor tissues suffered from poorer overall survival (OS) compared to those with high CYP2A6 and CYP2C8 in GSE14520 profile (log ranks P = 0.01 and P = 0.006, respectively). In addition, HCC patients with lower CYP2A6 and CYP2C8 in tumors had worse recurrence-free survival (RFS) than those with higher CYP2A6 and CYP2C8 (log ranks P = 0.02 and P = 0.012, respectively). In GSE36376 validation dataset, HCC patients with lower CYP2A6 and CYP2C8 had worse OS and RFS than those with higher CYP2A6 and CYP2C8 (all P < 0.05), in line with results in GSE14520 dataset. Additionally, lower CYP2A6 and CYP2C8 are associated with advanced clinicopathological features including tumor staging, vascular invasion, intrahepatic metastasis, and high alpha fetoprotein (all P < 0.05).Conclusion:Downregulation of CYP2A6 and CYP2C8 in tumor tissues links to poorer OS and RFS in HCC patients.
