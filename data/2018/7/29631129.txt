Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that is associated with various types of recurrent seizures, which are drug-resistant in about one third of patients. Moreover, anticonvulsant drugs are used to treat a wide range of non-epileptic conditions, including chronic pain. Here, we investigated the anticonvulsant activity of six new hybrid compounds based on the pyrrolidine-2,5-dione scaffold in the 6 Hz corneal stimulation test with 44 mA stimulus intensity in mice, which is the model of pharmacoresistant seizures. We demonstrated that two molecules, DK-10 (11) and DK-14 (14) show higher anticonvulsant activity and similar safety profile in comparison with valproic acid and much higher in comparison with levetiracetam in the aforementioned test. The second aim of this study was to examine analgesic activity of these compounds. For this purpose, the hot plate test, the formalin test, and the oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy model were performed. Among tested agents DK-11 (12) revealed prominent antinociceptive activity at non-sedative doses in the second (inflammatory) phase of the formalin test, which is the model of tonic pain and antiallodynic activity in the oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain, the model of painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. No cytotoxic effect on hepatoma cells was observed. Compound DK-10 (11) had high affinity for voltage-gated sodium channels, whereas compound DK-11 (12) showed weak binding toward sodium and calcium voltage-gated channels and the NMDA receptor. As a result, hybrid compounds reported herein seem to be very promising broad spectrum anticonvulsant molecules with collateral analgesic activity.
