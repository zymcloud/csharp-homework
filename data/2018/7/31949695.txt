This study aimed to assess the effect of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) taurine-upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) on cells proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. LncRNA TUG1 expression was detected in HCC cell lines (SMMC7721, HepG2 and BEL-7402 cells) and normal liver cells (L-02 cells) by qPCR assay. After the transfection of blank mimic, lncRNA TUG1 mimic, blank inhibitor and lncRNA TUG1 inhibitor plasmids into SMMC7721 cells, CKK8, wound-healing, matrigel assay, AV/PI, qPCR assay and western blot assays were performed to detect cells proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis, RNA expression and protein expression respectively. LncRNA TUG1 expression was increased in SMMC 7721 cells, HepG2 cells and BEL-7402 cells compared to L-02 cells. After transfection of lncRNA TUG1 mimic and inhibitor plasmids, cells proliferation, migration and invasion were observed to be increased in lncRNA TUG1 mimic group compared to blank mimic group (NC1), while were decreased in lncRNA TUG1 inhibitor group compared with blank inhibitor group (NC2). As to cells apoptosis, AV/PI assay disclosed that lncRNA TUG1 mimic suppressed cells apoptosis rate than NC1 while lncRNA TUG1 inhibitor promoted cells apoptosis rate than NC2, apoptosis markers (C-Caspase3 and Bcl) protein expression also supported the regulation of lncRNA TUG1 on cells apoptosis. In addition, lncRNA TUG1 positively regulated the protein and mRNA expressions of AURKA, but not SERPINE1 or BRAF. In conclusion, lncRNA TUG1 promotes cells proliferation, migration and invasion while represses apoptosis, and upregulates AURKA expression in HCC cells.
