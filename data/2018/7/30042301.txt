Transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2) is a master regulator of antioxidant and/or electrophile response elements (AREs/EpREs)-driven genes involved in homeostasis, detoxification, and adaptation to various stresses. The cytoprotective activity of Nrf2, though being oppositely involved in both cancer prevention and progression, is critically controlled by Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1), which is an adaptor subunit of Cullin 3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase and also is a key sensor for oxidative and electrophilic stresses. Here, we first report a novel naturally-occurring mutant of Keap1, designated Keap1ΔC, which lacks most of its C-terminal Nrf2-interacting domain essential for inhibition of the cap'n'collar (CNC) basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) factor. This mutant Keap1ΔC is yielded by translation from an alternatively mRNA-spliced variant lacking the fourth and fifth exons, but their coding sequences are retained in the wild-type Keap1 locus (with no genomic deletions). Although this variant was found primarily in the human highly-metastatic hepatoma (MHCC97H) cells, it was widely expressed at very lower levels in all other cell lines examined. Such Keap1ΔC retains no or less ability to inhibit Nrf2, so that it functions as a dominant-negative competitor of Keap1 against its inhibition of Nrf2 due to its antagonist effect on Keap1-mediated turnover of Nrf2 protein.
