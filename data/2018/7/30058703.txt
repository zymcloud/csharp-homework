Objective:We aimed at analyzing the efficacy of low molecular heparin in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after resection of primary liver cancer and at exploring the correlation of VTE with P-selectin (CD62P), lysosomal granule glycoprotein (CD63), platelet activating factor (PAF) and plasma D-dimer (D-D).Patients and methods:A total of 233 patients treated with primary liver cancer resection in our hospital from February 2014 to October 2016 were enrolled in this study. The patients were randomly divided into the observation group (n=117) and the control group (n=116). The observation group received a subcutaneous injection of low molecular weight heparin at 2-7 days after surgery, and the control group was not treated with anticoagulation. The prevalence of VTE and the changes of CD62P, CD63, PAF, and D-D before and after treatment were compared between the two groups. The VTE prevalence after surgery, the changes of CD62P, CD63, PAF, D-D before and after surgery and the correlation of the above indexes with VTE were analyzed.Results:The prevalence of VTE in the observation group was 0.85% (1/117), which was lower than that of the control group (13.79%) (16/116); the difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in blood coagulation function between the two groups before and after operation (p>0.05). The CD62P, CD63, PAF, and D-D of the two groups were continuously decreased after the operation, and the serum CD62P, CD63 and plasma D-D of the observation group 6 d and 10 d after operation were lower than that of the control group; the difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). The serum CD62P, CD63 and plasma D-D in the VTE group 6 d and 10 d after operation were lower than those in the non-VTE group; the differences were statistically significant (p<0.05).Conclusions:Low molecular weight heparin can effectively prevent VTE after primary liver cancer resection. Regularly monitoring CD62P, CD63, PAF, and D-D in patients after the operation is pivotal for early diagnosis, evaluation and treatment of VTE.
