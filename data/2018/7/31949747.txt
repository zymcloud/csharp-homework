Human cells exposed to environmental or endogenous carcinogens can develop DNA damage. This DNA damage may contribute to a susceptibility to cancer; therefore, it is important to repair these defects. The nucleotide excision repair pathway (NER) is a versatile DNA repair pathway that eliminates a wide variety of helix-distorting base lesions induced by environmental or endogenous carcinogenic sources. The excision repair cross-complementation group 5 (ERCC5) gene is a central component of NER. Ectopic expression of ERCC5 has been linked to different types of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, previous reports, mainly based on mRNA level and the role of ERCC5 in cancer, remain conflicting and unclear. In this study, we examined 104 cases of HCC for immunohistochemistry to explore the role of ERCC5 protein in HCC. We found the expression of ERCC5 protein was significantly increased in tumor tissues compared to paracancerous ones (P
