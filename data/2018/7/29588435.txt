Background/aims:This study aimed to describe the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes for Korean chronic hepatitis C patients and to investigate the impact of patient and virus-related factors on HRQoL.Methods:HRQoL was assessed in 235 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients from seven nationwide tertiary hospital, including those with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), using the Shor-Form 36 (SF-36) version 2 and the European quality of life questionnaire-5 dimensions (EQ-5D-3L).Results:The SF-36 physical (48.8±8.3) and mental (46.2±11.7) component summary scores of the HCV-infected patients were below normal limits. Of the eight domains, general health, vitality, and mental health tended to show low scores. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis had the lowest HRQoL, while HCC and chronic hepatitis patients had similar HRQoL results. The EQ-5D index was low (0.848±0.145) in the HCV infected patients. Multivariable analysis showed age ≤65 years, high monthly family income (＞$2,641), low comorbidity score, and sustained virologic response (SVR) were independently associated with favorable HRQoL.Conclusions:HRQoL in Korean patients with chronic HCV infection was low and was affected by cirrhosis severity, SVR, and comorbidity as well as income, which had the strongest effect. Therefore, HRQoL may be improved by antiviral therapy with reasonable costs to prevent cirrhosis progression.
