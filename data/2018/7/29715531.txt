This study aims to design a novel nano-sized anticancer drug delivery system that can enhance the therapeutic effects of the loaded drug. With this idea in mind, this work reported the design and characterization of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) functionalized chitin (CH) derivative, and its application in nano-drug delivery system. The EGCG-functionalized CH (CE) polymer was firstly prepared and characterized. The nanoparticles (NPs) of CE-loaded honokiol (HK), which was prepared by ionic crosslinking, exhibited a size of 80 nm, zeta potential of +33.8 mV, and spherical morphology. The antitumor activity of the CE-HK NPs in vitro and in vivo was investigated and compared to free HK. As a result, the CE-HK NPs can effectively inhibited cell proliferation of HepG2 cell by inhibiting more cells in the G2/M phase and decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential. The CE-HK NPs (40 mg/kg) inhibited tumor growth by 83.55% (p
