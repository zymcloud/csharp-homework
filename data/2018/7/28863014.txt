Background/aim:Advances in hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment offer high sustained virologic response rates with minimal side-effects. However, benefits of eradicating HCV in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients whose life expectancies are hard to be determined after palliative therapy still needs to be assessed. This study sought to evaluate prognostic factors for survival in HCV-related HCC patients that responded to the palliative HCC treatment to speculate whether treating HCV would be beneficial in these patients.Materials and methods:In this retrospective cohort study, the medical records of 97 patients that showed complete or partial response to the initial HCC treatment were included.Results:Receiving HCV treatment [hazard ratio (HR), 0.244; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.075-0.788; P=0.018] increased the survival, whereas partial response to the initial HCC treatment (HR, 1.795; 95% CI, 1.071-3.008; P=0.026) and increased Child-Turcotte-Pugh score (HR, 2.017; 95% CI, 1.196-3.403; P=0.009) reduced the survival. From 97 patients, 16 patients were eventually treated for HCV. The mean time from the last HCC therapy to HCV treatment was 16.9Â±13.9 months. The median time of follow-up after HCV treatment was 10.0 months (range, 3 to 47 mo). Among the HCV-treated patients 3 patients had HCC recurred. The time to progression in HCV-treated patients were significantly longer than those untreated for HCV (P=0.032).Conclusions:Although treating HCV in HCC patient that undergo noncurative HCC treatment is still debatable, this study results carefully suggest that HCV-related HCC patients that responded to the initial HCC palliative treatment might benefit from HCV treatment.
