Thrombocytopenic patients requiring invasive surgery have few options to improve their platelet count preoperatively. This is a single-centre, retrospective review of thrombocytopenic patients receiving the thrombopoietin receptor agonist romiplostim perioperatively to allow for surgical interventions. Patient characteristics, romiplostim use, and surgical and safety outcomes (bleeding, thrombosis, transfusions) were collected and analysed. Forty-seven patients underwent 51 surgical procedures (ranging from total hip arthroplasty to open cardiac surgery) with romiplostim support. Thrombocytopenia aetiologies included immune thrombocytopenia, chronic liver disease, haematological malignancy, drug-related thrombocytopenia, and hereditary thrombocytopenia. Median (range) platelet counts improved, from 47 × 109 /l (9-120 × 109 /l) at romiplostim initiation to 164 × 109 /l (28-603 × 109 /l) at the time of surgery (P < 0·0001). A dose of 3 μg/kg per week for 2 doses increased the platelet count to >100 × 109 /l in 79% of patients within 14 days. In 96% of cases, surgery proceeded on schedule without delay or cancellation. Four patients had bleeding events unrelated to thrombocytopenia and 1 patient developed deep venous thrombosis. Six patients required red cell transfusion and 3 patients required platelet transfusion perioperatively. In conclusion, romiplostim was effective in increasing platelet counts to allow surgery to proceed safely and on schedule. Bleeding and thromboembolic events were within acceptable limits for this surgical population.
