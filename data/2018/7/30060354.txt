Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the major histological type of primary liver cancer (PLC), and the etiology is relative clear. Chronic infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) plays dominant roles, and high exposure to aflatoxins is an important co-factor. Qidong was one of the endemic area with high PLC incidence in rural China. The results from a series of etiological intervention studies on PLC in this area indicated that 1) the protective efficacy of neonatal HBV vaccination against PLC development under the age of 30 was 84% (95% CI 23%-97%); 2) the relative risk of liver cancer incidence decreased at least 4 folds in young adults aged <35 years with reducing aflatoxin exposures and cleaning drinking water. The prevention of HBV infection and the supplies of clean water and safe food with limited aflatoxins demonstrated as an effective primary prevention model of liver cancer in rural China.
