Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the greatest life threats for Chinese people, and the prognosis of this malignancy is poor due to the strong chemotherapy resistance in patients. Notch pathway components mediate cell survival and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and also participate in the induction of multi-drug resistance (MDR). In the present study, we demonstrated the discovery of a novel inhibitor for Notch activating/cleaving enzyme ADAM-17, named ZLDI-8; it inhibited the cleavage of NOTCH protein, consequently decreased the expression of pro-survival/anti-apoptosis and EMT related proteins. ZLDI-8 treatment enhanced the susceptibility of HCC cells to a small molecular kinase inhibitor Sorafenib, and chemotherapy agents Etoposide and Paclitaxel. ZLDI-8 treatment enhanced the effect of Sorafenib on inhibiting tumor growth in nude HCC-bearing mice model. These results suggest that ZLDI-8 can be a promising therapeutic agent to enhance Sorafenib's anti-tumor effect and to overcome the MDR of HCC patients.
