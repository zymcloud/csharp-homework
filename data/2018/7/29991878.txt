Aim:To understand the cellular and molecular changes in peripheral blood that can lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and provide new methods for its diagnosis and treatment.Methods:Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of HCC patients and normal controls and then analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)+ regulatory cells (Tregs) in the peripheral blood was measured, and the expression of TGF-β was also determined. Then, the relationship between the changes and the 5-year survival of patients was analyzed. In addition, recombinant human TGF-β (rhTGF-β) and recombinant human interleukin-6 were added to stimulate the cultured cells, and their effects on HCC were evaluated.Results:The expression of TGF-β and the percentage of TGF-β+ Tregs in the peripheral blood of HCC patients increased significantly compared with normal controls. Compared with the low TGF-β expression group, the high TGF-β expression group had a significantly lower 5-year survival rate, and the same result was found in the two TGF-β+ Treg groups, suggesting that TGF-β and TGF-β+ Tregs were negatively correlated with the overall survival of the patients. In addition, rhTGF-β promoted the growth of tumor cells and induced high expression levels of IL-6, which further promoted tumor proliferation.Conclusion:The results showed that TGF-β may promote tumor growth and proliferation by inducing the production of IL-6, and TGF-β and TGF-β+ Tregs may serve as new markers for predicting a poor prognosis in HCC.
