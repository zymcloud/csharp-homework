Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) shows poor prognosis owing to its very frequent recurrence even after curative treatment. Thus, an effective and safe long-term chemopreventive agent is strongly in demand. Menahydroquinone-4 (MKH) is an active form of menaquinone-4 (MK-4, vitamin Kâ‚‚) that is involved in the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent proteins in the liver. We hypothesized that efficient delivery of MKH might be critical to regulate HCC proliferation. The discovery of a suitable prodrug targeting HCC in terms of delivery and activation could reduce the clinical dose of MK-4 and maximize efficacy and safety. We previously showed that MKH dimethylglycinate (MKH-DMG) enables effective delivery of MKH into HCC cells and exhibits strong antitumor effects compared with MK-4. In this study, we prepared anionic MKH hemi-succinate (MKH-SUC) and non-ionic MKH acetate (MKH-ACT), in addition to cationic MKH-DMG, and evaluated MKH delivery profiles and antitumor effects in vitro. MKH-SUC showed the highest uptake and the most efficient release of MKH among the examined compounds and exhibited rapid and strong antitumor effects. These results indicate that MKH-SUC might have a good potential as an MKH delivery system for HCC that overcomes the limitations of MK-4 as a clinical chemopreventive agent.
