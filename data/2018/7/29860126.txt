Background:Sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma (SHC) is a rare disease with a poor prognosis. Due to the scarcity of patients with this condition, the optimal treatment for SHC has not been established. In this study, we compared the benefits of subsequent treatments for surgical SHC patients.Materials and methods:Clinical records were retrospectively studied. The SHC patients were divided into two groups according to whether subsequent treatment was performed. The overall survival (OS) rates and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and comparisons were made using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards regression model.Results:The study included 25 patients; 9 (36%) had subsequent treatments following surgery. The median OS of the treatment group and non-treatment group were 8.8 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 8.4-9.1] and 5.4 months [95% CI 4.3-6.5], respectively. OS showed statistical significance between the two groups (log-rank, P = 0.025). Univariate analysis suggested that two factors were poor predictors of OS: without subsequent treatment and with capsule formation. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only subsequent treatment significantly influenced OS.Conclusion:After surgery, SHC patients with subsequent treatment showed better outcomes. However, a more effective treatment is yet to be found. Further studies with a larger patient population are needed.
