Neoadjuvant chemotherapy of colorectal liver metastases can induce hepatotoxicity in noncancerous liver. The aim of the present study was to describe the chemotherapy-induced major changes in the hepatic parenchyma and their prognostic impact. We undertook a retrospective study of 48 cases of colorectal liver metastases treated with neoadjuvant therapy followed by liver resection. These cases were collected at the Pathology Department of Mongi Slim Hospital over a 2-year period (July 2015-February 2018). Our series consisted of 27 men and 21 women with a sex-ratio (M/F = 1.28). The average age of our patients was 57.68 years old with extremes ranging from 30 to 75 years old. All patients received chemotherapy with FOLFOX. From a total of 48 operative specimens examined, we found 24 cases (50%) of non-systematized steatosis, grade 1 sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (n = 12) and grade 2 sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (n = 12), regenerative nodular hyperplasia (n = 3), portal and/or lobular inflammatory infiltrate (n = 6). In three cases, no abnormalities were reported in the liver parenchyma. Surgical margins were < 1 mm in seven cases and were invaded in four cases. Preoperative chemotherapy is associated with regimen-specific liver injury. The presence of such an injury may have a negative impact on the functional reserve of the liver, thereby increasing the risk of surgical morbidity and mortality.
