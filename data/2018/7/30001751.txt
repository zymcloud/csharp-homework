Background:The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have participated in the promotion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) initiation and progression. Nevertheless, the biological role and underlying mechanism of LINC01287 in HCC has never been reported.Methods:The TGCA database was used to explore the abnormal expression of lncRNAs in HCC. Real-time PCR and in situ hybridization assays were used to examine the expression of LINC01287 in HCC tissues. The clinicopathological characteristics of HCC patients in relation to LINC01287 expression were then analyzed. Infection of cells with the si-LINC01287 lentiviral vector was performed to down-regulate LINC01287 expression in HCC cells. MTT and colony formation assays were performed to examine cell growth ability, and FACS analysis was performed to examine the cell cycle and apoptosis. A Boyden assay was used to examine HCC cell invasion ability, and RNA immunoprecipitation tested the interaction between LINC01287 and miR-298. A luciferase reporter assay was used to examine whether STAT3 was a direct target of miR-298, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was used to examine the potential binding of c-jun to the miR-298 promoter.Results:We revealed that the expression of LINC01287 was increased in HCC cell lines, as well as tissues. Knockdown of LINC01287 decreased HCC cell growth and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. LINC01287 can negatively regulate miR-298 expression by acting as a ceRNA. miR-298 directly targeted STAT3 and inhibited its expression. LINC01287 exerted its function via the miR-298/STAT3 axis in HCC. Interestingly, STAT3 elevated LINC01287 expression via c-jun, which bound to the LINC01287 promoter. A feedback loop was also discovered between LINC01287 and the miR-298/STAT3 axis.Conclusions:Our data indicated that LINC01287 played an oncogenic role in HCC growth and metastasis and that this lncRNA might serve as a novel molecular target for the treatment of HCC.
