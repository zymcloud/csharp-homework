Background:It remains uncertain whether patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) benefit from postoperative adjuvant trans-arterial chemoembolization (PA-TACE).Methods:We retrospectively identified 540 patients to form the crude cohort and adopted propensity score matching analysis to assemble another cohort of 464 patients with similar baseline characteristics. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were performed in exploratory subgroups to identify the independent effect of PA-TACE on overall survival (OS).Results:In the overall study population, univariate analysis showed PA-TACE was associated with longer OS [odds ratio (OR) = 0.55, p = 0.001], and stratified analyses indicated an interaction between PVTT types and PA-TACE on OS (p = 0.057 for interaction). After matching, all of the characteristics were well balanced between the PA-TACE and control groups (all p > 0.05). Multivariate Cox analysis validated that the protective role of PA-TACE was significant greater with the expansion of PVTT (type I, OR 0.66; type II, OR 0.33; and type III, OR 0.33, respectively, p = 0.011 for interaction). There also was evidence of treatment effect modification by PVTT type in the crude cohort (type I, OR 0.60; type II, OR 0.32; and type III, OR 0.32, respectively, p = 0.011 for interaction).Conclusions:In patients with HCC and PVTT, PA-TACE was associated with a lower risk of death, particularly, among those with PVTT involving right/left or main portal vein, after excluding patients who were unsuitable for this procedure at 1 month after surgery.
