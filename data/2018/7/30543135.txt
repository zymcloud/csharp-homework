Purpose: CD24 is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor tissues and in the highly metastatic HCC cell lines. However, plasma CD24 level in HCC patients and the correlation of plasma CD24 level with clinicopathological factors and prognosis of HCC patients still remain unclear. Materials and Methods: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect plasma CD24 level in 86 HCC patients, 35 healthy subjects, 26 patients with liver cirrhosis and 23 patients with chronic hepatitis. The relationship between plasma CD24 level with clinicopathological characteristics in HCC patients was assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Patient survival between groups was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test, prognostic factors being analyzed by the Cox regression model. Results: Our present study demonstrated that plasma CD24 level in HCC patients was significantly higher than that in the controls. CD24 was significantly associated with tumor differentiation, but was not correlated with other clinicopathologic parameters including gender, age, tumor size, tumor number, capsulation status, HBsAg status, tumor node metastasis stage, ALT, AFP, and GGT level. CD24 might be a prognostic predictor for overall survival and recurrence-free survival. Conclusions: Plasma CD24 level was significantly higher in HCC patients than that in the controls. Plasma CD24 level was associated with tumor differentiation. The HCC patients with high plasma CD24 level had unfavorable prognosis. CD24 might be a prognostic biomarker for HCC in the future.
