In order to identify potential specific gene networks of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed, which may provide an insight into the potential mechanism of the HCC development. HCV-related HCC and normal sample data were downloaded from GEO, T test of limma package was used to screen different expression genes (DEGs); KEGG pathway was used to analyze related biochemical pathways, and WGCNA was used to construct clustering trees and screen hub genes in the HCC-specific modules. A total of 1151 DEGs were authenticated between the HCC and normal liver tissue samples, including 433 upregulated and 718 downregulated genes. Among these genes, three specific modules of HCC were constructed, including Tan, Yellow and Cyan, but only Yellow module had a significant enrichment score in substance combination module with three hub genes: SLA2547, EFNA4 and MME. Although Tan and Cyan separately had four and three hub genes, but the bio-functions of them did not have significant enrichment scores (score
