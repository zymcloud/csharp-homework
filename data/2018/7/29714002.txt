Combination therapy is one of the important methods to improve therapeutic effect on the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sorafenib (SF) is a canonical US Food and Drug Administration-approved multikinase molecule inhibitor against HCC. However, therapeutic benefit with Sorafenib alone was usually unsatisfactory. Ceramide (CE) is an endogenous bioactive sphingolipid, which has a strong potential to suppress various tumors. The combination of SF and CE was hoping to exert maximum synergistic antitumor effect through different tumor-suppressible mechanisms. In this respect, SF and CE co-loaded liposomes (SF/CE-liposomes) were developed to verify synergistic antitumor efficacy. The optimal molar ratio of SF and CE was determined through combination index. SF/CE-liposomes were prepared by thin-film hydration method, which exhibited spherical or ellipsoidal shape. Particle size of SF/CE-liposomes was 174 ± 4 nm with homogeneous distribution. Release profile of SF demonstrated that addition of CE imposed no significant impact on the release of SF. SF/CE-liposomes exhibited acceptable stability in different media and desirable storage stability over 30 days at 4°C. In vitro cellular uptake confirmed that SF/CE-liposomes could be efficiently internalized into HepG2 cells. In vitro cytotoxicity evaluation indicated that SF/CE-liposomes exhibited higher cytotoxicity on HepG2 cells. IC50 value of SF/CE-liposomes was 11.5 ± 0.44 μM, which was significantly lower than that of SF-liposomes (**p < 0.01). Evaluation of in vivo synergistic effect on H22-bearing mice verified that SF/CE-liposomes achieved robust antitumor activity in preventing tumor growth. All results suggested that SF/CE-liposomes might be served as an efficient co-delivery system for improving therapeutic efficacy of HCC.
