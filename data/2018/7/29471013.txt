Background & aims:To compare the overall survival (OS) and disease progression free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (Ad-HCC) who are undergoing hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil/leucovorin (FOLFOX) treatment vs. sorafenib.Methods:This retrospective study was approved by the ethical review committee, and informed consent was obtained from all patients before treatment. HAI of FOLFOX (HAIF) was recommended as an alternative treatment option for patients who refused sorafenib. Of the 412 patients with Ad-HCC (376 men and 36 women) between Jan 2012 to Dec 2015, 232 patients were treated with sorafenib; 180 patients were given HAIF therapy. The median age was 51 years (range, 16-82 years). Propensity-score matched estimates were used to reduce bias when evaluating survival. Survival curves were calculated by performing the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by using the log-rank test and Cox regression models.Results:The median PFS and OS in the HAIF group were significantly longer than those in the sorafenib group (PFS 7.1 vs. 3.3 months [RECIST]/7.4 vs. 3.6 months [mRECIST], respectively; OS 14.5 vs. 7.0 months; p Conclusion:HAIF therapy may improve survival compared to sorafenib in patients with Ad-HCC. A prospective randomized trial is ongoing to confirm this finding.Lay summary:We compared the hepatic arterial infusion of FOLFOX (a combination chemotherapy) with sorafenib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, retrospectively. It was found that hepatic arterial infusion of FOLFOX therapy may improve both progression free and overall survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
