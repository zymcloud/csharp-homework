Targeted therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is essential for improved therapies. Therefore, identification of key targets specifically to HCC is an urgent requirement. Herein, an iTRAQ quantitative proteomic approach was employed to identify differentially expressed proteins in HCC tumor tissues. Of the upregulated tumor-related proteins, minichromosome maintenance 2 (MCM2), a DNA replication licensing factor, was one of the most significantly altered proteins, and its overexpression was confirmed using tissue microarray. Clinicopathological analysis of multiple cohorts of HCC patients indicated that overexpression of MCM2 was validated in 89.8% tumor tissues and strongly correlated with clinical stage. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated repression of MCM2 expression resulted in significant suppression of the HepG2 cell cycle and proliferation through the cyclin D-dependent kinases (CDKs) 2/7 pathway. Finally, the first small molecule-based MCM2-targeted NIR-II probe CH1055-MCM2 was concisely generated and subsequently evaluated in mice bearing HepG2 xenografts. The excellent imaging properties such as good tumor uptake and high tumor contrast and specificity were achieved in the small animal models. This analytical strategy can determine novel accessible targets of HCC useful for imaging and therapy.
