Objectives: To explore the comorbidity profile and its impact on reported outcome of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) receiving tyrosine kinase-inhibitor (TKI) therapy in China. Methods: From September 2015 to March 2016, anonymous questionnaires were distributed to adult CML patients who were receiving TKI treatment in China. The questionnaires included demographics, comorbidity(ies), TKI(s) therapy, annual out-of-pocket expense for TKIs, treatment responses, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measured by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), satisfaction with therapy, impact of TKI therapy on work and daily life. Results: Data from 1 108 respondents in CML-CP were analyzed, 701 (63.6%) were male, median age was 42 years (range, 18-88 years), 76.4% were currently on imatinib, median TKI-therapy-duration was 29 months (range, 3-178 months). Of them, 300 (27.1%) had ≥1 comorbidity(ies), including hypertension(30.3%), diabetes (21.0%), coronary heart disease (12.3%), gastro-intestinal disease (12.3%), liver disease (11.7%), kidney disease (8.3%), cerebrovascular disease (6.7%) and lung diseases (5.7%), thrombosis (1.3%), other benign diseases (15.3%) and other cancer (8.0%), and 74 (24.7%) had ≥2 comorbidities. Multivariate analyses showed the comorbidity profile of other benign diseases was significantly associated with lower HRQoL score and TKI therapy affecting work and daily life, but it did not significantly affect patients' satisfaction with TKI treatment. Female and no complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) were associated with lower HRQoL score, education level ≥bachelor degree and TKI-therapy duration ≥3 years were associated with higher HRQoL score. Switching between first and second generation TKIs and no CCyR were associated with dis-satisfaction or extreme dis-satisfaction with TKI therapy, free out-of-pocket expense for TKI was associated with better satisfaction. Age<60 years and no CCyR were associated with TKI therapy affecting work and daily life. Conclusions: The survey showed that 27.1% Chinese adult patients with CML-CP receiving TKI-therapy had comorbidity(ies). Different comorbidity profile had different impact on patients' HRQoL and different impact of TKI therapy on work and daily life.
