Despite advances in the clinical management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), this form of cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Currently, there are few treatment options for advanced HCC. Therefore, novel treatment strategies for HCC are required. Here, we described the promising antitumour effects of anisomycin, which exerts both direct killing effects and natural killer cell (NK)-mediated immunotherapeutic effects in HCC. To better elucidate the mechanisms through which anisomycin mediates its antitumour effects, we performed a genome-scale transcriptional analysis. We found that anisomycin treatment of HCC differentially modulated a broad range of immune regulation-associated genes. Among these immune regulation-associated genes, we found that lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3 (LFA-3, also called CD58), whose expression was significantly increased in anisomycin-treated HCC cells, was a critical player in NK-mediated immunotherapeutic effects. Furthermore major histocompatibility complex molecules class I (MHC-I) on HCC cells were also significantly regulated by treatment of anisomycin. Those adhesion molecules like CD58, MHC-I, and ICAM4 should be important for immune synapse formation between NK cells and HCC cells to boost NK-mediated immunotherapeutic effects. Notably, this is the first report of NK-dependent immunomodulatory effects of anisomycin suggesting anisomycin as a novel therapeutic drug for treatment of HCC.
