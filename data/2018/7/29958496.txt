Developing an effective computed tomography (CT) contrast agent is still a challenging task for precise diagnosis of hepatic carcinoma (HCC). Here, we present the use of acetylated polyethylenimine (PEI)-entrapped gold nanoparticles (Ac-PE-AuNPs) without antifouling modification for negative CT imaging of HCC. PEI was first linked to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FI) and then utilized as a vehicle for the entrapment of AuNPs. The particles were then acetylated to reduce its positive surface potential. The designed Ac-PE-AuNPs were characterized by various techniques. We find that the Ac-PE-AuNPs with a uniform size distribution (mean diameter = 2.3 nm) are colloidally stable and possess low toxicity in the studied range of concentration. Owing to the fact that the particles without additional antifouling modification were mainly gathered in liver, the Ac-PE-AuNPs could greatly improve the CT contrast enhancement of normal liver, whereas poor CT contrast enhancement appeared in liver necrosis region caused by HCC. As a result, HCC could be easily and precisely diagnosed. The designed Ac-PE-AuNPs were demonstrated to have biocompatibility through in vivo biodistribution and histological studies, hence holding an enormous potential to be adopted as an effective negative CT contrast agent for diagnosis of hepatoma carcinoma.
