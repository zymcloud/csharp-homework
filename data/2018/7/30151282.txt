Introduction:Adrenal metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a rare entity and can be treated by resection, local ablative therapy, or systemic therapy. Unfortunately, data about treatment outcome, especially in liver transplant recipients, are rare.Patients and methods:From 2005 to 2015, 990 liver resections and 303 liver transplantations because of HCC were performed at our clinic. We retrospectively analyzed treatment outcome of the patients with metachronous adrenal metastasis of HCC, who received either resection, local ablation, or surveillance only.Results:10 patients were identified (0.8%). 7 patients received liver transplantation for primary HCC therapy, 3 liver resection, and 1 a local ablative therapy. 8 patients underwent adrenalectomy (one via retroperitoneoscopy), one was treated with local ablation, and one had surveillance only. Seven out of eight patients had no surgical complications and one experienced a pancreatic fistula, treated conservatively. 37.5% of the resected patients had recurrence 1 year after adrenalectomy and 75% after 2 years. The mean survival time after primary diagnosis of HCC was 96.6±22.4 months. After adrenalectomy, the mean survival time was 112.4±25.2 months. The mean time until tumor recurrence was 13.2±3.8 in the total cohort and 15.8±3.8 months in patients after adrenalectomy. The estimated overall survival after adrenalectomy was 77.2±17.4 months.Conclusion:Metachronous adrenal metastasis occured in less than 1% of HCC patients. Adrenalectomy is a safe procedure and leads to acceptable survival rates even after liver transplantion. Therefore, it should be performed whenever the primary tumor is well controlled and the patient is in adequate physical condition.
