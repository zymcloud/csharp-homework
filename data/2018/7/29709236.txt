Aim:To assess the long-term therapeutic outcomes of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) versus surgical resection (SR) as a first-line treatment for patients meeting the Milan criteria with multiple hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).Materials and methods:This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and the requirement for informed consent was waived. Between January 2004 and December 2009, among 3,441 patients with treatment-naive HCCs, 88 patients meeting the Milan criteria with multiple HCCs (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC] A stage) who underwent either RFA (n=62) or SR (n=26) were included. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were compared by using propensity score matching. In addition, multivariate analysis was performed for assess the prognostic factor.Results:Matching yielded 20 matched pairs of patients. In the two matched groups, the RFS rates were 30% and 30% at 5- and 10-years, respectively, in the RFA group and 60% and 48.6% in the SR group (p=0.054). The corresponding OS rates were 63.3% and 46.1% in the RFA group and 100% and 73.6% in the SR group, respectively (p=0.061). In multivariate analysis, treatment type was independently associated with RFS (hazard ratio [HR]=0.51; p=0.043) whereas it was not a statistically significant factor for OS (HR=0.50; p=0.088).Conclusion:In patients meeting the Milan criteria with multiple HCCs (BCLC A stage), SR may provide better RFS compared to RFA.
