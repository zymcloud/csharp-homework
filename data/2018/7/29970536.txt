Background/aim:Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is expressed in hepatic progenitor cells and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and is considered a marker of liver cancer stem cells.Materials and methods:A total of 262 patients were enrolled who had undergone surgical resection for HCC, with immunohistochemical staining results for EpCAM. The immunohistochemical expression of EpCAM and other stemness-related markers was evaluated as prognosticators of tumor recurrence and survival in patients who underwent surgical resection for HCC.Results:A multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that tumor size [hazard ratio (HR)=2.26, p=0.005], intrahepatic metastasis (HR=2.31, p=0.011), and EpCAM positivity (HR=1.74, p=0.038) were associated with tumor recurrence. In a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, patients with EpCAM-positive tumors had a significantly higher tumor recurrence rate and a reduced overall survival compared to those with EpCAM-negative tumors.Conclusion:Immunohistochemical expression of EpCAM was identified as a poor prognosticator of recurrence and survival after surgical resection in patients with HCC.
