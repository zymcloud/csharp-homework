Objective:To identify reliable magnetic resonance (MR) features for distinguishing mass-forming type of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IMCC) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on tumor size.Methods:This retrospective study included 395 patients with pathologically confirmed IMCCs (n = 180) and HCCs (n = 215) who underwent pre-operative contrast-enhanced MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). MR features were evaluated and clinical data were also recorded. All the characteristics were compared in small (≤3 cm) and large tumor (>3 cm) groups by univariate analysis and subsequently calculated by multivariable logistic regression analysis.Results:Multivariable analysis revealed that rim arterial phase hyperenhancement [odds ratios (ORs) = 13.16], biliary dilation (OR = 23.42) and CA19-9 (OR = 21.45) were significant predictors of large IMCCs (n = 138), and washout appearance (OR = 0.036), enhancing capsule appearance (OR = 0.039), fat in mass (OR = 0.057), chronic liver disease (OR = 0.088) and alpha fetoprotein (OR = 0.019) were more frequently found in large HCCs (n = 143). For small IMCCs (n = 42) and HCCs (n = 72), rim arterial phase hyperenhancement (OR = 9.68), target appearance at DWI (OR = 12.51), alpha fetoprotein (OR = 0.12) and sex (OR = 0.20) were independent predictors in multivariate analysis.Conclusion:Valuable MR features and clinical factors varied for differential diagnosis of IMCCs and HCCs according to tumor size. Advances in knowledge: MR features for differential diagnosis of large IMCC and HCC (>3 cm) are in keeping with that recommended by LI-RADS. However, for small IMCCs and HCCs (≤3 cm), only rim enhancement on arterial phase and target appearance at DWI are reliable predictors.
