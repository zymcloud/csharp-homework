Background:With regard to quality of life and organ shortage, follow-up after liver transplantation (LT) should consider risk factors for allograft failure in order to avoid the need for re-LT and to improve the long-term outcome of recipients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore potential risk factors for allograft failure after LT.Material and methods:A total of 489 consecutive LT recipients who received follow-up care at the University Hospital of Muenster were included in this study. Database research was performed, and patient data were retrospectively reviewed. Risk factors related to donor and recipient characteristics potentially leading to allograft failure were statistically investigated using binary logistic regression analysis. Graft failure was determined as graft cirrhosis, need for re-LT because of graft dysfunction, and/or allograft-associated death.Results:The mean age of recipients at the time of LT was 50.3 ± 12.4 years, and 64.0 % were male. The mean age of donors was 48.7 ± 15.5 years. Multivariable statistical analysis revealed male recipient gender (p = 0.04), hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) (p = 0.014), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (p = 0.03), biliary complications after LT (p Conclusion:Male recipients, patients who received LT for HCV or HCC, those with pretransplant diabetes mellitus, and LT recipients with biliary complications are at high risk for allograft failure and thus should be monitored closely.
