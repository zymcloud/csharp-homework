Growing evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) may be potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for many disease conditions, including cancer. In this study, we constructed a risk score system of three lncRNAs (LOC101927051, LINC00667 and NSUN5P2) for predicting the prognosis of small hepatocellular carcinoma (sHCC) (maximum tumor diameter â‰¤5 cm). The prognostic value of this sHCC risk model was confirmed in TCGA HCC samples (TNM stage I and II). Stratified survival analysis revealed that the suitable patient groups of the sHCC lncRNA-signature included HBV-infected and cirrhotic patients with better physical conditions yet lower levels of albumin and higher levels of alpha-fetoprotein preoperatively. Besides, Asian patients with no family history of HCC or history of alcohol consumption can be predicted more precisely. Molecular functional analysis indicated that PYK2 pathway was significantly enriched in the high-risk patients. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that the two lncRNAs (LINC00667 and NSUN5P2) associated with poor prognosis were closely related to cell cycle. The nomogram based on the lncRNA-signature for RFS prediction in sHCC patients exhibited good performance in recurrence risk stratification. In conclusion, we identified a novel three-lncRNA-expression-based risk model for predicting the prognosis of sHCC.
