Viral hepatitis is globally leading causes of death, and 96% of these are due to hepatitis B and C (HBV/HCV) late outcomes. The first Global Health Sector Strategy (GHSS) aims to reduce by 65% the mortality associated with HBV/HCV, and an indicator (C10) is proposed to monitor progress. Data on viral hepatitis and liver-related mortality are required, and different methods of estimation can be used, depending on availability and quality of sources. We aimed to understand the current situation and practicality of calculating C10, accessing available sources to estimate initial figure for Europe. We listed and compiled regional and national data sources reporting deaths from HCC, cirrhosis and chronic liver disease (CLD) and available estimates of attributable fraction. We critically appraised quality of data, highlighting gaps in current data and estimated mortality attributable to HBV and HCV, for 31 EU/EEA countries from 2010 to 2015. Mortality data are available for 30/31 countries. Quality varies but 60% of national sources report with specificity as required by WHO indicator. Attributable fraction is only available through the literature search. We estimated C10 for 87.6% country-years. Deaths attributable to HBV/HCV for this period and region were 292 600, while HCV deaths were three times higher. Incomplete data for 2015 prevented calculation of time trends. Regional sources are outdated for monitoring C10, but national sources are capable of reporting mortality data. Sources for attributable fraction are sparse, outdated and much needed. We recommend improvement of death registration allowing measuring this indicator. Studies measuring attributable fraction on national and subnational levels are crucial.
