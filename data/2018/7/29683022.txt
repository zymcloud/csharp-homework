Objective This study was performed to determine whether transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus multi-imaging-guided radiofrequency ablation (MIG-RFA) can completely eliminate 3.1- to 5.0-cm hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) nodules and identify factors that may influence the complete elimination rate (CER) of this therapy. Methods Patients who underwent TACE+MIG-RFA for initial treatment of HCC from January 2008 to January 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. In total, 162 patients with 216 HCC nodules (3.1-5.0 cm) were enrolled. TACE was performed first; MIG-RFA was performed 2 to 4 weeks later. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography was performed 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after TACE+MIG-RFA. If tumor enhancement was not detected by the end of the 12-month follow-up, the lesion was considered completely eliminated. Additional TACE+MIG-RFA was performed for residual lesions. The CER was calculated 12 months after the last therapy. Factors that may influence the CER were analyzed. Results In total, 207 (95.8%) nodules showed no residual lesions and were completely eliminated after one or more TACE+MIG-RFA sessions. Nine (4.2%) nodules were incompletely eliminated even with repeated TACE+MIG-RFA. Tumor location was the only significant prognostic factor influencing the CER. Conclusions TACE+MIG-RFA can eliminate 3.1- to 5.0-cm HCC nodules; the tumor location may affect the treatment outcome.
