Background:Although a recent study has shown that the C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (CAR) can predict the survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it is unclear whether CAR can predict the survival after surgery.Objective:To investigate the utility of CAR for prediction of postoperative survival among HCC patients with Child-Pugh class A.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed 239 patients with Child-Pugh class A who were newly diagnosed with HCC and received initial liver resection. Univariate and multivariate analyses using the Cox proportional hazard model were performed to detect clinical characteristics that correlated with overall survival (OS), and their cutoff values were identified using receiver operating characteristic curve analyses. The cutoff value of CAR was 0.028. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test were used for the comparison of OS and disease-free survival (DFS) between two CAR groups (>0.028/≤0.028).Results:Multivariate analysis using 16 clinical characteristics selected by univariate analyses revealed that CAR (>0.028/≤0.028) (HR, 3.211; 95% CI 1.065-9.680; P = 0.038) was significantly associated with OS, as well as anatomical resection (presence/absence) (HR, 0.275; 95% CI 0.119-0.635; P = 0.275). A significant difference in OS and DFS was observed between patients with low CAR (≤0.028) and patients with high CAR (>0.028).Conclusions:CAR is a useful predictor of postoperative survival among HCC patients with Child-Pugh class A.
