To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of liver imaging reporting and data system (LI-RADS) with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma with hepatic nodules (≤2cm). We retrospectively evaluated 56 CEUS exam records of hepatic nodules (≤2cm) performed between January 2015 and July 2016 at West China hospital. Each nodule was classified into a LI-RADS-CEUS category by two radiologists according to imaging features. The ultimate CEUS categories were then compared with pathological reports and their correlation was then calculated. Inter-observer agreement for LI-RADS between reader A and B was κ, 0.690, illustrating good consistency. The diagnostic accuracy of LR-5 on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was 86.49% but 11.11% for LR-M. LI-RADS-CEUS is a potential standardized categorization system for high-risk HCC patients but might also increase the false-negative diagnosis of nodules of less than 2cm.
