Background:Prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who undergo transcatheter intra-arterial therapies, including transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and transcatheter arterial infusion chemotherapy, is affected by many clinical factors including liver function and tumor progression. However, the effect of body composition such as skeletal muscle and visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues (VAT and SAT, respectively) on the prognosis of these patients remains unclear. We investigated the prognostic value of body composition in HCC patients treated with transcatheter intra-arterial therapies.Patients and methods:This study retrospectively evaluated 100 HCC patients treated with transcatheter intra-arterial therapies between 2005 and 2015. Areas of skeletal muscle, VAT, and SAT were measured on computed tomography images at third lumbar vertebra level and normalized by the height squared to calculate the skeletal muscle index, VAT index, and SAT index (SATI). The visceral to subcutaneous adipose tissue area ratio was also calculated. Overall survival (OS) was compared between high- and low-index groups for each body composition. Furthermore, prognostic significance was assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses using Cox proportional hazards models.Results:Among the body composition indexes, only SATI could significantly differentiate OS (p=0.012). Multivariate analysis showed that SATI (low- vs. high-SATI: HR, 2.065; 95% CI, 1.187-3.593; p=0.010), serum albumin (<3.5 vs. ≥3.5 g/dL; HR, 2.007; 95% CI, 1.037-3.886; p=0.039), serum alpha-fetoprotein (<20 vs. ≥20 ng/mL; HR, 0.311; 95% CI, 0.179-0.540; p<0.001), and Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors assessment (complete response+partial response+stable disease vs. progressive disease; HR, 0.392; 95% CI, 0.221-0.696; p=0.001) were indicated as independent prognostic factors for OS.Conclusion:High SAT volume is associated with better survival outcomes in HCC patients treated with transcatheter intra-arterial therapies. Elucidation of the mechanisms regulating SAT volume may offer a new therapeutic strategy for these patients.
