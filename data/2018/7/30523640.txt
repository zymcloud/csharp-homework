MiR-137 has been identified as potential hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognostic biomarkers. Highly relevant HCC prognostic biomarkers may be derived from combinations of miR-137 with its target genes involved in the regulation of liver microenvironment. This study aimed at the discovery of such a combination with improved HCC prognosis performance than miR-137 or its target gene alone in a significantly higher number of HCC patients than previous studies. Analysis of the differentially expressed micro RNAs (miRNAs) between cancer and noncancer tissues reconfirmed miR-137 to be among the most relevant prognostic miRNAs and the data of 375 HCC patients and 50 normal cases were from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sets. Target genes were identified by the established search methods and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of HCC patients was used to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Cox proportional hazards regression indicated that the miR-137 and its target gene AFM combination is an independent prognostic factor for the OS and RFS in HCC. In vitro experiments validated that miR-137 could bind to 3'-untranslated region of the AFM and promote the invasion and metastasis of HCC cell lines. The expressions of miR-137 and its liver microenvironment regulatory target gene AFM in combination significantly correlated with HCC progression in a higher number of patients than in previous studies, which suggested their potential as prognostic biomarkers for HCC.
