Indications of liver transplantation are extensive, but deceased donation does not meet the demand. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive grafts used to be discarded in the past. The aim of this study was to examine viral activity and outcome of HBsAg-positive deceased grafts transplanted to HBsAg-positive recipients. Eleven HBsAg-positive deceased grafts were transplanted to HBsAg-positive patients with acute liver failure (3 patients), hepatocellular carcinoma (6 patients) and repeatedly bleeding varices (2 patients). Postoperatively, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was treated by a combination of antiviral nucleoside and nucleotide analogues. HBV DNA and HBsAg were measured periodically. The median (interquartile) model of end-stage liver disease score for the recipients was 19 (16-32) with a range from 11 to 40. HBV DNA was detected in 6 patients with a range from 61 to 1083 IU/mL before transplantation. After transplantation, HBV DNA was detected in 4 patients in the first month and 2 patients in the 6th month and became undetectable for all patients at end of the first year. The quantitative HBsAg ranged from 0.86 to 241.1 IU/mL at 6 months and 0.34 to 238.5 IU/mL at 24 months (P = .135). Three of the patients died in the early phase, and the other patients were followed up for 40.0 Â± 19.2 months with normal liver function. In conclusion, HBsAg-positive deceased liver grafts function well with minimal viral activity under treatment of combined antiviral nucleoside and nucleotide analogues. Use of HBsAg-positive deceased grafts is feasible and increases the donor pool to rescue dying patients.
