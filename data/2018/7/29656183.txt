Hispidulin, a phenolic flavonoid, exerts potent cytotoxicity towards a variety of human cancers. However, the effects of hispidulin on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and underlying molecular mechanisms of its action remain elusive. The present study investigated the effect of hispidulin on HCC in experimental models, including tumor cell lines and mouse tumor xenograft. Results demonstrated that hispidulin was cytotoxic and anti-proliferative to HCC cell lines (SMMC7721 and Bel7402). Hispidulin activated caspase-3 and triggered apoptosis in HCC cells. Moreover, hispidulin inhibited cell migration and invasion by inhibiting the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-9) and by inducing tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) expression. Hispidulin activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) signaling which mainly contributed to its cytotoxicity in HCC cells. Remarkably, GW9662 (a PPARγ inhibitor) or PPARγ targeting siRNA significantly abrogated the anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, and anti-metastatic effects of hispidulin in HCC cells. Furthermore, hispidulin induced activation of PPARγ which was associated with increased phosphorylation of AMPK, ERK, JNK in HCC cells. Compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) or PD98059 (a MEK inhibitor) partly reversed the effects of hispidulin on PPARγ signaling in HCC cells. In contrast, no significant changes in PPARγ signaling were observed in HCC cells pretreated with SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor), while SP6000125 significantly inhibited the anti-cancer effects of hispidulin in HCC cells. Hispidulin administration effectively suppressed Bel7402 xenograft tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Our findings indicate that PPARγ activation by hispidulin effectively suppressed HCC cell growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo.
