The present study aimed to demonstrate the potent role of nanoselenium and Doxorubicin in retrogression of genotoxicity induced in hepatocellular carcinoma rat model by studying chromosomal aberration, micronuclei formation, DNA fragmentation as well as comet assay. Male rats hepatocellular carcinoma model were treated with Se-Nanoparticles, Doxurobicin (DOX) and the combination of both. The results revealed the protective effect of nanoselenium, Doxorubicin and their combination on bone marrow cytogenetic toxicity by decreasing chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei formation as well as their effects on rat's liver by decreasing DNA damage. Nevertheless, the treatment with nanoselenium either alone or in combination with Doxorubicin was more effective than treatment with doxorubicin alone.
