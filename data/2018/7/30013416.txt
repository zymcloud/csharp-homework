Background:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common complication in patients with metabolic syndrome. The role of statin therapy specifically for the treatment of NAFLD remains unknown. The aim of this review is to discuss outcomes of recent articles analyzing statin therapy in patients with NAFLD.Findings:A total of 12 trials met the inclusion criteria. Statins were not found to increase the prevalence of NAFLD once confounding variables were considered. Statins were also found to be beneficial in treating dyslipidemia and improving liver function. Histological liver outcomes in patients with NAFLD were controversial. One trial found a reduction in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma associated with the use of statins.Conclusions:Overall, therapy with statins appears to be safe for use in patients with NAFLD. Several trials have validated the use of statins for the treatment of dyslipidemia; however, it remains unknown as to whether statins should be used to specifically treat NAFLD.
