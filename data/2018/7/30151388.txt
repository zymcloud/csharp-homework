Background:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection causes acute and chronic liver diseases that can eventually develop into cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the carcinogenesis of HBV is not fully understood. Carboxyl-terminal-binding protein 2 (CtBP2) plays an important role in tumorigenesis and progression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of HBV on CtBP2 expression and to explore its mechanism.Methods:Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting were used to evaluate the CtBP2 mRNA and protein expression levels in tissues and cells. The HBV infectious clone pHBV1.3 and plasmids expressing a single gene of the HBV genome were cotransfected with the CtBP2 gene promoter pGL3-CtBP2 into the human hepatoma cell line HepG2, and luciferase activity was determined using a luminometer.Results:CtBP2 expression was higher in HBV-related HCC tissues than in paracancerous tissues. CtBP2 expression was higher in HepG2.2.15 cells integrated with the HBV genome than in HepG2 cells. pHBV1.3 upregulated CtBP2 mRNA and protein expression. The HBV X gene significantly activated CtBP2 gene promoter activity, and CtBP2 mRNA and protein expression were upregulated by the HBV X gene. This activation effect was enhanced by the increase in the dose of the X gene, showing metrological dependence.Conclusion:HBV may be involved in the occurrence and development of HCC by upregulating CtBP2 expression.
