To determine the diagnostic value of computed tomography (CT) for prediction of microvascular invasion (MVI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Preoperative CTs for 160 patients with 57 MVI-positive and 103 MVI-negative HCCs diagnosed by surgical pathology were reviewed retrospectively. CT parameters and serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) level were analyzed in SPSS 16.0. Although univariate analysis showed that tumor size (P = .012), grade (Z = -2.114, P = .034), and peritumoral enhancement (χ = 4.464, P = .035) were associated with MVI, multiple logistic regression analysis showed that capsular invasion (odds ratio [OR] = 23.469, P
