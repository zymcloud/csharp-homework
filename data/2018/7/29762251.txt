Background:Adenovirus infection is associated with graft dysfunction and graft loss in pediatric cardiac, lung, and liver transplants in prior retrospective studies, but data in pediatric kidney transplant recipients is limited.Methods:We conducted a prospective single-center cohort study of 75 consecutive pediatric kidney transplant recipients who underwent monthly screening for adenovirus viremia and symptom assessment for 2 years posttransplant.Results:Adenovirus viremia was detected in 11 (14.7%) patients at a median onset of 173 days (interquartile range, 109-310 days) posttransplant, 6 (8%) had asymptomatic viremia, and 5 (6.7%) had symptomatic disease (2 with hematuria and 3 with an acute febrile respiratory illness). Viremic patients did not differ from nonviremic patients in age, immunosuppression management, or cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus serostatus, but were more likely to develop cytomegalovirus viremia during the first 2 years posttransplant. No patient had an increase in creatinine from baseline during the time of adenovirus viremia. In a Cox proportional hazards regression, subclinical adenovirus viremia was not associated with a faster time to a 30% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate.Conclusions:Adenovirus infection is common among pediatric kidney transplant recipients and frequently causes symptomatic disease; however, symptoms are often mild and are not associated with a decline in graft function. Routine monitoring for adenovirus viremia in pediatric kidney transplant recipients may not be warranted.
