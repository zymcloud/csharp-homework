Hepatocellular nodules have been recognized in vascular liver diseases for a long time and mostly described and studied in the imaging literature. Some confusions in their identification and overlap in their definitions exist, especially in this specific clinical context. Pathology descriptions report the development of nodular regenerative hyperplasia, large regenerative nodule, and focal nodular hyperplasia, as adaptive responses of the liver parenchyma to the modified blood flow. True neoplastic hepatocellular nodules such as hepatocellular adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma can also appear, mainly in Budd-Chiari syndrome, and have to be correctly diagnosed. This is more difficult for the radiologist in these diseased livers, leading more frequently to perform liver biopsies. We describe the histology of each type of well-differentiated hepatocellular nodules and provide some clues for their differential diagnosis. A review of the literature gives an historical perspective of the problem and enlightens the frequency and the subtypes of hepatocellular nodules found in the most common vascular liver diseases.
