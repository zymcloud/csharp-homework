Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays an important role in diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes in cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. We have previously shown that exogenous H2S exerts its biological effects on hepatoma, glioma, and esophageal cancer cells through the activation of NF-ÎºB, p38-MAPK/ERK1/2-COX-2, and HSP90 pathways. However, the role of H2S and the underlying mechanism in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma remain unclear. Here we investigated whether exogenous H2S contributes to the biological behavior of esophageal squamous cancer cell line EC109, through the activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. EC109 cells were treated with NaHS (a donor of H2S) and AG490 (a specific inhibitor of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway). The expression levels of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, caspase-3/9/12, Bax, Bcl-2, MMP-2/9, and VEGFR were measured by western blot analysis. Cell viability was detected by CCK-8 and quantified by direct counting of cells under a microscope. Cell migration was analyzed by the scratch-wound assay, while the level of VEGF was measured by ELISA. Cells treated with NaHS for 24 h showed significant upregulation of p-JAK2, and p-STAT3 expression, as well as increased cell viability when compared to the control cells. The expression levels of caspase-3/9/12 and Bax decreased, while those of Bcl-2, MMP-2/9, VEGFR, and VEGF increased. NaHS induced the migration of EC109 cells. However, co-treatment with NaHS and AG490 significantly inhibited these effects. Thus, JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway may contribute to H2S-induced cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, migration, and angiogenesis in EC109 cells.
