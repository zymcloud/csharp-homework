Inflammation and fibrosis in human liver are often precursors to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet none of them is easily modeled in animals. We previously generated transgenic mice with hepatocyte-specific expressed herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk). These mice would develop hepatitis with the administration of ganciclovir (GCV)(Zhang, 2005 #1). However, our HSV-tk transgenic mice developed hepatitis and HCC tumor as early as six months of age even without GCV administration. We analyzed the transcriptome of the HSV-tk HCC tumor and hepatitis tissue using microarray analysis to investigate the possible causes of HCC. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that the up-regulated genes in the HCC tissue mainly include the immune-inflammatory and cell cycle genes. The down-regulated genes in HCC tumors are mainly concentrated in the regions related to lipid metabolism. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that immune-inflammatory-related signals in the HSV-tk mice are up-regulated compared to those in Notch mice. Our study suggests that the immune system and inflammation play an important role in HCC development in HSV-tk mice. Specifically, increased expression of immune-inflammatory-related genes is characteristic of HSV-tk mice and that inflammation-induced cell cycle activation maybe a precursory step to cancer. The HSV-tk mouse provides a suitable model for the study of the relationship between immune-inflammation and HCC, and their underlying mechanism for the development of therapeutic application in the future.
