Purpose:Since the change in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) policy excluding patients with very early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (veHCC, single tumor nodule Methods:A retrospective study has been performed on patients with veHCC evaluated in multidisciplinary liver tumor clinic of a large academic center between 2004-2011. Patients eligible for LT were assigned to the wait-and-not-treat group while patients who were not eligible were assigned to the definitive LRT group. Tumor size, time to treatment, severity of liver disease, recurrence and survival from time of detection were reviewed and recorded.Results:A total of 19 patients were identified and treated with definitive LRT while 57 patients were treated with bridging LRT prior to LT after disease progression to T2 stage. Patients in the definitive LRT group were older (70.4±10.2 years vs. 58.7±5.9 years, P Conclusion:Based on the findings of current retrospective study, treating veHCC (UNOS T1 stage) patients listed for LT with bridging LRT after disease progression to T2 stage appears to be safe and effective with high 5-year survival rates.
