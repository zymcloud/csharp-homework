Apelin is a peptide hormone with anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities and is proposed to be a potential therapeutic for many disease conditions, including sepsis. However, short in vivo half-life of the apelin peptide would limit its potential clinical applications. This study aims to investigate the effects of Fc-apelin, a novel long-acting apelin fusion protein, on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced liver injury. Liver injury was induced by systemic injection of LPS in mice. Hepatoprotective activities of Fc-apelin against inflammation were evaluated in LPS mice and/or hepatoma Huh-7 cells with respect to serum ALT, apoptosis, oxidative stress, macrophage infiltration and gene expression. We found that LPS induced systemic inflammation and liver damage. Co-administration of Fc-apelin significantly attenuated serum ALT elevation, diminished LPS-induced apoptosis and ROS production in the liver and in Huh-7 cells, mitigated hepatic macrophage infiltration, and reduced TNFÎ± and IL-6 gene expression. Collectively, Fc-apelin fusion protein exerts protective effects against LPS-induced liver damage and may serve as a potential therapeutic for endotoxin-induced liver injury.
