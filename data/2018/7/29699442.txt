Drug-loaded nanoparticles have been widely researched in the antitumor. However, some of them are unsatisfactory in the long blood circulation and controlled drug release. Red blood cell (RBC) membrane vesicles (RV)-coated nanoparticles have gained more and more attention in drug delivery for their many unique advantages, such as excellent stability, long blood circulation, and reduced the macrophage cells uptake. Herein, by utilizing the advantages of RV, we fabricated RV-coated poly(lactide- co-glycolide) (PLGA)-docetaxel (RV/PLGA/DTX) nanoparticles to enhance the antitumor efficiency in vivo. The RV/PLGA/DTX showed spherical morphology with particle size of about 100 nm and zeta potential at -12.63 mV, which could maintain stability for a long time. The RV/PLGA/DTX significantly enhanced cellular uptake of DTX compared to PLGA/DTX in HepG2 cells. Moreover, RV/PLGA/DTX showed the strongest antitumor effect in vitro. Prolonged blood circulation and enhanced DTX accumulation at the tumor site through enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect were achieved by RV/PLGA/DTX, which eventually obtained satisfactory antitumor effect and depressed system toxicity on mice bearing HepG2 xenografts mouse models when compared with free DTX. The hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunofluorescence assays further proved the advantages of RV/PLGA/DTX in vivo antitumor. These RV-coated nanoparticles provide a mimetic therapy, completely inhibited the growth of the HepG2 cells, and with simple compositions, suggesting it to be an ideal strategy for improving the antitumor effect of drug-loaded nanoparticles.
