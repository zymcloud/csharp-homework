The carcinogenic liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini, is a serious health problem in Southeast Asia where infection is associated with cholangiocarcinoma, a major cause of death in Thailand. This cross-sectional study aimed to screen for O. viverrini infection among a Thai rural population of 560 individuals from Nakhon Ratchasima, Khonkaen, and Chaiyaphum provinces with a verbal screening test with a mobile application (OvApp). Faecal samples were also processed with a mini-parasep sf parasite faecal concentrator. The infection rate of O. viverrini was found to be 2.86%. The majority of infections were detected in males aged 41â€“50, with primary school being their highest education level, and who were engaged in agricultural occupations. In screening for O. viverrini infection, the OvApp had a high sensitivity (87.5%), specificity (94.6%), negative predictive value (98.9%), and accuracy (98.6%). The positive predictive value was 70.0% for the OvApp. The observed agreement was substantial for this application (k-value = 0.64) indicated that it is a potentially useful tool for decreasing the cost of large-scale O. viverrini screening.
