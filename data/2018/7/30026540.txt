Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally. Because most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease, multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib is the only available drug to show limited effectiveness. Novel and effective therapies are unmet medical need for advanced HCC patients. Given that the aberrant expression and activity of platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) are closely associated with the pathogenesis of HCC, here we present the discovery and identification of a novel PDGFRα inhibitor, N-(3-((4-(benzofuran-2-yl)pyrimidin-2-yl)oxy)-4-methylphenyl)-4-((4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl)benzamide (E5) after comparison of different derivatives. We found that E5 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in HCC cells. Since the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK partially rescued HCC cells from E5-reduced cell viability, autophagic cell death triggered by E5 was subsequently investigated. E5 could induce the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, increase the expression of Atg5 and restore the autophagy flux blocked by chloroquine. Meanwhile, E5 was able to downregulate the PDGFRα/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and to activate MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Taken together, in addition to the possibility of E5 as a valuable drug candidate, the present study further supports the notion that targeted inhibition of PDGFRα is a promising therapeutic strategy for HCC.
