Background/aims:The aim of this study was to evaluate elasticity of benign and malign focal liver lesions and surrounding parenchyma as measured by acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI).Materials and methods:34 hemangiomas, 4 focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), 10 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 22 metastatic lesions from a total of 62 patients were examined with ARFI elastography. ARFI measurements for each tumor type were expressed as mean ± standard deviation for liver mass and surrounding parenchyma. ARFI values were compared between tumor types and surrounding parencyhma.Results:The mean stiffness values were 2.15±0.73 m/s for hemangiomas (n=34), 3.22±0.18 m/s for FNH (n=4), 2.75±0.53 m/s for HCC (n=10) and 3.59±0.51 m/s for metastasis (n=22). Although there was not a significant difference between hemangiomas and HCC lesions in ARFI values (p>0.05), hemangiomas showed significantly different ARFI values from FNH and metastases (pConclusion:Although currently ARFI is not a definitive method for the primary diagnosis of focal solid liver lesions, it provides additional important information non-invasively for differential diagnosis.
