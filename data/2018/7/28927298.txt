Background Targeted therapies are of increasing clinical importance and classic radiologic therapy response-criteria often fail to detect early therapeutic response or failure. For hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), this is of major importance as therapeutic options are limited. Purpose To investigate the impact of sorafenib-treatment on intralesional perfusion using perfusion computed tomography (PCT) in HCC and to correlate the observed changes with mRECIST and the course of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) for identification of their prognostic value. Material and Methods PCT was performed before and after two months of sorafenib treatment in 28 consecutive HCC patients and AFP levels were registered. Changes in tumor perfusion parameters blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), mean transit time (MTT), volume transfer constant (Ktrans), arterial liver perfusion (ALP), and hepatic perfusion index (HPI) were registered in one target lesion. mRECIST measurements were performed at baseline and after two and four months during sorafenib treatment. Results According to mRECIST, after two months of treatment, all patients showed stable disease (SD), whereas after four months, 13 patients (46%) showed SD and 15 patients (54%) showed progressive disease (PD). A significant decrease was found in perfusion parameters BF, BV, Ktrans, ALP, and HPI in patients with SD as well as a significant increase in MTT ( P < 0.05) after two months compared to baseline, while patients with PD showed a significant increase in HPI, BF, and BV. There were no correlations between AFP and mRECIST or perfusion parameters. Conclusion Decreased intralesional BF and HPI after two months of sorafenib treatment predicts disease stabilization after four months, whereas AFP dynamics were of limited value.
