Metastasis and recurrence following surgery are major reasons for the high mortality rate and poor prognosis associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to be able to cause cancer, and to be the primary cause of tumor recurrence and metastasis. The underlying mechanisms of the metastatic potential of CSCs is poorly understood. In the present study, side population (SP) cells were isolated from 4 HCC cell lines, and their self-renewal and migratory abilities were compared. The results demonstrate that SP cells from different cell lines exhibited similar self-renewal abilities but different metastatic potentials. Furthermore, the overall proteomes of the SP cells were systematically quantified. This revealed 11 and 19 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), upregulated and downregulated, respectively, associated with increased metastatic potential. These proteins were involved in the 'regulation of mRNA processing' and 'cytoskeleton organization' biological processes. The majority of the proteins were involved in 'cell proliferation', 'migration' and 'invasion of cancer', and may promote HCC metastasis in a synergistic manner. The AKT and nuclear factor-ÎºB signaling pathways may contribute to the regulation of HCC metastasis through regulating the DEPs in SP cells. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate the overall proteome difference among SP cells from the different HCC cell lines with different metastatic potentials. The present study provides novel information regarding the metastatic potential of CSCs, which will facilitate further investigation of the topic.
