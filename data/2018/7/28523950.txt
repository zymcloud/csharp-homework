Asparaginase is a chemotherapeutic agent that is commonly used in combination with other medications for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. An adverse effect of asparaginase includes hepatotoxicity, which can lead to severe liver failure and death. Several reports have documented successful treatment of asparaginase-induced hepatotoxicity using levocarnitine (l-carnitine) and vitamin B complex. Herein, we report a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia that experienced acute liver injury following pegaspargase administration. Our patient was successfully treated with l-carnitine and vitamin B complex for 8 days and achieved recovery of hepatic function. Furthermore, we review the current literature and provide a recommendation on a regimen that can be used as an option for the treatment of asparaginase-induced hepatic injury.
