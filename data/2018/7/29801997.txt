To identify a potent and selective nucleoside inhibitor of dengue virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a series of 2'- and/or 4'-ribose sugar modified uridine nucleoside phosphoramidate prodrugs and their corresponding triphosphates were synthesized and evaluated. Replacement of 2'-OH with 2'-F led to be a poor substrate for both dengue virus and human mitochondrial RNA polymerases. Instead of 2'-fluorination, the introduction of fluorine at the ribose 4'-position was found not to affect the inhibition of the dengue virus polymerase with a reduction in uptake by mitochondrial RNA polymerase. 2'-C-ethynyl-4'-F-uridine phosphoramidate prodrug displayed potent anti-dengue virus activity in the primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cell-based assay with no significant cytotoxicity in human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell lines and no mitochondrial toxicity in the cell-based assay using human prostate cancer cell lines.
