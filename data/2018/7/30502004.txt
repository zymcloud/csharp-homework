Introduction:Biliary atresia (BA) represents the leading indication for liver transplantation in childhood. Only few studies reported the outcome of patients who survived more than 20 years on their native liver, and up to date there are no Italian data available. We reported our 40-year single centre experience with long-term follow-up of BA patients.Materials and methods:All consecutive patients who underwent Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE) for BA managed at our Institution between 1975 and 1996 were retrospectively reviewed. Native liver (NLS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed with Kaplan-Meyer curves and LogRank test. A p value of Results:During the 22-year period of the study 174 patients underwent surgery (median age 60 days). Clearance of jaundice at 6 months from surgery was achieved in 90 patients (51.7%). NLS was 41% at 5 years, 32% at 10 years, 17.8% at 20 years and 14.9% at 40 years. Cholangitis was recorded in 32%, hepatocellular carcinoma in 0.5%. Twenty-six patients (14.9%) survived with their liver more than 20 years; 84.6% had normal serum bilirubin level and 23% had esophageal varices. Quality of life was comparable with the healthy Italian population in all but one patient.Conclusions:Our Italian experience confirms KPE represents the cornerstone of treatment for children with BA. Multidisciplinary and meticulous lifelong post-operative follow-up should be guaranteed for these patients because of the possibility of late-onset cholangitis, portal hypertension, hepatic deterioration and liver malignant tumors.Type of the study:retrospective case series.Level of evidence:IV.
