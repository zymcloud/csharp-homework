The role of liver biopsy in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has changed over time. The diagnostic algorithm for this tumor is nowadays mainly based on radiological imaging, relegating histology to controversial cases, in which imaging techniques cannot establish a clear-cut diagnosis. This most commonly happens in small lesions, where biopsies frequently become mandatory, or in larger hypovascularized lesions. In this case however, the histological examination may not be reliable enough to grade the lesion, as different cell clones, deriving from sequential mutations, can originate heterogeneous cell populations. The risk of complications of liver biopsy, such as tumor seeding and intra-abdominal bleeding, needs to be reconsidered in light of new scientific evidence and of the technical improvements that have been introduced. Furthermore, increasing knowledge of the immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma opens a new scenario in which biopsy may play a decisive role in defining prognosis, and even treatment, by identifying the patient populations who could most benefit from target-driven hepatocellular carcinoma treatments, and therefore improving the success rate of experimental therapies. All the above reasons suggest that, overall, the role of liver biopsy in the management of HCC needs a reappraisal.
