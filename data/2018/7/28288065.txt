Objective:To assess how virtual hepatectomy (VH), conducted using surgical planning software, influences the outcomes of liver surgery.Background:Imaging technology visualizes the territories of the liver vessels, which were previously impossible. However, the clinical impact of VH has not been evaluated.Methods:From 2004 to 2013, we performed 1194 VHs preoperatively. Outcomes of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) and hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)/colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) were compared between patients in whom VH was performed (VH) and those without VH evaluation (non-VH).Results:In LDLT, the rate of right liver graft use was higher in the VH (62.1%) than in the non-VH (46.5%) (P Conclusions:VH in LDLT allows double equipoise for the recipient and donor by optimizing decision-making on graft selection and venous reconstruction. VH offers a chance for radical hepatectomy even in HCC patients with impaired liver function and CRLM patients with advanced tumors, without compromising survival.
