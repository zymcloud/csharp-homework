Purpose To determine the safety and efficacy of sorafenib combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) (hereafter, S-TACE-RFA) in patients with medium or large (range, 3.1-7.0 cm in diameter) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and Methods This retrospective study evaluated the medical records of consecutive patients with medium or large HCC who underwent S-TACE-RFA or combined TACE and RFA (hereafter, TACE-RFA) from January 2010 to December 2014. Sorafenib was started 3-5 days after TACE, and RFA was performed 1-2 weeks after TACE. Treatment complications, recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) in patients who underwent S-TACE-RFA were compared with those in patients who underwent TACE-RFA. Results Of the 174 patients who underwent S-TACE-RFA or TACE-RFA, 106 who met the eligibility criteria were included in this study. Among them, 40 underwent S-TACE-RFA and 66 underwent TACE-RFA. The patients who underwent S-TACE-RFA had longer RFS (median, 24.0 vs 10.0 months; P = .04) and better OS (median, 63.0 vs 36.0 months, P = .048) than those who underwent TACE-RFA. S-TACE-RFA and α-fetoprotein level were independent prognostic factors for survival in uni- and multivariable analyses. The rate of complications in patients who underwent S-TACE-RFA was similar to that in patients who underwent TACE-RFA (22.5% vs 18.2%, P = .59). Conclusion S-TACE-RFA resulted in longer RFS and better OS than did TACE-RFA in patients with medium or large HCC. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.
