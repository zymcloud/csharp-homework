Hepatic cancer (HCC) is a well-identified dilemma throughout the world, and hence, the molecular mechanisms and strategy for preventive protection against this malignancy are critical. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is a unique methyl granter in vast reactions, including DNA methylation, and secures the genome against hypomethylation, which is a hallmark of tumors. Consequently, SAM may control the rate of gene expression. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) transcript involved in hepatic tumorigenesis, including additional coding CEBPA (ecCEBPA) and urothelial carcinoma related 1 (UCA1), antioxidant enzymes transcripts, and relevant signaling pathway in diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-prompted HCC along with their conceivable targeting by SAM at different stages of HCC in rats. Our outcomes revealed that SAM particularly when given at the starting phase downregulates ecCEBPA and UCA1 gene transcripts and ameliorate histopathological alterations in DEN-initiated HCC. Interestingly, SAM attenuates DEN-induced upregulation of PI3K/Akt protein expression. However, SAM upregulates the antioxidant enzymes mRNA transcripts and effectively diminishing DNA oxidation. The results of a DNA fragmentation assay further support the capacity of SAM to ameliorate DEN-induced hepatic malignancy. These results revealed the role of ecCEBPA and UCA1 in HCC and suggest that these lncRNAs may be helpful as prognostic and analytical biomarkers of HCC. Curiously, SAM readily targets the studied genes via inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which should make SAM an appealing agent for both chemoprevention and treatment of HCC.
