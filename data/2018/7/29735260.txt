Purpose:To analyze outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing preoperative portal vein embolization (PVE).Materials and methods:A retrospective analysis of survival, recurrence, and complications was performed in 82 patients with HCC undergoing preoperative PVE and surgical treatment with curative intention from June 2006 to December 2014.Results:Rate of major adverse events after PVE was 11% with no mortality. Twenty-eight (34.1%) patients showed radiologic progression of HCC after PVE; 72 patients (87.8%) eventually were accepted as surgical candidates. Median interval between PVE and surgery was 37 days, and 69 patients (84.1%) ultimately underwent surgical resection. At 1 and 3 years, disease-free survival rates were 81.3% and 53.1%, respectively, and overall patient survival rates were 77.5% and 63.1%. Compared with patients accepted as surgical candidates, patients who did not undergo surgery had a higher median number of HCC tumors (1 [range, 1-5] vs 2 [range, 1-4], P = .031). At 1 and 3 years, patients with disease progression after PVE but who still underwent surgical resection showed similar recurrence-free (90% vs 79.6% and 75% vs 48.6%) and overall (72.2% vs 78.4% and 57.8% vs 64%) survival rates as the rest of the patients who underwent resection.Conclusions:PVE is a safe technique with good outcomes that potentially increases the number of patients with initially unresectable HCC who can be offered resection. Radiologic progression after PVE should not be seen as a contraindication to offer resection if it is still deemed possible.
