Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by ectopic lipid accumulation and insulin resistance, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. MiR-190b is thought to play a role in hepatocellular carcinoma by modulating insulin resistance; however, its role in NAFLD remains unknown. Here, we found that miR-190b expression was significantly increased in the liver tissues of patients with NAFLD, compared to normal tissues. Moreover, miR-190b was upregulated in a high-fat diet NAFLD mouse model and a free fatty acid-induced NAFLD cellular model. Knockdown of miR-190b decreased aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), triglyceride (TG), and total cholesterol (TC). It also reduced expression of the lipogenic genes fatty acid synthase (FAS) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylCoA reductase (HMGCR), alleviated hepatic steatosis, improved glucose tolerance, elevated insulin sensitivity, and activated insulin receptor substrate (IRS)2/Akt signaling in vivo and/or in vitro. Furthermore, we confirmed that miR-190b directly targeted IGF-1 and ADAMTS9. MiR-190b overexpression suppressed expression of IGF-1 and ADAMTS9, which were increased by miR-190b inhibition. Expression of IGF-1 and ADAMTS9 was inversely correlated with miR-190b in liver tissues of patients with NAFLD, respectively. We also found that IGF-1 or ADAMTS9 inhibition partially reversed the effects of miR-190b on lipid metabolism and insulin signaling in vitro. Taken together, the data reveal that miR-190b inhibition suppressed lipid accumulation and improved insulin sensitivity by targeting IGF-1 and ADAMTS9, suggesting that miR-190b inhibition may be a therapeutic strategy against NAFLD.
