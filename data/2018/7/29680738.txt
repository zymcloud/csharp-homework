Apigenin is a dietary flavonoid with known antioxidant and antitumor effects against several types of cancers by promoting cell death and inducing cell cycle arrest. Apigenin also regulates a variety of intracellular signal transduction pathways during apoptosis or autophagy. However, the precise mechanism underlying the anticancer effects of apigenin in liver cancer remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that apigenin has anticancer activity against hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Apigenin inhibited the cell growth and induced cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner in HepG2 cells. We found that apigenin treatment increased the expression of LC3-II and the number of GFP-LC3 puncta. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy with 3-MA and Atg5 gene silencing strengthened apigenin-induced proliferation inhibition and apoptosis. Our data has indicated that apigenin-induced autophagy has a protective effect against cell death. Additionally, apigenin induced apoptosis and autophagy through inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Most importantly, in vivo data showed that administration of apigenin decreased tumor growth and autophagy inhibition by 3-MA significantly enhanced the anticancer effect of apigenin. Collectively, our results reveal that apigenin inhibits cell proliferation and induces autophagy via suppressing the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Our results also suggest combination of autophagy inhibitors and apigenin would be a potential chemotherapeutic strategy against hepatocellular carcinoma.
