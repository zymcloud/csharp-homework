This work aimed to develop and optimize several lipid nanocapsule formulations (LNCs) to encapsulate cisplatin (CDDP) for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. By comparing the effect of oil/surfactant ratio, lecithin content, and oil/surfactant type on LNC characteristics, two LNCs were selected as optimal formulations: HS15-LNC (Solutol HS 15/MCT/lecithin, 54.5:42.5:3%, w/w) and EL-LNC (Cremophor EL/MCT/lecithin, 54.5:42.5:3%, w/w). Both LNCs could effectively encapsulate CDDP with the encapsulation efficiency of 73.48 and 78.84%. In vitro release study showed that both LNCs could sustain the release CDDP. Moreover, cellular uptake study showed that C6-labeled LNCs could be effectively internalized by HepG2 cells. Cellular cytotoxicity study revealed that both LNCs showed negligible cellular toxicity when their concentrations were below 313 μg/mL. Importantly, CDDP-loaded LNCs exhibited much stronger cell killing potency than free CDDP, with the IC50 values decreased from 17.93 to 3.53 and 5.16 μM after 72-h incubation. In addition, flow cytometric analysis showed that the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly increased after treatment with LNCs. Therefore, the prepared LNC formulations exhibited promising anti-hepatocarcinoma effect, which could be beneficial to hepatocellular carcinoma therapy.
