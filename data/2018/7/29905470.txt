Cancers and many other diseases, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), have threatened human lives for centuries. Therefore, a novel technique for such disease prediction is in an urgent demand for timely treatment. Biomarkers, alpha-L-fucosidase (AFU) for HCC and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) for CVD, have proven to be essential in the role of disease detection. Herein, we report on an ultrasensitive plasmonic biosensor that converts plasmonic absorption to electrical current in order to detect AFU and cTnI using whole human blood in a real-time and parallel fashion. The detection limit was calculated to be 0.016 U/L for AFU and 0.015 ng/mL for cTnI, respectively. Combined with the versatility of the strategies for different biomarkers, these results demonstrate that the developed biosensor exhibits a promising application for the prediction of cancers and many other diseases.
