Background:This study investigated the safety and efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with simultaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as treatment for adrenal metastases (AM) from hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC).Methods:The records of 63 patients with AM who were treated at our Hospital between February 2013 and August 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into a TACE+RFA group (n = 38) and a control group that received TACE alone (n = 25) according to different treatment methods. The success rate, tumor control rate, and safety of these groups were compared, and survival was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:All treatments could be completed technically successful in both groups. The tumor control rate at first imaging after 1 months was 92.1% (35/38) in the TACE+RFA group and 76.0% (19/25) in the TACE group(P = 0.041). The assisted local tumor control rate allowing repeated interventions in case of local recurrence was 70.0% (7/10) in the TACE+RFA group and 30.8% (4/13) in the TACE group (P = 0.039). During the follow up period, the TACE+RFA group had better survival than the TACE group at 1 year (92.1% vs. 88.0%), 2 years (73.7% vs. 64.0%), and 3 years (55.3% vs. 44.0%) (P = 0.040). The mean survival time was 26.8 ± 2.0 months (95% CI, 22.8-30.7) in the TACE+RFA group and 17.5 ± 2.2 months (95% CI, 13.1-21.8) in the TACE group.Conclusion:TACE+RFA led to better control of local disease progression and longer survival time than TACE alone in the treatment of AM from HCC. Although patients given TACE+RFA had more complications than those given TACE alone, these complications were easily managed.
