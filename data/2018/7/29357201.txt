In premenopausal women with hormone dependent breast cancers, ovarian suppression is an important part of treatment, and is often achieved with a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). However, this procedure can lead to ovarian remnant syndrome (ORS), a rare condition where the adnexal tissue is not completely removed and can produce estrogen. We describe a case of ORS in a patient with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer who had progression of disease after undergoing a BSO, despite optimal therapy. ORS therefore poses a significant treatment challenge in premenopausal ER+ breast cancer patients thought to be rendered menopausal with a BSO.
ER positive breast cancer; metastatic breast cancer; ovarian remnant syndrome.
