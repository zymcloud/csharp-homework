Background and aims:Numerous reports have indicated that preoperative Neutrophil-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was correlated with the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent hepatectomy. However, the results still remained controversial. Therefore, the present meta-analysis of 17 studies was performed to evaluate the prognostic value of preoperative NLR in HCC patients.Method:Databases of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were retrieved. Hazard Ratio (HR) or Odds Ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence intervals (CI) was used to evaluate the association between preoperative NLR and the prognosis or clinical features of HCC patients.Result:A total of 17 studies eventually were included in this meta-analysis. Elevated preoperative NLR had a close relationship with the overall survival (OS) (HR 1.52; 95% CI 1.37-1.69), recurrence-free survival (RFS) (HR 1.64; 95% CI 1.44-1.87) and disease-free survival (DFS) (HR 1.50; 95% CI 1.35-1.67) of hepatocellular carcinoma. Additionally, preoperative NLR was also associated with tumor vascular invasion (OR 2.08; 95% CI 1.60-2.70), HBV (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.51-0.90) and large tumor size (OR: 4.07; 95% CI 2.60-6.37).Conclusion:The present meta-analysis indicated that preoperative NLR had significant association with the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma patients and may be an effectively prognostic indicator.
