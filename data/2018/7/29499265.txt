The in vitro antioxidant, cytotoxic and cytoprotective properties and in vivo hepatoprotective activities of crude polysaccharides extracted from cyanobacteria Phormidim versicolor NCC466 (CFv-PS) were investigated. The CFv-PS, identified as heteropolysaccharides with molecular weight of 63.79kDa, exhibited relatively strong antioxidant activity, in a concentration-depended manner, in vitro assays. Additionally, CFv-PS did not induce cytotoxic effect on HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells within the range of tested concentrations (25-150μg·mL-1) while preventing them against Cd. Moreover, in rats subjected to Cd-induced hepatotoxicity, CFv-PS pretreatment significantly (P<0.05) reduced the level of ALAT, ASAT, biliburin, MDA, protein carbonyl and DNA damage, and markedly increased enzyme activities in liver tissues. These findings suggest that the cyanobacteria Phormidium versicolor is a potential source of natural products possessing antioxidant, cytoprotective and hepatoprotective properties.
