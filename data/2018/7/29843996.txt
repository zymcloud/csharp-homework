Purpose:To examine the US nationwide experience with transarterial radioembolization (TARE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the years 2003-2012 and the prognostic factors associated with overall survival.Materials and methods:A retrospective cohort study from the National Cancer Database included 110,139 adult patients with HCC between 2003 and 2012, of whom 1,222 received TARE. Primary outcome of interest was mortality after treatment. Univariate and multivariate analyses for factors predicting mortality were performed for 961 patients treated between 2003 and 2011. Overall survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method.Results:There was a steady increase in utilization of TARE in the past decade. Most patients were white men with median age of 64 years. Of those patients, 67% received treatment at an academic institution, 42% were American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I or II, and 10% had metastatic disease at the time of treatment. Median overall survival was 13.3 months. Overall survival varied by patient and tumor characteristics. Female patients with tumors Conclusions:Use of TARE in patients with HCC has been increasing. Several factors are significantly associated with a less favorable outcome after TARE, including male sex, large tumors, and extrahepatic disease. These data can be used for designing future radioembolization trials.
