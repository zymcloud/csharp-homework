BACKGROUND miR-490-3p could play vital roles in multiple cancers. However, the role of miR-490-3p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains uncertain. In this study, we sought to explore the underlying role of miR-490-3p in HCC. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, we explored the clinical role of miR-490-3p in HCC via quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Then, a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the expression trend and diagnostic value of miR-490-3p in HCC. Furthermore, 12 miRNA prediction algorithms were applied to predict the potential target genes of miR-490-3p. The differentially expressed genes in HCC in the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database were also selected. Additionally, bioinformatics analyses were utilized to investigate the possible functions and pathways of the target genes. RESULTS miR-490-3p was clearly down-regulated in HCC based on RT-qPCR (P=0.002). Consistent with the results of RT-qPCR, miR-490 was more highly expressed in normal liver tissue than in HCC (P
