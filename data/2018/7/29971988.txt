Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent malignant tumors worldwide. Liver transplantation (LT) is known as a curative and therapeutic modality. However, the survival rates of recipients after LT are still not good enough because of tumor recurrence. To improve the survival rates of recipients after LT, identifying predictive factors for prognosis after LT and establishing a model assessing prognosis are very important to HCC patients. There has recently been a lot of clinical and basic research on recurrence and prognosis after LT. Progress has been made, especially in selection criteria for LT recipients and risk factors for predicting prognosis after LT. Hangzhou criteria, in line with China's high current incidence rate of primary liver, are first proposed by Chinese scholars of LT, and are accepted world-wide, and make an important contribution to the development of LT.
