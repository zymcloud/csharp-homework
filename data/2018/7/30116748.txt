Purpose:Restoration of the balance between T lymphocyte subsets and between Th1/Th2 cytokines together with improvement of antitumor immunity has been reported after hepatosplenectomy in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the detailed effects of partial splenic embolization (PSE) on host immunity are unknown. Accordingly, this study evaluated host immunity in patients with cirrhosis receiving PSE for thrombocytopenia.Methods:Twenty-three adult Japanese patients with cirrhosis and thrombocytopenia underwent PSE using straight coils at our hospital between 2010 and 2015. Blood samples were collected before PSE and 4 weeks after PSE.Results:The platelet counts were significantly higher 4 weeks after PSE compared with before PSE. The white blood cell count (neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes) also increased significantly after PSE. Furthermore, Th1 cells and Th2 cells showed a significant increase at 4 weeks after PSE compared with before PSE, although there was no significant change of Treg cells. Moreover, serum levels of TNF-alpha, soluble TNF receptor I, and soluble Fas were significantly increased after PSE. There was no significant change of the Child-Pugh score.Conclusions:In patients with cirrhosis and thrombocytopenia, PSE not only promoted the recovery of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia but also induced activation of host immunity.
