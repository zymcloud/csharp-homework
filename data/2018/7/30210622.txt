MicroRNAs (miRNAs) being proved to be involved in the carcinogenesis of numerous tumors. MicroRNA-124 (miR-124), identified as a tumor suppressor, has been demonstrated to exert pivotal roles in multiple processes of tumorigenesis. The present study demonstrated that miR-124 was low-expressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cell lines. In addition, overexpression of miR-124 through infected with miR-124 lentivirus inhibited the proliferation and migration of HCC in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo, whereas inhibition of miR-124 expression can reverse the process. Moreover, Baculoviral IAP Repeat Containing 3 (BIRC3) was identified as a target gene of miR-124. The BIRC3 mRNA expression was increased in HCC tissues and negatively correlated with miR-124 expression. Knockdown of BIRC3 recovered the miR-124-induced inhibiting effect on HCC progression. Furthermore, we found that up-regulation of miR-124 significantly inhibited p-P65, p-IκBα and c-Myc proteins expression. However, the effect of miR-124 up-regulation on HCC development was partly reversed by BIRC3 restoration. In conclusion, our data proved that miR-124 inhibits the proliferation and migration of HCC at least partly through targeting BIRC3 and regulating NF-κB signaling pathway, and it may be a therapeutic target for HCC prognosis.
