Hepatic schwannoma is a very rare hepatic tumor, usually appearing as a hypervascular solid mass with or without various degrees of cystic changes; however, to the best of our knowledge, only the two cases of hepatic schwannoma showing a multi-cystic appearance have previously been reported. We report herein a benign hepatic schwannoma presenting as an unusually large multi-cystic mass. The gadoxetic acid disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging features are described with the histopathologic correlation and briefly review the literature. The solid-like areas showing the early/progressive enhancement, reflecting remnants of the Antoni A/B portion, during the dynamic phases may be helpful imaging features for the differentiation of other multi-cystic hepatic lesions, but pathological evaluation remains essential for diagnosis.
