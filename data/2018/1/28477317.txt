Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome associated with germline pathogenic variants in TP53 gene. The phenotype may vary from classical to variant forms, known as Li-Fraumeni-like phenotypes. We searched for pathogenic variants in TP53 in a 14 year-old female diagnosed with fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma, a rare subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma. The proband is a heterozygote carrier of the TP53 c.467G>A (p.Arg156His) in exon 5, and her mother is an asymptomatic carrier. Analysis of tumor DNA disclosed an additional somatic mutation in TP53, c.461G>A; p.Gly154Asp. The TP53 germline and somatic pathogenic variants may have acted as possible driver mutations, resulting in genomic instability and tumor development. The fibrolamellar subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma may be part of the broad spectrum of tumors associated with Li-Fraumeni phenotype.
