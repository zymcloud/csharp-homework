Background:Patients suffering from peritoneal metastasis of biliary tract cancer were treated with pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC).Patients and methods:This was a study carried out at a single institution, tertiary referral center certified for therapy of peritoneal disease. Retrospective data analysis was performed of prospective data for PIPAC with intra-peritoneal low-dose doxorubicin (1.5 mg/m2) and cisplatin (7.5 mg/m2) delivered at intervals of 6 weeks. The outcome criteria were microscopic pathological response, survival, and adverse events [Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (v4.0)].Results:A total of 13 patients (male/female=8/5) with a mean age of 58 (range=37-75) years underwent 17 PIPAC procedures without intraoperative complications. The mean number of PIPAC applications was 1.3 (range=0-3). Due to non-accessibility of the abdominal cavity in two patients (15.4%) and rapid clinical deterioration in six patients (46%), five patients underwent two or more PIPAC applications and were, therefore, eligible for histological analysis to assess carcinoma regression. Overall tumor regression of any degree was determined in 4/5 patients. An overall median survival of 85 days (95% confidence interval(CI)=59.2-110.4 days) after the first PIPAC application was observed. No complications greater than Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (v4.0) level 2 occurred.Conclusion:PIPAC can induce objective regression of systemic chemotherapy-resistant peritoneal metastasis of biliary tract cancer. However, due to a rapid clinical deterioration of the patients, almost two-thirds of the patients cannot undergo repetitive PIPAC courses.
