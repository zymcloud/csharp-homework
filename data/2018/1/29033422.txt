A 49-year-old woman who was asymptomatic was found to have a small liver tumor on abdominal ultrasonography (US) at her annual health checkup. US revealed a hypoechoic, solid, mass measuring 17-mm in size in segment 6. The tumor markers associated with liver malignancy were negative. An infectious disease screen was negative for hepatitis B surface antigen, but positive for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen. Imaging studies using computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and CT angiography suggested a malignant liver tumor, such as hepatocellular carcinoma. Partial hepatic resection of the posterior segment was performed. The pathological diagnosis was pseudolymphoma of the liver.
HBc antibody; hepatic pseudolymphoma; hepatocellular carcinoma; occult hepatitis B; reactive lymphoid hyperplasia.
