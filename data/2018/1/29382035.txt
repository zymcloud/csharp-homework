Corylin is a flavonoid extracted from the nuts of Psoralea corylifolia L. (Fabaceae), which is a widely used anti-inflammatory and anticancer herb in China. Recent studies revealed antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and bone differentiation-promoting effects of corylin. However, there are no studies examining the anticancer activity of corylin. In this study, we used cells and animal models to examine the antitumor effects of corylin on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and then studied its downstream regulatory mechanisms. The results showed that corylin significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of HCC cells and suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We found that the anti-HCC mechanism of corylin's action lies in the upregulation of tumor suppressor long noncoding RNA growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) and the activation of its downstream anticancer pathways. In animal experiments, we also found that corylin can significantly inhibit tumor growth without significant physiological toxicity. The above results suggest that corylin has anti-HCC effects and good potential as a clinical treatment.
