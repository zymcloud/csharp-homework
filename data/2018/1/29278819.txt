A sensitive and reliable multi-mycotoxin-based method was developed to identify and quantify several carcinogenic mycotoxins in human blood and urine, as well as edible animal tissues, including muscle and liver tissue from swine and chickens, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). For the toxicokinetic studies with individual mycotoxins, highly sensitive analyte-specific LC-MS/MS methods were developed for rat plasma and urine. Sample purification consisted of a rapid 'dilute and shoot' approach in urine samples, a simple 'dilute, evaporate and shoot' approach in plasma samples and a 'QuEChERS' procedure in edible animal tissues. The multi-mycotoxin and analyte-specific methods were validated in-house: The limits of detection (LOD) for the multi-mycotoxin and analyte-specific methods ranged from 0.02 to 0.41 μg/kg (μg/L) and 0.01 to 0.19 μg/L, respectively, and limits of quantification (LOQ) between 0.10 to 1.02 μg/kg (μg/L) and 0.09 to 0.47 μg/L, respectively. Apparent recoveries of the samples spiked with 0.25 to 4 μg/kg (μg/L) ranged from 60.1% to 109.8% with relative standard deviations below 15%. The methods were successfully applied to real samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study carried out using a small group of patients from the Chinese population with hepatocellular carcinoma to assess their exposure to carcinogenic mycotoxins using biomarkers. Finally, the multi-mycotoxin method is a useful analytical method for assessing exposure to mycotoxins edible in animal tissues. The analyte-specific methods could be useful during toxicokinetic and toxicological studies.
