Background:Patients with borderline (BR) or locally advanced (LA) pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) are often treated with induction FOLFIRINOX (FLX). However, the role of additional preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is controversial. The aim of this study is to evaluate its impact in patients who underwent resection after induction FLX.Patients and methods:Retrospective analysis of prospective consecutive surgical BR or LA PAC patients after induction FLX in 23 French centers between November 2010 and December 2015, treated with or without preoperative additional CRT (FLX vs FLX + CRT groups).Results:Two hundred three patients were included (106 BR, 97 LA PAC). Median number of FLX cycles was 6 (range 1-30); 50% (n = 102) of patients received additional CRT. Median duration between diagnosis and surgery was 5.4 and 8.7 months (P = 0.001) in the FLX and FLX + CRT group, respectively. The 90-day mortality, major complications, and pancreatic fistula rates were 4.4%, 17.7%, and 5.4%, respectively. After 45.1 months follow-up, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival were 45.4 months and 16.2 months, respectively. Patients with additional CRT had higher R0 resection rate (89.2% vs 76.3%; P = 0.017), ypN0 rate (76.2% vs 48.5%; P < 0.001), and higher rate of pathologic major response (33.3% vs 12.9%; P = 0.001). In the FLX + CRT group, patients had lower rate of locoregional relapse (28.3% vs 50.7%; P = 0.004). Patients with additional CRT had longer OS than those receiving FLX alone (57.8 vs 35.5 months; P = 0.007).Conclusions:Pathological results and survival data argue for interest in additional CRT. Prospective studies on an intention-to-treat basis are needed to confirm these results.
