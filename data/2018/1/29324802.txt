Background:Previous studies have discussed the liver stiffness measurement (LSM) performance on predicting liver-related surgical outcomes for patients of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) under hepatic resection, yet there is much variation in reporting and consistency of findings. Therefore, we report a meta-analysis on this issue.Methods:We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of science to find the eligible cohort studies. The pooled Odds Ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate effect. The weighted mean LSM value was calculated as the optimal LSM cut-off value among studies.Results:12 prospective cohort studies and one retrospective cohort study, including a total of 1942 cases were identified. The pooled results showed that preoperative LSM is significantly associated with the occurrence of overall postoperative complications (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.46-2.11). In addition, a weighted mean LSM value of 14.2 kPa and 11.3KPa were suggested as the optimal LSM cut-off value reference using transient elastoqraphy (TE) for predicting overall postoperative complications in Asia countries and European countries, respectively.Conclusions:Preoperative LSM should be taken into account cautiously in the management of patients undergoing hepatectomy of HCC. Future studies could focus on setting a prognostic model integrated with LSM in predicting post-hepatectomy outcomes.
