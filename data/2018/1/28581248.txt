Background & aims:We tested whether non-invasive tests for liver disease severity can stratify hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients showing low-level viremia (LLV, HBV DNA Methods:A retrospective cohort of 1006 chronic hepatitis B patients showing persistently LLV, defined by at least two consecutive assessments in the year before enrolment, was assessed for HCC development. Two non-invasive serum biomarkers, the aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) and the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), were tested. Cirrhosis was defined with ultrasonography.Results:During a median 5.1 years of follow-up, HCC developed in 36 patients. HCC incidence rate at 5 years was significantly higher for cirrhotic patients (19/139, 13.7%), but was not null for non-cirrhotic patients (17/867, 2.0%, PConclusions:The combined use of two non-invasive serum biomarkers (APRI and FIB-4) could stratify HCC risk for chronic HBV-infected patients with LLV.
