Aim:To investigate the relationship between glucose metabolism and glypican-3 (GPC3) expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Immunohistochemical staining of pathological samples for GPC3 and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), and whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT for measuring tumour glucose uptake were performed in 55 newly diagnosed HCC patients. The maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) and tumour-to-non-tumourous liver uptake (T/NT) ratio were used to quantify 18F-FDG uptake. In vitro18F-FDG uptake assay of GPC3-expressing HepG2 and non-GPC3-expressing RH7777 cells was used to examine the effect of GPC3 in cellular glucose metabolism. The relationships between GPC3 expression and 18F-FDG uptake, GLUT1 expression, tumour differentiation, and other clinical indicators were analysed using Spearman rank correlation, univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses.Results:Positive GPC3 expression was observed in 67.3% of HCC patients, including 75.0% of those with well or moderately differentiated HCC and 36.4% of those with poorly differentiated HCC. There was an inverse relationship between GPC3 expression and SUVmax (Spearman correlation coefficient = -0.281, P = 0.038) and a positive relationship between GLUT1 expression and SUVmax (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.681, P < 0.001) in patients with HCC. Univariate analysis showed that two glucose metabolic parameters (SUVmax and T/NT ratio), tumour differentiation, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage were all significantly associated with GPC3 expression (P < 0.05), whereas GLUT1 expression, sex, age, tumour size, intrahepatic lesion number, and distant metastasis showed no statistical association (P > 0.05). Further multivariate analysis revealed that only the T/N ratio was signiÔ¨Åcantly correlated with GPC3 expression in patients with HCC (P < 0.05). In vitro assay revealed that the uptake of 18F-FDG in GPC3-expressing HepG2 cells was significantly lower than that of non-GPC3-expressing RH7777 cells (t = -20.352, P < 0.001).Conclusion:The present study demonstrated that GPC3 expression is inversely associated with glucose metabolism, suggesting that GPC3 may play a role in regulating glucose metabolism in HCC.
