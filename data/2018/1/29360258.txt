The unfolded protein response (UPR) improves endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein folding in order to alleviate stress. Yet it is becoming increasingly clear that the UPR regulates processes well beyond those directly involved in protein folding, in some cases by mechanisms that fall outside the realm of canonical UPR signaling. These pathways are highly specific from one cell type to another, implying that ER stress signaling affects each tissue in a unique way. Perhaps nowhere is this more evident than in the liver, which-beyond being a highly secretory tissue-is a key regulator of peripheral metabolism and a uniquely proliferative organ upon damage. The liver provides a powerful model system for exploring how and why the UPR extends its reach into physiological processes that occur outside the ER, and how ER stress contributes to the many systemic diseases that involve liver dysfunction. This review will highlight the ways in which the study of ER stress in the liver has expanded the view of the UPR to a response that is a key guardian of cellular homeostasis outside of just the narrow realm of ER protein folding.
