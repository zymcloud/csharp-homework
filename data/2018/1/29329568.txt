Background:To determine the effect of Yttrium-90 (Y90) radioembolization on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and its effect on overall survival advanced, unresectable infiltrative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with concurrent portal vein thrombosis (PVT).Methods:Consecutive patients with unresectable infiltrative HCC and PVT were recruited. The Short-Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire was used to assess HRQOL for consecutive patients treated with glass-based Y90 based on a prospective phase II trial. MR imaging was used to determine tumor progression every 3 months post-treatment. Overall survival (OS) from treatment and time to progression (TTP) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimation and log-rank test.Results:Thirty patients were treated and followed for 17.4 months; physical and mental component summary scores (PCS & MCS) remained unchanged at one, three, and six months. While no difference was observed in baseline SF-36 scores for patients with prolonged TTP (≥4 months) and OS (≥ 6 months), corresponding 1-month PCS were significantly higher than those with TTP Conclusion:Y90 radioembolization for HCC demonstrated long-term preservation of HRQOL. Lower baseline HRQOL scores were predictive of poorer OS. Early (1 month post-treatment) significant decreases in PCS were independent predictors of poorer OS and TTP.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01556282 , registered March 16, 2012.
