Radiologists play a central role in the assessment of patient response to locoregional therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The identification of viable tumor following treatment guides further management and potentially affects transplantation eligibility. Liver Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (LI-RADS) first introduced the concept of LR-treated in 2014, and a new treatment response algorithm is included in the 2017 update to assist radiologists in image interpretation of HCC after locoregional therapy. In addition to offering imaging criteria for viable and nonviable HCC, new concepts of nonevaluable tumors as well as tumors with equivocal viability are introduced. Existing guidelines provided by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) and modified RECIST address patient-level assessments and are routinely used in clinical trials but do not address the variable appearances following different locoregional therapies. The new LI-RADS treatment response algorithm addresses this gap and offers a comprehensive approach to assess treatment response for individual lesions after a variety of locoregional therapies, using either contrast-enhanced CT or MRI.
