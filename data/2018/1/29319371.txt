Palliative radiotherapy improves lung cancer related symptoms. Prognosis should be taken into account when deciding about fractionation. In this study, prognostic factors derived from multivariate analysis were used to assign a point sum reflecting 6-month survival. Four prognostic groups were compared. Performance status, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, liver/adrenal gland metastases, and extrathoracic disease status significantly predicted survival and formed the basis of the score. The four groups had a median survival of 0.8, 1.6, 3.3, and 10.5 months (6-month survival 0, 10, 30, 70%; 12-month survival 0, 0, 12, 40%; p = 0.0001), respectively. In the unfavorable group best supportive care might be preferable.
