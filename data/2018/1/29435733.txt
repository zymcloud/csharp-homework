Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary malignant tumor in the liver. One of the main features of cancer survival is the generalized loss of growth control exhibited by cancer cells, and Miki is a protein related to the immunoglobulin superfamily that plays an important role in mitosis. We aim to study protein expression levels of Miki in non-tumoral liver and 20 HCCs recruited from a Pathology Department. Clinical information was also obtained. A tissue microarray was performed, and immunohistochemical techniques applied to study protein expression levels of Miki. In normal liver, Miki was weakly expressed, showing nuclear staining in the hepatocytes. Cirrhotic areas and HCCs showed a variety of staining patterns. Most HCC samples showed positive expression, with three different staining patterns being discernible: nuclear, cytoplasmic and mixed. Statistical analysis showed a significant association between grade of differentiation, Ki-67 proliferative index, survival rates and staining patterns. This study has revealed the positive expression of Miki in normal liver, cirrhotic areas and HCCs. Three different staining patterns of Miki expression with clinical relevance were noted in HCCs.
