We report a case of advanced breast cancer with liver metastasis(T2N1M1, Stage IV )achieving a significant improvement of QOL by multi-disciplinary therapy. The patient was 37-year-old woman who had breast lump and axillary lymph nodes swelling with liver metastasis. A core needle biopsy for breast tumor led to a diagnosis of an invasive ductal carcinoma, negative for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, and positive for HER2/neu protein expression. The Ki-67 positive cell index was 40%. She received 16 courses of DOC plus HER plus PER(docetaxel 75mg/m / 2, trastuzumab 6 mg/kg, pertu- zumab 450mg/body, and received 4 courses of EC(epirubicin 90mg/m / 2, cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2). The breast lesion and liver metastatic lesion disappeared after chemotherapy. We checked up whole body. There was no metastatic lesion. Therefore, we diagnosed a clinical complete response. We performed muscle preserving mastectomy and axillary lymph nodes dissection. The pathological diagnosis from resected specimens were pathological complete response. The surgical margin was negative. She was started the endocrine therapy by tamoxifen(20mg/day). Three years after surgery, she was well without metastases. Multi-disciplinary therapy can improve patient QOL and the clinical outcomes in Stage IV advanced breast cancer.
