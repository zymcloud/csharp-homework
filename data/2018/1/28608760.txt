To develop an effective therapeutic treatment, the potential of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)-polyethylene glycol-retinoic acid (PLGA-PEG-RA) polymeric micelles for targeted delivery of irinotecan to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and colorectal cancer cell lines (HT-29) was evaluated. PLGA-PEG-RA was synthesized by amide reaction of PLGA with NH2-PEG-NH2 and then PLGA-PEG-NH2 with RA and confirmed by FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Irinotecan-loaded nanomicelles were prepared using thin-film hydration method and the impact of various formulation variables on their particle size (PS), polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential (ZP), entrapment efficiency (EE), and mean release time (MRT) were assessed using a Taguchi design. TEM was used to observe morphology of the nanomicelles and the CMC was determined by fluorescence spectroscopy. Adopted PLGA-PEG-RA nanomicelle exhibited PS of 160 ± 9.13 nm, PDI of 0.20 ± 0.05, ZP of -24.9 ± 4.03 mV, EE of 83.9 ± 3.61%, MRT of 3.28 ± 0.35 h, and CMC value of 25.7 μg/mL. Cytotoxicity of the targeted nanomicelles on HepG2 and HT-29 cell lines was significantly higher than that of non-targeted nanomicelles and the free drug. These results suggest that PLGA-PEG-RA nanomicelles could be an efficient delivery system of irinotecan for targeted therapy of colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.
