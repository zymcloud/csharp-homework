Chemotherapeutic treatments against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are necessary for both inoperable patients to improve prospects for survival and surgery patients to improve the outcome after surgical resection. However, multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major obstacle to obtaining desirable results. Currently, increasing the chemotherapy sensitivity of tumor cells or discovering novel tumor inhibitors is an effective therapeutic strategy to solve this issue. In the present study, we uncovered the dual-inhibitory effect of miR-338-5p: on the one hand, it could downregulate ABCB1 expression and sensitize HCC cells to doxorubicin and vinblastine by directly targeting the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of ABCB1, while, on the other hand, it could suppress the proliferation of HCC cells by directly targeting the 3'-UTR of EGFR and reducing EGFR expression. Since EGFR regulates ABCB1 levels, the indirect action of miR-338-5p in ABCB1 modulation was revealed, in which miR-338-5p inhibits ABCB1 expression by targeting the EGFR/ERK1/2 signaling pathway. These data indicate that the miR-338-5p/EGFR/ABCB1 regulatory loop plays a critical role in HCC, and a negative correlation between miR-338-5p and EGFR or ABCB1 was also detected in HCC clinical samples. In conclusion, these findings reveal a critical role for miR-338-5p in the regulation of MDR and proliferation of HCC, suggesting the potential therapeutic implications of miR-338-5p in HCC treatment.
