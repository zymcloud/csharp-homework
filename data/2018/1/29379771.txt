Association between altered glycosylation patterns and poor prognosis in cancer points glycans as potential specific tumor markers. Most proteins are glycosylated and functionally arranged on cell surface and extracellular matrix, mediating interactions and cellular signaling. Thereby, aberrant glycans may be considered a pathological phenotype at least as important as changes in protein expression for cancer and other complex diseases. As most serum glycoproteins have hepatic origin, liver disease phenotypes, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), may present altered glycan profile and display important modifications. One of the prominent obstacles in HCC is the diagnostic in advanced stages when patients have several liver dysfunctions, limiting treatment options and life expectancy. The characterization of glycomic profiles in pathological conditions by means of mass spectrometry (MS) may lead to the discovery of early diagnostic markers using non-invasive approaches. MS is a powerful analytical technique capable of elucidating many glycobiological issues and overcome limitations of the serological markers currently applied in clinical practice. Therefore, MS-based glycomics of tumor biomarkers is a promising tool to increase early detection and monitoring of disease.
