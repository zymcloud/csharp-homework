Thermosensitive glucose-functionalized glycopolymers grafted gold nanoparticles (Glyco@GNPs) with good colloidal stability and thermosensitive in aqueous solution were fabricated by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) mediated one-pot synthesis. The formation of core-shell morphology with about a 60 nm gold core in diameter and a glycopolymer shell of about 80 nm in thickness was indicated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The recognition ability of the Glyco@GNPs toward lectin concannavalin A (Con A) was verified by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The good cytocompatibility of the glycopolymers and Glyco@GNPs was proven by MTT assay on L-929 cells. Glyco@GNPs could effectively inhibit hepatoma cells SMMC-7721 growth after recognizing Con A was also proved by MTT assay and flow cytometry assay.
