Introduction:This study reviews the evidence for the use of Bortezomib (BZB), a first-in-class proteasome inhibitor in advanced Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This review aims to delineate the role of BZB within the management of non-surgical and metastatic HCC, either as an alternative or as an adjunct to the current treatment paradigm.Areas covered:In addition to BZB pharmacology and mechanism of action, safety and tolerance profiles of the drug obtained from clinical trials are explored. The utility of BZB as a therapeutic agent either alone or in combination with other therapies against HCC, including its application in both preclinical and clinical settings has been reviewed. In particular, we highlight the importance of preclinical evaluation of BZB as a combinatorial agent in synergism with other therapies for the use in the management of HCC.Expert opinion:There has been much interest surrounding the use of BZB, a first-in-class proteasome inhibitor for HCC therapy. The discernment of outcomes of BZB clinical trials for HCC need to take into consideration the disease-specific factors that can affect survival outcomes including patient selection and aetiological differences. Further preclinical testing of BZB in combination with other therapeutic modalities can be important for eliciting enhanced anti-HCC effects.
