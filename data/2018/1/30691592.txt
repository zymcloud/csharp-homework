Background:The oncological effects of obesity on liver transplant (LT) patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. We investigated patient overall survival and tested two-way interactions between donor and recipient obesity status.Methods:Using the UNOS database, a total of 8352 LT recipients with HCC were included. Donors and recipients were stratified in normal weight (NW), overweight (OW) and obese (OB). Hazard ratios (HR) for any cause of death and interactions between recipient and donor BMI were estimated by multivariate flexible parametric models.Results:Five-year overall survival was 66% for NW, 67% for OW and 68% for OB recipients. The HRs of death from all causes were 0.96 (95% CI: 0.86-1.08) for OW and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.82-1.05) for OB recipients when compared to NW patients. At multivariate analysis, predictors of inferior survival were recipient age (≥65 years), donor age (≥45 years), need for pre-operative dialysis, HCV infection, transplants performed before 2007, and UNOS regions 2,3,9,10, and 11. The lowest adjusted HR was measured for recipients with BMI between 25 and 35 and there were no interactions between recipient and donor BMI.Conclusions:the overall survival of LT recipients with HCC was not affected by donor or recipient obesity.
