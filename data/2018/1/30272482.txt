Objective:The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the safety and effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) by using a multiple-electrode switching system to treat unresectable medium-large (3.1-6.0 cm) HCC nodules.Methods:RFA using a multiple-electrode switching system was performed for HCC nodules with size > 3.0 Results:No procedure-related death or major complications occurred. Complete ablation was obtained in all nodules (100%). At a median follow up of 30 months, local tumor progression occurred in five out of 26 nodules (19.2%). Overall survival at 4 years was 49%.Conclusion:RFA with a multiple-electrode switching system may be a safe, quick and effective therapeutic option for treatment of 3.1-ï»¿6.0 cm unresectable HCC tumours.Advances in knowledge:RFA with multiple electrodes provides favourable clinical results in patients with medium-large HCC nodules who are not suitable for surgery.
