Objective:Cisplatin is an important anti-cancer drug. However, the molecular mechanism of cisplatin on inhibition of the proliferation of liver cancer cells is unclear. Thus, we aimed to investigate the regulatory role of cisplatin on the growth and apoptosis of hepatoma LM3 cells.Materials and methods:LM3 cells were treated with cisplatin (2 μmol/L) for 48 h. MTT assay, flow cytometry, and caspase-3 activity assay were used to detect the growth, proliferation and apoptosis of LM3 cells. Western blot was applied to detect the expression of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein, XIAP. siRNA was used to knockdown the level of XIAP followed by cisplatin (2 μmol/L) treatment, and then the apoptosis of LM3 cells was measured.Results:The treatment of cisplatin significantly inhibited the growth but induced the apoptosis of LM3 cells. Cisplatin also downregulated the expression of XIAP. The downregulation of XIAP by using siRNA enhanced the apoptosis of LM3 cells induced by cisplatin.Conclusions:Downregulation of XIAP enhanced the proapoptotic effect of cisplatin on LM3 cells, suggesting that XIAP might be used as a potential target in the treatment of liver cancer.
