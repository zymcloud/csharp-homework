The development of minimally invasive treatment over the last two decades has had a great impact on hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated primary liver cancer. The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score is the optimal evaluated parameter for mortality in patients with end-stage liver disease. However, the association between MELD score and minimally invasive treatment with regard to the mortality of patients with HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with a portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) remains unclear. In the present study, a total of 173 patients who had been diagnosed with HBV-associated HCC and PVTT in the Beijing Ditan Hospital (Beijing, China), between January 2012 and January 2015, were screened. Follow-up was performed to observe the survival time and collect information on the demographic characteristics and associated clinical indicators present in the cohort. The patient's age, sex, laboratory parameters and the use of minimally invasive treatment were analyzed with SPSS 20.0 software. Independent risk factors for mortality were screened by Cox regression analysis. Logistic regression indicated that there was an interaction between the MELD score and minimally invasive treatment. In addition, a MELD score â‰¤17.85 was associated with a lower mortality rate subsequent to minimally invasive treatment.
