Tumor environmental sensitive polypeptide integrated photosensitizer is a platform for imaging-guided photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, the photosensitizer leakage during blood circulation, poor accumulation in tumor tissue and inferior quantum yield of singlet oxygen are still challenges. Herein, NHS-active boron-dipyrromethene derivative with bromine substituted NHS-BODIPY-Br2 was first synthesized, which possessed high singlet oxygen generation efficiency and near infrared (NIR) fluorescence, and then it was conjugated to a sharp pH (6.36) sensitive polypeptide to achieve a macrophotosensitizer for NIR imaging-guided PDT. In vitro study showed that the macrophotosensitizer nanoparticles exhibited good cellular uptake and ability to kill cancer cells. Once accumulating in the tumor tissues, the nanoparticles can be demicellized by tumor acidity to promote cellular uptake, which could enlarge fluorescence signal intensity and enhance in vivo PDT therapeutic effect upon NIR laser irradiation. It provides a strategy to design photosensitizer conjugated tumor acidity sensitive polypeptide for NIR imaging-guided photodynamic therapy.
