Circular RNAs (circRNA), a class of noncoding RNAs, have been found to be involved in various diseases. Here, the expression levels of the circRNA hsa_circ_0001445 in 73 pairs of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and adjacent nontumor tissues were investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Our data demonstrate that the hsa_circ_0001445 levels were significantly decreased in HCC tissues (P < 0.001) and markedly associated with the number of tumor foci (P = 0.014). Furthermore, in vitro approaches showed that overexpression of hsa_circ_0001445 promoted apoptosis and inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC-derived cells, suggesting that hsa_circ_0001445 might be involved in the development of HCC. In addition, we found that the plasma hsa_circ_0001445 transcription levels in HCC patients were lower than those in cirrhosis (P < 0.001) and hepatitis B (P < 0.001) patients as well as in healthy controls (P < 0.001). In fact, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that plasma hsa_circ_0001445 could be a fairly accurate marker to distinguish HCC cases from healthy controls as well as patients with cirrhosis or hepatitis B.
