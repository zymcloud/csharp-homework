Background:Recently, pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (pro-GRP) became available as an alternative sensitive, specific and reliable tumor marker for patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), both in limited (LD) and diffuse disease (DD).Methods:We retrospectively analyzed pro-GRP, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and CEA in patients with SCLC and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Serum pro-GRP level was measured with electrochemiluminescence at our laboratory (cutoff 77.8 pg/mL). Continuous variables were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney test, contingency data with Fisher's exact test. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to identify threshold values to set the highest sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) values.Results:A total of 65 patients were studied (49 men, median age 67 years, range 27-79). Thirty-seven patients had SCLC (29 DD, 8 LD) and 28 advanced NSCLC. Median pro-GRP level was 919 pg/mL (range 22-147,350) in SCLC and 32 pg/mL (range 10-119.2) in NSCLC (p<0.0001). NSE was 4.38-fold higher in SCLC patients (p = 0.0005); CEA did not reveal significant differences between groups. Pro-GRP Sn and Sp were 86.4% and 96.4%, respectively. With ROC curve analysis, a cutoff value of 329.3 pg/mL showed a Sn of 75.8% and Sp of 87.5% in discriminating DD from LD. Pro-GRP was not influenced by either liver metastases or renal impairment.Conclusions:Pro-GRP is sensitive for SCLC diagnosis. Since high marker levels are related to high disease burden, pro-GRP may have a negative prognostic significance. Follow-up studies are required to define its role in clinical practice in monitoring responses to treatment and early relapses.
