Purpose:The intermediate stage of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC] B) comprises a highly heterogeneous population, and the treatment strategy is still controversial. Because of the heterogeneity, a subclassification of intermediate-stage HCCs was put forward by Bolondi according to the 'beyond Milan and within up-to-7' criteria and Child-Pugh score. In this study, we aim to analyze the prognosis of BCLC-B stage HCC patients who received hepatic resection according to the Bolondi's subclassification.Materials and methods:One thousand and one hundred three patients diagnosedwith HCC and treatedwith hepatic resectionwere enrolled in our hospital between 2006 and 2012. According to Bolondi's subclassification, the BCLC-B patients were divided into four groups. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed.Results:According to Bolondi's subclassification, the BCLC-B patients were divided into four groups: B1 (n=41, 18.7%), B2 (n=160, 73.1%), B3 (n=11, 5.0%), and B4 (n=7, 3.2%). Significant difference was observed between B1 and other groups (B1 vs. B2, p=0.022; B1 vs. B3, p Conclusion:In our study, HCC patients at B1 stagewere benefited from hepatic resection and had similar survival to BCLC-A stage patients. Our study provided rationality of hepatic resection for selected BCLC-B stage HCC patients instead of routine transarterial chemoembolization.
