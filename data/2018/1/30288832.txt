Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of noncoding, endogenous, single-stranded RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides in length that are transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Mounting evidence has indicated that lncRNAs play key roles in several physiological and pathological processes by modifying gene expression at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, epigenetic, and translation levels. Many reports have demonstrated that lncRNAs function as potential oncogene or tumour suppressors and thus play vital regulatory roles in tumourigenesis and tumour progression. ZNFX1 antisense RNA 1 (ZFAS1), a novel lncRNA transcribed in the antisense orientation of zinc finger NFX1-type containing 1(ZNFX1), was found to be increased in multiple cancers, such as gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, contributing to cancer development and progression. In the present review, we summarized recent progression on study of the functions and underlying molecular mechanisms of ZFAS1 related to occurrence and development of multiple cancers.
