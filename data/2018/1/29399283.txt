Aim:To assess the usefulness of intra-arterial contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (IAUS) during transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with drug-eluting beads (DEB) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Thirty two patients with 39 HCC underwent DEB-TACE guided with IAUS, and examined by contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) or dynamic CT after DEB-TACE were enrolled in this study. CEUS findings before DEB-TACE and IAUS findings were compared. Treatments judged to be complete and incomplete for lesions were appropriate and insufficient, respectively. Findings on CEUS and/or dynamic CT performed 1, 3 and 6 mo after DEB-TACE were evaluated using mRECIST (CR/PR/SD/PD).Results:The treatments were complete and incomplete in 26 and 13 lesions, respectively. On imaging evaluation using CEUS and/or dynamic CT one month after treatment, 25 and 1 lesions were judged to be CR and PR, respectively, and at 6 mo after treatment, the results were CR, PR, SD and PD for 24, 1, 0 and 1 of these lesions, respectively, in the 26 completely treated lesions. Of the 13 lesions in which treatment was incomplete, the results on imaging at one month after treatment were CR, PR, SD and PD for 0, 6, 4 and 3 lesions, respectively. The overall CR rate at 6 mo after treatment was 61.5% (24/39).Conclusion:A combination of DEB-TACE with IAUS can improve the therapeutic effects in patients with HCC.
