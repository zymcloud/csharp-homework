Effects of interventional embolotherapy on the expression of fragile histidine triad (FHIT) and p16 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients were investigated. Patients with primary HCC who were definitely diagnosed and treated in the Department of Gastroenterology in Qingdao Central Hospital from March 2014 to March 2016 were selected, and they underwent interventional embolotherapy. HCC and cancer-adjacent tissues of the patients were harvested for immunohistochemical staining. The correlation between the expression levels of FHIT and p16 was analyzed at the gene and protein level. Clinical data were collected, and whether they were correlated with the expression of FHIT and p16 was investigated. The expression levels of FHIT and p16 in primary HCC tissues were remarkably lower than that in cancer-adjacent tissues (P
