MicroRNAs (miRNAs) diagnostics can be useful for diagnosing or confirming miRNA abundance and are used in screening tests and to assess changes in miRNAs in vivo. At present, the use of traditional nucleic acid amplification assays to detect miRNAs has been limited in laboratory environment because of the time, equipment, and technical expertise required to perform these assays. A specialized, rapid affordable miRNA detection system is necessary when there are limited resources or point-of-care testing needs. We designed a portable and affordable fluorescence-based miRNA detection system based on isothermal signal amplification technology, using SYBR Green II as a fluorescent dye. To reduce costs, we chose LED as a light source and designed the corresponding optical path for LED. The portable detection system shows results consistent with those by real-time PCR, and can be used to detect miR-183 with a limit of detection of approximately 2 fmol. We used the system to detect miR-183 in tissues and blood from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The results from the portable detection device were compared with those from clinical trials and indicated that the miR-183 fluorescence signal could successfully identify HCC and provide information related to cancer progression.
