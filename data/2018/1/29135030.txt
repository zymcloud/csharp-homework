Objectives:To determine whether older adults with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) achieve a sustained viral response (SVR) after treatment with direct-acting antiviral therapy.Participants:Individuals aged 80 and older with chronic HCV infection (N = 253; n = 213 with cirrhosis, n = 40 with advanced fibrosis).Measurements:We investigated the efficacy, safety, and global clinical effect of treatment with different combinations of direct antiviral agents (DAAs). Participants with cirrhosis were staged according to Child-Pugh-Turcotte class, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, and the D'Amico staging system. The type and number of comorbidities at baseline and hepatic and nonhepatic events during follow-up were registered.Results:Ninety-five percent of participants with cirrhosis and 95% of those with advanced fibrosis attained SVR. The rate was independent of sex, HCV genotype, and treatment schedule. During a mean follow-up of 14 Â± 4 months (range 5-23 months), 34 events occurred in 27 participants: 10 hepatocellular carcinomas, 12 hepatic decompensations, 9 nonhepatic events, 3 deaths. Multivariate analysis of risk factors for experiencing adverse events during follow up showed that participants in D'Amico Stages 4 and 5, with a baseline serum albumin level of 3.5 mg/dL or less, and 3 or more comorbidities were the most at risk.Conclusion:In a real-world setting, DAAs are safe and effective in older adults with HCV-related advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Individuals with preserved albumin synthesis and fewer than 3 comorbidities at baseline have the most to gain from long-term DAA therapy.
