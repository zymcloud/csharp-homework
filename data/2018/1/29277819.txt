Background/aim:To investigate the utility of adjuvant hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) following hepatectomy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with intrahepatic dissemination (IHD) after local ablation therapy.Patients and methods:Twelve patients with HCC with IHD were divided into two groups: HAIC group (n=6) underwent hepatectomy followed by HAIC; and the non-HAIC group (n=6) underwent hepatectomy alone. HAIC with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil was started within a month and was continued for a month: Results: At the first local ablation, tumors close to the major portal vein and insufficient ablation were recognized in eight (67.7%) and six (58.3%) of the patients, respectively. In the HAIC group, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 50.0%, 16.7%, and 16.7%, and 83.3%, 83.3% and 62.5%, respectively. Three patients in the HAIC group remain alive after 10 years of follow-up.Conclusion:Hepatic resection with short-term postoperative HAIC may provide excellent outcomes in patients with HCC and IHD.
