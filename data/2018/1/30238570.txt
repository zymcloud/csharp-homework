Due to the advances made in research based on next generation sequencers, it is now possible to detect and analyze epigenetic abnormalities associated with cancer. DNA methylation, various histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA-associated gene silencing are considered to be transcriptional regulatory mechanisms associated with gene expression changes. The breakdown of this precise regulatory system is involved in the transition to cancer. The important role of epigenetic regulation can be observed from the high rate of genetic mutations and abnormal gene expression leading to a breakdown in epigenetic gene expression regulation seen in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Based on an understanding of epigenomic abnormalities associated with pathological conditions, these findings will lead the way to diagnosis and treatment. In particular, in addition to the fact that there are few choices in terms of extant drug therapies aimed at HCC, there are limits to their antitumor effects. The clinical application of epigenetic therapeutic agents for HCC has only just begun, and future developments are expected.
