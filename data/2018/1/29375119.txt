BACKGROUND Rhabdomyolysis syndrome is a rare surgical complication. It is infrequently reported in prolonged operations under lateral decubitus position. This syndrome mainly impacts kidney function and electrolytes levels; liver is another organ that is uncommonly affected. CASE REPORT A 54-year-old male underwent a partial hepatectomy in the supine position, the procedure lasted three hours. After five days of uneventful recovery from surgery, he was readmitted to the hospital with rhabdomyolysis syndrome involving his lower limbs. No predisposing factors other than surgery could be identified. Based on blood tests, the only affected organ was the liver. Upon aggressive hydration, the creatinine kinase, hepatic enzymes, bilirubin levels, and prothrombin time were normalized. The patient regained normal physical strength over the next few weeks. CONCLUSIONS Liver dysfunction secondary to rhabdomyolysis is rare but should be considered when other causes are excluded. Prothrombin time, bilirubin levels and albumin levels may help to identify concomitant liver damage. Rhabdomyolysis is rarely reported in liver resection surgeries.
