Aim:In our previous study, we have built a nine-gene (GPC3, HGF, ANXA1, FOS, SPAG9, HSPA1B, CXCR4, PFN1, and CALR) expression detection system based on the GeXP system. Based on peripheral blood and GeXP, we aimed to analyze the results of genes expression by different multi-parameter analysis methods and build a diagnostic model to classify hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and healthy people.Methods:Logistic regression analysis, discriminant analysis, classification tree analysis, and artificial neural network were used for the multi-parameter gene expression analysis method. One hundred and three patients with early HCC and 54 age-matched healthy normal controls were used to build a diagnostic model. Fifty-two patients with early HCC and 34 healthy people were used for validation. The area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity were used as diagnostic indicators.Results:Artificial neural network of the total nine genes had the best diagnostic value, and the AUC, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.943, 98%, and 85%, respectively. At last, 52 HCC patients and 34 healthy normal controls were used for validation. The sensitivity and specificity were 96% and 86%, respectively.Conclusion:Multi-parameter analysis methods may increase the diagnostic value compared to single factor analysis and they may be a trend of the clinical diagnosis in the future.
