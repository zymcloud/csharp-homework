Aim:Lenvatinib (LEN) has recently become available as a first-line tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (u-HCC). In patients who showed intolerability or failure in other TKI treatments, alternative treatment options are needed. This retrospective study evaluated the therapeutic potential of LEN in clinical practice.Methods:We enrolled 57 u-HCC patients treated with LEN from March to June 2018. Lenvatinib was given orally to patients weighing Results:The average patient age was 72.4 ± 9.3 years and 38 (77.6%) were men. The LEN dose was 8 and 12 mg in 32 and 17 patients, respectively. Twenty-nine (59.2%) had history of treatment with sorafenib and six of them (20.7%) with regorafenib. Of the 49 patients, 27 were evaluated using findings obtained by enhanced CT/MRI at 4 weeks after introducing LEN. Partial response was shown in 11, stable disease in 12, and progressive disease in four (overall response rate [ORR], 40.7%; disease control rate [DCR], 85.2%). The ORR and DCR of TKI-naïve patients (n = 8) were 50.0% and 87.5%, respectively, whereas those of TKI-experienced patients (n = 19) were 36.8% and 84.2%, respectively (P = 0.675 and P = 1.00, respectively).Conclusion:Early therapeutic response to LEN was favorable. This new TKI could have therapeutic potential both in patients with and without past TKI treatments.
