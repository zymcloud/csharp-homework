Previous studies have demonstrated that the selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor celecoxib shows efficacy against multiple cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma. However, whether celecoxib is effective in alleviating steatosis during hepatocarcinogenesis is unknown. In a rapid hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse model established via hydrodynamic transfection of activated forms of AKT and c-Met proto-oncogenes, we investigated the antisteatotic and anticarcinogenic efficacy of celecoxib in vivo. Multiple HCC cell lines were employed for in vitro evaluation. Additionally, immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, hematoxylin and eosin staining and Oil Red O staining were applied for mechanistic investigation. The results revealed that if celecoxib was administered in the early stage of AKT/c-Met-induced HCC, it resulted in disease stabilization. Moreover, celecoxib could alleviate lipid accumulation in the HCC mice and in an oleic acid-induced in vitro hepatic steatosis model. Further evidence at the molecular level indicated that celecoxib down-regulated the expression of phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in the HCC mice. In addition, celecoxib efficiently repressed the phosphor-Akt (Thr308)/fatty acid synthase (FASN) axis both in vivo and in vitro. Altogether, this study suggests that celecoxib exerts its antilipogenic efficacy by targeting a COX-2/AKT/FASN cascade, which contributes to its ability to delay hepatocarcinogenesis.
