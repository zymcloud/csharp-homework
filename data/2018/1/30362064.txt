Background:After resection of colorectal liver metastases (CLM), up to 40% of patients will develop intrahepatic recurrence. This study aims to identify patterns of intrahepatic recurrence and their impact on survival after preoperative chemotherapy and CLM resection.Methods:A retrospective review was performed of patients developing intrahepatic recurrence after CLM resection following preoperative chemotherapy. Prechemotherapy, preoperative, and postoperative computed tomography scans were reviewed. Recurrences were classified as in situ, de novo, or both in situ and de novo. Median follow-up was 42 months (range 2-144 months).Results:Among 223 patients meeting study criteria, intrahepatic recurrence was identified a median of 9 months after hepatectomy. Isolated de novo or in situ recurrence developed in 105 (47%) and 86 (39%) patients, respectively. Thirty-two patients (14%) developed both in situ and de novo recurrence, which was associated with significantly lower median overall survival of 33 months compared with 49 and 45 months with isolated in situ or de novo recurrence, respectively (p = 0.048). Among 118 patients (53%) who developed in situ recurrence as a component of disease relapse, recurrences resulted from disappearing or missed liver metastases in 47 patients (40%).Conclusions:An intrahepatic recurrence pattern of both in situ and de novo metastases after CLM resection following preoperative chemotherapy predicts significantly worse overall survival compared with isolated in situ or de novo recurrence.
