Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) typically develops in a chronic inflammatory setting causal to release of a plethora of growth factors and cytokines. However, the molecular effect of these cytokines on HCC progression is poorly understood. In this study, we exposed HCC cells to TGF-β2 (Transforming Growth Factor-β2), which resulted in a significant elevation of EMT (Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition) like features. Molecular analysis of EMT markers showed an increase at both RNA and protein levels upon TGF-β2 administration along with up-regulation of TGF-β-induced Smad signaling. Induction of EMT was associated with a simultaneous increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytostasis of TGF-β2-treated cells. Importantly, quenching of ROS resulted in a significant promotion of TGF-β2-induced EMT. Furthermore, cells treated with TGF-β2 also showed an enhanced autophagic flux. Interestingly, inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine-di-phosphate (CQDP) or siRNA-mediated ablation of ATG5 drastically inhibited TGF-β2-induced EMT. Autophagy inhibition significantly increased ROS levels promoting apoptosis. It was further observed that pro-inflammatory cytokine like, TNF-α (Tumor Necrosis Factor-α) can antagonize TGF-β2-induced response by down-regulating autophagy, increasing ROS levels and thus inhibiting EMT in HCC cells. This inhibitory effect of TNF-α is serum-independent. Transcriptomic analysis through RNA sequencing was further performed which validated that TGF-β2-induced autophagic genes are inhibited by TNF-α treatment suppressing EMT. Our study suggests that autophagy plays a pro-metastatic role facilitating EMT by regulating ROS levels in HCC cells and TNF-α can suppress EMT by inhibiting autophagy. We provide unique mechanistic insights into the role of TGF-β2 in HCC cells, along with appropriate cues to effectively control the disease.
