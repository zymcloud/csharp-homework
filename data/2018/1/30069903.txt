Background and aim:Elevated cytochrome p450 (CYP) 4A gene expression has been linked to the aggravation of various cancers and affects various regulated metabolites. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the clinicopathological value of CYP4A has not yet been explored, although CYP4A is expressed at high levels in the liver. The goal of this study was to evaluate the clinicopathological value of CYP4A11 expression in HCC.Methods:We performed immunohistochemical analysis of CYP4A11 and correlated the results with clinicopathological features of HCC (n = 155). Western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction against CYP4A11 and CYP4A22 were also performed for 15 and 20 pairs of fresh-frozen primary HCC and non-neoplastic liver tissue, respectively. Moreover, we analyzed the underlying mechanism by comparing the high and low CYP4A11 mRNA expression groups using gene set enrichment analysis.Results:CYP4A11 expression level was higher in non-neoplastic hepatocytes than those in HCC cells (P Conclusion:These findings support the notion that CYP4A11 expression is a favorable prognostic factor of HCC and suggest potential predictive diagnostic and prognostic roles of CYP4A11 expression in HCC.
