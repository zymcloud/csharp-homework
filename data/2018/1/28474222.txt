Background:Biomarkers predicting the response to the anticancer treatment and prognosis in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are required. Recently, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was reported to promote HCC progression and be associated with poor prognosis for patients with HCC. The purpose of this study was to assess serum HMGB1 concentrations before and during sorafenib treatment or hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) and to explore the ability of serum HMGB1 concentrations to predict prognosis.Methods:Serum HMGB1 concentrations were measured in 71 and 72 patients with advanced HCC treated with sorafenib and HAIC, respectively, to assess their usefulness for prediction of the response to the treatment and prognosis.Results:Multivariate analysis identified high HMGB1 at 4 weeks (P = 0.001), high Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) at baseline (P = 0.025), tumor liver occupying rate (P = 0.009) and modified RECIST (mRECIST, P Conclusions:These results suggest that serum HMGB1 at 4 weeks after the start of treatment might be a useful biomarker with added value to the conventional tumor marker and radiologic responses to predict poor overall survival in patients with advanced HCC treated with sorafenib or HAIC.
