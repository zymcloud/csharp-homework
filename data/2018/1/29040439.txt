Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the hepatic manifestation of obesity, is an emerging risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Accumulating evidence has shown that chronic inflammation represents a plausible link between obesity and HCC and that the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 contributes to the development of obesity-related HCC. In the present study, we aimed to examine the therapeutic potential of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which exerts anti-inflammatory effects. The results showed that the development of carcinogen-induced HCC was significantly less in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) supplemented with EPA than in those fed HFD only, suggesting that EPA attenuates the development of obesity-related HCC. Although EPA did not appear to affect obesity-linked inflammation, it suppressed the activation of the pro-tumorigenic IL-6 effector STAT3, contributing to the inhibition of tumor growth. These findings suggest a clinical implication of EPA as a treatment for obesity-related HCC.
