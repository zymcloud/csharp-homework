Background:Orantinib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor. This study was done to evaluate the efficacy of orantinib combined with conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (cTACE) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study was done at 75 sites in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, no extra-hepatic tumour spread, and Child-Pugh score of 6 or less were randomly assigned (1:1) by interactive web response system using a computer-generated sequence to receive orantinib or placebo, within 28 days of cTACE. Randomisation was stratified by region, Child-Pugh score (5 vs 6), alpha fetoprotein concentrations (50 mm). Orantinib at 200 mg, twice per day, or placebo was given orally until TACE failure or unacceptable toxicity. The patients, investigators, and study personnel were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed in the full analysis set (patients who had received at least one dose of study drug). This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01465464, and has been terminated.Findings:Between Dec 10, 2010, and Nov 21, 2013, 889 patients were randomly assigned to receive either orantinib (445 patients; 444 treated) or placebo (444 patients; all treated). The study was ended at interim analysis for futility evaluation. Median follow-up was 17·3 months (IQR 11·3-26·4). There was no improvement in overall survival with orantinib compared with placebo (median 31·1 months [95% CI 26·5-34·5] vs 32·3 months [28·4-not reached]; hazard ratio 1·090, 95% CI 0·878-1·352; p=0·435). The main adverse events in the orantinib group were oedema, ascites, and elevation of aspartate and alanine aminotransferases. The most frequent adverse events of grade 3 or worse in the orantinib group included elevated aspartate aminotransferase (189 [43%] patients in the oratinib group, 161 [36%] patients in the placebo group), elevated alanine aminotransferase (150 [34%] patients in the oratinib group, 132 (30%) patients in the placebo group), and hypertension (47 [11%] patients in the oratinib group, 39 [9%] patients in the placebo group). Serious adverse events were reported in 200 (45%) patients in the orantinib group and 134 (30%) patients in the placebo group.Interpretation:Orantinib combined with cTACE did not improve overall survival in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.Funding:Taiho Pharmaceutical.
