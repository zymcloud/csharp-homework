Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor worldwide. Attributed to the lack of early diagnosis index, most patients are diagnosed in their late stage. Homer1, as a member of scaffold protein family, is made up of two different isoforms: Homer1a and Homer1b/c. More and more evidences show that Homer1 is dysregulated in cancers. Here, in this study, we investigated the expression profile, clinical, diagnostic and prognostic significance of Homer1 in hepatitis B virus-induced HCC (HBV-HCC). Methods: We first tested the expression of Homer1 in HCC cell lines by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot. Then, 86 pairs of tumorous and adjacent normal tissues from HCC together with a total number of 245 peripheral blood samples were enrolled to check the expression levels of Homer1 by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Results: The results revealed that the levels of Homer1 were both downregulated in HCC cell line and tissue and were associated with tumor size, but were not related to the prognosis of HBV-HCC. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses indicated that the sensitivity of Homer1 to differentiate HCC patients from the controls was high to 100.0% and the combination of Homer1 and AFP got a higher prediction value of HCC (AUC=0.890). Conclusion: Our data highlighted that Homer1 played a critical role in HCC tumorigenesis and might be a potential diagnostic marker for HCC.
