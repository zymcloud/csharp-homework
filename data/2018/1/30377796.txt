Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) has universally poor outcome, mainly due to its late clinical presentation. Identification of specific biomarkers and development of effective treatment are still urgently required. Mutations in PBRM-1 and BAP-1 genes, and the expression of S100P have been related to survival in ICC. miR-31 seems also to play important regulatory functions in ICC and it directly regulates BAP-1 expression in lung cancer. In this study, tissue expression of BAP-1, PBRM-1, S100P, and miR-31 was investigated in ICC and correlated with clinical-pathological features. Sixty-one consecutive patients who underwent curative hepatic resection for ICC were enrolled. None received any therapy prior to surgery. Immunostaining for BAP-1, PBRM-1, and S100P, and in situ hybridization for miR-31 were performed, using tissue microarray slides. A strong retained expression of BAP-1 and PBRM-1 was associated with a reduced overall (p = 0.04 and p = 0.002, respectively) and disease-free survival (p = 0.05 and p = 0.02, respectively). An overexpression of S100P was related to a reduced overall survival (p = 0.005). The multivariate analyses identified the presence of perineural invasion and the retained PBRM-1 expression as independent predictors of worse overall [p = 0.02, hazard ratio (HR) = 2.25 (1.16-4.39) and p = 0.001, HR = 3.13 (1.56-6.28), respectively] and disease-free survivals [p = 0.03, HR = 2.43 (1.09-5.4) and p = 0.03, HR = 2.51 (1.11-5.67), respectively]. An overexpression of S100P was predictive of a worse overall survival [p = 0.02, HR = 1.66 (1.08-2.55)]. High levels of miR-31 were significantly associated to a low expression of BAP-1 protein (p = 0.03). In ICC, a retained expression of BAP-1 and PBRM-1, and an overexpression of S100P are related to a poor prognosis.
