This study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of drug-eluting bead (DEB) embolization (DEB-TACE) when combined with cryoablation in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The study was a single-center randomized controlled trial comprised of 60 patients with HCC conducted between August 2015 and October 2017. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: DEB-TACE combined with cryoablation (DEB-TACE-Cryo group) or cryoablation alone (Cryo group). Inter-group differences in overall survival, progression-free survival, and adverse reactions were assessed. The operative success rates were 82.7% and 77.4% in the DEB-TACE-Cryo group and Cryo group, respectively, with no operative mortality. The overall survival and progression-free survival in the DEB-TACE-Cryo group were significantly higher than those in the Cryo group (16.8 months vs.13.4 months, P = 0.0493; 8.1 months vs. 6.0 months, P = 0.0089, respectively). The postoperative complications in the two groups were rated as grade 1 or grade 2, according to guidelines set by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (CTCAE V4.0). We demonstrated that DEB-TACE combined with cryoablation was effective, well tolerated, and had a low complication rate. Therefore, this combination therapy may be a better choice for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.
