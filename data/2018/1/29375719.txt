Egl-9 family hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)3/prolyl hydroxylase 3 (EGLN3/PHD3) serves a role in the progression and prognosis of cancer. PHD3 is able to induce apoptosis in HepG2 cells. In the present study, the protein levels of PHD3 and HIF2α were analyzed by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry in 84 paired hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and adjacent non-tumor liver tissues. The mRNA levels of PHD3 and HIF2α were analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. PHD3 was overexpressed in HCC tissues compared with adjacent liver tissues (mRNA expression: P
