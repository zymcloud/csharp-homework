Objective:We evaluated microwave-assisted liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma.Patients and methods:We enrolled 79 patients in this study, and microwave ablation was used for liver resection. Patients were randomized to group A (50.6%; n = 40), liver resection without microwave ablation, or group B (49.4%; n = 39), liver resection performed using microwave ablation. Data were analyzed for statistical significance.Results:Of the participants enrolled, 60 were male, and the participant's average age was 59.32 Â± 10.34 years. The mean overall tumor diameter was 4.39 (2.00) cm, and this did not differ between groups. Intraoperative blood loss in group B was significantly less than that in group A ( P Conclusions:The curative effects of liver resection combined with microwave ablation during operation are superior to only liver resection in the treatment of primary liver cancer.
