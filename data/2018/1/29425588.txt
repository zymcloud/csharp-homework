The underground cane of Schizocapsa plantaginea (Hance) has long been used by Chinese ethnic minority as a constituent of anti-cancer formulae. Saponins are abundant secondary metabolic products located in the underground cane of this plant. The potential therapeutic effects of total saponins isolated from Schizocapsa plantaginea (Hance) (SSPH) on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were tested in vitro in human liver cancer cell lines, SMMC-7721 and Bel-7404. Apoptosis and cell cycle arrest were determined using flow cytometry, caspase activation was determined by ELISA, and PARP, cleaved PARP, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression and phosphorylation were measured using Western blotting analysis. In vivo anti-HCC effects of SSPH were verified in nude mouse xenograft model. SSPH exerted markedly inhibitory effect on HCC cell proliferation in time- and concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, SSPH significantly induced apoptosis through caspase-dependent signaling and arrested cell cycle at G2/M phase. These anti-proliferation effects of SSPH were associated with up-regulated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (Erk1/2) and c-jun-NH2-kinase-1/2 (JNK1/2) and reduced phosphorylation of p38MAPK. Furthermore, inhibitors of ERK, UO126, and JNK, SP600125 inhibited the anti-proliferation effects by SSPH, suggesting that Erk and JNK were the effector molecules in SSPH induced anti-proliferative action. During in vivo experiments, SSPH was found to inhibit xenograft tumor growth in nude mice, with a similar mechanism in vitro. Our study confirmed that SSPH exerted antagonistic effects on human liver cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Molecular mechanisms underlying SSPH action might be closely associated with MAPK signaling pathways. These results indicated that SSPH has potential therapeutic effects on HCC.
