Objectives:In patients with refractory or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after first line chemotherapy, phase III trials showed superiority of nivolumab, an IgG4 programmed death-1 immune-checkpoint-inhibitor antibody, over docetaxel. We evaluated case mix, effectiveness and safety of nivolumab upon implementation in general practice.Materials and methods:In 20 general hospitals, all consecutive NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab within the medical need program (inclusion period 12 months) in Flanders - Belgium were evaluated.Results:There were 267 patients, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score was 2 in 24% and 0-1 in 76%. In 48%, two or more systemic regimens were given before nivolumab. The median overall survival was 7.8 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.3-9.3). At one year, the overall survival rate was 36.5Â±0.34%. Median progression-free survival was 3.7 months (95% CI 2.9-4.5). An objective response was obtained in 23.2%. ECOG score 2 and presence of liver metastasis strongly correlated with worse survival (p<0.00001). Treatment related adverse events grade 3 or 4 were reported in 21%, colitis (4%) and pneumonitis (7%) were most frequent.Conclusion:Upon implementation of nivolumab therapy in general hospitals, the case mix was characterized by a more heavily pretreated population with a substantial fraction of patients with ECOG score 2. The median overall survival is slightly inferior to what was published in the randomized phase III trials. An ECOG score 2 and the presence of liver metastasis correlated strongly with a worse survival. We report a high prevalence of serious adverse events.
