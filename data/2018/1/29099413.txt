Background:Prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not only influenced by tumor-related factors but also by the background liver functions. The maximal removal rate of technetium-99m-galactosyl human serum albumin (GSA-Rmax) of the remnant liver (rGSA-Rmax) is a useful candidate for predicting the liver function and clarifying the relationship between the remnant liver functional reserve and tumor-free survival in patients who have undergone hepatectomy.Patients and methods:One hundred and sixty-five patients with HCC who underwent curative hepatectomy were divided into three groups of hepatitis B virus (B-HCC; n=42), hepatitis C virus (C-HCC, n=58), and non-B, non-C (NBNC-HCC, n=65). The relationship between rGSA-Rmax and survival was examined by univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:In the C-HCC group, the albumin, or LHL15, level was significantly lower, and alanine aminotransferase, ICGR15, and the prevalence of grade B liver damage were significantly higher than other two groups (PConclusion:GSA-Rmax and rGSA-Rmax reflect the severity of liver dysfunction and furthermore, the lower rGSA-Rmax is useful as a complementary factor to predict the early HCC recurrence after hepatectomy.
