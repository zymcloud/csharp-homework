Purpose:To introduce the technique and investigate the clinical efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in combination with simultaneous DynaCT-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of solitary large hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) (maximal diameter > 5 cm).Materials and methods:Forty-six patients who received TACE combined with simultaneous DynaCT-guided RFA for solitary large HCCs between January 2012 and August 2016 were reviewed, and the success rate, safety, local tumor progression (LTP), and overall survival (OS) were retrospectively investigated. OS and time to progression were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:Technical success rate was 100%, average operative time for DynaCT-guided RFA was 45.3 ± 4.8 min, average radiation dose was 730.5 ± 78.8 mGy, and no life-threatening complications were observed. At 1-month follow-up enhanced MRI, complete remission was achieved in 82.6% of patients (38/46), and partial remission in 17.4% (8/46). The median follow-up period was 29.5 months (interquartile range 4.0-69.0 months). At 1, 2, and 3 years after surgery, the LTP rates were 4.3, 13.1, and 30.4%, respectively, and the OS rates were 89.1, 71.7, and 56.5%, respectively.Conclusion:DynaCT-guided TACE + RFA is safe and feasible for the treatment of solitary large HCCS. TACE combined with simultaneous RFA provides a new treatment option for solitary large HCCs in which DynaCT has important clinical value.
