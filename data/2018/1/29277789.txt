Background/aim:To assess the expression of cancer stem cell (CSC) markers CD44, CD133 and CD24 in colon cancer liver metastases and analyse their predictive value for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) after liver resection.Materials and methods:Patients operated on for colon cancer liver metastases were included. CSC marker expression was determined through immunohistochemistry analysis. OS and DFS were compared between marker-positive and marker-negative patients. Multivariate analysis was performed to select predictive variables for OS and DFS.Results:CD133-positive patients had a worse DFS than CD133-negative patients, with a median DFS of 12 and 25 months (p=0.051). Multivariate analysis selected CD133 expression as a significant predictor for DFS. CD44 and CD24 were not found to predict OS or DFS.Conclusion:CD133 expression in colonic liver metastases is a negative prognostic factor for DFS after liver resection. In the future, CD133 could be used as a biomarker for risk stratification, and possibly for developing novel targeted therapy.
