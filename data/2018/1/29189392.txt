Background and objective:The objective of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of several inflammation-based models in hepatitis B-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:We retrospectively reviewed 470 cases of hepatitis B-associated HCC. Preoperative data were collected to calculate the inflammation-based markers, including systemic immune-inflammation index (neutrophil√óplatelets/lymphocyte), platelets-to-lymphocyte ratio, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Overall survival and recurrence-free survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox analysis.Results:During a median follow-up time of 29 months, 34.0% (160/470) of patients died and 36.0% (169/470) experienced recurrence. Compared with patients with lower scores of inflammation models, patients in the higher group had larger tumor diameter and higher risk of vascular invasion (both PConclusion:The inflammation-based markers, in particular the combination of NLR with tumor size, are effective tools for assessing prognosis in hepatitis B-associated HCC.
