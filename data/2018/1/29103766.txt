Vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) is a member of the vaccinia-related kinase (VRK) family of serine/threonine protein kinases, which phosphorylates several transcription factors and has been postulated to be involved in regulation of cell proliferation. However, it remains unclear whether aberrant expression of VRK1 is related to the development of glioma. In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical significance of VRK1 expression in human glioma and its biological function in glioma cells. Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that VRK1 was highly expressed in glioma tissues and cell lines. In addition, the expression level of VRK1 was positively correlated with glioma pathological grade, as well as Ki-67 expression. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with high VRK1 expression was associated with a poorer prognosis. To determine whether VRK1 could regulate the proliferation of glioma cells, we transfected glioma cells with interfering RNA target VRK1, then investigated cell proliferation with cell counting kit (CCK) -8, flow cytometry assays and colony formation analyses. Our results indicated that knockdown of VRK1 would inhibit the proliferation of glioma cells. Besides, reduced expression of VRK1 could induce the apoptosis of glioma cells. On the basis of these findings, we suggested that VRK1 might be a promising prognostic biomarker of glioma.
