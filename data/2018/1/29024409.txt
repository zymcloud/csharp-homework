The natural agent rhein is an ananthraquinone derivative of rhubarb, which has anticancer effects. To determine the mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of rhein, we detected the effect of rhein on several oncoproteins. Here, we show that rhein induces β-catenin degradation in both hepatoma cell HepG2 and cervical cancer cell Hela. Treatment of HepG2 and Hela cells with rhein shortens the half-life of β-catenin. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 blunts the downregulation of β-catenin by rhein. The induction of β-catenin degradation by rhein is dependent on GSK3 but independent of Akt. Treatment of HepG2 and Hela cells with GSK3 inhibitor or GSK3β knockdown abrogates the effect of rhein on β-catenin. GSK3β knockdown compromises the inhibition of HepG2 and Hela cell growth by rhein. Furthermore, rhein dose not downregulate β-catenin mutant that is deficient of phosphorylation at multiple residues including Ser33, Ser37, Thr41 and Ser45. Moreover, rhein induces cell cycle arrest at S phase in both HepG2 and Hela cells. Intraperitoneal administration of rhein suppresses tumour cells proliferation and tumour growth in HepG2 xenografts model. Finally, the levels of β-catenin are reduced in rhein-treated tumours. These data demonstrate that rhein can induce β-catenin degradation and inhibit tumour growth.
