Primary hepatic angiosarcoma is the most common malignant mesenchymal tumor of the liver. It has a poor prognosis and various appearances on magnetic resonance (MR) images. We report a case of hepatic angiosarcoma with a characteristic appearance on gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced MR imaging in the hepatobiliary phase. A 72-year-old man was admitted with a complaint of abdominal pain. Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging revealed a liver tumor that showed slight hyperintensity in the hepatobiliary phase. These findings suggested Gd-EOB-DTPA uptake in the tumor. An autopsy revealed the solid proliferation and sinusoidal spreading of hepatic angiosarcoma cells. Immunohistochemistry indicated that the tumor was negative for OATP1B3. Gd-EOB-DTPA uptake in the liver tumor in the hepatobiliary phase suggested sinusoidal tumor invasion with residual normal hepatocytes.
