Purpose:To evaluate the accuracy of the virtual liver parenchymal perfusion area using a commercially available workstation and liver analysis software in conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:This method was retrospectively applied to 29 treated HCCs in 23 patients. The virtual embolic area (VEA) was estimated based on cone beam computed tomography during hepatic arteriography using a commercially available workstation and liver analysis software by two observer groups (group A: experts; group B: semi-experts). The real embolic area (REA) was defined as the area where iodized oil accumulated on computed tomography at 1 week after cTACE. The REA was estimated by each of the two groups, and the mean REA between the groups (mREA) was used as a standard reference. Agreement of volume and cross-sectional area in three orthogonal planes between the VEA and mREA were analyzed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland-Altman plots.Results:The ICCs for volume between VEA and mREA were 0.97 and 0.88 for groups A and B, respectively, and those for cross-sectional area were 0.94 and 0.88 for the axial plane, 0.95 and 0.83 for the coronal plane, and 0.87 and 0.74 for the sagittal plane, respectively. Thus, the overall agreement was excellent, except for the sagittal imaging plane in group B.Conclusion:This method using a commercially available workstation and liver analysis software can be useful for estimating the embolic area in cTACE.
