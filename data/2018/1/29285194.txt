The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic potential of a novel inflammation-based system, the combination of the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (CNP), for predicting the survival time of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who had received radiofrequency ablation (RFA). A total of 287 HCC patients treated with RFA were enrolled in the study. Patients with an elevated NLR (>2.58) and an elevated PLR (>131.78) were allocated a score of 2, and patients exhibiting one or neither of these characteristics were allocated a score of 1 or 0, respectively. The association between the CNP and various HCC clinicopathological factors, patterns of recurrence and prognoses were analyzed. The CNP was associated with liver cirrhosis (P=0.015), Child-Pugh class (P=0.024), total bilirubin level (P=0.028), neutrophil count (P
