BACKGROUND Ante-situm resection and auto-transplantation (ante-situm for short) provides a more aggressive approach to conventionally unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We described the long-term outcomes of patients with HCCs who underwent this technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between October 2005 and December 2016, we performed 23 ante-situm liver resections. We evaluated postoperative complications, 90-day mortality, recurrence, and long-term survival rates, and reviewed the literature on this topic. RESULTS Five types of complications associated with six patients were observed.: 1) primary nonfunctioning liver, thus receiving a liver transplantation; 2) initial poor liver function with recovery two weeks after treatment; 3) diagnoses of portal vein tumor thrombosis, biliary fistula, and small-for-size syndrome, respectively. The median follow-up was 3.6 years; 12 out of 23 patients were alive at the end of the study. One patient who had hepatic recurrence was lost to follow-up after three months. One patient died of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome after the operation, nine patients died due to hepatic recurrence and/or extrahepatic metastasis of HCC. The one-year, three-year, five-year, and 10-year survival rates were 65.2%, 56.5%, 50.9%, and 20.3%, respectively. The one-year, three-year, five-year, and 10-year recurrence rates were 60.9%, 50.7%, 50.7%, and 50.7%, respectively. The chi-square test revealed the patients with recurrence after ante-situm technique were more likely to have poor prognosis (mortality of patients with recurrence versus no-recurrence: 88.9% versus 14.3%, p
