Purpose:To evaluate the efficacy of maintenance apatinib after chemotherapy for extensive-stage (ED) small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).Patients and methods:This was a retrospective analysis of 23 cases of extensive-stage SCLC admitted to the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2015 to December 2017. The patients without progression after induction chemotherapy received apatinib 250 mg per day until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. We analyzed the median progression-free survival (PFS), median overall survival (OS) and safety.Results:Of 23 enrolled patients, 1 was lost to follow-up. The median PFS from the time of maintenance therapy was 4.1 months (95% CI 3.63-4.57 months). The median PFS from the time of induction chemotherapy was 8.3 months (95% CI 7.20-9.40 months). The median OS from the time of maintenance therapy was 12.5 months (95% CI 5.51-19.49 months). The median OS from the time of induction chemotherapy was 17.0 months (95% CI 9.86-24.14 months). The most frequent treatment-related adverse events were hand-foot syndrome (43.5%, 10/23) and secondary hypertension (30.4%, 7/23), followed by fatigue, proteinuria, nausea, and oral mucositis (17.4%, 13.0%, 13.0%, and 8.7%, respectively). Hematologic toxicity included thrombocytopenia (30.4%), leucopenia (26.1%), and anemia (17.4%). The main grade 3 or 4 toxicities were hand-foot syndrome (8.7%, 2/23) and hypertension (4.3%, 1/23).Conclusion:Maintenance apatinib was safe and achieved encouraging PFS and OS in extensive-stage SCLC.
