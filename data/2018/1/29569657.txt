Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a worldwide problem, with a high prevalence in nonindustrialized countries and a rising incidence in industrialized countries as well. Its close association with chronic liver diseases and liver cirrhosis represents a significant challenge in its treatment. A front-line systemic treatment for unresectable cases of HCC (sorafenib) was identified only in 2007. Following a decade of failed clinical trials with a wide range of drugs for second-line treatment, regorafenib proved its efficacy as a second-line treatment in 2016, when the randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III RESORCE trial demonstrated a meaningful increase in overall survival in the regorafenib treatment arm compared with the placebo arm (10.6 vs. 7.8 months). In this monograph we review the main preclinical and clinical findings in the trials assessing regorafenib for the treatment of HCC patients.
