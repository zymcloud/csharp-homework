The incidence and mortality rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are higher in China compared with in other countries. Further research is required in order to improve the diagnosis and treatment of HCC. Sperm-associated antigen 9 (SPAG9) protein has been revealed to serve an important function in cancer progression; however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The present study investigated the expression level of SPAG9 in HCC tissues using quantitative-polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and western blotting, and the results demonstrated that SPAG9 was overexpressed in HCC tissues compared with the adjacent non-cancerous tissues. To explore the potential mechanisms underlying SPAG9 in HCC, the effect of SPAG9 on cell proliferation, cell cycle, migration and invasion capacities were investigated in the QGY HCC cell line by RNA interference. It was revealed that inhibition of SPAG9 mRNA in QGY cells significantly inhibited the expression level of SPAG9 compared with the control. Depletion of SPAG9 expression decreased cell proliferation (P1/G2 cell cycle phase. The percentage of cells in the S phase was decreased, and cell migration and invasion capabilities in vitro were reduced (P<0.01). In summary, the results of the present study suggested that SPAG9 was upregulated in HCC and may serve an important function in cancer cell proliferation, differentiation and invasion. Whether SPAG9 is a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target of human HCC requires additional study.
