The authors describe a rapid and direct SERS-based immunoassay for the determination of AFP, an important marker for diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs; 36 nm i.d.) serve as a support to immobilize antibody and as a SERS intensifier, and AFP-modified gold nanoparticles are employed as capturing substrate. Direct and quantitative detection of AFP is accomplished with a limit detection as low as 5 ng·mL-1. Compared to assays based on the use of metal nanoparticles, the use of gold-silver nanoparticle heterodimers as an active SERS substrate can save costs because only a single antibody is required. Moreover, the high selectivity and good linear relationship of detecting AFP in fetal bovine serum indicates its potential applicability for the direct analysis of clinical samples. Graphical abstract Direct and quantitative determination of AFP antigen utilizing SERS has been was successfully presented and applied to detect alpha fetoprotein antigen in fetal bovine serum with detection limit of 2 ng•mL-1.
