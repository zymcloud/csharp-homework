Transarterial therapies in the setting of primary and secondary liver malignancies are becoming an essential part of the oncology landscape. The mechanism of action of c-TACE is the induction of tumor necrosis due to the high concentration of the chemotherapeutic that is delivered only locally and to the embolic effect that causes ischemia and increased dwell time of the chemotherapeutic in the tumor. Recently, DEB-TACE has emerged as a variation of c-TACE with the potential for the selective delivery of large amounts of drugs to the tumor for a prolonged period, thereby decreasing plasma levels of the chemotherapeutic agent and related systemic effects. There is an increasing consensus that compared with conventional lipiodol-based regimen, DEB-TACE offers standardized methodology, is more reproducible and is associated with improved response and significantly better safety profile. Using an easy to access point by point format, this manuscript summarizes the expert discussion from the Mediterranean Interventional Oncology Live Congress (MIOLive 2017) about the role of TACE in the treatment of liver tumors.
