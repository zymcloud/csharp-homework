Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is the effector factor of hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Accumulating evidence suggests that retinoic acids (RAs), derivatives of vitamin A, contribute to prevention of liver fibrosis and carcinogenesis, however, regulatory mechanisms of RAs still remain exclusive. To elucidate RA signaling pathway, we previously performed a genome-wide screening of RA-responsive genes by in silico analysis of RA-response elements, and identified 26 RA-responsive genes. We found that thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), which inhibits antioxidant activity of thioredoxin (TRX), was downregulated by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). In the present study, we demonstrate that ATRA ameliorates activation of HSCs through TXNIP suppression. HSC activation was attenuated by TXNIP downregulation, whereas potentiated by TXNIP upregulation, indicating that TXNIP plays a crucial role in activation of HSCs. Notably, we showed that TXNIP-mediated HSC activation was suppressed by antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. In addition, ATRA treatment or downregulation of TXNIP clearly declined oxidative stress levels in activated HSCs. These data suggest that ATRA plays a key role in inhibition of HSC activation via suppressing TXNIP expression, which reduces oxidative stress levels.
