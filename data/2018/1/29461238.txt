Hepatitis C is a widespread infectious disorder, accounting for chronic hepatic inflammatory condition - hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma throughout the world. In Georgia, where the incidence of HCV infection in population is highest among eastern European countries, hepatitis C represents one the most actual problems of healthcare system. The aim of the study was to identify the efficacy of antiviral therapy and management of side effects in HCV infected patients. In the patients under observation with type I genotype, the rapid viral response (RVR) was negative in 100%. End of treatment response (EOT) was negative in 100%, and stable viral response (SVR) was negative in 99.3%. In patients with type II genotype the rapid viral response (RVR) was negative in 100%, end of treatment response (EOT) was negative in 100% and stable viral response (SVR) was negative in 100%. In patients with type III genotype: the rapid viral response (RVR) was negative in 100%. End of treatment response (EOT) was negative in 100% and stable viral response (SVR) was negative in 97%. Thus, HCV infection is widespread in correction department institutions. According to our study results, the final outcomes of antiviral treatment completed within the frames of this program, side effects developed during the course of treatment and their management are not significantly different from the results of antiviral treatment conducted in other population. Regardless of different psychological setting present in this type of institutions, this program is ongoing successfully and the observed results indicate on the importance of its continuation.
