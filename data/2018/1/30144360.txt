Background and aim:The fibrosis stage of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely associated with long-term prognosis, including liver-related mortality. However, it is not yet clear whether noninvasive fibrosis markers can predict the incidence of non-liver-related complications in Japanese NAFLD. In this study, we clarified the prognosis of NAFLD patients, including non-liver-related diseases, based on hepatic pathology and noninvasive fibrosis markers.Methods:A total of 246 Japanese patients with NAFLD diagnosed by liver biopsy were enrolled. We investigated their prognosis based on hepatic pathology and noninvasive fibrosis markers.Results:When these patients were categorized based on the severity of liver fibrosis as F0-2 (n = 196) and F3-4 (n = 50), the patients with F3-4 had significantly poorer prognosis in overall survival rates and all complications (P Conclusions:Severe liver fibrosis was associated not only with the hepatocarcinogenesis and LC-related complications but also with extrahepatic malignancies. The FIB-4 index was useful for predicting liver-related diseases but had limitations in predicting extrahepatic malignancies.
