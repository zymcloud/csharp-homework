Objective:To study the regulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) expression bythe brother of the regulator of the imprinted site (BORIS) in hepatocellular carcinoma cell.Methods:The expression of SOCS3 mRNA in HCC cell lines was detected by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). The expression of SOCS3 protein in knockdown and overexpression BORIS of HCC cell lines was tested by Western blot. The SOCS3 gene promoter methylation statusin the knockdown and overexpression BORIS of hepatocarcinoma cell lines was detected by using methylation specific PCR (MSP-PCR) method.The potential BORIS binding site of SOCS3promoter region was found by UCSC database analysis.The enrichment of BORIS in SOCS3 promoter region in endogenous high expression BORIS of HCC cells was evaluated by using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR (ChIP-qPCR).The SOCS3 promoter region histone methylation status in the knockdown and overexpression BORIS of HCC was detected by ChIP-qPCR.Results:The expression of SOCS3 mRNA in hepatocellular carcinoma cells was higher and SOCS3 protein expression was down-regulated or up-regulated in the knockdown or overexpression of BORIS mRNA hepatocarcinoma cells,so BORIS has a positive regulatory effect on SOCS3 protein expression in hepatocarcinoma cells. MSP-PCR experiments showed that the SOCS3 promoter in SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells was unmethylated and knockdown of BORIS did not change the methylation status; the SOCS3 promoter region of Huh7 cells was methylated; after overexpression of BORIS,the SOCS3 promoter region was changed to an unmethylated state; the SOCS3 promoter was unmethylated in HCCLM3,overexpression of BORIS did not alter the methylation status. The ChIP-qPCR assay demonstrated that BORIS specifically binds to the SOCS3 promoter region in HCC cells with high expression of BORIS. Histone methylation assay indicated that knockdown of BORIS reduced BORIS enrichment in the SOCS3 promoter region, with decreasing H3K4 me2 and increasing H3K27 me3 in the region of histone,whereas the overexpress BORIS in HCC cells showed the opposite situation.Conclusion:BORIS plays a role of epigenetic regulationon SOCS3 gene promoter methylation and histone methylation,modulating the expression of SOCS3,and then involved in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
