The Î´ opioid receptor (DOR) is involved in the regulation of malignant transformation and tumor progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, regulation of the DOR in HCC remains poorly defined. We found that miR-874 was identified as a negative regulator of the DOR, which is a direct and functional target of miR-874 via its 3' untranslated region (UTR). Moreover, miR-874 was downregulated in HCC and its expression was inversely correlated with DOR expression. Downregulation of miR-874 was also associated with larger tumor size, more vascular invasion, a poor TNM stage, poor tumor differentiation, and inferior patient outcomes. Functionally, overexpression of miR-874 in the HCC cell line SK-hep-1 inhibited cell growth, migration, in vitro invasion, and in vivo tumorigenicity. Furthermore, miR-874 overexpression suppressed the DOR, resulting in a downregulated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. The EGFR activator-epidermal growth factor (EGF)-can rescue the proliferation and migration suppression induced by miR-874 overexpression, and the rescue effects of the EGF were blocked by an ERK inhibitor. Our study results suggest that miRNA-874 is a negative regulator of the DOR that can suppress tumor proliferation and metastasis in HCC by targeting the DOR/EGFR/ERK pathway, which may be a potential target for HCC treatment.
