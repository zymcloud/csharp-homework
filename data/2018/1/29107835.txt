Combination with chemotherapeutic drug and gene therapy has been proven highly effective in suppressing tumor progression. Hence, an asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR)-targeting nanodrug delivery system based on mesoporous silica (MSN) nanocarrier for co-delivery of sorafenib (SO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeted siRNA (siVEGF) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was successfully designed and synthesized. The structure of nanoparticles was characterized by IR, particle size, zeta potential and N2 adsorption-desorption. The nanoparticles were further evaluated for drug release, cellular uptake, transfection, cell cytotoxicity and cell cycle against HepG2 and Huh7 cells. In vitro testing demonstrated that MSN-LA delivery system could not only induce S cell cycle arrest, enhance the cytotoxicity and improve the tumor target of SO and siVEGF, but also enhance the siVEGF transfection efficiency in ASGPR-overexpressing Huh7 cells. Overall, the MSN-LA delivery system can be a promising drug carrier which could further enhance the anti-cancer efficacy of SO and siVEGF via the active targeting property of LA.
