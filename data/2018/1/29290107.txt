Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been used for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancers by integrating photosensitizers, which cause cytotoxic effects on cancer cells by converting tumor oxygen into reactive singlet oxygen (1O2). However, the PDT efficiency of MOFs is severely limited by tumor hypoxia. Herein, by decorating platinum nanozymes on photosensitizer integrated MOFs, we report a simple yet versatile strategy for enhanced PDT. The platinum nanoparticles homogeneously immobilized on MOFs possess high stability and catalase-like activity. Thus, our nanoplatform can facilitate the formation of 1O2 in hypoxic tumor site via H2O2-activated evolvement of O2, which can cause more serious damage to cancer cells. Our finding highlights that the composites of nanozymes and MOFs have the potential to serve as efficient agents for cancer therapy, which will open an avenue of nanozymes and MOFs toward biological applications.
