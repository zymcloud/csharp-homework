Alternative polyadenylation (APA), a post-transcriptional modification, has been implicated in many diseases, but especially in tumor proliferation. CFIm25, the 25 kDa subunit of human cleavage factor Im (CFIm), is a key factor in APA. We show that CFIm25 expression is reduced in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and its expression correlates with metastasis. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that CFIm25 is related to overall survival in HCC. Moreover, CFIm25 expression is negatively related to the metastatic potential of HCC cell lines. CFIm25 knockdown promotes cell invasion and migration in vitro, while overexpression of CFIm25 inhibits cell invasion and migration in vitro and inhibits intrahepatic and lung metastasis in vivo. Additional studies showed that CFIm25 disrupts epithelial-mesenchymal transition by increasing E-cadherin, that it inhibits HCC cell migration and invasion by blocking the p38 and JNK/c-Jun signaling pathways, and that CFIm25 knockdown increases the transcriptional activity of activating protein-1 (AP-1). These findings indicate that therapy directed at increasing CFIm25 expression is a potential HCC treatment.
