Background:Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients who achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) may still develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The characteristic of HCC and the prognosis between SVR and non-SVR patients were not well known.Methods:Among 1884 HCV-infected patients who were treated with pegylated IFN plus ribavirin therapies, 122 patients developed HCC during follow-up were enrolled in this study. Laboratory data were collected before and at least 1 year after IFN-based therapy, as well as the latest follow-up.Results:Both SVR and non-SVR patients had similar risk factors to develop HCC, but with a little difference. Liver cirrhosis plays a key role in HCC occurrence in both groups. Among the patients who developed HCC, non-SVR patients had significantly higher total bilirubin, higher FIB-4, lower pre-treatment platelet count, higher pre-treatment AFP levels and higher proportion of cirrhosis than SVR patients before occurrence of HCC. After curative treatment, SVR patients had lower recurrence and longer overall survival than non-SVR patients by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed that APRI ≥0.7 was the independent risk factor for HCC recurrence; and AFP ≥20 ng/ml post IFN therapy, as well as HCC recurrence were the independent risk factors of mortality.Conclusion:Liver cirrhosis plays a key role in HCC occurrence after antiviral therapies. SVR patients may have lower HCC recurrence and longer survival rates than non-SVR patients. Only APRI was associated with HCC recurrence; and post-IFN AFP and HCC recurrence were predictive of subsequent mortality independently.
