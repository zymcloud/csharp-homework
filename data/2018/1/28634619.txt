Since its introduction in 2011, Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) has become an increasingly utilized method for radiologists to categorize lesions for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients at risk (American College of Radiology, www.acr.org/quality-safety/resources/lirads 2016). This overview article presents insight into methods of incorporating LI-RADS into an existing clinical practice, highlighting concrete ways to establish this system as a mainstay in any radiologist's evidence-based armamentarium. We will focus on the importance of standardization to improve the value of our reporting. We will also discuss specific opportunities to favor adoption of LI-RADS including building a community of users composed of radiologists and referring physicians, forming a strategic vision, enlisting a team leader, overcoming barriers to adoption, communicating successes, integrating the system into the departmental culture, and learning from mistakes. The 2017 version of LI-RADS is the most recent update and is based on the most current medical imaging evidence. The details of these updates are described in other articles in this journal's edition. Efforts should be made to increase adherence and to enhance standardized use of LI-RADS internationally. Ultimately, the objective of LI-RADS is to prioritize patient care and optimize medical outcomes.
