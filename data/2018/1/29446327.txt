This study was designed to estimate the contribution of age- and disease-specific mortality, particularly that attributable to chronic noncommunicable diseases and at-birth life expectancy (LE) in Suzhou, East China, between 2006 and 2015. In total, data on 427 290 deaths were analyzed. From 2006 to 2015, the at-birth LE increased from 78.92 years to 82.87 years in Suzhou. A decrease in all-cause age-specific death rates contributed to an increase of 1.98 years. The decreased death rates attributable to noncommunicable diseases including cerebrovascular diseases, cancer, heart disease, and respiratory diseases resulted in an increased LE of 1.37 years, which was particularly pronounced among people aged 65 years and older. However, the prevalence of cancer in those aged 45 to 74 years, particularly gastric, liver, and esophageal cancers, contributed the most to the increase in LE. These data may be useful for public health communications.
