Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer and is typically diagnosed at advanced stages. Identification and characterisation of genes within amplified and deleted chromosomal loci can provide new insights into the pathogenesis of cancer and lead to new approaches for diagnosis and therapy. In our previous study, we found a recurrent region of copy number amplification at 19p13.2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we performed integrated copy number analysis and expression profiling at this locus and a putative cancer gene, SMARCA4/BRG1, was uncovered in this region. BRG1 is a part of the large ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complex SWI/SNF. The function of BRG1 in various cancers is unclear, including its role in HCC tumorigenesis. Here, we found that BRG1 is upregulated in HCC and that its level significantly correlates with cancer progression in HCC patients. Importantly, we also found that nuclear expression of BRG1 predicts early recurrence for HCC patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated that BRG1 promotes HCC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. BRG1 was observed not only to facilitate S-phase entry but also to attenuate cell apoptosis. Finally, we discovered that one of the mechanisms by which BRG1 promotes cell proliferation is the upregulation of SMAD6. These findings highlight the important role of BRG1 in the regulation of HCC proliferation and provide valuable information for cancer prognosis and treatment.
