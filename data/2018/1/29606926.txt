Objective:To investigate the imaging features observed in preoperative Gd-EOB-DTPA-dynamic enhanced MRI and correlated with the presence of microvascular invasion (MVI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:66 HCCs in 60 patients with preoperative Gd-EOB-DTPA-dynamic enhanced MRI were retrospectively analyzed. Features including tumor size, signal homogeneity, tumor capsule, tumor margin, peritumor enhancement during mid-arterial phase, peritumor hypointensity during hepatobiliary phase, signal intensity ratio on DWI and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC), T1 relaxation times, and the reduction rate between pre- and postcontrast enhancement images were assessed. Correlation between these features and histopathological presence of MVI was analyzed to establish a prediction model.Results:Histopathology confirmed that MVI were observed in 17 of 66 HCCs. Univariate analysis showed tumor size (p = 0.003), margin (p = 0.013), peritumor enhancement (p = 0.001), and hypointensity during hepatobiliary phase (p = 0.004) were associated with MVI. A multiple logistic regression model was established, which showed tumor size, margin, and peritumor enhancement were combined predictors for the presence of MVI (Î± = 0.1). R2 of this prediction model was 0.353, and the sensitivity and specificity were 52.9% and 93.0%, respectively.Conclusion:Large tumor size, irregular tumor margin, and peritumor enhancement in preoperative Gd-EOB-DTPA-dynamic enhanced MRI can predict the presence of MVI in HCC.
