Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, very little is known about the replication of HBV in HCC tissues. We analyzed viral and cellular parameters in HCC (T) and nontumor liver (NT) samples from 99 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive, virologically suppressed patients treated by tumor resection or liver transplantation. We examined total HBV DNA and RNA as well as covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) and pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), which are considered as markers of active HBV replication. Total HBV DNA and RNA were detected in both T and NT samples in a majority of cases, but only a subset of tumors harbored detectable levels of HBV cccDNA and pgRNA (39% and 67%) compared to NT livers (66% and 90%; P Conclusion:HCC replicating HBV represents a subtype of weakly invasive HCC with a transcriptomic signature. pgRNA originating from nonintegrated, complete HBV genomes is a sensitive marker for viral replication and prognosis.
