Introduction:Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the main etiologic risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Early studies indicated that the increase of omega-6-derived oxylipins may be involved in the pathogenesis of HBV-related HCC, yet their changes during the distinct clinical phases of chronic HBV infection remain unclear. To fill this gap, in this study we investigated the omega-6-derived oxylipin profiles in patients with three major clinical stages of chronic HBV infection (chronic hepatitis B, liver cirrhosis, and HCC).Methods:Eighteen omega-6-derived oxylipins were quantified in serum samples of 34 patients with chronic hepatitis B, 46 patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis, 38 patients with HBV-related HCC, and 50 healthy controls using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.Results:Seven oxylipins were found to be altered in patients with HBV-related liver diseases, including 9,10-dihydroxyoctadecenoic acid (9,10-DiHOME), 12,13-DiHOME, 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (14,15-DiHETrE), 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), 11-HETE, and thromboxane B2 (TXB2). Of these, three oxylipins derived from the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) pathways including 9,10-DiHOME, 12,13-DiHOME, and 14,15-DiHETrE were found to be associated with the levels of α-fetoprotein (AFP), a tumor marker. In combination with AFP, age, and gender, a combination of these seven differential oxylipins could significantly enhance the prediction of HBV-related liver diseases, particularly for liver cirrhosis (p < 0.05).Conclusion:This study for the first time shows the correlations between CYP450-derived oxylipins and the progression of chronic HBV infection, and sheds a new light on the surveillance of HBV-related live diseases using oxylipins.
