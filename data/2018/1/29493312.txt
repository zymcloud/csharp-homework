The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with thalassemia is increasing, the two well recognized HCC risk factors in thalassemia being iron overload and chronic hepatitis C. The carcinogenicity of iron is related to its induction of oxidative damage, whereas chronic hepatitis leads to necroinflammation that can accelerate progression to HCC. We hereby report the case of a non transfused, hepatitis C-negative, β-thalassemia intermedia (β-TI) patient from our practice who had evidence of significant iron overload, suggesting the importance of increased iron burden as a HCC risk factor in this patient population. As such, screening thalassemia patients using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based liver iron concentration (LIC) measurement and liver ultrasound is strongly recommended for early detection of iron overload and HCC, respectively. Data appears to be lacking on HCC treatment outcomes in patients who have thalassemia, but an approach tailored to each patient's comorbidities is key to treatment success. The prognosis of these patients can be improved by multicenter studies investigating novel HCC therapeutic targets in the thalassemia realm.
