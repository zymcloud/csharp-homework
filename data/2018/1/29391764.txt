Aim:To optimize the hepatobiliary phase delay time (HBP-DT) of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (GED-MRI) for more efficient identification of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurring in different degrees of cirrhosis assessed by Child-Pugh (CP) score.Methods:The liver parenchyma signal intensity (LPSI), the liver parenchyma (LP)/HCC signal ratios, and the visibility of HCC at HBP-DT of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min (i.e., DT-5, DT-10, DT-15, DT-20, and DT-25 ) after injection of Gd-EOB-DTPA were collected and analyzed in 73 patients with cirrhosis of different degrees of severity (including 42 patients suffering from HCC) and 18 healthy adult controls.Results:The LPSI increased with HBP-DT more significantly in the healthy group than in the cirrhosis group (F = 17.361, P < 0.001). The LP/HCC signal ratios had a significant difference (F = 12.453, P < 0.001) among various HBP-DT points, as well as between CP-A and CP-B/C subgroups (F = 9.761, P < 0.001). The constituent ratios of HCC foci identified as obvious hypointensity (+++), moderate hypointensity (++), and mild hypointensity or isointensity (+/-) kept stable from DT-10 to DT-25: 90.6%, 9.4%, and 0.0% in the CP-A subgroup; 50.0%, 50.0%, and 0.0% in the CP-B subgroup; and 0.0%, 0.0%, and 100.0% in the CP-C subgroup, respectively.Conclusion:The severity of liver cirrhosis has significant negative influence on the HCC visualization by GED-MRI. DT-10 is more efficient and practical than other HBP-DT points to identify most of HCC foci emerging in CP-A cirrhosis, as well as in CP-B cirrhosis; but an HBP-DT of 15 min or longer seems more appropriate than DT-10 for visualization of HCC in patients with CP-C cirrhosis.
