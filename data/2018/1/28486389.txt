Objective:To compare performances for predicting surgical difficulty and postoperative complications.Background:An expert panel recently proposed a complexity classification for liver resection with 3 categories of complexity (low, medium, or high). We compared this new classification with the conventional major/minor classification.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed 469 hepatocellular carcinoma patients who underwent liver resection between 1 January 1, 2004 and June 30, 2015. We used receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis to compare the performances of both classifications for predicting perioperative outcomes.Results:Both classifications effectively differentiated subgroups of patients in terms of their intraoperative findings and short-term outcomes, including blood loss, transfusion rate, operation time, and postoperative hospital stay (all P Conclusions:The complexity classification outperformed the major/minor classification for predicting the surgical difficulty of liver resection.
