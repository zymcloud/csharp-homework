Objective:To observe the expression and clinical significance of micro RNA (miR)-139-3p in liver cancer tissues, and to explore its relationship with miR-139-3p target genes related to the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 362 patients with HCC were included in the study. Liver hepatocellular carcinoma data were obtained directly from The Cancer Genome Atlas data portal .The bioinformatics analysis tool TargetScan was applied to predict miR-139-3p target genes.Results:Survival time was significantly higher in patients with high miR-139-3p expression, compared with the low miR-139-3p expression group. Bioinformatics analysis showed that miR-139-3p target genes ISG20L2, RAD54B, KIAA0101, and PIGS were significantly negatively correlated with miR-139-3p expression.Conclusions:High miR-139-3p expression in HCC tissues was indicative of good patient prognosis. miR-139-3p target genes ISG20L2, RAD54B, KIAA0101, and PIGS were related to HCC prognosis.
