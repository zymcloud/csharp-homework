Objectives:The aim of this study was to investigate the quality of ultrasound (US) examinations for hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance under the Korean National Cancer Screening Program and to assess knowledge and experience about liver US of physicians who perform US examinations.Methods:The investigation about the quality of liver US for hepatocellular carcinoma screening was based on the results of a nationwide quality assurance (QA) evaluation between 2012 and 2014 at all medical institutions participating in the National Cancer Screening Program. The QA evaluation was for personnel, equipment, education, and clinical images. Medical institutions with fewer than 60 of 100 points were considered to have failed the evaluation. Follow-up education in the form of a hands-on workshop was provided for physicians who worked in medical institutions that failed the QA evaluation. A questionnaire about basic knowledge and experience with US was administered during follow-up education.Results:After the QA evaluation, 542 of 685 hospitals and 1340 of 1985 private clinics passed the test. The evaluation of private clinics and hospitals showed substantial differences in the frequency of adequacy or mean scores between the pass and fail groups for all QA items, even requirements. Among 233 participants in the hands-on workshops, 187 physicians (80.2%) responded to the questionnaire. Results revealed that physicians had deficient knowledge and experience about liver US.Conclusions:The quality of liver US for hepatocellular carcinoma screening remains suboptimal. Education for physicians who perform liver US examinations is unsatisfactory in Korea. We should make an effort to improve the quality of liver US and teach basic US techniques to physicians.
