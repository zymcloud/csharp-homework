Background and aims:Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), as an inflammation-based marker, plays critical roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study was aimed to investigate the prognostic value of preablation NLR in locally advanced HCC patients following radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and to determine an optimal cutoff value for NLR.Materials and methods:From September 2008 to May 2017, 402 locally advanced HCC patients treated with RFA were retrospectively evaluated. Several prognostic factors including NLR was assessed with univariate and multivariate analysis. The optimal cutoff value of NLR was determined with a maximally selected log-rank test. Other prognostic factors influenced the overall survival (OS) were also evaluated.Results:Based on the univariate analysis of 16 prognostic factors for OS, the type of hepatitis, a-fetoprotein (AFP), NLR, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and serum albumin were identified as independent prognostic factors; and based on multivariate analysis of 6 prognostic factors for OS, AFP, and NLR were identified (P Conclusions:Preablation NLR was a valuable predictor in locally advanced HCC patients treated with RFA. NLR â‰¥2.2 indicated a poor prognosis. These findings suggested that preablation NLR may be a convenient, easily-obtained, low cost, and reliable biomarker with prognostic potential for HCC patients.
