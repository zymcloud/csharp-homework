The prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)with right atrium tumor thrombus(RATT)is dismal and necessary to be treated on as oncologic emergency. We report a case of HCC with RATT which was treated with multidisciplinary therapy including surgery. After repeated transarterial chemoembolization(TACE)and radiofrequency ablation(RFA), a 71-year-old man consulted to our hospital with multiple HCC, lung metastasis, and RATT. Left hemihepatectomy, thrombectomy of RATT, and 3 months of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy(HAIC)was performed, and intrahepatic HCCs were controlled. However, during treatment of lung metastasis by sorafenib, the patient died of brain metastasis, 3 years after the first treatment. Although surgery and HAIC may give a chance of further treatment by control of intrahepatic HCCs, stronger regimen for systemic HCC would be necessary.
