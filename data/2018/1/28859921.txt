Background:Associating liver partition with portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) and conventional staged hepatectomy (CSH) are options for patients with unresectable liver tumors due to insufficient future liver remnant (FLR).Methods:A retrospective comparison of clinical data, liver volumetry and surgical outcomes between 10 ALPPS and 29 CSH patients was performed.Results:Patient demographics and disease characteristics were similar between both groups. ALPPS induced superior FLR growth (ALPPS vs. CSH, 48.1% (IQR 39.4-96.9%) vs. 11.8% (IQR 4.3-41.9%), p = 0.013). However, post-operative day 5 international normalized ratio (INR) (ALPPS vs. CSH, 1.6 (IQR 1.5-1.8) vs. 1.4 (IQR 1.3-1.6), p = 0.015) and rate of post-hepatectomy liver failure (ALPPS vs. CSH, 25 vs. 0%, p = 0.032) was higher in the ALPPS group. 90-day mortality (ALPPS vs. CSH, 12.5% vs. 0%, p = 0.320) was similar in both groups.Conclusion:ALPPS was superior in inducing FLR growth but associated with increased post-hepatectomy liver failure compared to CSH.
