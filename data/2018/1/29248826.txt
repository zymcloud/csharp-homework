Objectives:'Hub-and-spoke' networks may be one solution to reduce the geographical inequality in access to liver transplantation (LT) and the growing demands on, and saturation of, LT centres. It is not clear if such networks improve equity of access, deliver comparable patient outcomes or effect patient satisfaction.Study design:Retrospective evaluation of outcomes and patient satisfaction within the Royal Free liver transplant 'hub-and-spoke' network.Methods:Patient outcomes in those assessed for LT between September 2011 and 2014 at spoke centres (n = 4) were compared retrospectively with those assessed at the LT hub centre. Patient satisfaction questionnaires were completed and changes in LT referral patterns were explored with data obtained directly from NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT).Results:A total of 655 patients (180 spoke; 475 hub) were assessed for LT. Patients referred from spoke centres were more likely to have viral hepatitis as an underlying aetiology (72/180 vs 110/475; P Conclusion:Hub-and-spoke LT networks are effective in offering equivalent clinical outcomes, high patient satisfaction and alleviate clinical pressure on the hub centre. They have to potential to help eliminate the geographical disparity in mortality rates from chronic liver disease.
