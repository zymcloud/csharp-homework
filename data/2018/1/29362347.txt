We report a case of endocrine cell carcinoma of the colon with very poor prognosis, onset with bowel obstruction and multiple liver metastases. The patient was a 77-year-old man who underwent left hemicolectomy after a colon stent treatment for bowel obstruction due to cancer of the transverse colon with unresectable multiple liver metastases. Chemotherapy was not initiated because of his poor health. He died of primary cancer 52 days after the surgery. Endocrine cell carcinoma of the large intestine has a poor prognosis due to an early onset of liver and lymph node metastases, as well as peritoneal dissemination. A large-scale clinical study is needed to establish an effective adjuvant chemotherapy.
