Thirty-one isolates belonging to eight genera in seven orders were identified from 141 strains that were isolated from several marine plants. Alternaria sp. and Fusarium sp. were found to be the predominant fungi. Evaluation of the anti-phytopathogenic bacterial and fungal activities, as well as the cytotoxicity of these 31 extracts, revealed that most of them displayed different levels of bioactivities. Due to their interesting bioactivities, two fungal strains-Fusarium equiseti (P18) and Alternaria sp. (P8)-were selected for chemical investigation and compounds 1-4 were obtained. The structure of 1 was elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR analysis, as well as high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (HRESIMS), and the absolute configuration of its stereogenic carbon (C-11) was established by comparison of the experimental and calculated electronic circular-dichroism (ECD) spectra. Moreover, alterperylenol (4) exhibited antibacterial activity against Clavibacter michiganensis with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1.95 Î¼g/mL, which was 2-fold stronger than that of streptomycin sulfate. Additionally, an antibacterial mechanism study revealed that 4 caused membrane hyperpolarization without evidence of destruction of cell membrane integrity. Furthermore, stemphyperylenol (3) displayed potent antifungal activity against Pestallozzia theae and Alternaria brassicicola with MIC values equal to those of carbendazim. The cytotoxicity of 1 and 2 against human lung carcinoma (A-549), human cervical carcinoma (HeLa), and human hepatoma (HepG2) cell lines were also evaluated.
