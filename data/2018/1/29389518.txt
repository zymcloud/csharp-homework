Wnt/β-catenin signaling is integral to the homeostasis and regeneration of many epithelial tissues due to its critical role in adult stem cell regulation. It is also implicated in many epithelial cancers, with mutations in core pathway components frequently present in patient tumors. In this chapter, we discuss the roles of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and Wnt-regulated stem cells in homeostatic, regenerative and cancer contexts of the intestines, stomach, skin, and liver. We also examine the sources of Wnt ligands that form part of the stem cell niche. Despite the diversity in characteristics of various tissue stem cells, the role(s) of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is generally coherent in maintaining stem cell fate and/or promoting proliferation. It is also likely to play similar roles in cancer stem cells, making the pathway a salient therapeutic target for cancer. While promising progress is being made in the field, deeper understanding of the functions and signaling mechanisms of the pathway in individual epithelial tissues will expedite efforts to modulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cancer treatment and tissue regeneration.
