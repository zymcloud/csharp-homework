Despite the availability of a preventative vaccine, chronic hepatitis B (CHB) remains a global healthcare challenge with the risk of disease progression due to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although current treatment strategies, interferon and nucleos(t)ide analogues have contributed to reducing morbidity and mortality related to CHB, these therapies are limited in providing functional cure. The treatment paradigm in CHB is rapidly evolving with a number of new agents in the developmental pipeline. However, until novel agents with functional cure capability are available in the clinical setting, there is a pressing need to optimize currently licensed therapies. Here, we discuss current agents used alone and/or in combination strategies along with the impact of these therapies on viral and immune responses. Novel treatment strategies are outlined, and the potential role of current therapies in the employment of pipeline agents is discussed.
