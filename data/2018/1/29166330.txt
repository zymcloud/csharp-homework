A 58-year-old man was referred for selective internal radiation therapy for locally advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Intra-arterial particle perfusion scintigraphy was performed with SPECT/CT following intra-arterial injection of Tc macroaggregated albumin. Angiography demonstrated a hepatic falciform artery, a feeding artery of the ligamentum teres, whereas scintigraphy demonstrated tracer uptake in the mid-anterior abdominal wall. The hepatic falciform artery was subsequently embolized and the repeat angiogram confirmed successful occlusion. Subsequent post-selective internal radiation therapy PET/CT images did not reveal any tracer uptake in the mid-anterior abdominal wall.
