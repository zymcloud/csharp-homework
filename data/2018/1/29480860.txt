Rationale:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly invasive cancer associated with great mortality rates. The prognosis of advanced HCC is very poor.Patient concerns:Here, we report a HCC patient with a big paraspinal metastasis with 10 cm in diameter who failed the treatment of sorafenib.Diagnoses:Sorafenib refractory HCC with big paraspinal metastasis.Interventions:The concurrent treatment of apatinib with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).Outcomes:The paraspinal metastasis with 10 cm in diameter showed nearly complete response.Lessons:We think that the apatinib may be a good choice for HCC and it may function as a radiosensitizer of HCC. However, it warrants further investigation in the future prospective clinical studies.
