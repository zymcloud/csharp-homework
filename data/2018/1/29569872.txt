Hepatocellular carcinoma is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and late diagnosis is the main cause of death in HCC patients. In this study expression patterns of HSP70, GPC3 and GS and their relationships with pathogenesis of HCC in Iranian patients were investigated. The expression of HSP70, GPC3 and GS were determined by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR) methods, using 121 cases from patients with HBV alone, HCC without HBV, HBV+HCC and 30 normal tissues as control group. HSP70, GPC3 and GS were expressed in higher levels in HBV-related HCC samples compared to HBV alone group. The results showed that the labeling index of HSP70, GPC3 and GS are correlated with immunohistochemical and molecular expressions of HSP70, GPC3 and GS. The sensitivity and specificity for HCC diagnosis were 43.4% and 89.7% for HSP70, 64.3% and 90.4% for GPC3, and 60.7% and 94.3% for GS, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the panels with 3, 2 and 1 positive markers, regardless of which one, were 21.6% and 100%, 51.3% and 100% and 93.4% and 80.5% respectively. The current study demonstrated an association between HSP70, GPC3 and GS expressions and HBV-related HCC in our population. It was concluded that HSP70, GPC3 and GS expressions could be useful biomarkers for increasing the specificity and sensitivity of HCC diagnosis to acceptable level. Also, proper combinations of these 3 markers could improve diagnostic accuracy.
