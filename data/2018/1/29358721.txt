Metastasis and recurrence contribute to poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, we reported that interferon-α (IFN-α) can suppress metastasis of HCC; however, the underlying mechanism has not been fully described. In this study, we demonstrated that expression of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD), a pyrimidine catabolic enzyme, was dose-dependently downregulated by IFN-α in HCC tissues from nude mice. Notably, DPYD expression was found to be significantly increased in HCC cell lines with higher metastatic potentials compared with their controls. Moreover, upregulation of DPYD in HCC cells could promote in vitro migration, invasion, and in vivo lung metastasis, and inducing changes characteristic of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In contrast, knockdown of DPYD inhibited these processes. Mechanistically, DPYD functioned as a positive regulator of EMT in HCC by targeting the p38/NF-κB/Snail1 pathway. Clinically, tissue microarray analysis showed that high DPYD expression was positively associated with aggressive tumor characteristics, including larger tumor size, tumor recurrence, and advanced tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, and independently correlated with poorer overall survival times after curative resection. HCC patients with low DPYD expression have better response to IFN-α therapy. Taken together, our findings elucidate that IFN-α could downregulate DPYD expression to inhibit EMT and HCC metastasis, and suggest that DPYD might be a potential prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for HCC.
