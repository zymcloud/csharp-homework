Physiological responses of bacterial, fish, rat and human hepatoma cells to the technical cypermethrin (AS), cypermethrin-based plant protection product (PPP), and the major co-formulant (solvent) were compared. The endpoints included: bioluminescence, total protein content, activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenase and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes CYP1A and CYP1B, and expression of several genes encoding different CYP enzyme isoforms. Toxicity of PPP was compared with the toxicity predicted using concentration addition model. Cypermethrin disturbs the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenase. Induction of CYP1A1-, CYP1A2- and CYP1B1-associated activity was more pronounced in PPP than in cypermethrin treatment. The predominant biotransformation pathway of cypermethrin is related to Cyp3a1 induction. Deviations between observed and predicted toxicity of PPP indicate synergistic effects of cypermethrin and a solvent. In vitro cellular assays may serve as rapid pre-screening tool and provide for a good indication of mixture effects and prompt further in vivo testing of PPPs when really needed.
