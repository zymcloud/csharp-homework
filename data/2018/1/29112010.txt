C-acetate uptake could be increased in physiologic or inflammatory conditions without evidence of cancer. We report a hepatocellular carcinoma patient with sorafenib-induced metabolic acidosis, who showed increased hepatic uptake of C-acetate. C-acetate PET/CT might be a potentially useful surrogate marker to monitor these adverse effects via the changes in C-acetate uptake patterns from before to after drug withdrawal.
