BACKGROUND The association between X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) Arg399Gln gene polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been investigated in several populations. However, the findings are controversial. The aim of this study was to address the association between XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism and HCC in an Iranian population. METHODS We have evaluated the association between XRCC1 Arg399Gln gene polymorphism and HCC in 151 Iranian individuals (50 patients with HCC and 101 healthy matched controls) using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) method. RESULTS Significant association was found for the XRCC1 A allele and HCC [OR = 1.93, 95% CI (1.16 - 3.25), P = 0.0099]. Also, genotype analysis by SNPStats online software showed a significant association between XRCC1 gene polymorphisms and HCC under co-dominant, dominant, and recessive genetic models. CONCLUSION Our study provides evidence that the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism may be associated with the risk of HCC development in Iranian population.
