Objective:The aim is to study the effectiveness and side effects of sorafenib administration after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. To evaluate the safety of the combination of sorafenib and TACE to treat HCC.Materials and methods:A total of 36 unresectable HCC patients were enrolled. After TACE, administration of sorafenib was carried out. Follow-up was taken for every 4 weeks. Liver and renal function and alpha-fetoprotein were tested. Modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST) was used to evaluate the clinical effect. The side effects were recorded.Results:The median overall survival (mOS) and the median time to progress were 12.5 and 8 months with the range from 6 to 32 and 4-30 months, respectively. The mOS of patients with single tumor was 18 months while that of multiple tumors in liver was 10 months (Ï‡2 = 4.1639, P = 0.0413). According to mRECIST, there were no complete response patients, 2 partial response patients, 10 stable disease patients, and 24 progressive disease patients. Response rate was 5.5% (2/36). Disease control rate (DCR) was 33% (12/36). The main adverse events were hand-foot skin reaction and diarrhea. The frequency of Grade II, III hand-foot-skin reaction was 39%. After treatment, it decreased to 5.6%. Forty-four percentage patients suffered from diarrhea of Grades I and II. After treatment, it decreased to 28%. The mean interval of TACE was 45 days before combination therapy and 120 days after combination therapy.Conclusion:Administration of sorafenib after TACE could prolong overall survival of advanced HCC patients, keep the stable status longer and extend the interval between TACEs. The side effects are usually treatable, which proves the safety of this combination.
