Background/aim:We report the outcomes of sorafenib therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in our Department.Patients and methods:Thirty-eight patients with unresectable HCC who were administrated sorafenib from 2009 to 2015 were investigated retrospectively.Results:The 1-year overall survival rate was 59.3%. The macroscopic vascular invasion and response rate were independent prognostic factors of survival. Surgical resection after sorafenib achieved long-term survival in two cases. Case 1: A patient with locally unresectable HCC showed significant response induced by sorafenib, which allowed complete surgical resection. This tumor tested positive for FGF4. Case 2: A patient with a history of hepatectomy for HCC had multiple distant metastases. Most lesions were reduced in size after sorafenib therapy and new lesions in the remnant liver and residual lung metastases were resected. The sorafenib-resistant lesions were negative for FGF4.Conclusion:Sorafenib combined with surgical resection is a feasible option in advanced HCC patients, if sorafenib has been effective.
