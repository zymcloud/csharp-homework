Background & aims:Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with disease-causing alterations across the ATP7B gene, with highly variable symptoms and age of onset. We aimed to assess whether the clinical variability of WD relates to modifier genes.Methods:A total of 248 WD patients were included, of whom 148 were diagnosed after age of 17. Human exome libraries were constructed using AmpliSeq technology and sequenced using the IonProton platform.Results:ATP7B p.His1069Gln mutation was present in 215 patients, with 112 homozygotes and 103 heterozygotes. Three other mutations: p.Gln1351Ter, p.Trp779Ter and c.3402delC were identified in >10 patients. Among patients, 117 had a homozygous mutation, 101 were compound heterozygotes, 27 had one heterozygous mutation, and 3 other patients had no identifiable pathogenic variant of ATP7B. Sixteen mutations were novel, found as part of a compound mutation or as a sole, homozygous mutation. For disease phenotype prediction, age at diagnosis was a deciding factor, while frameshift allelic variants of ATP7B and being male increased the odds of developing a neurological phenotype. Rare allelic variants in ESD and INO80 increased and decreased chances for the neurological phenotype, respectively, while rare variants in APOE and MBD6 decreased the chances of WD early manifestation. Compound mutations contributed to earlier age of onset.Conclusions:In a Polish population, genetic screening for WD may help genotype for four variants (p.His1069Gln, p.Gln1351Ter, p.Trp779Ter and c.3402delC), with direct sequencing of all ATP7B amplicons as a second diagnostic step. We also identified some allelic variants that may modify a WD phenotype.
