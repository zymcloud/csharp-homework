We investigated the long-term risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in dual-infected hepatitis B and C patients after eradication of hepatitis C virus (HCV). A total of 164 (62% male, median age, 50.5 years) hepatitis B and C dual-infected patients who achieved HCV sustained virological response were recruited. Half the patients were HCV genotype 1 with a median viral load of 5.5 log10 IU/mL, and 22.6%had an HBV DNA level ≥ 2000 IU/mL before therapy. HCC developed in 14 patients (8.5%), with an annual incidence of 1.38% per person-year. The 3-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year cumulative probabilities were 2.5%, 5.1%, 12.6%, and 22.7%, respectively. Six months after treatment, a Cox regression hazard analysis revealed platelet level (HR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.957-0.999, P = 0.038) and AFP level (HR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.031-1.400, P = 0.019) to be independent factors in HCC. A higher 10-year cumulative risk of HCC was detected in patients with 6-month post-treatment AFP levels > 5.0 ng/mL and platelet levels < 130 x1000/µL (54.9%), compared to patients with neither (8.6%). Although the risk of HCC is low, surveillance of HCC is encouraged in dual-infected patients after eradication of HCV. Post-treatment AFP and platelet levels predict HCC development.
