Background:The aim of this study was to establish a preoperatively available serological risk index using alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) for predicting oncologically futile liver transplantation (LT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:A total of 119 liver transplant patients with HCC were retrospectively analyzed. The prognostic impact of clinical and histopathologic factors including pre-LT serum AFP and CRP values was determined.Results:Apart from microvascular tumor invasion (MVI; odds ratio [OR] 15.77), pretransplant serum levels of AFP > 100 ng/ml (OR 13.31) and CRP > 0.8 mg/dl (OR 13.97) were identified as independent predictors of HCC recurrence. The cumulative risk of HCC relapse at 5 years post-LT was 2.3% in low serological tumor activity (STA) index (AFP ≤ 100 ng/ml + CRP ≤ 0.8 mg/dl), 17.1% in intermediate STA (AFP ≤ 100 ng/ml or CRP ≤ 0.8 mg/dl), and 91.6% in high STA index (AFP > 100 ng/ml + CRP > 0.8 mg/dl; p Conclusion:Our proposed serological risk index based on pretransplant serum AFP and CRP values is able to predict oncologically futile LT among advanced HCC patients.
