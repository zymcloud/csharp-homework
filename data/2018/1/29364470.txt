Objective:Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) GIHCG has been reported as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the expression, roles, and clinical values of GIHCG in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression, roles, diagnostic and prognostic values of GIHCG in RCC.Patients and methods:The expression of GIHCG in 46 pairs of RCC tissues and adjacent normal renal tissues was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). GIHCG serum level in 46 RCC patients, 46 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, 20 pre- and post-surgery RCC patients was measured by qRT-PCR. The diagnostic values of serum GIHCG were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis. The effect of GIHCG on RCC cell proliferation was evaluated using Cell Count Kit-8 assay, and the effect of GIHCG on RCC cell migration was evaluated using transwell migration assay.Results:GIHCG is upregulated in RCC tissues compared with adjacent normal renal tissues. Increased expression of GIHCG is positively correlated with advanced TNM stages, Fuhrman grades, and poor prognosis. Serum GIHCG level is also significantly upregulated in RCC patients and correlated with advanced TNM stages. Serum GIHCG could accurately discriminate RCC patients from healthy controls, and also early stage RCC patients from healthy controls. Furthermore, serum GIHCG level is positively correlated with GIHCG expression in RCC tissues. Serum GIHCG level is significantly reduced after radical resection of RCC. Functional assays showed that knockdown of GIHCG significantly represses proliferation and migration of RCC cells.Conclusions:Long noncoding RNA GIHCG would sever as a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for RCC.
