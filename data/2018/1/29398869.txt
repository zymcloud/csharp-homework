Aim:To identify clinical biomarkers that could early predict improved survival in patients with advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with transarterial chemoembolization combined with sorafenib (TACE-S).Methods:We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of consecutive patients with advanced-stage HCC who underwent TACE-S from January 2012 to December 2015. At the first follow-up 4-6 wk after TACE-S (median, 38 d; range, 33-45 d), patients exhibiting the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST)-evaluated complete response, partial response, and stable disease were categorized as early disease control. At this time point, multiple variables were analyzed to identify the related factors affecting survival.Results:Ninety-five patients were included in this study, and 60 of these patients achieved early disease control, with an overall disease control rate (DCR) of 63.2%. Patients who got sorafenib at the first TACE (no previous TACE) and patients without portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) had a higher DCR than those who underwent previous TACE before TACE-S (72.4% vs 48.6%, P = 0.019) and those with PVTT (75.5% vs 50.0%, P = 0.010). Early disease control after TACE-S, no previous TACE, and no PVTT were the independent prognostic factors for survival in the uni- and multivariate analyses.Conclusion:The first follow-up 4-6 wk after TACE-S can be used as the earliest time point to assess the response to TACE-S, and patients with mRECIST-evaluated early disease control, no previous TACE, and no PVTT had better survival.
