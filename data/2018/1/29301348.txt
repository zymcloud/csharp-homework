Cells respond to various environmental factors such as nutrients, food intake, and drugs or toxins by undergoing dynamic epigenetic changes. An imbalance in dynamic epigenetic changes is one of the major causes of disease, oncogenic activities, and immunosuppressive effects. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a unique cellular chemical sensor present in most organs, and its dysregulation has been demonstrated in multiple stages of tumor progression in humans and experimental models; however, the effects of the pathogenic mechanisms of AHR on epigenetic regulation remain unclear. Apart from proto-oncogene activation, epigenetic repressions of tumor suppressor genes are involved in tumor initiation, procession, and metastasis. Reverse epigenetic repression of the tumor suppressor genes by epigenetic enzyme activity inhibition and epigenetic enzyme level manipulation is a potential path for tumor therapy. Current evidence and our recent work on deacetylation of histones on tumor-suppressive genes suggest that histone deacetylase (HDAC) is involved in tumor formation and progression, and treating hepatocellular carcinoma with HDAC inhibitors can, at least partially, repress tumor proliferation and transformation by recusing the expression of tumor-suppressive genes such as TP53 and RB1.
