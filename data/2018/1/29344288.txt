Objective GP73 is a new hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) marker, which is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma and closely relates to prognosis. This study was to investigate the effects of GP73 on cellular proliferation, apoptosis, oxaliplatin (OXA) resistance and secretory clusterin (sCLU) of HCC cells. Materials and Methods Western blot and immunofluorescence was used to detect the expression of GP73 in 8 types of commonly used HCC cell lines. Drug resistance was induced by increasing concentration gradient method. The drug-resistant human HCC cell lines underwent GP73 overexpression or inhibition. Flow cytometry were used to detect the proliferation and apoptosis of HCC cell lines. The changes of sCLU were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results The expression of GP73 in MHC-97H cells was the highest and in Hep3B cells the lowest. The expression of GP73 was found further elevated in OXA-resistant MHC-97H cells. After the knockdown of GP73 in OXA-resistant 97H cells, the IC50 of OXA decreased and the ability of cell proliferation decreased significantly. After over-expression of GP73 in OXA-resistant Hep3B cells, the IC50 of OXA increased and the cell proliferation ability increased, showing that GP73 is critical for OXA resistant in HCC cell lines; No significant change of sCLU level in GP73 overexpressed Hep3B and GP73 blocked MHCC-97H were identified. Conclusion The expression level of GP73 is critical for the resistance of OXA in HCC cell lines.
