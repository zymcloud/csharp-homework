Purpose:Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) is an effective treatment strategy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. However, the prognoses of patients with portal vein thrombosis, extra-hepatic metastases, or residual tumors remain poor when treated with SIRT alone. In these patients, sequential external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) may offer a chance of salvage. Here, we reported the clinical outcomes and the detailed dosimetry analysis of 22 patients treated with combination therapy.Methods:Between October 2011 and May 2015, 22 consecutive patients who underwent EBRT after yttrium-90 (90Y) SIRT were included in this study. The post-SIRT 90Y bremsstrahlung SPECT/CT of each patient was transferred to dose distribution by adopting the local deposition hypothesis. The patient-specific 3-dimensional biological effective dose distribution of combined SIRT and EBRT was generated. The overall survival and safety were evaluated. The relationship between dosimetric parameters and liver toxicity was analyzed.Results:The mean administered activity of SIRT was 1.50 GBq (range: 0.5-2.8). The mean prescribed dose of EBRT was 42.3 Gy (range: 15-63) in 14 fractions (range: 5-15) and was targeted to the residual liver tumor in 12 patients (55%), portal vein thrombosis in 11 patients (50%), and perihilar lymphadenopathies in 4 patients (18%). The overall 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were 59.8%, 47.9%, and 47.9%, respectively. Overall, 8 patients (36%) developed > grade 2 liver toxicities, and the Child-Pugh score prior to EBRT strongly affected the toxicity risk. A dosimetry analysis restricted to 18 Child-Pugh A/B patients showed that the V100 (The fraction of normal liver exposed to more than 100 Gy) to V140 significance differed between patients who did or did not experience hepatotoxicity. The V110 was the strongest predictor of hepatotoxicity (18.6±11.6% vs 29.5±5.8%; P = 0.030).Conclusion:Combined therapy is feasible and safe if patients are carefully selected. Specifically, 3-dimensional dosimetry is crucial for the evaluation of efficacy and toxicity. The normal liver V100 to V140 values of the combined dose should be as low as possible to minimize the risk of liver toxicity.
