Background:(18)fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18FDG-PET/CT) might be a useful tool in the management of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Aims:The aim of this study was to analyze maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) after 18FDG-PET/CT as predictor of survival outcomes and method to determine treatment strategies.Methods:A consecutive series of patients who underwent preoperative 18FDG-PET/CT and subsequent resection for PDAC were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded.Results:46 patients were included in the analysis. Median follow-up was 27 months (4-67). Patients who recurred within 12 months showed a significantly higher preoperative median SUVmax (8.1 vs 6.1, p=0.039). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves for disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) identified SUVmax of 6.0 as optimal cut-off. Multivariate analysis showed that SUVmax ≥ 6.0 was an independent predictor of poor DFS (HR 2.288, p=0.024) and DSS (HR 4.875, p<0.001). The combination of SUVmax ≥6.0 with CA19.9 ≥200U/ml was significantly associated with survival outcomes in comparison to patients without concordantly elevated values.Conclusion:SUVmax ≥6.0 is an independent predictor of DFS and DSS in resected PDAC. 18FDG-PET/CT might be considered in the preoperative evaluation of patients with pancreatic cancer.
