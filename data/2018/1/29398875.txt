We herein report a case of neuroendocrine carcinoma of the gastric stump found 47 years after Billroth II gastric resection for a benign gastric ulcer. A 74-year-old man was referred to another hospital with melena. Endoscopic examination revealed a localized ulcerative lesion at the gastrojejunal anastomosis. The diagnosis by endoscopic biopsy was neuroendocrine carcinoma. A total gastrectomy of the remnant stomach with D2 lymphadenectomy was performed at our hospital. The lesion invaded the subserosa, and metastasis was found in two of nine the lymph nodes retrieved. The lesion was positive for synaptophysin and chromogranin A, and the Ki-67 labeling index was 60%. The diagnosis of neuroendocrine carcinoma of the gastric stump was confirmed using World Health Organization 2010 criteria. Subsequently, the patient underwent one course of adjuvant chemotherapy with the etoposide plus cisplatin (EP) regimen; however, treatment was discontinued due to grade 3 myelosuppression. The patient showed lymph node metastasis in the region around the gastrojejunal anastomosis in the abdominal cavity 7 mo post-surgery. He then underwent radiotherapy and platinum-based combination chemotherapy; however, the disease progressed and liver recurrence was observed on follow-up computed tomography at 16 mo post-surgery. The patient then received chemotherapy with regimens used for the treatment of small cell lung cancer in first- and second-line settings. The patient died of disease progression 31 months after surgery.
