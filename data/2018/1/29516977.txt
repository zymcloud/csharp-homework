Objective:The objective of this study is to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of Habib™ VesOpen, a new intravascular radiofrequency ablation (RFA) catheter in percutaneous puncture of portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) in patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma.Materials and methods:Collected data of patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein trunk or main branch who were treated by the RFA of portal vein tumor ablation with Habib™ VesOpen, a new intravascular RFA catheter. The postoperative success rate, complications, liver and kidney function, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), portal vein patency, and tumor thrombus were analyzed, and the survival status of patients was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and the COX proportional hazards regression model was used to analyze the factors influencing the clinical prognosis of patients.Results:All the 44 patients were operated successfully without complications such as vascular perforation, infection, liver abscess, and intraperitoneal hemorrhage. The liver function index, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and serum albumin (ALB) were significantly different before and after surgery at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after operation (P Conclusions:The use of Habib™ VesOpen intravascular RFA catheter percutaneous puncture of the portal vein tumor RFA has positive clinical effect which is safe and reliable, expected to become one of the effective means in treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma with PVTT.
