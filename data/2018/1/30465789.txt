Histone deacetylases (HDACs) can regulate cell-cycle, differentiation, and apoptosis of hepatocarcinoma (HCC) cells, while their roles in drug sensitivity remain unclear. Our results showed that the expression of HDAC2 was significantly increased in HCC doxorubicin (Dox) resistant cells as compared with their corresponding control cells. Over expression of HDAC2 can increase the cell viability and decrease the Dox sensitivity. Kaplan-Meier Plotter assay revealed that HCC patients with higher levels of HDAC2 had significantly poor prognosis than that of the lower expression patients. Mechanistically studies revealed that HDAC2 can regulate the transcription of ABCB1 via directly binding with its promoter and increasing its expression in Dox resistant HCC cells. Knockdown of HDAC2 significantly inhibited the expression of ABCB1. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that HDAC2 can bind with c-fos, an important transcription factor of ABCB1, in HCC/Dox cells. Knockdown of c-Fos decreased the binding between HDAC2 and promoter of ABCB1 in HCC/Dox cells. Collectively, our data revealed that HDAC2 can regulate Dox sensitivity of HCC cells and the transcription of ABCB1.
