Amphibian skin secretions are known to contain numerous peptides with a large array of biological activities. Bombinins are a group of amphibian-derived peptides with broad spectrum antimicrobial activities that have been only identified from the ancient toad species, Bombina. In this study, we described the identification and characterization of a novel bombinin precursor which encoded a bombinin-like peptide (BLP-7) and a novel bombinin H-type peptide (named as Bombinin H-BO) from the skin secretion of Oriental fire-bellied toad, Bombina orientalis. The primary structures of both mature peptides were determined by combinations of molecular cloning of peptide precursor-encoding cDNAs and mass spectrometry techniques. Secondary structure prediction revealed that both peptides had cationic amphipathic Î±-helical structural features. The synthetic replicate of BLP-7 displayed more potent antimicrobial activity than Bombinin H-BO against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and yeast. Also, in vitro antitumour assay showed that both peptides possessed obvious antiproliferative activity on three human hepatoma cells (Hep G2/SK-HEP-1/Huh7) at the non-toxic doses. These results indicate the peptide family of bombinins could be a potential source of drug candidates for anti-infection and anticancer therapy.
