Decrease in blood concentration of branched-chain amino acids, especially leucine, is known to promote liver carcinogenesis in patients with chronic liver disease, but the mechanism is unclear. We herein established hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells knocked out for DEPDC5 by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and elucidated that cell viability of the DEPDC5 knockout (DEPDC5-KO) cells was higher than that of the DEPDC5 wild-type (DEPDC5-WT) under leucine starvation. Considering that autophagy deficiency might be involved in acquired resistance to leucine deprivation, we observed reduction of LC3-II followed by accumulation of p62 in the DEPDC5-KO, which induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) tolerance. DEPDC5 overexpression suppressed cell proliferation and tumorigenicity in immunocompromised mice, and triggered p62 degradation with increased ROS susceptibility. In clinical specimens of HCC patients, decreased expression of DEPDC5 was positively correlated with p62 overexpression, and the progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were worse in the DEPDC5-negative cases than in the DEPDC5-positive. Moreover, multivariate analysis demonstrated DEPDC5 was an independent prognostic factor for both PFS and OS. Thus, DEPDC5 inactivation enhanced ROS resistance in HCC under the leucine-depleted conditions of chronic liver disease, contributing to poor patient outcome. It could be a potential target for cancer therapy with oxidative stress control.
