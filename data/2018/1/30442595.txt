Tissue specific T1/T2 dual contrast abilities for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have great significance in initial detection of cancer lesions. Herein, we developed a novel kind of Magnus nano-bullets (Mn-DTPA-F-MSNs) distinguished by magnetic (Fe3O4-NPs) head combined with mesoporous (SiO2) persist body, respectively. Subsequently, modify mesoporous SiO2 group and finally loaded with Mn2+. These Magnus nano-bullets have relaxivity value (r1 = 5.12 mM-1 s-1) and relaxivity value (r2 = 265.32 mM-1 s-1); they were > 2 folds in comparison to control at 3.0 T. Meanwhile, Magnus nano-bullets also offered significant enhancements for the detection of Glutathione (GSH), a biomarker that has been showed a redox responsive T1-weighted MRI effect in vitro and in vivo evaluations with good biocompatibility. Therefore, our finding endorses that Magnus nano-bullets offer a "smart" and tremendous strategy for greater GSH responsive T1/T2 dual MRI image probes for future biomedical applications.
