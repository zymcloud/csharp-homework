Accumulating evidence indicates that the neural precursor cell-expressed, developmentally downregulated 4-like (Nedd4L) related with some tumor progression pathways and was found abnormally expressed in several kinds of solid cancers. However, the role and mechanism of Nedd4L in HCC remain unknown. This study was to assess the role of Nedd4L in HCC tumorigenesis and prognosis. The real-time quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry results revealed that Nedd4L was downregulated in HCC tissues compared to corresponding peri-noncancerous tissue, and HCC patients with low expression of Nedd4L exhibited poor prognosis assessed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis in 78 HCC patients. Furthermore, knockdown of Nedd4L could significantly promote proliferation of HCC cells by CCK-8 and colony formation assays in vitro; whereas ectopic expression of Nedd4L resulted in attenuating proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivc determined by nude mice xenografts model. Mechanically, Nedd4L could phosphorylate ERK1/2 and regulate genes related with apoptosis. Collectively, Nedd4L plays a tumor suppressive role in HCC, possibly through triggering MAPK/ERK-mediated apoptosis, and Nedd4L downregulation may be a potential prognostic biomarker as well as a therapeutic target for HCC.
