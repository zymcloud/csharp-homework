Background:Repeat liver resection is an effective treatment, with long-term surgical outcomes for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal liver metastasis. However, the efficacy of a minimally invasive surgical approach for recurrent liver cancer is not yet confirmed. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of minimally invasive repeat liver resection (MISRLR) compared with open repeat liver resection (ORLR) for primary and metastatic liver cancer. Here, we retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological features and short-term surgical outcomes of patients undergoing MISRLR and ORLR.Methods:From 2005 to 2016, 97 patients with liver cancer underwent repeat hepatectomy. Of these patients, 68 patients receiving macroscopically curative resection and only hepatectomy, without other additional operations, were selected. Twenty patients underwent MISRLR and 48 patients underwent ORLR. We compared the clinicopathological and surgical parameters in the MISRLR group with those in the ORLR group.Results:There were no statistically significant differences in patients' gender, age, viral infection status, Child-Pugh classification, tumor size, tumor number, tumor location, or the presence of liver cirrhosis in the two groups. The operative times were similar, but blood loss was significantly lower in MISRLR group (159 vs. 502 ml, P = 0.0035). The length of the postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter in the MISRLR group (14.2 vs. 19.2 days, P = 0.0275). Postoperative complications were observed only in the ORLR group, with a complication rate of 19%.Conclusions:We demonstrate that MISRLR for primary and metastatic liver cancer reduces blood loss and postoperative complications compared with ORLR. MISRLR might be a feasible and effective procedure for the selected patients.
