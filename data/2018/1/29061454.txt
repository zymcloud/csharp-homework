Background:Germline pathogenic variants in BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1), a nuclear ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase with evidence suggestive of independent tumor suppressor function, predispose affected families to uveal melanoma, cutaneous melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, malignant mesothelioma, and possibly a range of other tumors and malignancies as part of the BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome, a recently recognized hereditary cancer syndrome.Case description:A 50-year-old woman presented with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor of the left fifth metatarsal head. Further examination revealed a right renal mass and left breast mass. Her family history was significant for astrocytoma, melanoma, cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Genetic testing revealed a BAP1 mutation in the proband.Conclusions:Although there have been reports of sarcomas and meningiomas in patients affected with BAP1 mutations, to our knowledge malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in this patient population have not been previously reported. We report a case of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor in a patient affected by a BAP1 mutation.
