Conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (c-TACE) is a widely used first-line palliative treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Despite the effectiveness of c-TACE, to date, technique and procedure scheduling has not yet been standardized. Drug-eluting microspheres (DEMs) were therefore introduced to ensure more sustained and tumor-selective drug delivery for permanent embolization. These DEMs can load various drugs and release them in a sustained manner over a prolonged period. This approach ensures the delivery of high concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents to tumors, without increasing systemic concentrations, and promote tumor ischemia and necrosis. This review summarizes the recent advances in the use of DEM-TACE to treat HCC.
