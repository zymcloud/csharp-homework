Background and aim:The histologic discrepancies between preoperative endoscopic forceps biopsy (EFB) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) specimens sometimes confuse the endoscope operator. This study aimed to analyze the limitation of the biopsy-based diagnosis before ESD and to evaluate which factors affect the discordant pathologic results between EFB and ESD.Methods:A total of 1427 patients, who were diagnosed with gastric adenoma by EFB, were enrolled. Cancer confirmed on EFB was excluded (n = 513). We retrospectively reviewed cases and compared histologic diagnoses in the biopsy sample with the final diagnosis in the endoscopically resected specimen.Results:The diagnosis was upgraded (from low-grade dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma, or from high-grade dysplasia to adenocarcinoma) in 328 cases (23.0%), concordant in 944 (66.1%), and downgraded (from high-grade dysplasia to low-grade dysplasia or non-neoplasia, or from low-grade dysplasia to non-neoplasia) in 155 (10.9%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that surface ulceration and depressed lesions were associated with significant risk factors for upgrading. Age younger than 60 years and size <1 cm were associated with significant factors for downgrading.Conclusions:Careful endoscopic observation should consider size, ulceration, and depression to ensure accurate diagnosis when a gastric neoplasm is suspected.
