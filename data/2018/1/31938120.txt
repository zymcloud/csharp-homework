Lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP) 3 is one of members of lysosome-associated membrane protein family, which has been reported to play an important role in multiple malignant tumors. However, there is less research about the expression of LAMP3 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of LAMP3 and explore its roles in HCC.The expression of LAMP3 in 99 cases of HCC tissues was performed by immunohistochemistry. In addition, the expression of LAMP3 in 20 pairs of HCC tissues and pericarcinomatous tissues was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Immunohistochemical staining showed that LAMP3 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm. And the expression of LAMP3 in HCC tissues (64/99, 64.6%) was significantly lower than that in pericarcinomatous tissues (23/99, 23.2%). In addition, the expression of LAMP3 mRNA and protein in HCC tissues was also significantly lower than that in pericarcinomatous tissues for 20 pairs of HCC samples. Low expression of LAMP3 was correlated with age, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging, Edmondson grade, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with low expression of LAMP3 had worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Multivariate analysis revealed that low expression of LAMP3 was an independent prognostic factor of OS and DFS for HCC patients.The results suggested that LAMP3 may play an important role in the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma, and serve as an independent prognostic predictor for HCC patients after surgical resection.
