We report a 69-year-old adult case with a monoclonal gammopathy incidentally discovered, associated with a moderate thrombocytopenia of 90 G/L. Study of blood smear revealed the presence of tumor cells presenting Auer rod-like inclusions, although there were not blast cells. Blood cytology as well as immunophenotyping allowed us to make the diagnosis of malignant hemopathy.
Auer rod-like inclusions; lymphoma.
