The pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) is a key component of aerobic glycolysis and has been reported to regulate apoptosis. However, it is unclear whether PKM2 is involved in cyclooxygenase‑2 (COX‑2) induced apoptosis‑resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. In the present study, it was observed that COX‑2 and PKM2 were significantly elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues compared with adjacent liver tissues (P
