Accumulating evidences have illuminated that an amount of microRNAs are involved in human diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we found that the expression of miR-382 in HCC tissues was down-regulated compared with the non-cancerous tissues. Over-expression of miR-382 could significantly inhibit the migration and invasion of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Bioinformatic algorithms and luciferase reporter assays suggested that Golgi Membrane Protein 1 (GOLM1) was a direct target of miR-382. Interestingly, we found the down-regulation of GOLM1 in HCC cells could rescue these cells from miR-382-mediated suppression of migration and invasion. Our findings might demonstrate that miR-382 inhibited the metastasis of HCC by targeting GOLM1. Furthermore, cox proportional hazards analyses suggested that low expression of miR-382 was an independent prognostic factor for the HCC patients. In conclusion, our results highlighted that miR-382, a novel prognostic factor, target GOLM1 to inhibit metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma.
