Objective:The purpose of this article is to review tumor staging systems for gastrointestinal tumors including pancreatic adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, small bowel adenocarcinoma, rectal carcinoma, and anal carcinoma and identify the key imaging findings ("tipping points"), which change patient management based on changes in tumor staging.Conclusion:For all malignant gastrointestinal tumors, there are key imaging findings ("tipping points") including tumor size, tumor extension, lymphadenopathy, vascular invasion, and distant metastasis that dictate patient management and prognosis, based on changes in tumor stage. In interpreting these imaging studies, radiologists should be cognizant of these "tipping points" to guide patient management.
