To explore the characteristics of localization and prognostic implication of Ezrin expression in HCC, 92 cases of HCC meeting strict follow-up criteria were selected for immunohistochemical staining of Ezrin protein. Correlations between Ezrin expression and clinicopathological features of HCC were evaluated using Chi-square tests, survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the relationship between prognostic factors and patient overallsurvival was analyzed using Cox proportional hazard analysis. In results, Ezrin protein was mainly expressed in the inner side of the cell membrane of the adjacent non tumor tissues, and diffusely expressed in cytoplasm of HCC tissues. There was an obviously difference between the benign and malignant tissues about the location of Ezrin expression. Ezrin strong-expression rates were significantly higher in HCC samples compared with the adjacent non tumor tissues (P<0.05). The Ezrin strong-expression rate was closely related with the differentiation (P<0.01), AJCC stage and metastasis of HCC (P<0.05, respectively). Therefore, the sub-cellular localization of Ezrin protein in the liver cells will be changed in the process of the transformation from the benign to malignant, and Ezrin plays an important role in the progression of HCC.
