DEP domain containing 1 (DEPDC1) protein is a novel oncoantigen upregulated in multiple types of cancers which present oncogenic activity and high immunogenicity. However, the function and therapeutic potential of DEPDC1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. In the present study, we showed that DEPDC1 was frequently upregulated in HCC and associated with cancer diagnosis and poor prognosis for HCC patients. Moreover, DEPDC1 promotes HCC cell proliferation in vitro as well as carcinogenesis in vivo. Notably, DEPDC1 overexpression also increases the neoplasm metastasis ability of HCC cells both in vivo and in vitro. Gene set enrichment analysis results showed that DEPDC1 expression is positively correlated with K-RAS signal pathway, pathways in cancer and WNT/Î²-catenin signal pathway, all of which are closely associated with specific cancer-related gene sets. Our study provides the basis for further investigation of the molecular mechanism by which DEPDC1 promotes the development and metastasis of HCC.
