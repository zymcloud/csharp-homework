Purpose:To evaluate the prevalence of major and ancillary imaging features from liver imaging reporting and data systems (LI-RADS) version 2014 and their interreader agreement when comparing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and combined tumor (cHCC-CC).Methods:The Institutional Review Board approved this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study and waived the requirement for patients' informed consent. Patients with resected HCC (n = 51), ICC (n = 40), and cHCC-CC (n = 11) and available pre-operative contrast-enhanced MRI were included from 2000 to 2015. Imaging features and final LI-RADS category were evaluated by four radiologists. Imaging features were compared by Fisher's exact test and interreader agreements were assessed by Îº statistics.Results:None of the features were unique to either HCC or non-HCC. Imaging features that were significantly more common among HCC compared to ICC and cHCC-CC included washout (76%-78% vs. 10%-35%, p Conclusion:HCC and non-HCC show significant differences in the prevalence of imaging features defined by LI-RADS, and are identified by radiologists with moderate interreader agreement. Using LI-RADS, radiologists also achieved moderate interreader agreement in the assignment of the LR-M category.
