Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a specialized form of ultrasound (US) performed with an intravenous injection of microbubble contrast agents. It has been successfully used for a variety of applications including characterization of liver tumors. In April 2014, the American College of Radiology (ACR) convened a working group of international experts to develop ACR CEUS Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (CEUS LI-RADS). An initial version of CEUS LI-RADS was published in August 2016. Although the CEUS LI-RADS concept and principles for liver lesion characterization, using dynamic contrast enhancement features, are similar to those for CT or MRI, there are significant differences between CT/MRI and CEUS LI-RADS. Therefore, CEUS LI-RADS has different diagnostic features and a unique characterization algorithm. The size of a lesion, the type and degree of arterial phase enhancement, the presence of washout, and the timing and degree of washout are the major features used for categorization. This paper describes key differences between CT/MRI and CEUS, and provides a diagnostic algorithm of CEUS LI-RADS with detailed, step-by-step instructions and imaging examples of CEUS LI-RADS categories.
