Background:We investigated an association between the levels of plasma microRNA (miRNA)-21, -26a, and -29a-3p and treatment outcomes following transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 198 patients with TACE-treated HCC were followed up for TACE refractoriness and liver transplantation (LT)-free survival. Pretreatment plasma miRNA-21, -26a, and -29a-3p levels were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.Results:During the mean follow-up of 22.3 (range, 0.7-79) months, 118 (59.6%) patients exhibited TACE refractoriness. Multivariate analyses showed that expression of a specific combination of miRNAs (miRNA-21 ≥ 2.5, miRNA-26a ≥ 1.5, and miRNA-29a-3p Conclusion:Combination of plasma miRNA-21, -26a, and -29a-3p expression could predict early TACE refractoriness in patients with TACE-treated HCC.
