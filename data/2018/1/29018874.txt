Introduction:Flavocoxid is a proprietary blend of two flavonoids, baicalin and catechin, and recent evidence has shown that bioflavonoids may exert antiviral activities. The potential antiviral activity of Flavocoxid against hepatitis B virus (HBV) was evaluated. Additionally, it was investigated if Flavocoxid used in combination with Entecavir could potentiate its anti-HBV activity.Materials and methods:Hepatoma cells replicating HBV were treated with Flavocoxid, or Entecavir alone or in combination for up to 5 days. Viral replicative intermediates, transcripts, and cccDNA levels were evaluated in HBV-replicating cells by real-time PCR, Southern and Northern blotting. Expression profiling was performed using TaqMan low-density arrays.Results:Flavocoxid treatment induced a reduction of HBV replicative intermediates, the amount of transcripts, and HBsAg levels. Flavocoxid and Entecavir combination therapy further decreased the amount of HBV replicative intermediates, compared to Flavocoxid alone. Importantly, Flavocoxid alone or in combination with Entecavir also induced a reduction of cccDNA. Gene-expression analysis showed that Flavocoxid activates type I IFNs-signaling and dampens the HBV-induced inflammatory response.Conclusions:Flavocoxid inhibits HBV replication by targeting multiple steps of viral life cycle. These results indicate that the antiviral activity of Entecavir is potentiated by Flavocoxid, suggesting that this medical food might be considered as an adjuvant for anti-HBV therapy.
