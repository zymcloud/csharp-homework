Background:Although the role of staging laparoscopy (SL) in detecting radiologically occult M1 disease has been widely recognized, it is seldom used in China and its clinical value based on Chinese population has been rarely reported. The aim of this study is to identify the yield of SL for Chinese patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC) and determine the proportions of patients in whom treatment plan is altered.Materials and methods:The clinical data were retrospectively collected from 879 AGC patients who underwent SL without any definite signs of disseminated disease on imaging examination. The primary outcomes were the proportions of patients whose laparoscopy identified incurable factors (including M1 diseases and unresectable T4b diseases), and who had their treatment plan altered.Results:SL revealed incurable factors in 130 (14.8%) patients, including macroscopic peritoneal metastasis (n = 92), positive peritoneal cytology (n = 10), liver metastasis (n = 12), para-aortic lymph node metastasis (n = 1), and unresectable T4b tumor (n = 18). After SL, treatment plans were altered in 123 (14.0%) patients, among which 82 (63.1%) patients were not offered any further procedure and referred for chemotherapy. Among 749 M0 patients who immediately proceeded to radical gastrectomy after SL, new incurable factors were found at subsequent operations in 21 (2.8%) patients. Multivariate analysis showed that tumor size â‰¥8 cm, Borrmann type III and IV, and tumor invasion of T4a and T4b in preoperative imaging examination were the predictive factors for peritoneal metastasis.Conclusions:SL detects additional incurable factors in Chinese AGC patients with potentially resectable disease and optimizes their treatments. A systematic and painstaking inspection of the whole abdominal cavity, including routine entry into the bursa omentalis, is necessary for improving the yield of SL.
