Cirrhosis is the end result of chronic liver damage, associated with altered serum biomarkers and lipid profile. However, only few studies regarding serum biomarkers and plasma lipid profile in non-alcoholic liver cirrhosis subjects have been undertaken in Pakistan. This study aimed to evaluate the degree of alterations of tumor markers and lipid profile in liver cirrhosis patients and in normal healthy individuals. Levels of serological markers and plasma lipid pattern was measured in liver cirrhosis patients and in sex and age matched normal healthy individuals (n=46). Tumor marker alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was measured by ELISA, whereas plasma lipid profile and biomarker alanine aminotr ansferase (ALT) was determined by colorimetric assays. In patients with cirrhosis significant increase was observed in serum AFP and ALT levels when compared with healthy individuals (p
