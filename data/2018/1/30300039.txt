Purpose:Previous studies have reported that parameters of dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (DCE-US) could predict prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after antiangiogenic therapies. In this study, we aimed to investigate the correlation of DCE-US parameters and the prognosis of HCC patients after microwave ablation (MWA).Materials and methods:Between June 2012 and January 2018, a total of 35 HCC patients who received MWA with a curative intent were enrolled. Pre-ablation DCE-US, liver biopsy, CD34 staining, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) staining were performed. DCE-US parameters were extracted from time-intensity curves using SonoLiver software. The correlation of DCE-US parameters with histopathology results and overall survival (OS) were investigated.Results:Quantitative analysis showed that IMAX, RT, TTP, and mTT of HCC were statistically different with that of reference liver parenchyma (all p ＜ .001). Microvessel density was shown to be positively correlated with IMAX and negatively correlated with TTP (r = 0.755 and -0.647, both p ＜ .01). Additionally, positive correlations were observed between IMAX and VEGF expression (r = 0.665, p ＜ .01). After a median follow-up of 22 months (range 6-64 months), local recurrence was detected in three patients. Largest diameter and TTP were shown to help predict OS in univariate and multivariate analyses.Conclusion:DCE-US parameter may help predict the outcome of HCC patients after MWA, though further study is still needed.
