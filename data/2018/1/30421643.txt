Background:Chronic infection with hepatitis B (HBV) and C virus (HCV) is linked with a pro-inflammatory state, predisposing to cirrhosis and liver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A role for Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling in hepatocarcinogenesis was recently documented. We hypothesised a link TLR3 and TLR4 polymorphisms and HCC, as surrogates for the significance of TLR signalling in the promotion and initiation of HCC.Materials and methods:We recruited 174 HCV-infected patients, 100 HBV-infected patients and 360 healthy control subjects. TLR3 (rs3775290) and TLR4 (rs4986790) genotyping was done by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP), LFTs and AFP by standard routine techniques. Liver fibrosis was assessed clinically by the Fibrotest and Actitest.Result:The TLR3 rs3775290 minor T genotype was linked with increased risk of chronic HBV (P = 0.05) and HCV (P = 0.031) infection. The TLR4 rs4986790 minor G genotype was linked with significantly increased risk for HBV/HCV chronic infection (P Conclusion:TLR3 and TLR4 polymorphisms are promising biomarkers of liver cirrhosis and cancer associated with HBV and HCV infection.
