Recent studies have revealed that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in the tumorigenesis of human cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In present study, we screen the circular RNA expression profiles in HCC tissue and investigate the molecular roles on HCC tumorigenesis. Human circRNA microarray analysis showed there were total 1,245 differently expressed circular RNAs, including 756 up-regulated circRNAs and 489 down-regulated circRNAs, in three pairs of HCC tissue and adjacent normal tissue. Hsa_circ_0016788 was identified to be up-regulated in both HCC tissue and cell lines. Loss-of-functional experiments in vivo and vitro revealed that hsa_circ_0016788 silencing inhibited the proliferation, invasion and promoted the apoptosis in vitro, and inhibited the tumor growth in vivo. Bioinformatics tools and luciferase reporter assay validated that miR-486 targeted hsa_circ_0016788 and CDK4 accompanying with negatively correlated expression, suggesting the hsa_circ_0016788/miR-486/CDK4 pathway. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that hsa_circ_0016788 had high diagnostic value (AUC = 0.851). In summary, results reveal the role of hsa_circ_0016788/miR-486/CDK4 in HCC tumorigenesis, providing a novel therapeutic target for HCC.
