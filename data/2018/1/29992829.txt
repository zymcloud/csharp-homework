Many cruciferous vegetables, including cabbage, contain indole-3-carbinol (I3C), which is a known anticarcinogen. However, the anticarcinogenic effects of I3C on liver cancer have not been investigated. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the anticarcinogenic effects of I3C in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) SNU449 cells. The results of MTT and WST-1 assays indicated that treatment of SNU449 cells with I3C decreased viability in dose- and time-dependent manners, while colony formation assays indicated that I3C also inhibited proliferation of SNU449 cells. Moreover, fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis showed that I3C induced apoptosis in SNU449 cells in dose- and time-dependent manners. Furthermore, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling revealed that I3C induced DNA fragmentation in SNU449 cells in a time-dependent manner, while Western blotting showed that apoptotic proteins such as p53, cleaved PARP, caspase-3, and caspase-7 were activated in SNU449 cells following treatment with I3C. Finally, reactive oxygen species-related protein peroxiredoxin-1 and thioredoxin-1 expression decreased in I3C-treated SNU449 cells. The aim of our study is to investigate the unknown mechanisms responsible for the apoptotic effects of I3C on human HCC SNU449 cells, and the results suggest that I3C may be useful for the prevention and treatment of liver cancer.
