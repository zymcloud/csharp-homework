Background:Postoperative liver failure remains the main complication and predominant cause of hepatectomy-related mortality for patients undergoing liver resection.Aim:Our aim is to investigate whether immediate postoperative Fibrosis-4 could predict postoperative liver failure.Methods:We retrospectively enrolled 1353 consecutive hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing radical resection. The characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared between patients with high and low immediate postoperative Fibrosis-4. Risk factors for hepatic failure were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis.Results:Using a receiver operating characteristic curve, immediate postoperative Fibrosis-4 showed good prediction ability for postoperative liver failure (AUROC=0.647, PConclusions:Immediate postoperative Fibrosis-4 showed good prediction ability for postoperative liver failure, and required measure should be taken to prevent liver failure when high postoperative Fibrosis-4 appeared.
