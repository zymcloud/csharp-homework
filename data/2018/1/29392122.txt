Background:To compare the outcomes of liver resection (LR) with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 122 HBV-related small HCC patients who underwent LR (n=64) or RFA (n=58) were involved in this retrospective study. Their basic clinical data, postoperative complications, survival outcomes, and prognostic factors were compared and analyzed.Results:Patients in the LR group had more serious complications (11 versus 0) and longer postoperative hospital stays (11.3 versus 6.0 days) than those in the RFA group (all P<0.05). LR was associated with better recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates at 1, 3, and 5 years compared with RFA (90.4%, 65.9%, and 49.5% versus 79.3%, 50.3%, and 35.6%, P=0.037), but there was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) (95.2%, 78.1%, 58.6% versus 93.1%, 71.3%, 52.9%, P=0.309). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that the hepatic cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.13), tumor number (HR: 3.73), tumor diameter (HR: 1.92), and postoperative anti-HBV therapy (HR: 0.53) had predictive values for RFS, and the latter three (HR: 4.34, 2.30, and 0.44) were independent predictors of OS (all P<0.05).Conclusion:LR might be considered the preferred method for patients with HBV-related small HCC, while RFA could apply to selective cases. Anti-HBV therapy after treatment was recommended.
