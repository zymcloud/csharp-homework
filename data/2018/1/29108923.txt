This study quantitatively assessed serum insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) promoter methylation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and explored its clinical value. A total of 80 patients with hepatitis B virus-associated HCC, 35 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and 20 healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. MethyLight was used to quantitatively assess the methylation levels of serum IGFBP7 promoter. A logistic regression model was established for the combined evaluation of AFP and serum IGFBP7 promoter methylation. The results showed that mean methylation levels of serum IGFBP7 promoter were significantly higher in HCC (5.33%, interquartile range [IQR] 1.14-15.70%) patients than in individuals with CHB (1.54%, IQR 0.64-2.45%; P3cm and advanced tumor node metastasis (TNM) showed higher methylation levels compared with the remaining groups (P
