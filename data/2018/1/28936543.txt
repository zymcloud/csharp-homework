Ultrasound is the most widely used imaging tool for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening and surveillance. Until now, this method has lacked standardized guidelines for interpretation, reporting, and management recommendations [1-5]. To address this need, the American College of Radiology (ACR) has developed the Ultrasound Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (US LI-RADS) algorithm. The proposed algorithm has two components: detection scores and visualization scores. The detection score guides management and has three categories: US-1 Negative, US-2 Subthreshold, and US-3 Positive. The visualization score informs the expected sensitivity of the ultrasound examination and also has three categories: Visualization A: No or minimal limitations; Visualization B: Moderate limitations; and Visualization C: Severe limitations. Standardization in ultrasound utilization, reporting, and management in high-risk individuals has the capacity to improve communication with patients and referring physicians, unify screening and surveillance algorithms, impact outcomes, and supply quantitative data for future research.
