A 73-year-old woman with chief complaint of macroscopic hematuria was diagnosed as having left renal tumor with pancreatic invasion. Nephrectomy was performed. Pathological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma, pT3a. Three months after the operation, liver metastasis appeared and sunitinib was started. Most of the liver metastases disappeared; however, a new lesion appeared, and sunitinib was switched to axitinib, which was effective on the residual lesion, but the new lesion had poor response. Transarterial chemoembolization was performed to treat the liver metastases, and all metastatic lesions disappeared. There was no recurrence at 2 years, and axitinib was discontinued.
