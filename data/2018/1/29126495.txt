Today, most head and neck cancer subsites, such as the larynx, hypopharynx, nasopharynx, and oropharynx, are treated with radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy as a primary treatment modality. Surgery is reserved for the salvage of recurrent tumors that occur within the head and neck in the absence of distant (ie, lung, liver) metastasis. However, unlike all other head and neck subsites, oral cancer should ideally be managed with primary surgery with the possibility of adjuvant radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy depending on the presence of certain high-risk pathologic features.
