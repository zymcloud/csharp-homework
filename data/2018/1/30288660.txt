Background:Liver fibrosis can progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or liver failure. Unfortunately, the antifibrotic agents are limited. Thrombin activates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Therefore, we investigated the effects of a direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, on liver fibrosis.Methods:Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with thioacetamide (TAA, 200 mg/kg twice per week) for 8 or 12 weeks to induce liver fibrosis. The injured rats were assigned an oral gavage of dabigatran etexilate (30 mg/kg/day) or vehicle in the last 4 weeks of TAA administration. Rats receiving an injection of normal saline and subsequent oral gavage of dabigatran etexilate or vehicle served as controls.Results:In the 8-week TAA-injured rats, dabigatran ameliorated fibrosis, fibrin deposition, and phosphorylated ERK1/2 in liver, without altering the transcript expression of thrombin receptor protease-activated receptor-1. In vitro, dabigatran inhibited thrombin-induced HSC activation. Furthermore, dabigatran reduced intrahepatic angiogenesis and portal hypertension in TAA-injured rats. Similarly, in the 12-week TAA-injured rats, a 4-week treatment with dabigatran reduced liver fibrosis and portal hypertension.Conclusions:By inhibiting thrombin action, dabigatran reduced liver fibrosis and intrahepatic angiogenesis. Dabigatran may be a promising therapeutic agent for treatment of liver fibrosis.
