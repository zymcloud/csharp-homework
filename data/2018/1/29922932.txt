Purpose:To determine the feasibility of pre-TACE IVIM imaging based on histogram analysis for predicting prognosis in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Fifty-five patients prospectively underwent 1.5T MRI 1 week before TACE. Histogram metrics for IVIM parameters and ADCs maps between responders and non-responders with mRECIST assessment were compared. Kaplan-Meier, log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazard regression model were used to correlate variables with time to progression (TTP).Results:Mean (p = 0.022), median (p = 0.043), and 25th percentile (p < 0.001) of perfusion fraction (PF), mean (p < 0.001), median (p < 0.001), 25th percentile (p < 0.001) and 75th percentile (p = 0.001) of ADC(0,500), mean (p = 0.005), median (p = 0.008) and 25th percentile (p = 0.039) of ADCtotal were higher, while skewness and kurtosis of PF (p = 0.001, p = 0.005, respectively), kurtosis of ADC(0,500) and ADCtotal (p = 0.005, p = 0.001, respectively) were lower in responders compared to non-responders. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that mRECIST was associated with TTP independently, and kurtosis of ADCtotal had the best predictive performance for disease progression.Conclusion:Pre-TACE kurtosis of ADCtotal is the best independent predictor for TTP.Key points:• mRECIST was associated with TTP independently. • Lower kurtosis and higher mean for ADCs tend to have good response. • Pre-TACE kurtosis of ADC total is the best independent predictor for TTP.
