Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has been reported to have high rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence compared with deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT). This has been assumed to be due to the frequent use of small-for-size grafts (SFSGs) in LDLT rather than DDLT, but the relationship between graft size and prognosis remains controversial. This study aimed to clarify the effect of SFSGs on the oncologic outcomes of patients with HCC who underwent LDLT. Between January 2005 and December 2015, 597 consecutive patients underwent LDLT. Among these patients, those with HCC who underwent LDLT were randomly matched at a 1:3 ratio (graft-to-recipient body weight ratio [GRWR] 0.8%) according to propensity score. HCC recurrence and patient survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. In addition, stratified subgroup analysis based on the Milan criteria was performed. SFSG was defined as a GRWR
