There are many factors participating in the process of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence and development. In this study, romoted cell invasion and migration in vitro and in vivo. In contrary, inhibition of Rab5a suppressed cell invasion and migration. Mechanistic studies revealed that Rab5a was positively regulated cell division cycle 42we found that Rab5a expression was higher in the HCC tissues and 3 cell lines than normal liver tissues. Overexpression of Rab5a p (Cdc42) expression by enhancing its promoter activity. These data suggested that Rab5a is highly expressed in HCC, and promote the invasion and migration by targeting Cdc42 expression.
