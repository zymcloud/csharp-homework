Background: While curative resection is the established strategy for Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, the prognosis still remains poor, and the efficiency of existing prediction models is unsatisfactory. Therefore, we aimed to develop a credible and easy-to-use prognostic index for patients with HCC undergoing curative therapy. Methods: A total of 768 patients with HCC, who underwent curative resection from December 2010 to June 2012 in Zhongshan Hospital, were divided into a training cohort with 616 patients and a validating cohort of 152 patients at a ratio of 4 to 1 by random allocation. Then, a retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify effective prognostic indexes. Results: FC-score, which incorporates fibrinogen and C-reactive protein, was established. In the multivariate analysis for OS and RFS, FC-score has shown to be a significant independent prognostic index in both the training cohort and validation cohort. Furthermore, the C-index of the FC-score for OS and RFS were 0.698 and 0.594 respectively, which were superior to other inflammation systems such as IBI, IBS, and GPS. Then, we developed a novel nomogram, which integrated FC-score into the conventional BCLC staging system. This new nomogram gave rise to a new C-index of 0.746 (95%CI: 0.743-0.749) for OS, and 0.654 (95%CI: 0.652-0.656) for RFS. The calibration curve and decision curve analysis indicated that our nomogram was highly consistent between predicted and actual observations. Conclusions: FC-score represents a novel, convenient, reliable, and accurate prognostic predictor for both OS and RFS in HCC patients undergoing curative therapy.
