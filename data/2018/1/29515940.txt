Gallbladder (GB) carcinomas are adenocarcinomas (AC) in the majority of cases. Adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) and pure squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the gallbladder are rarely encountered and comprise 1-3% of gallbladder cancer cases. Pure squamous cell carcinoma of the gallbladder is rarer with less than 1% of the incidence. Most of the published literature is based on case reports and case series. The survival rates of ASC and SCC of the gallbladder are significantly lower (mean of five months) compared to the AC of the gallbladder (mean survival of 11.4 months). Most of these lesions are advanced at presentation, rendering them unresectable and resulting in a poor prognosis. However, if the lesions are diagnosed at an early stage, they could potentially be resectable. We report one such rare case of pure SCC GB presenting as a hepatic mass. The patient subsequently underwent resection of the gallbladder and liver mass with complete recovery and is currently planned for chemotherapy and radiation treatment.
