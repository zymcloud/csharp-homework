Intact N-glycopeptide analysis remains challenging due to the complexity of glycopeptide structures, low abundance of glycopeptides in protein digests, and difficulties in data interpretation/quantitation. Herein, we developed a workflow that involved advanced methodologies, the EThcD-MS/MS fragmentation method and data interpretation software, for differential analysis of the microheterogeneity of site-specific intact N-glycopeptides of serum haptoglobin between early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver cirrhosis. Haptoglobin was immunopurified from 20 Î¼L of serum in patients with early HCC, liver cirrhosis, and healthy controls, respectively, followed by trypsin/GluC digestion, glycopeptide enrichment, and LC-EThcD-MS/MS analysis. Identification and differential quantitation of site-specific N-glycopeptides were performed using a combination of Byonic and Byologic software. In total, 93, 87, and 68 site-specific N-glycopeptides were identified in early HCC, liver cirrhosis, and healthy controls, respectively, with high confidence. The increased variety of N-glycopeptides in liver diseases compared to healthy controls was due to increased branching with hyper-fucosylation and sialylation. Differential quantitation analysis showed that 5 site-specific N-glycopeptides on sites N184 and N241 were significantly elevated in early HCC compared to cirrhosis ( p
