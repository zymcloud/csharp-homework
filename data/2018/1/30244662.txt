The rs937283 variant, locating in murine double minute 2 promoter region, has been previously reported to potentially alter the promoter activity and to influence cancer susceptibility. In this study, we investigated the association of murine double minute 2 rs937283 variant and cancer susceptibility in a central Chinese population, followed by a meta-analysis. A total of 1058 healthy controls, 480 patients with breast cancer, 384 patients with cervical cancer, 480 patients with liver cancer, 426 patients with colon cancer, and 361 patients with rectal cancer were recruited in this case-control study. The murine double minute 2 rs937283 was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism and confirmed by sequencing. Our case-control analysis revealed that rs937283 was associated with the susceptibility to breast and liver cancer, but not cervical, colon, or rectal cancer. Specifically, the G allele of rs937283 conferred a significantly increased risk of breast and liver cancer. Moreover, results of meta-analysis demonstrated that rs937283 was significantly associated with cancer susceptibility, and this significant association remained in Asian (Chinese) population, but not in Caucasian population. Collectively, the murine double minute 2 rs937283 variant may serve as a potential biomarker for cancer predisposition in Chinese population.
