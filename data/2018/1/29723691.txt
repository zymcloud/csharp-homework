The burden of chronic liver disease has increased exponentially, driving more patients toward orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) evaluation.1 Because of limited access to transplant centers, patients often travel long distances to be evaluated for OLT.2 Liver transplantation in the VA system is offered at 6 Veterans Affairs transplant centers (VATCs) across the United States, including Richmond. To increase access to specialty care, the VA introduced the Specialty Care Access Network-Extension of Community Healthcare Outcomes (SCAN-ECHO) program,3,4 which was designed to transfer subspecialty knowledge to primary care physicians. In 2011, the Richmond VA introduced SCAN-ECHO for gastroenterology/hepatology providers to facilitate case-based distance learning combined with real-time consultation in hepatology, and the opportunity for an initial triage without completing a formal transplant evaluation. We studied the role of SCAN-ECHO in triaging OLT evaluations and the utility of this health care delivery in the field of transplantation.
