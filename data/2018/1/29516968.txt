Objective:The objective of this study is to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture and multiple acupoint stimulation in relieving cancer pain in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Sixty-five cases of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with cancer pain were selected in our hospital and were divided into electroacupuncture multiple acupoint stimulation group (electroacupuncture group) (n = 32) and fentanyl transdermal patch analgesia group (control group) (n = 33) according to analgesic methods and intentions. In the electroacupuncture group, electric acupuncture treatment was administered at different acupoints, including Baihui, Quchi, Neiguan, Xuehai, Zusanli, and Sanyinjiao acupoint, once a day for 7 days. In the control group, a fentanyl transdermal patch was placed on the upper left arm every 3 days and replaced with a continuous external paste once for 7 days. Pain scores in the two groups before and during the treatment were evaluated with a visual analog scale (VAS), and adverse reactions during the treatment were recorded.Results:The VAS pain score of the electroacupuncture group was significantly decreased on day 3 (P 0.05) between the two groups 4 days after treatment. For treatment-related side effects, there were 3 cases of subcutaneous hemorrhage in the electroacupuncture group; 1 case of skin rashes and 3 cases of nausea and vomiting in the control group. The incidences of adverse reactions in the two groups were 9.4% and 12.1%, respectively, without significant difference (P > 0.05).Conclusion:Cancer pain in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma can be alleviated with electroacupuncture and multiple acupoint stimulation, but the onset pain relief was slow. To improve the analgesic effects of this technique, the combination of various analgesic methods should be necessary in early stage of the treatment.
