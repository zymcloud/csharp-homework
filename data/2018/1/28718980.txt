Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, mainly because of its poor prognosis. A valid mechanism-based prognostic biomarker is urgently needed. γ-hydroxy-1,N2 -propanodeoxyguanosine (γ-OHPdG) is an endogenously formed mutagenic DNA adduct derived from lipid peroxidation. We examined the relationship of γ-OHPdG with hepatocarcinogenesis in two animal models and its potential role as a prognostic biomarker for recurrence in HCC patients. Bioassays were conducted in xeroderma pigmentosum group A knockout mice and diethylnitrosamine-injected mice, both prone to HCC development. γ-OHPdG levels in the livers of these animals were determined. The effects of antioxidant treatments on γ-OHPdG and hepatocarcinogenesis were examined. Using two independent sets of HCC specimens from patients, we examined the relationship between γ-OHPdG and survival or recurrence-free survival. γ-OHPdG levels in liver DNA showed an age-dependent increase and consistently correlated with HCC development in all three animal models. Theaphenon E treatment significantly decreased γ-OHPdG levels in the liver DNA of xeroderma pigmentosum group A knockout mice and remarkably reduced HCC incidence in these mice to 14% from 100% in the controls. It also effectively inhibited HCC development in the diethylnitrosamine-injected mice. Using clinical samples from two groups of patients, our study revealed that higher levels of γ-OHPdG are strongly associated with low survival (P < 0.0001) and low recurrence-free survival (P = 0.007).Conclusion:These results support γ-OHPdG as a mechanism-based, biologically relevant biomarker for predicting the risk of HCC and its recurrence.
