Background & aims:HIV/HCV co-infected patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have poorer survival than HCV mono-infected patients. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic factors for survival.Methods:From 2006 to 2013, 55 incident HCCs among HIV+/HCV+ patients, from three ANRS cohorts, were compared with 181 HCCs in HIV-/HCV+ patients from the ANRS Cirvir cohort.Results:HIV+/HCV+ patients were younger (50 years [IQR: 47-53] vs 62 [54-70], P Conclusions:The radiological aggressiveness of the tumour is the best prognostic factor associated with poorer survival of HCC in HIV+/HCV+ patients. High Î±-foetoprotein level and decompensated cirrhosis are other ones. This justifies a particular attention to the detection and the management of small nodules in this high-risk population.
