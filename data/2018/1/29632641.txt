Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a local-ablative therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). At present, there is no predictive marker for RFA treatment outcomes. This work aimed to valuate myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1 (MEIS-1) in predicting post-RFA treatment outcomes of unresectable HCC patients. The time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) of 81 HCC patients who received RFA treatment were measured. The protein level of MEIS-1 in tumor specimens was measured by western blot. The role of MEIS-1 in RFA-treating HCC in vivo growth nude mouse model was examined via PET/CT imaging. Higher level of MEIS-1 in tumor tissue is associated with better RFA treatment outcomes. The median TTP was 9.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.8-11.3) months in patients with high MEIS-1 expression (n = 43) versus 6.0 (95% CI: 4.6-7.4) months in patients with low MEIS-1 expression (n = 38). Moreover, in rodent HCC model we found overexpression of MEIS-1 enhanced the anti-tumor effect of RFA treatment. We conclude that high level of MEIS-1 expression predicts better RFA treatment outcome in HCC.
