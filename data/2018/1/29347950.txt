Background:Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) has an abundance of tumor stroma which plays an important role in cancer progression via tumor-promoting signals. This study aims to explore the microRNA (miRNA) profile of CCA-associated fibroblasts (CCFs) and the roles of any identified miRNAs in CCA progression.Methods:miRNA expression profiles of CCFs and normal skin fibroblasts were compared by microarray. Identified downregulated miRNAs and their target genes were confirmed by real-time PCR. Their binding was confirmed by a luciferase reporter assay. The effects of conditioned-media (CM) of miRNA mimic- and antagonist-transfected CCFs were tested in CCA migration in wound healing assays. Finally, the levels of miRNA and their target genes were examined by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry in clinical CCA samples.Results:miR-15a was identified as a downregulated miRNA in CCFs. Moreover, PAI-2 was identified as a novel target gene of miR-15a. Recombinant PAI-2 promoted migration of CCA cells. Moreover, CM from miR-15a mimic-transfected CCFs suppressed migration of CCA cells. Lower expression of miR-15a and higher expression of PAI-2 were observed in human CCA samples compared with normal liver tissues. Importantly, PAI-2 expression correlated with poor prognosis in CCA patients.Conclusions:These findings highlight the miR-15a/PAI-2 axis as a potential therapeutic target in CCA patients.
