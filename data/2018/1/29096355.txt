Among the first found cancer-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), MALAT1 is one that involves in the development and progression of some tumors. MALAT1 can be aberrantly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma, cervical, breast, ovarian cancers, as well as colorectal cancer. The paper aims to make certain the function of MALAT1 in human choriocarcinoma cell lines by investigating the detailed effects and molecular mechanisms. Being specifically upregulated in choriocarcinoma cell lines, the under-researched lncRNA-MALAT1 promoted choriocarcinoma cell growth by targeting miR-218. After MALAT1 knockdown, proliferation of human choriocarcinoma cell in vitro was dramatically hindered, and the tumor size in vivo was reduced. What is more, miR-218-mediated Fbxw8 regulation was required for MALAT1-induced choriocarcinoma cell proliferation. Taken together, MALAT1 might promote choriocarcinoma tumor growth through miR-218-mediated Fbxw8 regulation. According to our data, MALAT1 might be an oncogenic lncRNA that promoted choriocarcinoma proliferation and could be therapeutically targeted in human choriocarcinoma.
