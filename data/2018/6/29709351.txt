Backgroud:Wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 5a (Wnt5a) is involved in carcinogenesis. However, little data are available in Wnt5a signaling with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we investigated the expression of hepatic Wnt5a in HCC and the role of Wnt5a in HCC progression and outcome.Methods:Wnt5a expression and cellular distribution in HCCs and their matched paracancerous tissues from 87 patients were analyzed with tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry and compared with hepatic Wnt3a signaling. Wnt5a expression was categorized into low or high based on immunohistochemistry. Overall survival rate of HCC patients was estimated in correlation with the hepatic Wnt5a level using Kaplan-Meier method; the survival difference between patients with low and those with high Wnt5a was compared with log-rank test; and prognostic analysis was carried out with Cox regression.Results:Total incidence of Wnt5a expression in the HCC tissues was 70.1%, which was significantly lower (χ2 = 13.585, P < 0.001) than that in their paracancerous tissues (88.5%). Significant difference of Wnt5a intensity was found between HCC and their paracancerous tissues (Z = 8.463, P < 0.001). Wnt5a intensity was inversely correlated with Wnt3a signaling (r = -0.402, P < 0.001) in HCC tissues. A decrease of Wnt5a expression in relation to the clinical staging from stage I to IV and low or no staining at advanced HCC were observed. Wnt5a level was related to periportal embolus (χ2 = 11.069, P < 0.001), TNM staging (χ2 = 8.852, P < 0.05), 5-year survival (χ2 = 4.961, P < 0.05), and confirmed as an independent prognosis factor of HCC patients (hazard ratio: 1.957; 95% confidence interval: 1.109-3.456; P < 0.05).Conclusions:The decrease of hepatic Wnt5a signaling is associated with HCC progression and poor prognosis.
