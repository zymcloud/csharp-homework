Background:Studies comparing microwave ablation (MWA) and liver resection are lacking. This study evaluates the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with liver resection or MWA and the role of Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) score in patient selection for treatments.Methods:This is a retrospective analysis of patients who received curative liver resection or MWA for HCC. Propensity score matching was used at a 1:1 ratio. The value of ALBI grade for patient selection was evaluated. Overall and disease-free survival were compared between two groups.Results:Of the 442 patients underwent MWA or liver resection for HCC during the study period, 63 patients received MWA and 379 patients received liver resection. Propensity scoring matching analysis resulted in 63 matched pairs for further analysis. Subgroup analysis according to the ALBI grade was performed. Liver resection offered better overall and disease-free survivals in patients with ALBI grade 1. MWA provided a significantly better overall survival (p = 0.025) and a trend towards better disease-free survival (p = 0.39) in patients with ALBI grade 2 or 3.Conclusions:Liver resection offered superior disease-free survival to MWA in patients with HCC. The ALBI grade could identify patients with worse liver function who might gain survival advantage from MWA.
