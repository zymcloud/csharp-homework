The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) plays an important role in mediating dioxins toxicity. Currently, genes of P450 families are major research interests in studies on AhR-mediated gene alterations caused by dioxins. Genes related to other metabolic pathways or processes may be also responsive to dioxin exposures. Amino acid transporter B0AT1 (encoded by SLC6A19) plays a decisive role in neutral amino acid transport which is present in kidney, intestine and liver. However, effects of dioxins on its expression are still unknown. In the present study, we focused on the effects of dioxin and dioxin-like compounds on SLC6A19 expression in HepG2 cells. We identified SLC6A19 as a novel putative target gene of AhR activation in HepG2 cells. 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) increased the expression of SLC6A19 in time- and concentration-dependent manners. Using AhR antagonist CH223191 and/or siRNA assays, we demonstrated that certain AhR agonists upregulated SLC6A19 expression via AhR, including TCDD, 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD), 2,3,4,7,8- pentachlorodibenzofuran (2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF) and PCB126. In addition, the expression of B0AT1 was also significantly induced by TCDD in HepG2 cells. Our study suggested that dioxins might affect the transcription and translation of SLC6A19 in HepG2 cells, which might be a novel putative gene to assess dioxins' toxicity in amino acid transport and metabolism in liver.
