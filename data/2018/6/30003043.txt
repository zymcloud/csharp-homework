Pazopanib is an orally bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitor anticancer drug approved worldwide for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Here we report the case of a patient whose recurrent retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma showed a drastic reduction immediately after pazopanib administration accompanied by severe liver dysfunction. His liver function was restored conservatively by giving him hepatoprotectors and having him stop taking pazopanib. The recurrent tumor disappeared but by 4 months later had regrown.
