Percutaneous liver ablation has become a cornerstone of the recently developed subspecialty of radiology - that is, interventional oncology. Thermal ablation technology has evolved rapidly during the past decades, with substantial technical and procedural improvements that can help obtain better clinical outcomes and safety profiles. Due to the widespread use of percutaneous ablation, a comprehensive review of the methodologic and technical considerations seems to be mandatory. This article summarizes the expert discussion and report from Mediterranean Interventional Oncology Live Congress (MIOLive 2017) that was held in Rome, Italy, integrating evidence-reported literature and experience-based perceptions, to assist not only residents and fellows who are training in interventional radiology but also practicing colleagues who are approaching to this locoregional treatment.
