Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major health concern and the prevalence continues to increase in many industrialized and developing countries around the world. NAFLD affects adults and children. NAFLD-related cirrhosis is expected to become the top indication for liver transplantation in the near future, and the incidence of NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma is also increasing. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is the more severe form of NAFLD. The pathogenesis of NALFD/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is complex and new concepts continue to evolve. The diagnosis and categorization of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis currently rests on hepatopathologists. Accurate morphologic interpretation is important for therapeutic, prognostic, and investigational purposes.
