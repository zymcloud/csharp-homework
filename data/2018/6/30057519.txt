Drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) is a well-established, minimally invasive interventional treatment for nonresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Generally, TACE is regarded as safe and effective with a low complication rate. However, remote gastrointestinal ischemia due to the carryover of embolic material into visceral arteries is a rare but serious complication of TACE. In this report, we present a case of duodenal ulceration with contained perforation and severe necrotizing pancreatitis after TACE in a patient with nonresectable HCC and underlying hepatitis C virus associated with Child-Pugh stage B liver cirrhosis. This patient showed, for the first time, complete endoscopic and clinical recovery within 2 months of conservative treatment. Considering the high mortality rate from surgical intervention in all previously reported patients, the significant recovery potential demonstrated by our case suggests conservative treatment with antibiotics and parenteral nutrition combined with close clinical, radiological, and endoscopic monitoring should be considered in all clinically stable patients without signs of peritonism or septic sequelae.
