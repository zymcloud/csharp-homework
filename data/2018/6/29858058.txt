The CRISPR-associated Cas9 system can modulate disease-causing alleles both in vivo and ex vivo, raising the possibility of therapeutic genome editing. In addition to gene targeting, epigenetic modulation by the catalytically inactive dCas9 may also be a potential form of cancer therapy. Granulin (GRN), a potent pluripotent mitogen and growth factor that promotes cancer progression by maintaining self-renewal of hepatic stem cancer cells, is upregulated in hepatoma tissues and is associated with decreased tumor survival in patients with hepatoma. We synthesized a group of dCas9 epi-suppressors to target GRN by tethering the C terminus of dCas9 with three epigenetic suppressor genes: DNMT3a (DNA methyltransferase), EZH2 (histone 3 lysine 27 methyltransferase), and KRAB (the Kr√ºppel-associated box transcriptional repression domain). In conjunction with guide RNAs (gRNAs), the dCas9 epi-suppressors caused significant decreases in GRN mRNA abundance in Hep3B hepatoma cells. These dCas9 epi-suppressors initiated de novo CpG DNA methylation in the GRN promoter, and they produced histone codes that favor gene suppression, including decreased H3K4 methylation, increased H3K9 methylation, and enhanced HP1a binding. Epigenetic knockdown of GRN led to the inhibition of cell proliferation, decreased tumor sphere formation, and reduced cell invasion. These changes were achieved at least partially through the MMP/TIMP pathway. This study thus demonstrates the potential utility of using dCas9 epi-suppressors in the development of epigenetic targeting against tumors.
