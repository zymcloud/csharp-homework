While surgical resection represents the standard potentially curative therapy for liver cancer, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has evolved as a standard therapy for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as liver metastases. However, it is still not fully understood which patients particularly benefit from TACE. Cytokines represent a broad category of signaling molecules that might reflect concomitant inflammation as an adverse prognostic factor. Here, we evaluated the role of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and CC-chemokine ligand (CCL)22 as biomarkers in the context of TACE treatment. Cytokine serum levels were analyzed by multiplex immunoassay in 54 patients (HCC: n = 44, liver metastases: n = 10) undergoing TACE as well as 51 healthy controls. Patients with primary and secondary liver cancer showed significantly elevated levels of IL-6 and IL-8 but not CCL22 compared to healthy controls. Interestingly, low pre-interventional levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were predictors for an objective response after TACE in binary logistic regression. In contrast, patients with high pre-interventional IL-6 and IL-8 serum levels not only poorly responded to TACE but had a significantly impaired overall survival. Serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8 represent promising biomarkers for patients undergoing TACE and might help to pre-interventionally identify patients who particularly benefit from TACE regarding objective treatment response and overall survival.
