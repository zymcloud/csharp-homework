Lung transplantation (LT) is the standard therapeutic option for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with end-stage lung disease. Both conditions lead to extrarespiratory complications, such as diabetes, renal insufficiency, bone disease, and cancer. The purpose of this study was to provide an update of the nonrespiratory comorbidities following LT in adult patients with CF and their specificities regarding their multisystemic underlying condition despite their younger age compared to other patients undergoing LT. Diabetes, renal insufficiency, metabolic bone disease, hypertension, liver disease, and cancer are the comorbidities considered in this review. The increase in CF adults living with a lung transplant justifies an update of knowledge for this specific situation (the prevalence of these complications, underlying risk factors), to provide better medical care and establish early diagnosis strategies.
