MicroRNAs (miRs) are important in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. miR‑145‑5p acts as a tumor suppressor in certain malignancies, however, its role in HCC remains unclear. The present study aimed to perform a functional analysis of miR‑145‑5p in HCC in order to elucidate its role in the pathogenesis of HCC. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) was performed to analyze tissue and cellular expression of miR‑145‑5p in HCC. Following miRNA mimics transfection, cell viability, apoptosis and cells migration were determined by Cell Counting kit‑8, Annexin V‑FITC/propidium iodide staining and Transwell analyses. The target of miR‑145‑5p was analyzed by luciferase reporter assay and western blot analysis. It was observed that miR‑145‑5p was significantly decreased in HCC tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR‑145‑5p significantly increased apoptosis, reduced cell proliferation and suppressed HCC cell migration. Kruppel‑like factor 5 (KLF5) is regarded as a target of miR‑145‑5p in HCC cells. In addition, KLF5 overexpression partially attenuated the tumor suppressive effects of miR‑145‑5p. KLF5 expression was negatively associated with levels of miR‑145‑5p in HCC tissues. The present study demonstrated that miRNA‑145‑5p may, by targeting KLF5, partially suppress HCC cell growth and motility. The results of the present study suggested that miRNA‑145‑5p alteration in HCC may serve a role in the progression of HCC.
