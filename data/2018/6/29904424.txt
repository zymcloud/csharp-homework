The aim of the present study was to examine the expression and role of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and microRNA (miRNA or miR)-381 in tumor thrombi from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). Tumor thrombi and adjacent paired tissues were collected from 39 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with PVTT. VEGFA expression levels were assessed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. miRNAs that may regulate VEGFA expression were predicted using bioinformatics analysis and confirmed via a dual luciferase reporter assay. The effects of VEGFA and its upstream miRNA on proliferation of the proliferation of EAhy926 human venous endothelial cells were analyzed using an MTT assay. Compared with the paired adjacent tissues, VEGFA was significantly upregulated at both the mRNA and protein level in tumor thrombi (P
