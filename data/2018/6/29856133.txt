At present, as hotspot members of the noncoding RNA network, circular RNAs (circRNAs) with distinct properties and diverse pathophysiological functions are being increasingly delineated. CircRNAs play roles at the epigenetic, transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory levels. Major studies have focused on their functions as efficient microRNA sponges. The validated number of endogenous circRNAs involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) continues to increase. Altered circRNA expression is associated with HCC occurrence, invasion, and metastasis. Moreover, the aberrant expression of circRNAs is also significantly related to HCC tumor stage, size, differentiation and metastasis. Because they are exceptionally stable, highly conserved and have tissue-specific expression patterns, some circRNAs, including hsa_circ_0004018, hsa_circ_0003570, and hsa_circ_0005075, may be potential markers for the diagnosis of HCC. We herein summarize the current knowledge of HCC-associated circRNAs and present their implications for carcinogenesis and their potential value as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Finally, we discuss the future directions of studies on HCC-associated circRNAs.
