Aim:To discover methylated-differentially expressed genes (MDEGs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to explore relevant hub genes and potential pathways.Methods:The data of expression profiling GSE25097 and methylation profiling GSE57956 were gained from GEO Datasets. We analyzed the differentially methylated genes and differentially expressed genes online using GEO2R. Functional and enrichment analyses of MDEGs were conducted using the DAVID database. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was performed by STRING and then visualized in Cytoscape. Hub genes were ranked by cytoHubba, and a module analysis of the PPI network was conducted by MCODE in Cytoscape software.Results:In total, we categorized 266 genes as hypermethylated, lowly expressed genes (Hyper-LGs) referring to endogenous and hormone stimulus, cell surface receptor linked signal transduction and behavior. In addition, 161 genes were labelled as hypomethylated, highly expressed genes (Hypo-HGs) referring to DNA replication and metabolic process, cell cycle and division. Pathway analysis illustrated that Hyper-LGs were enriched in cancer, Wnt, and chemokine signalling pathways, while Hypo-HGs were related to cell cycle and steroid hormone biosynthesis pathways. Based on PPI networks, PTGS2, PIK3CD, CXCL1, ESR1, and MMP2 were identified as hub genes for Hyper-LGs, and CDC45, DTL, AURKB, CDKN3, MCM2, and MCM10 were hub genes for Hypo-HGs by combining six ranked methods of cytoHubba.Conclusion:In the study, we disclose numerous novel genetic and epigenetic regulations and offer a vital molecular groundwork to understand the pathogenesis of HCC. Hub genes, including PTGS2, PIK3CD, CXCL1, ESR1, MMP2, CDC45, DTL, AURKB, CDKN3, MCM2, and MCM10, can be used as biomarkers based on aberrant methylation for the accurate diagnosis and treatment of HCC.
