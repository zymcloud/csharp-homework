Sorafenib, which is a novel targeted agent, plays an important role in treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through its antiangiogenic and antiproliferative effects. However, conventional morphology-based radiographic evaluation systems may underestimate the efficacy of sorafenib in HCC due to a lack of apparent tumor shrinkage or altered tumor morphology in many cases. This calls for the development of more accurate imaging methods for evaluating sorafenib. The introduction of tumor burden measurements based on viability and other evolving imaging approaches for assessing therapeutic effects are promising for overcoming some of the limitations of the morphology-based criteria. In this review, we summarize various imaging methods that are used to assess treatment responses of advanced HCC to sorafenib. Imaging markers predictive of prognosis in advanced HCC after treatment with sorafenib are also included and discussed.
