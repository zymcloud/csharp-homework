A structurally diverse library of 14 gold(I) cationic bis(NHC) and neutral mono(NHC) complexes (NHC: N-heterocyclic carbene) was synthesized and characterized in this work. Four of them were new cationic gold(I) complexes containing functionalized NHCs, and their X-ray crystal structures are presented herein. All of the complexes were investigated for their anticancer activities in four cancer cell lines, including a cisplatin-resistant variant, and a noncancerous cell line. Seven of the cationic gold(I) complexes were found to display high and specific cytotoxic activities toward cancer cells. Two of them were even able to overcome cisplatin resistance. Two highly potent cationic complexes (11 and 15) were also submitted to the NCI-60 cancer panel for further cytotoxicity evaluation. Complex 15 showed a surprisingly high potency toward leukemia among the nine examined cancer subtypes, particularly toward the CCRF-CEM leukemia cell line with a concentration for 50 % inhibition of growth down to 79.4 nm. In addition, cationic complex 13, which demonstrated a remarkable cytotoxicity against hepatocellular carcinoma, was selected to obtain insight into the mechanistic aspects in HepG2 cells. Cellular uptake measurements were indicative of good bioavailability. By various biochemical assays, this complex was found to effectively inhibit thioredoxin reductase and its cytotoxicity toward HepG2 cells was found to be reactive oxygen species dependent.
