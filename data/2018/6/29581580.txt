H19 is an oncofetal RNA expressed in the developing embryo as well as in bladder, breast, gastric, pancreatic, hepatocellular, and prostate cancers. Recent studies have shown that H19 enhances cancer invasion and metastasis; however, its roles in cancer remain controversial. In the current study, H19 exhibited the second largest increase (82.4-fold) and represented the only non-protein coding gene among 11 genes identified that were elevated over 10-fold in lung-metastasis-derived pancreatic cancer cells compared with their parental cells using a mouse metastatic model. Subsequently, we further clarified the roles of H19 in pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis using in vitro and in vivo techniques. In situ hybridization showed that H19 was detected in 23 of 139 invasive ductal carcinomas (17%), and that H19 expression positively correlated with higher histological grades (P
