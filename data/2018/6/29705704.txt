The transcription factor Forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) plays critical roles in cancer development and progression, including human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the regulatory role and underlying mechanisms of FOXM1 is still limited. Here, we found that the high level expression of FOXM1 and CCNB1 is closely associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. And FOXM1 and CCNB1 were overexpressed concomitantly in liver tumor tissues. Knockdown of FOXM1 significantly inhibited the expression levels of CCNB1 in HCC cell lines at both the mRNA and protein levels. Mechanistic studies revealed that FOXM1 binds directly to the promoter region of CCNB1 and regulates the expression levels of the CCNB1 gene in the transcriptional level. Furthermore, the loss of functional and rescue experiments showed that CCNB1 is essential for FOXM1-driven proliferation in HCC cells. In the present study, our results partially explained the dysregulated expression of FOXM1 play an important role in proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells via transcriptional activation of CCNB1 expression. And it also highlights a FOXM1/CCNB1 axis could be a potential target for the treatment of HCCs.
