Fibrocystic breast change (FBC) is extremely common and occurrs in 90% of women during their lives. The association between body composition and risk of breast cancer is well established. We hypothesized that the effect might exist during the development of FBC. Our aim was to examine the relationships of total lean mass (TLM) and percent body fat (PBF) with FBC in a general female population. In total, 8477 female subjects aged 20 years or older were enrolled in the study at the Tri-Service General Hospital in Taiwan from 2011 to 2016. Comprehensive examinations including biochemical data, measurements of body composition and breast ultrasound were performed. PBF was positively associated with the presence of FBC (OR = 1.039, 95%CI: 1.018-1.060), and TLM showed the opposite result (OR = 0.893, 95%CI: 0.861-0.926). Condition of metabolic syndrome (MetS), diabetes (DM) and fatty liver modified the association between PBF and FBC (P < 0.001, P = 0.032 and P = 0.007, respectively). Female subjects diagnosed with MetS, DM, and fatty liver had higher risk of developing FBC than control subjects (OR = 1.110, 95%CI: 1.052-1.171; OR = 1.144, 95%CI: 1.024-1.278; OR = 1.049, 95%CI: 1.019, 1.080). Those with higher PBF (for highest quartile versus lowest, OR = 2.451, 95%CI: 1.523-3.944) or lower TLM (for highest quartile versus lowest, OR = 0.279, 95%CI: 0.171-0.455) had increased risk of developing FBC. In conclusion, increased PBF and reduced TLM were likely to predict the risk of the presence of FBC in a general female population.
