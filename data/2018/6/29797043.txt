Clinical/methodical issue:Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is becoming increasingly important for the detection and characterization of malignant liver lesions and allows percutaneous treatment when surgery is not possible. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound image fusion with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) opens up further options for the targeted investigation of a modified tumor treatment.Methodical innovations:Ultrasound image fusion offers the potential for real-time imaging and can be combined with other cross-sectional imaging techniques as well as CEUS.Performance:With the implementation of ultrasound contrast agents and image fusion, ultrasound has been improved in the detection and characterization of liver lesions in comparison to other cross-sectional imaging techniques. In addition, this method can also be used for intervention procedures. The success rate of fusion-guided biopsies or CEUS-guided tumor ablation lies between 80 and 100% in the literature.Achievements:Ultrasound-guided image fusion using CT or MRI data, in combination with CEUS, can facilitate diagnosis and therapy follow-up after liver interventions.Practical recommendations:In addition to the primary applications of image fusion in the diagnosis and treatment of liver lesions, further useful indications can be integrated into daily work. These include, for example, intraoperative and vascular applications as well applications in other organ systems.
