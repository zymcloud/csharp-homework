Objective:To evaluate the association between the liver imaging reporting and data system (LI-RADS) categories and features and the fractional allelic imbalance (FAI) rate index of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Medical records collected between January 2008 and December 2013 were reviewed to find patients with histologically confirmed HCC, FAI analysis, and CT or MR imaging of the liver. The final population included 71 patients (54 males, 17 females). Three radiologists reviewed the images using the LI-RADS v. 2014. The association between FAI and LI-RADS categories and features was tested using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rho) and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test [low FAI (Results:HCCs were classified as LR-3 (n = 4), LR-4 (n = 22), and LR-5 (n = 45). There was a positive correlation (rho = 0.264) between FAI rate index and LI-RADS category, although not statistically significant after Bonferroni correction (p = 0.024). 14 of the 20 (70%) HCCs with high FAI (≥40%) were categorized as LR-5, 6/20 (30%) as LR-4 and none as LR-3 (p = 0.377). Among the evaluated LI-RADS imaging features, only lesion size showed a statistically significant different distribution in tumors with high FAI compared to those with low FAI. HCCs with FAI ≥40% were larger (56 ± 42 mm) compared to those with FAI Conclusion:There was a positive correlation, although not statistically significant, between the LI-RADS diagnostic categories and the FAI rate of HCC. Tumors with high FAI were larger compared to those with low FAI. Advances in knowledge: HCCs with high (≥40%) FAI are larger compared to those with low (
