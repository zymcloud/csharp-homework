Several cases of hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative advanced and recurrent breast cancer treated with fulvestrant (FUL)were retrospectively investigated to assess the efficacy and safety of the treatment. FUL was administered to a total of 41 patients-33 with recurrent and 8 with Stage IV cancer-from January 2012 to September 2016. The median number of lines that used FUL was 3, the median time to treatment failure(TTF)was 7 months, the overall response rate(RR)was 19.5%, and the clinical benefit rate(CBR)was 53.6%. Our result was similar to those of the FIRST and the FALCON studies, which showed a decrease in RR after the fourth-line. With regard to RR, FUL seemed to provide better results at Cthird-lines of treatment. While a shorter TTF was seen in the cases with liver metastases, a longer TTF was seen in the cases with soft tissue metastases. Therefore, it may be helpful to consider the site of metastasis when predicting the effects of FUL.
