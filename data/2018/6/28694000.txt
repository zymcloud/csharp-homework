Background/purpose:The role of directly-acting antivirals (DAA)-containing regimens in the treatment of patients dually-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains unclear. The pilot study aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of a protease inhibitor, boceprevir, in combination with peginterferon/ribavirin for HCV genotype 1 (HCV-1)/HBV dually-infected patients refractory to prior peginterferon/ribavirin.Methods:Twelve peginterferon-experienced patients dually-infected with HCV-1/HBV were assigned to receive boceprevir 800 mg, twice a day, plus peginterferon-α 2b 1.5 μg/kg/week and ribavirin 800-1400 mg/day for 36 or 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was HCV sustained virological response (SVR, HCV RNA undetectable 24 weeks after end-of-treatment).Results:Five patients terminated treatment early due to adverse events (one at week 4, one at week 46), virological failures (one non-response and one breakthrough), and patient request (n = 1). Eight patients achieved HCV SVR (66.7% in full-analysis set and 72.7% in modified intention-to-treat population). The HCV SVR rate was 71.4% (5/7) in prior relapsers, 60.0% (3/5) in prior null responder; 75% in non-cirrhotic and 50% in cirrhotic patients. All four patients of prior non-cirrhotic relapsers received 36-week regimen and achieved HCV SVR. There was no HBV-related hepatic flare. All patients experienced at least one adverse event. Two had serious adverse events.Conclusion:Boceprevir plus peginterferon/ribavirin is effective in the treatment of HCV-1/HBV dually infected patients' refractory to prior peginterferon/ribavirin combination therapy.
