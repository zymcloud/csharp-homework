Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) always require routine surveillance and repeated treatment, which leads to accumulation of huge amount of clinical data. A predictive model utilizes the time-series data to facilitate dynamic prognosis prediction and treatment planning is warranted. Here we introduced an analytical approach, which converts the time-series data into a cascading survival map, in which each survival path bifurcates at fixed time interval depending on selected prognostic features by the Cox-based feature selection. We apply this approach in an intermediate-scale database of patients with BCLC stage B HCC and get a survival map consisting of 13 different survival paths, which is demonstrated to have superior or equal value than conventional staging systems in dynamic prognosis prediction from 3 to 12 months after initial diagnosis in derivation, internal testing, and multicentric testing cohorts. This methodology/model could facilitate dynamic prognosis prediction and treatment planning for patients with HCC in the future.
