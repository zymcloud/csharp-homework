Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) of the colon is very rare, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of colon cancer is rare. We recently treated a patient with both NEC and SCC that initially presented as multiple unresectable liver and lung metastases. A 68-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital because of diarrhea with descending colon cancer obstruction. He underwent a left colectomy. Based on immunohistochemistry results, we diagnosed mixed NEC and SCC, the primary lesion location of which was probably the lung in the final pathologic examination. He began systemic palliative chemotherapy with CDDP and CPT-11. After 3 months of treatment, shown the progressive disease, we started CDDP and VP-16. The patient was not eligible for additional chemotherapy after 2 months.
