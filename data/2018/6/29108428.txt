Background:The outcome of patients with intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated by transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) remains poor. Search for a more effective therapy is still necessary.Objective:This study aimed to investigate the effect of combining TACE with Kang'ai (KA) injection for treating patients with intermediate stage HCC.Methods:A total of 89 patients with intermediate stage HCC were enrolled and divided into TACE +KA group (n = 48) receiving repeated TACE plus KA injection, and TACE group (n = 41) receiving repeated TACE alone. All patients were prospectively studied. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and time to radiologic progression (TTP).Results:The TACE + KA group had significantly longer median OS (27.0 vs 21.0 months, P = .038) and TTP (12.0 vs 10.0 months, P = .028) than TACE group. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates in the TACE + KA group were markedly higher than in TACE group (88.5%, 58.8%, and 20.8% vs 81.3%, 44.9%, and 6.7%, respectively, P = .038), while the 1- and 2-year TTP rates in the TACE + KA group were significantly lower than in TACE group (49.3% and 86.9% vs 75.3% and 100%, P = .028). TACE + KA group displayed significantly lower incidences of intrahepatic and extrahepatic metastases, as well as postembolization syndrome than TACE group ( P Conclusion:TACE plus KA injection is more effective than TACE alone for treating patients with intermediate stage HCC in this nonrandomized study. Further research is warranted.
