The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) MIR22HG has previously been identified as a prognostic marker in hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of lncRNA expression profiles from RNA-Seq data and report that MIR22HG plays a similar role in lung cancer. Analysis of 918 lung cancer and normal lung tissues and lung cancer cell lines revealed that MIR22HG was significantly downregulated in lung cancer; this decreased expression was associated with poor patient survival. MIR22HG bound and stabilized the YBX1 protein. Silencing of MIR22HG triggered both cell survival and cell death signaling through dysregulation of the oncogenes YBX1, MET, and p21. In this MIR22HG network, p21 played an oncogenic role by promoting cell proliferation and antiapoptosis in lung cancers. MIR22HG played a tumor-suppressive role as indicated by inhibition of multiple cell cycle-related genes in human primary lung tumors. These data show that MIR22HG has potential as a new diagnostic and prognostic marker and as a therapeutic target for lung cancer.Significance: The lncRNA MIR22HG functions as a tumor suppressor, with potential use a diagnostic/prognostic marker and therapeutic target in lung cancer.
