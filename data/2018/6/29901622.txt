We evaluated whether nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) influences the risk of non-hepatocellular carcinoma (non-HCC) malignancies in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A total of 9867 patients with CHB were followed up for ≥12 months for the occurrence of any type of malignancy between 1998 and 2013. Patients who received NA for ≥180 days were defined as the NA group. Propensity score matching produced the control (n = 2220) and NA groups (n = 2220) after adjustment for age, sex, and the presence of diabetes mellitus and liver cirrhosis. The National Health Insurance Service sample cohort dataset was used for external validation. Regarding non-HCC malignancies, only old age was an independent risk factor (>50 years; hazard ratio 3.17, 95% confidence interval 1.71-5.88, P 50 years old are encouraged to undergo surveillance for malignancies similar to the general population.
