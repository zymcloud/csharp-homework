Objective:Arterial ketone bodies, which reflect liver function, have been investigated. However, the relationship between venous ketone bodies and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear. We investigated whether prognosis of patients with HCC after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) was associated with venous blood ketone bodies.Methods:Sixty-eight patients with HCC who underwent TACE were recruited for this study. The venous blood ketone body levels were measured 1 d before (pretreatment) and 7 d after TACE (posttreatment). Skeletal muscle quality was evaluated using the intramuscular adipose tissue content (IMAC).Results:Of the 68 patients, 43 (63.2%) were male, with median age of 73.0 y, and the IMAC was -0.274 (range -0.82 to 0.24). The median ketone body levels pre- and posttreatment were 63.0 µmol/L (13-310) and 48.0 µmol/L (8-896), respectively. The cumulative survival rate of patients with total ketone body ratio ([TKBR]: posttreatment/pretreatment total ketone bodies) -0.2745, odds ratio: 3.958, 95% CI: 1.137-13.779, P = 0.031) that predicted TKBR. TKBR and IMAC were positively correlated (rS = 0.358, P = 0.003).Conclusions:The changes in the venous ketone body were associated with the muscle status and predicted the prognosis of patients with HCC who underwent TACE. The venous ketone bodies could be a new predictor of the prognosis of HCC patients after TACE.
