A cross-sectional study on hepatitis B patients in Indonesia showed association of pre-S2 start codon mutation (M120 V) with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which was dissimilar from studies from other populations where pre-S2 deletion mutation was more prevalent. Different mutation patterns were attributed to different hepatitis B virus (HBV) subgenotypes in each population study. HBV surface proteins are reported to induce the activation of NF-κB, a transcriptional factor known to play an important role in the development of liver disease. This study aimed to see the effects of HBs variants in HBV subgenotype B3 on the expression and activation of NF-κB as one of the mechanisms in inducing advanced liver disease. HBV subgenotypes B3, each carrying wild-type (wt) HBs, M120 V, and pre-S2 deletion mutation were isolated from three HCC patients. HBs genes were amplified and cloned into pcDNA3.1 and were transfected using Lipofectamine into a Huh7 cell line. NF-κB activation was measured through IκB-α expression, which is regulated by NF-κB. RNA expressions for HBs, IκB-α, and NF-κB subunit (p50) were evaluated using real-time PCR. M120 V mutant had a significantly higher mRNA level compared with wt and pre-S2 deletion mutant; however, there were no significant differences in HBs protein expressions. The transcription level of p50 was higher in M120 V mutation compared with HBs wild-type and pre-S2 deletion mutant. NF-κB activation was higher in HBs wild-type compared with the two mutant variants. Pre-S2 mutations had no effect on the increment of NF-κB activation. However, M120 V mutation may utilize a different pathway in liver disease progression that involves high expression of NF-κB subunit, p50.
