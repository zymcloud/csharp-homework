Background:The present study aimed to investigate the impact of pre-sarcopenia on the prognosis of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with sorafenib.Methods:We enrolled 214 patients (71 ± 10 years old; 166 men and 48 women; 90% Child-Pugh grade A and 10% Child-Pugh grade B) treated with sorafenib in our hospital from July 2009 to August 2016. The muscle volume was measured from CT images just before sorafenib administration using software (SliceOmatic). Skeletal muscle mass index was calculated, and the presence of pre-sarcopenia was judged according to the standard (42 cm2/m2 for men and 38 cm2/m2 for women) proposed by the Japan Society of Hepatology.Results:Pre-sarcopenia was found in 123 patients (57%). The overall survival (OS) in patients with pre-sarcopenia tended to be worse than in patients without pre-sarcopenia (median 252 vs. 284 days, respectively; p = 0.16). Multivariate Cox hazard analysis revealed a baseline serum albumin level of ≤3.5 g/dl [hazard ratio (HR) 1.9; p = 0.0006], a baseline alpha-fetoprotein(AFP) level of ≥100 ng/ml (HR 2.1; p = 0.002), presence of lesions in bilateral hepatic lobes (HR 1.7; p = 0.03), and presence of major portal vein invasion (HR 1.8; p = 0.01) to be independent prognostic factors. In the 68 patients who had three or more negative prognostic factors, the presence of pre-sarcopenia did not correlate with prognosis. Of the 146 patients who had two or less prognostic factors, OS was significantly worse in 84 patients (58%) with pre-sarcopenia than in 62 patients without pre-sarcopenia (median 417 vs. 562 days, respectively; p = 0.047), and Cox hazard analysis revealed pre-sarcopenia to be an important prognostic factor (HR 1.6; p = 0.047).Conclusion:In sorafenib treatment for advanced HCC, pre-sarcopenia is a significant prognostic factor in patients with two or less negative prognostic factors, and could be the target of intervention to improve prognosis.
