Background/aim:The results of surgical treatment of breast cancer liver metastases (BCLM) remain suboptimal. The search for perioperative prognostic factors could help determine high risk groups of patients. The aim of study was to evaluate the significance of tumour markers (TM) on long-term treatment results.Patients and methods:Liver surgery was carried out in 32 women for BCLM. The perioperative serum levels of CEA, CA19-9, TPA, TPS, CYFRA 21-1 and TK were determined.Results:Preoperative levels of CA19-9 were significant for overall survival (OS)(p<0.05) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (p<0.01). TPA, TPS and CYFRA 21-1 levels were significant for OS (p<0.05; p<0.04; p<0.05). Postoperative levels of CEA, TPS and CYFRA 21-1 were significant for RFS (p<0.04; p<0.01; p<0.02), while CA19-9 postoperative levels were significant for OS and RFS (p<0.03; p<0.01).Conclusion:Perioperative TM serum levels may represent prognostic indicators reflecting the results of surgical treatment of BCLM.
