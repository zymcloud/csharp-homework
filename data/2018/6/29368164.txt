Objective:To compare diagnostic performance and agreement between CT, MRI and combined CT/MRI in reference to LI-RADS classification system to categorize hepatic observations detected in hepatic patients during screening ultrasound.Methods:240 patients with 296 liver observations detected during ultrasound surveillance underwent hepatic CT and MRI examinations, histopathology, and clinical and radiological follow-up. Using LI-RADS v2014, six radiologists evaluated the observations independently and assigned a LI-RADS category to each observation using CT, MRI and combined CT/MRI.Results:Combined CT and MRI in LI-RADS yielded better accuracy (91.29 %), sensitivity (90.71 %) and specificity (92.31 %) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis than using MRI or CT alone; accuracy, sensitivity and specificity decreased to 85.37 %, 86.34 %, and 83.65 %, respectively, for MRI and 67.6 %, 54.10 % and 91.35 %, respectively, for CT. The intraclass agreement of the LI-RADS scores between CT, MRI and combined CT/MRI was excellent (κ=0.9624 (95 % CI: 0.9318-0.9806)).Conclusion:CT and MRI are complementary to each other. Combined CT/MRI enabled a more precise determination of LI-RADS category of hepatic observations; however, due to the expense and minor increase in accuracy, the combined methodology should only be utilized in cases of suspected HCC.Key points:• Hepatic observation may be categorized differently depending on the imaging modality used. • We compared LI-RADS categorization between CT, MRI and combined CT/MRI. • MRI produces higher accuracy and sensitivity, while CT produces higher specificity. • Combining CT and MRI improves LIRADS categorization reports. • Considering additional cost, combined methodology could be restricted to challenging cases.
