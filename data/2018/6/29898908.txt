Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) is an oncological emergency. It is caused by cellular death occurring secondary to cancer therapy or spontaneously in rapidly dividing tumours. More common in haematological malignancies, it has also been reported in solid tumours. Out of 14 cases of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with TLS, only three cases of spontaneous TLS have been reported in literature to date. Here we report a case of SCLC presenting as a spontaneous TLS.
