Arctigenin is evaluated for antitumor efficacy in patients with pancreatic cancer. It has an inhibitory activity on mitochondrial complex I.Therefore, plasma lactate level of patients after arctigenin administration was evaluated for biomarker of clinical response and/or adverse effect. Plasma lactate level in 15 patients enrolled in a Phase I clinical trial of GBS-01 rich in arctigenin was analyzed by colorimetric assay. Statistical analyses for association of plasma lactate and clinical responses, pharmacokinetics of arctigenin, and background factors of each patient by multivariate and univariate analyses.In about half of the patients, transient increase of lactate was observed. Correlation between plasma lactate level and pharmacokinetic parameters of arctigenin and its glucuronide conjugate, and clinical outcome was not detected. Regarding to the determinant of lactate level, only slight association with liver function test was detected. Plasma lactate level is primary determined by reutilization rather than production for antitumor effect and dose not serve as a biomarker. Arctigenin, inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, plasma lactate concentration, phase I clinical trial of GBS-01, Cori cycle.
