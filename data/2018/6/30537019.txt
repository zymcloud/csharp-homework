Lipid autophagy (lipophagy) is defined as a selective autophagy process in which some intracellular lipid droplets are selectively degraded by autophagic lysosomes pathway. The occurrence of lipophagy was first discovered in liver tissues. Additionally, abundant evidence indicated that the occurrence of hepatic lipophagy has been implicated in many liver diseases including fatty liver diseases, nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases, liver fibrosis, and liver cirrhosis. However, recent studies suggested that hepatic lipophagy occurs not only in liver tissue but also in other nonliver tissues and cells. Furthermore, the occurrence of lipophagy plays a crucial role in nonliver tissues and some related diseases. For instance, lipophagy relieves insulin resistance in adipose tissue from obesity patient with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, lipophagy has the ability to remit neurodegenerative diseases by reducing activity-dependent neurodegeneration in nervous tissue. Lipophagy decreases muscle lipid accumulation and accordingly improves lipid storage myopathy in muscle tissue. Moreover, lipophagy alleviates the malignancy and metastasis of cancer in clear renal cell carcinoma tissue. Lipophagy is also involved in other processes, such as spermatogenesis, osteoblastogenesis, and mucosal ulceration. In conclusion, targeting lipophagy may be a critical regulator and a new therapeutic strategy for nonliver tissues and some related diseases.
