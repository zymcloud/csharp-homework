Previous studies have demonstrated that several members of the Forkhead-box (FOX) family of genes are associated with tumor progression and metastasis. The objective of the current study was to screen candidate FOX family genes identified from analysis of molecular networks in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The expression of FOX family genes as well as FOX family-associated genes was examined, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (n=525). Patient characteristics, including sex, age, tumor diameter, laterality, tumor-node-metastasis, tumor grade, stage, white blood cell count, platelet count, the levels of hemoglobin, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), were collected for univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards ratio analyses. A total of seven candidate FOX family genes were selected from the TCGA database subsequent to univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards ratio analyses. FOXA1, FOXA2, FOXD1, FOXD4L2, FOXK2 and FOXL1 were associated with poor OS time, while FOXA1, FOXA2, FOXD1 and FOXK2 were associated with poor DFS time (P<0.05). FOXN2 was associated with favorable outcomes for overall and disease-free survival (P<0.05). In the gene cluster network analysis, the expression of FOX family-associated genes, including nuclear receptor coactivator (NCOA)1, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase flavoprotein 3 (NDUFV3), phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PISD) and pyruvate kinase liver and red blood cell (PKLR), were independent prognostic factors for OS in patients with ccRCC. Results of the present study revealed that the expression of FOX family genes, including FOXA1, FOXA2, FOXD1, FOXD4L2, FOXK2 and FOXL1, and FOX family-associated genes, including NCOA1, NDUFV3, PISD and PKLR, are independent prognostic factors for patients with ccRCC.
