Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) is a tumor-associated protein overexpressed in numerous types of cancer and is involved in the regulation of resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents. However, the role of SphK1 in the resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to oxaliplatin remains unclear. In the present study, the transcriptional levels of SphK1 were analyzed in 21 patients with HCC and the SphK1 expression levels were identified to be significantly upregulated in HCC tissue compared with that in adjacent normal tissue samples (P
