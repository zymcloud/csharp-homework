Objective:Albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade has been validated as a simple, evidence-based, and objective prognostic tool for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, minimal information is available concerning postoperative ALBI grade changes in HCC. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of postoperative ALBI grade changes in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC within the Milan criteria after liver resection.Methods:Patients with HBV-related HCC within the Milan criteria who underwent liver resection between 2010 and 2016 at West China Hospital were reviewed (N = 258). A change in ALBI grade was defined as first postoperative month ALBI grade-preoperative ALBI grade. If the value was >0, postoperative worsening of ALBI grade was considered; otherwise, stable ALBI grade was considered. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to determine the factors that influence recurrence and survival.Results:During the follow-up, 130 patients experienced recurrence and 47 patients died. Multivariate analyses revealed that postoperative worsening of ALBI grade (HR 1.541, 95% CI 1.025-2.318, P = 0.038), microvascular invasion (MVI, HR 1.802, 95% CI 1.205-2.695, P = 0.004), and multiple tumors (HR 1.676, 95% CI 1.075-2.615, P = 0.023) were associated with postoperative recurrence, whereas MVI (HR 2.737, 95% CI 1.475-5.080, P = 0.001), postoperative worsening of ALBI grade (HR 2.268, 95% CI 1.227-4.189, P = 0.009), high alpha-fetoprotein level (HR 2.055, 95% CI 1.136-3.716, P = 0.017), and transfusion (HR 2.597, 95% CI 1.395-4.834, P = 0.003) negatively influenced long-term survival. Patients with postoperative worsening of ALBI grade exhibited increased incidence of recurrence and worse long-term survival.Conclusion:Postoperative worsening of ALBI grade was associated with increased recurrence and poorer overall survival for patients with HBV-related HCC within the Milan criteria. We should pay attention to liver function changes in HCC patients after liver resection.
