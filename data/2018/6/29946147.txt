In the originally published version of this Article, the colours of the bars in Fig. 4b were inadvertently switched during the production process, such that 'HK2-Dox' and 'HK2+Dox' were depicted in red and 'Nt-Dox' and 'Nt+Dox' were depicted in blue. These errors have now been corrected in both the PDF and HTML versions of the Article.
