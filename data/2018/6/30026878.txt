Transcription factor AP-2β plays an important role in human cancer, but its clinical significance in hepatocellular carcinogenesis is largely unknown. Methods: AP-2β expression was detected in human hepatocellular cancer (HCC) tissues and cell lines. The effects of AP-2β on HCC proliferation, migration, invasion, tumor formation and metastasis were evaluated by MTT, colony formation and transwell assays in vitro and mouse experiments in vivo. The association between AP-2β and miR-27a/EMT markers in HCC cell lines and tissues was analyzed. Results: AP-2β expression was decreased in HCC tissues and cell lines. Reduced expression of AP-2β was significantly associated with more advanced tumor stages and larger tumor sizes. The overexpression of AP-2β reduced HCC proliferation, migration, invasion, tumor formation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, AP-2β overexpression increased the sensitivity of HCC cells to cisplatin. Moreover, AP-2β modulates the levels of EMT markers through Slug and Snail in HCC cell lines and tissues. Furthermore, oncogenic miR-27a inhibits AP-2β expression by binding to the AP-2β 3' untranslated region (UTR) and reverses the tumor suppressive role of AP-2β. Conclusion: These results suggested that AP-2β is lowly expressed in HCC by inhibiting EMT signaling to regulate HCC cell growth and migration. Therefore, AP-2β in the novel miR-27a/AP-2β/Slug/EMT regulatory axis enhances the chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity of HCC and might represent a potential target for evaluating the treatment and prognosis of human HCC.
