Background:The high pretreatment plasma fibrinogen has been widely reported to be a possible biomarker for predicting prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and pancreatic carcinoma (PC), but persuasive conclusion has not been made yet. Thus, we herein conducted a meta-analysis to comprehensively assess the prognostic value of high pretreatment plasma fibrinogen in patients with HCC and PC.Method:We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science to identify eligible studies from inception to November 10, 2017.Results:Finally, a total of 12 publications with 13 studies were included. Of these eligible studies, 5 publications with 6 studies were about pancreatic cancer and 7 were about HCC. The pooled analysis indicated that high plasm fibrinogen level was significantly related to worse overall survival (OS) in HCC [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.87; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.55-2.24; P Conclusion:Taken together, our meta-analysis confirmed that high plasma fibrinogen level could predict worse survival in HCC and PC.
