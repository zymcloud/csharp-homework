The cancer risk in patients with alopecia areata (AA) or alopecia totalis (AT)/alopecia universalis (AU) remains unknown. In this study, national statistical data were used to study the association between these forms of alopecia and the risk of cancer. We enrolled 668,604 patients who were treated for alopecia from 2007 to 2014, and age- and sex-matched control subjects. AA and AT/AU patients had slightly higher overall cancer risks (hazard ratio (HR), 1.043; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.022-1.065 and HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.013-1.129, respectively) than controls, after adjusting for confounding factors. The risks of oral cavity, esophagus, liver, biliary tract, pancreas, larynx, lung, kidney, breast, cervix, ovary, uterus, testis, nerve, and skin cancers; and lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and leukemia, were not increased in alopecia patients. In AA or AT/AU patients, the only increased risk was that of thyroid cancer. In AA patients alone, the risks of bladder and prostate cancers were increased. Thus, the cancer risks varied by the alopecia subtype. Careful monitoring is needed to explore if the actual risks of thyroid, bladder, and prostate cancers are increased in alopecia patients.
