Soft coral, Sinularia sp. had been proven to inherit promising anti-cancer properties against variety of cancer. Current study, Sinularia sp. extract was introduced to Hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep 3B). Cell viability assay indicated the extract exhibit a dose and time dependent cytotoxicity. LC50 exhibited the lowest at 72 h post treatment estimated as 45.3 Âµg/mL. Morphological alterations including nuclear condensation, cytoplasm shrinkage and deformed cellular shape in treated Hep 3B were observable. Chemometric analysis revealed hydrophobic metabolites were significantly altered. Elevated vitamin D and derivatives tend to up-regulation Ca2+ and ROS subsequently triggering apoptosis. Dysregulated glycerolipids may suggest that they were biotransformed to compensate the needs of phospholipids during cell damage. Perturbation of sphingolipids, ceramide and carbohydrate-conjugated ceramides species increased the release of pro-apoptotic components reside within mitochondria and promote programmed cell death in treated Hep 3B. To conclude, MS-based metabolomics enabled the characterization of Sinularia sp. extract-induced cell death.
