Long-term sorafenib treatment triggers resistance to chemotherapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In order to investigate the mechanisms of sorafenib resistance in HCC, the aim of the present study was to develop a resistant human liver cell line via long-term exposure to sorafenib. The cytotoxicity cell counting kit-8 assay was used to evaluate drug sensitivity. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to examine the molecular mechanisms underpinning sorafenib resistance. Migratory and invasive properties in resistant cells were assessed using Transwell assays. The results from the present study revealed that resistant cells became insensitive to sorafenib treatment and exhibited increased migratory and invasive capacities. Activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition was characteristic of resistant cells. The use of LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, was able to suppress the activation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, attenuated the migratory and invasive capacities of resistant cells. Data from the present study indicates that inhibition of the PI3K signaling pathway with LY294002 exerts suppressive effects on sorafenib resistance and provides an attractive novel therapeutic regime in patients with advanced HCC.
