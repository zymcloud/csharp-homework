Aims:Some studies investigated the association between CCND1 rs9344 polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk. However, the results were inconclusive. Thus, we did a meta-analysis to determine this relationship.Materials and methods:Relevant studies were systematically searched using the PubMed, CNKI, and EMBASE databases. The strength of the association was calculated with the odds ratio (OR) and respective 95% confidence intervals (Cis).Results:We investigated the association between CCND1 rs9344 polymorphism and HCC risk in the dominant models. The result of this meta-analysis showed that CCND1 rs9344 polymorphism did not significantly associated with HCC risk (OR = 1.09; 95% CI 0.88-1.34). In the stratified analysis by ethnicity, we found that this polymorphism was significantly associated with HCC risk in Caucasians (OR = 1.55; 95% CI, 1.05-2.29). However, we did not find any significant association between this polymorphism and HCC risk in Asians (OR = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.71-1.18).Conclusions:This meta-analysis suggested that CCND1 rs9344 polymorphism might be associated with the risk of HCC among Caucasians.
