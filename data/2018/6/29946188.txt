The resistance to sorafenib highly affects its clinical benefits for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sodium orthovanadate (SOV) is a phosphate analog that displays anti-cancer activities against various types of malignancies including HCC. The present study has demonstrated that SOV is able to overcome sorafenib resistance and strengthens sorafenib in suppressing sorafenib-resistant HCC cells in vitro and in animal models. Similar to its action on parental HCC cells, SOV induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phases by regulating cyclin B1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 1, and apoptosis by reducing mitochondrial membrane potential, in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. More importantly, SOV inhibited ATPase activity, which was significantly elevated in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. SOV also reduced the expression of HIF-1α and HIF-2α and their nuclear translocation, resulting in downregulation of their downstream factors including vascular endothelial growth factor, lactate dehydrogenase-A and glucose transporter 1. Its ability to inhibit ATPase activity and hypoxia-inducible pathways enabled SOV to efficiently suppress both normoxic and hypoxic cells, which compose cancer cell populations inside sorafenib-resistant HCC tumors. The present results indicate that SOV may be a potent candidate drug for overcoming the resistance to sorafenib in treating HCC.
