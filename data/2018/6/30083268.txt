microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and have been extensively tested as therapeutic molecules against several human diseases. In vivo delivery of miRNAs needs to satisfy the following conditions: safety, efficiency, and long-term therapeutic effectiveness. To satisfy these conditions, we developed a tissue-adhesive nucleotide-polymer complex (NPX-glue) for in vivo delivery of miRNAs to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Polyallylamine (PAA), a cationic polymer, was mixed with tumor-suppressing miR-141 to form NPX and then mixed with partially oxidized alginate (OA) to form NPX-glue. Delivery efficiency of miR-141:NPX-glue was determined in cultured HCC cells and in an implanted HCC tumor model. In vivo tumor-suppressive effects of miR-141 on HCC were examined in mice upon intratumoral injection of miR-141:NPX-glue. Result: NPX-glue was generated by mixing of NPX with OA, which eliminated the inherent cytotoxic effect of NPX. NPX-glue led to the efficient delivery of miR-141 and plasmid to cultured cells and solid tumors in mice, where their expression was maintained for up to 30 days. Upon intratumoral injection of miR-141:NPX-glue, the growth of the tumors was dramatically retarded in comparison with the negative control, NCmiR:NPX-glue, (p < 0.05). Molecular examination proved miR-141:NPX-glue efficiently regulated the target genes including MAP4K4, TM4SF1, KEAP1, HDGF, and TIAM1 and finally induced apoptosis of cancer tissues. Conclusion: Here, we show that NPX-glue delivers therapeutic miR-141 to solid tumors in a safe, stable, and long-term manner and prove that locoregional treatment of HCC is possible using the NPX-glue system.
