Background:Direct-acting antivirals (DAA) are an effective treatment for hepatitis C virus infection. However, sustained virologic response (SVR) after DAA treatment does not seem to reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in these patients. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) may predict the risk of developing HCC in liver cirrhosis patients.Aims:The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of LSM variation as predictor of HCC development in patients treated with DAA.Methods:In 139 HCV-related cirrhotic patients, LSM and laboratory tests were carried out at baseline (BL) and at the end of DAA treatment (EOT). Patients were followed for at least 6 months after the EOT. LSM reduction was expressed as Delta LS (∆LS). Cox regression analysis was used to identify prognostic factors for HCC development after DAA.Results:Median LSM values were significantly reduced from BL to EOT (from 18.6 to 13.8 kPa; p Conclusion:Our results indicate that ∆LS is a useful non-invasive marker for predicting HCC development after DAA treatment.
