Introduction:While preoperative chemotherapy is frequently utilized before resection of non-neuroendocrine liver metastases, patients with resectable neuroendocrine liver metastases typically undergo surgery first. FAS is a cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen that is associated with substantial response rates in locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.Methods:All patients who underwent R0/R1 resection of pancreatic neuroendocrine liver metastases at a single institution between 1998 and 2015 were included. The outcomes of patients treated with preoperative FAS were compared with those of patients who were not.Results:Of the 67 patients included, 27 (40.3%) received preoperative FAS, whereas 40 (59.7%) did not. Despite being associated with higher rates of synchronous disease, lymph node metastases, and larger tumor size, patients who received preoperative FAS had similar overall survival [overall survival (OS), 108.2 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 78.0-136.0) vs. 107.0 months (95% CI 78.0-136.0), p = 0.64] and recurrence-free survival [RFS, 25.1 months (95% CI 23.2-27.0) vs. 18.0 months (95% CI 13.8-22.2), p = 0.16] as patients who did not. Among patients who presented with synchronous liver metastases (n = 46), the median OS [97.3 months (95% CI 65.9-128.6) vs. 65.0 months (95% CI 28.1-101.9), p = 0.001] and RFS [24.8 months (95% CI 22.6-26.9) vs. 12.1 months (2.2-22.0), p = 0.003] were significantly greater among patients who received preoperative FAS compared with those who did not.Conclusions:The use of FAS before liver resection is associated with improved OS compared with surgery alone among patients with advanced synchronous pancreatic neuroendocrine liver metastases.
