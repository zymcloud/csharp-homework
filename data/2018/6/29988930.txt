Aim:To investigate whether the change in pre-/post-operation serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels is a predictive factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) outcomes.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 334 HCC patients who underwent hepatic resection at our hospital between January 2006 and December 2016. The patients were classified into three groups according to their change in serum AFP levels: (1) the normal group, pre-AFP ≤ 20 ng/mL and post-AFP ≤ 20 ng/mL; (2) the response group, pre-AFP > 20 ng/mL and post-AFP decrease of ≥ 50% of pre-AFP; and (3) the non-response group, pre-AFP level > 20 ng/mL and post-AFP decrease of 20 ng/mL.Results:Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that multiple tumors [hazard ratio (HR): 1.646, 95%CI: 1.15-2.35, P < 0.05], microvascular invasion (mVI) (HR: 1.573, 95%CI: 1.05-2.35, P < 0.05), and the non-response group (HR: 2.425, 95% CI: 1.42-4.13, P < 0.05) were significant independent risk factors for recurrence-free survival. Similarly, multiple tumors (HR: 1.99, 95%CI: 1.12-3.52, P < 0.05), mVI (HR: 3.24, 95%CI: 1.77-5.90, P < 0.05), and the non-response group (HR: 3.62, 95%CI: 1.59-8.21, P < 0.05) were also significant independent risk factors for overall survival. The non-response group had significantly lower overall survival rates and recurrence-free survival rates than both the normal group and the response group (P < 0.05). Thus, patients with no response regarding post-surgery AFP levels were associated with poor outcomes.Conclusion:Serum AFP responses are significant prognostic factors for the surgical outcomes of HCC patients, suggesting post-resection AFP levels can direct the management of HCC patients.
