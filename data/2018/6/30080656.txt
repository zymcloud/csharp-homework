The physiological role of autophagy in the catabolic process of the body involves protein synthesis and degradation in homeostasis under normal and stressed conditions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the role of tumor microenvironment (TME) has been concerned as the main issue in fighting against this deadly malignancy. During the last decade, the crosstalk between tumor cells and their TME in HCC extensively accumulated. However, a deeper knowledge for the actual function of autophagy in this interconnection which involved in supporting tumor development, progression and chemoresistance in HCC is needed but still largely unknown. Recent studies have shown that coagulants tissue factor (TF) and factor VII (FVII) has a pathological role in promoting tumor growth by activating protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2). Autophagy-associated LC3A/B-II formation was selectively suppressed by FVII/PAR2 signaling which mediated by mTOR activation through Atg7 but not Atg5/Atg12 axis. The coagulant-derived autophagic suppression seemed potentiate a vicious circle of malignancy in producing more FVII and PAR2 which facilitate in vivo and in vitro tumor progression of HCC and the investigations are consistent with the clinical observations. In this review, we briefly summarize the current understanding of autophagy and discuss recent evidence for its role in HCC malignancy.
