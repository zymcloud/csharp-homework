The present study aimed to analyze the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results from patients with hepatic perfusion disorders (HPD) and liver diseases, in order to assess the pathogenetic mechanisms. This was completed byanalyzing the causes of HPD in 35 patients to assess if they were associated with arterioportal shunt, and classify the patients according to results from the MRI scans. Of the 35 patients, 26 (74.3%) with HPD presented with hepatocellular carcinoma, a major cause of HPD. The HPD phenomenon in 35 patients was not identified as obvious abnormal lesions on T2WI and T1WI according to the isointensity on diffusion weighted images. Enhanced scanning showed hyperintense signals on the arterial phase images, isointense or hyperintense signals on portal phase and delayed phase images. According to their MRI findings, hepatic perfusion disorders may be divided into different types, as follows: Diffuse, lobe or segment type, wedge type and platy. The HPD phenomenon may herald an underlying abnormality of liver disease and MRI may accurately diagnose HPDs in liver diseases.
