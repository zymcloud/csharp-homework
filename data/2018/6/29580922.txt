Background:Glycosylation is highly susceptible to changes of the physiological conditions, and accordingly, is a potential biomarker associated with several diseases and/or longevity. Semi-supercentenarians (SSCs; older than 105 years) are thought to be a model of human longevity. Thus, we performed glycoproteomics using plasma samples of SSCs, and identified proteins and conjugated N-glycans that are characteristic of extreme human longevity.Methods:Plasma proteins from Japanese semi-supercentenarians (SSCs, 106-109 years), aged controls (70-88 years), and young controls (20-38 years) were analysed by using lectin microarrays and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Peak area ratios of glycopeptides to corresponding normalising peptides were subjected to orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Furthermore, plasma levels of clinical biomarkers were measured.Results:We found two lectins such as Phaseolus vulgaris, and Erythrina cristagalli (ECA), of which protein binding were characteristically increased in SSCs. Peak area ratios of ECA-enriched glycopeptides were successfully discriminated between SSCs and controls using OPLS-DA, and indicated that tri-antennary and sialylated N-glycans of haptoglobin at Asn207 and Asn211 sites were characterized in SSCs. Sialylated glycans of haptoglobin are a potential biomarker of several diseases, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, liver cirrhosis, and IgA-nephritis. However, the SSCs analysed here did not suffer from these diseases.Conclusions:Tri-antennary and sialylated N-glycans on haptoglobin at the Asn207 and Asn211 sites were abundant in SSCs and characteristic of extreme human longevity.General significance:We found abundant glycans in SSCs, which may be associated with human longevity.
