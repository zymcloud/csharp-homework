It has been certified that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are crucial regulators in the progression of various human cancers. snoRNA host gene 6 (SNHG6) has been uncovered to affect the initial stage and tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Nevertheless, the expression pattern and biological role of SNHG6 in glioma still need to be investigated. The study aims to investigate the expression pattern, biological role and the potential mechanism of SNHG6 in glioma. In this study, the high expression of SNHG6 was tested in both glioma tissues and glioma cells. The correlation between expression levels of SNHG6 and the overall survival of glioma patients was demonstrated by using Kaplan Meier method analysis. Next, gain of function assays revealed that overexpression of SNHG6 can promote the formation of malignant phenotype of 1800 cell. However, results of loss-of-function assays revealed that silenced SNHG6 exerted the inhibitory function on glioma cell growth. Flow cytometric analysis was performed in glioma cells to detect the anti-oncogenic effects of silenced SNHG6 on cell cycle and apoptosis. Finally, we identified that p21 was involved in glioma cell proliferation after SNHG6 was downregulated. Taken together, we concluded that SNHG6 is a regulator and a potential therapeutic target in glioma.
