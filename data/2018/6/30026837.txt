Aim: The aim of this study was to compare vascularity observed using contrast-enhanced 3D ultrasonography and pathological changes in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and surrounding non-tumorous areas after sorafenib treatment. Materials and methods: Twelve patients with HCC were enrolled in this clinical study. The maximum tumor diameter as measured using sonography ranged from 15 to 33 mm (mean, 24.0 mm; SD, 5.7 mm). Assessments using contrast-enhanced (0.2 mL of Sonazoid suspension; Daiichi Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan) 3D ultrasonography (LOGIQ 7; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee) were performed in all the patients before and 1 week after sorafenib treatment. The microvessel density (MVD) of the HCC and surrounding non-tumorous area was evaluated based on the immunohistochemical staining of microvessels using an antigen for CD34. Results: Blood flow in the tumor was decreased in all 12 cases after sorafenib treatment. The MVD of the tumorous area at 1 week after sorafenib administration (38.8 ± 5.2) was significantly lower than that observed before sorafenib administration (72.4 ± 13.0) (P < 0.01). Blood flow in the non-tumorous area had decreased in 6 cases at 1 week after sorafenib treatment and had not changed in the 6 other cases. In the reduced blood flow group, the MVD of the non-tumorous area at 1 week after sorafenib administration had decreased significantly, compared with the MVD of the non-tumorous area before sorafenib administration. However, in the group with no change in blood flow, the MVD of the non-tumorous area at 1 week after sorafenib treatment had not changed, compared with the MVD of the non-tumorous area before sorafenib treatment. Conclusion: Contrast-enhanced 3D ultrasonography studies showed a correlation between vascularity and pathological changes in human HCC and the surrounding non-tumorous area after sorafenib treatment.
