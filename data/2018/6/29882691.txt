Aim:This prospective study aimed to envisage the putative prognostic significance of clinical and hematologic parameters in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with nivolumab.Materials & methods:Correlations of several parameters with disease control and survival outcomes were provided.Results:A total of 54 patients were included. An ECOG performance status 0-1, the lack of liver and bone metastases and a timeframe from the last systemic treatment â‰¥4 months correlated with better disease control. The same was observed for baseline low levels of white blood cells and neutrophils, for high levels of NK cells and a neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio <4. The mentioned parameters were also associated with longer overall survival.Conclusion:Nivolumab efficacy in non-small-cell lung cancer patients is influenced by clinicopathological parameters and specific leucocyte subsets.
