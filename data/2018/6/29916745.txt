Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors. At present, the molecular mechanism of HCC remains unclear. A recent circular RNA (circRNA) profiling study showed that circRBM23 expression was upregulated in HCC tissues. Therefore, in this study, the impact of circRBM23 during the progression of HCC was evaluated. The expression levels of circRBM23 and miR-138 in HCC tissues and HCC cell lines were determined by RT-PCR and the results indicated that circRBM23 expression was increased in the HCC tissues and HCC cell lines, whereas miR-138 expression was decreased. An upregulation of circRBM23 expression in HCC cells was shown to increase cell viability, and also increased the ability of cells to migrate. Downregulation of circRBM23 was found to decrease cell viability, proliferation, and migration, and promote the expression of miR-138 and its related target genes, vimentin, and CCND3. Moreover, miR-138 was found to regulate HCC cell viability and migration, and the levels of vimentin and CCND3 protein expression were found to be inversely correlated with those of miR-138 expression. The downregulation of circRBM23 in HCC tissues can regulate the miR-138-mediated signal pathway by promoting miR-138 expression. The results in vivo demonstrated that circRBM23 is required for the tumorigenesis with downregulation of tumor suppressor miR-138. These data indicated that upregulated circRBM23 functioned as oncogene in HCC through regulating the tumor suppressor miR-138.
