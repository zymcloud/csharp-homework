Background:The aim of this study was to investigate the reactivation of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) following transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with HBV-DNA negative and to evaluate the effects of TACE combined with antiviral therapy.Methods:This prospective study involved 98 patients with HBV-related and HBV-DNA negative HCC (HBV DNA Results:HBV reactivation occurred in 11 patients in the nonantiviral group (11/47, 23.4%) but only 3 patients in the antiviral group (3/51, 5.9%, P Conclusion:HCC patients with HBV DNA negative still remain associated with risk of HBV reactivation after TACE. HBeAg-positive, number of tumors more than 3, and absence of antiviral therapy in HCC patients after TACE have a higher risk of HBV reactivation. Antiviral therapy can reduce the risk of reactivation, helping improve liver function after TACE.
