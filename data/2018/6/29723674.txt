Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasingly managed by liver resection first then salvage liver transplantation in case of recurrence within accepted criteria. Many reports compared the safety of the salvage against the primary surgery in the setting of deceased donation but the difference in case of living donation is not sufficiently defined. Salvage living donor liver transplantation (SLDLT) is believed to be a more challenging surgery than primary living donor liver transplantation (PLDLT) due to operative field adhesions, in addition to the inherent difficulties particularly short vasculobiliary stumps. In this report, we compared both pathways from a surgical perspective in a homogenous LDLT-only cohort.Materials and methods:Over 15 years, 448 LDLTs for HCC were performed in a single liver transplant institution in Taiwan, including PLDLT (n = 348) and SLDLT (n = 100). A retrospective comparative review of the surgical outcomes of both pathways using a propensity score matching model (1-1, 100 pairs) was performed with adjustment for age, Child score and MELD score. The surgical outcome and survival were compared across 2 time eras.Results:The operative data showed that SLDLT surgery encountered more extensive adhesions (57% vs. 0%, p Conclusions:The SLDLT surgery is a demanding lengthy procedure with extensive adhesions and possibility of frequent re-explorations. Significant case load and high centre volume are important factors for safe practice of SLDLT and better cumulative OS.
