Impact of substitution of aa70 in the core region (Core aa70) in HCV genotype 1b (HCV-1b) on hepatocarcinogenesis following eradication of HCV RNA by direct-acting antiviral therapy is not clear. In a retrospective study, 533 patients with HCV-related chronic liver disease, with sustained virological response defined as negative HCV RNA at 12 weeks after cessation of direct-acting antiviral therapy, were examined to evaluate the relationship between Core aa70 substitution and hepatocarcinogenesis. Twelve patients developed hepatocellular carcinoma during the follow-up period. The cumulative hepatocarcinogenesis rates were 1.7% and 2.4% at the end of 1 and 2 years, respectively. Overall, multivariate analysis identified HCV subgroup (HCV-1b with Gln70(His70); P = 0.003) and age (>65 years; P = 0.049), as pretreatment predictors of hepatocarcinogenesis. In HCV-1b patients, multivariate analysis identified post-treatment Wisteria floribunda agglutinin positive Mac-2 binding protein (>1.8 COI; P = 0.042) and HCV subgroup (HCV-1b with Gln70(His70); P = 0.071), as predictors of hepatocarcinogenesis, including post-treatment parameter. In conclusion, Core aa70 substitution in HCV-1b at the start of direct-acting antiviral therapy is an important predictor of hepatocarcinogenesis following eradication of HCV RNA. This study emphasizes the importance of detection of Core aa70 substitution before initiating antiviral therapy.
