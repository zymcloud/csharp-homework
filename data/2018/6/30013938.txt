Nanotechnology is a promising era of medicine for developing targeted drug delivery system. Chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) have attracted increasing attention for their wide applications as anticancer drugs. This article is concerned with the therapeutic index of chitosan nanoparticles against diethyl nitrosamine (DEN) induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC was induced in rats via repeated DEN administration in a dose of 200 mg/kg BW IP, 2 weeks later rats received (2 ml/kg BW) CCl4 orally for 2 months followed by daily treatment with chitosan nanoparticles in an oral dose of 12 mg/kg for 1 month. Then the gene expression of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), (c-FOS), nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB) and tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF-α) were reported in rats sera and the correlation between GSK-3, C-Fos, NFƘB and TNF-α and liver tumorigenesis was investigated. The results elucidated that DEN significantly increased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Marked increments in serum malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NOx) levels along with a slight reduction of glutathione (GSH) level were evidenced in HCC. Liver injury triggered an inflammatory response by enhancing the mRNA gene expression of NFκB and TNF-α. DEN effectively activated apoptotic markers GSK-3 and c-FOS. Oral administration of CNPs alleviated the oxidative, inflammatory and apoptotic hazards induced via DEN. The histopathological examination reinforced these results. The present study highlights the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic potentials of CNPs against DEN-induced HCC.
