Aim:We estimated the cost-effectiveness of direct-acting antiviral treatment (DAA) compared to triple therapy (simeprevir, pegylated interferon-Î± [Peg-IFN], and ribavirin [RBV]) (scenario 1), Peg-IFN + RBV (scenario 2), and non-antiviral therapy (scenario 3).Methods:Cost-effectiveness was evaluated as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) using direct costs and indirect costs, which included loss of wages during the patient's lifetime due to early death caused by viral hepatitis infection. Quality of life (QOL) scores were determined by EQ-5D-3L questionnaire survey on 200 HCV patients in Hiroshima.Results:The QOL scores for chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma were estimated as 0.871, 0.774, and 0.780, respectively. The follow-up period that the ICER of scenario 1 becomes shortest (cost Conclusions:Direct-acting antiviral treatment was estimated to be cost-effective from 10 to 25 years after treatment, depending on the SVR rate of the drugs and the age of onset of treatment. In order to increase the cost-effectiveness of DAA treatment, measures or effort to improve the QOL score of patients after SVR are necessary.
