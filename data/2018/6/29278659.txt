Currently available studies have implicated that exosome-delivered microRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in human cancer. However, the association of serum exosomal miR-638 and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains largely unknown. We aim to investigate the expression of exosomal miR-638 in serum of HCC patients and its prognostic role in this deadly disease. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to determine the survival of patients histologically diagnosed with HCC. Reduced levels of exosomal miR-638 in serum samples from patients with HCC were identified by real-time PCR. Negative association of serum exosomal miR-638 with tumor size, vascular infiltration, and TNM stage was observed in HCC patients. Besides, the proliferation of Huh7 and SMCC7721 HCC cells were significantly inhibited when miR-638 was over-expressed in these cells. In addition, HCC patients with lower levels of serum exosomal miR-638 had poor overall survival than those with higher levels of exosomal miR-638 in serum. Our study strongly suggests that serum exosome-delivered miR-638 may serve as a novel circulating biomarker for HCC. Downregulation of miR-638 predicts poor prognosis for patients with HCC.
