Background:Glutaminase (GLS), the key enzyme that catalyzes glutamine catabolism, facilitates the production of energy, building blocks, and factors resisting stresses. Two isoforms of GLS have been identified: GLS1 and GLS2. Elevated GLS1 contributes to tumorigenesis and tumor progression. This study investigates the molecular mechanism by which GLS1 is regulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Online databases were investigated to search for factors that co-overexpress with GLS1. siRNA knockdown or chemical compounds were utilized to manipulate the activation or inactivation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 signaling. Both the mRNA and protein levels of GLS1 were detected. The biological and clinical importance of p65-GLS1 in HCC was also demonstrated.Results:NF-κB p65 regulates GLS1 expression in HCC cells. Knockdown or suppression of GLS1 compromises HCC cell proliferation. Elevated GLS1 expression correlates with neoplasm histological grade, and the dysregulation of p65-GLS1 is associated with poor prognosis in human HCC patients.Conclusion:GLS1 can be developed as a diagnostic and therapeutic target for human HCC.
