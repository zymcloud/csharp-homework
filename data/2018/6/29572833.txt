Background:There is currently no established model for predicting the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with negative alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) after curative resection. Therefore, the objective of this study was to establish a nomogram to identify the risk of recurrence in AFP-negative (Methods:A retrospective study was conducted to establish the recurrence-free survival (RFS) nomogram in a training cohort of 326 AFP-negative HCC patients. The results were validated on a well-matched validation cohort in the literature.Results:Macrovascular tumour invasion (P = 0.018, HR = 1.642), macronodular cirrhosis (P Conclusions:The present RFS nomogram for AFP-negative HCC patients after curative resection provides an accurate and reliable prognostic model to facilitate recurrence surveillance. Once AFP-negative patients are predicted to have a high recurrence score, additional high-end imaging examinations, such as MRI or CT exams, should be considered, and the interval time of regular folow-up should be reduced.
