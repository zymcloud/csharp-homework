Mono-polar spindle 1 (Mps1/TTK) represents a protein kinase reported to be vital for cell division processes and is generally regarded as an attractive target for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, breast carcinoma, and colon cancer. However, the C604Y mutation has been linked to acquired resistance. Recently, three potential small-molecule inhibitors of Mps1 (i.e., reversine, NMS-P715, and its derivative Cpd-5) were reported for the C604Y mutation that exhibit significant resistance to NMS-P715 and Cpd-5, but retain affinity for reversine. In this study, classical molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, accelerated MD (aMD) simulations, and umbrella sampling (US) simulations were performed to illustrate the resistance mechanisms of inhibitors to Mps1. The classical MD simulations combined with free energy calculations revealed that reversine features similar binding affinity characteristics to both Mps1WT and Mps1C604Y, but both NMS-P715 and Cpd-5 feature much higher binding affinities to Mps1WT than to Mps1C604Y. The major variations were shown to be controlled by electrostatic energy and the conformational change of A-loop-induced entropy increased. The large conformational changes of Mps1C604Y bound to NMS-P715 and Cpd-5 were also observed in aMD simulations. The US simulation results further suggest that reversine and Cpd-5 both exhibit similar dissociation processes from both Mps1WT and Mps1C604Y, but Cpd-5 and NMS-P715 were found to dissociate more easily from Mps1C604Y than from Mps1WT, thus a reduced residence time was responsible for the inhibitors resistance to the C604Y mutation. The physical principles provided by the present study may provide important clues for the discovery and rational design of novel inhibitors to combat the C604Y mutation of Mps1.
