In the twenty-seven years since the discovery of hepatitis C virus (HCV) the majority of individuals exposed to HCV establish a persistent infection, which is a leading cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In developed nations, the cure rates of HCV infection could be over 90% with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens, which has made the great progress in global eradication. However, the cost of these treatments is so expensive that the patients in developing nations, where the disease burden is the most severe, could not afford it, which highly restricted its access. Additionally, the largely asymptomatic nature of infection facilitates continued transmission in risk groups due to limited surveillance. Consequently a protective vaccine and likely emergence of drug-resistant viral variants call for further studies of HCV biology. In the current review, the development and the progress of preventive and therapeutic vaccines against the HCV have been reviewed in the context of peptide vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines, HCV-like particle, DNA vaccines and viral vectors expressing HCV genes.
