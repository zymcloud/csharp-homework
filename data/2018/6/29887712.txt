Isolated, metastatic hemangiopericytoma of liver is an extremely rare entity. We present a case of hemangiopericytoma of the liver, metastatic from a meningeal hemangiopericytoma, who presented 10 years after the surgical excision of the primary tumour and morphologically mimicked a hepatocellular carcinoma. We review the literature regarding this entity and discuss the difficulties in preoperative diagnosis and the need for a thorough preoperative evaluation.
