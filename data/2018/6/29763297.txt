FLNBD-BAMPEG2k, bearing a nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) unit and an oleyl terminus conjugated via a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) spacer ( Mn = 2,000), was designed to fluorescently label cell membranes by docking its hydrophobic oleyl terminus. During laser scanning microscopy in a minimal essential medium (MEM), human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells labeled with FLNBD-BAMPEG2k appeared to undergo optoporation at their plasma membrane. We confirmed this unprecedented possibility by a series of cellular uptake experiments using negatively charged and therefore membrane-impermeable quantum dots (QDs; Dh = 4.7 nm). Detailed studies indicated that the photoexcited NBD unit can generate singlet oxygen (1O2), which oxidizes the constituent phospholipids to transiently deteriorate the cell membrane. Reference membrane modifiers FLNBD-Oleyl and FLNBD-BAMPEG8k having shorter or longer hydrophilic spacers between the NBD and oleyl units showed a little or substantially no optoporation. For understanding these results, one must consider the following contradictory factors: (1) The photosensitized 1O2 generation efficiently occurs only when the NBD unit is in aqueous media, and (2) the lifetime of 1O2 in aqueous media is very short (3.0-3.5 Î¼s). As supported experimentally and computationally, the hydrophilic spacer length of FLNBD-BAMPEG2k is optimal for compromising these factors. Further to note, the optoporation using FLNBD-BAMPEG2k is not accompanied by cytotoxicity.
