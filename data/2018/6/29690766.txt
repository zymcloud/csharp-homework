Drug resistance, developed through multiple mechanisms, is a major hindrance to successful chemotherapy of tumor. Combination therapy of chemotherapeutic drugs and siRNA represents an emerging strategy which may improve anticancer effect by synergistic actions. In this study, triblock copolymer of poly(ethylene glycol)- block-poly(l-lysine)- block-poly aspartyl ( N-( N', N'-diisopropylaminoethyl)) (PEG-PLL-PAsp(DIP)) was synthesized for the first time to enable the codelivery of BCL-2 siRNA and DOX. The system is supposed to not only bypass drug efflux but also down-regulate the antiapoptotic gene and consequently confronting against chemoresistance as well. Moreover, the pH responsive ability of the codelivery system can prevent drug leakage during circulation and guarantee swift drug release at tumors. The codelivered siRNA serves to suppress the expression of antiapoptotic BCL-2 and hence sensitize the cancer cells to anticancer drugs and produce improved therapeutic effect. Consequently, the codelivery of BCL-2 siRNA and anticancer drug DOX serves as a promising strategy against drug resistance in chemotherapy.
