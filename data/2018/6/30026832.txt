Background: The aim of the present study was to identify diagnostic and prognostic values of minichromosome maintenance (MCM) gene expression in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: The biological function of the MCM genes were investigated by bioinformatics analysis. The diagnostic and prognostic values of the MCM genes were investigated by using the data of HCC patients from the GSE14520 and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. Results: Bioinformatics analysis of the MCM genes substantiated that MCM2-7 genes were significantly enriched in DNA replication and cell cycle, and co-expressed with each other. These genes also co-expressed in HCC tumor tissue in both the GSE14520 and TCGA cohort. We also observed that the expression of the MCM2-7 genes was increased in tumor tissue, and diagnostic receiver operating characteristic analysis of MCM2-7 indicated that these genes could serve as sensitive diagnostic markers in HCC. Survival analysis in the GSE14520 cohort suggested that expression of MCM2, MCM4, MCM5, and MCM6 were significantly associated with hepatitis B virus-related HCC overall survival (OS). However, none of the MCM genes were associated with recurrence-free survival in the GSE14520 cohort. The validation cohort of TCGA suggested that the expression of MCM2, MCM6, and MCM7 were significantly correlated with HCC OS. Conclusion: Our study indicated that MCM2-7 genes may be potential diagnostic biomarkers in patients with HCC. Among them, MCM2 and MCM6 may serve as potential prognostic biomarkers for HCC.
