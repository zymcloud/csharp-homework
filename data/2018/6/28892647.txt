Recent research suggested that microRNA 96 (miR-96) might function as an oncogene in several types of cancers. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to probe into the mechanism of miR-96 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. HCC tissues and non-tumorous tissues, HCC cell lines, and healthy cell lines were all involved in this study. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were used to detect miR-96 and SOX6 mRNA and protein expressions. The direct regulation of miR96 on SOX6 was confirmed by luciferase reporter assays. Cell proliferation and growth were determined by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide) assay and colony formation assay. Wound healing and transwell assay were employed for migration and invasion analyses. Finally, SPSS 21.0 and GraphPad 7.0 were applied for statistical analyses. In HCC tissues, miR-96 was highly expressed while SOX6 was lowly expressed. The overexpression of miR-96 reversely inhibited the expression of SOX6, contributing to the promotion of the biological functions of HCC cells. miR-96 could promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in HCC by targeting SOX6.
