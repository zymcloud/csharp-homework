Glypican (GPC)-3 is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). GPC3 binds to CD81. Forced expression of CD81 in a GPC3-expressing HCC cell line caused activation of Hippo, a decrease in ezrin phosphorylation, and a decrease in yes-associated protein (YAP). CD81 is also associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry into hepatocytes. Activation of CD81 by agonistic antibody causes activation of tyrosine-protein kinase SYK (SYK) and phosphorylation of ezrin, a regulator of the Hippo pathway. In cultures of normal hepatocytes, CD81 agonistic antibody led to enhanced phosphorylation of ezrin and an increase in nuclear YAP. HCV E2 protein mimicked GPC3 and led to enhanced Hippo activity and decreased YAP in cultured normal human hepatocytes. HCC tissue microarray revealed a lack of expression of CD81 in most HCCs, rendering them insusceptible to HCV infection. Activation of CD81 by agonistic antibody suppressed the Hippo pathway and increased nuclear YAP. HCV mimicked GPC3, causing Hippo activation and a decrease in YAP. HCV is thus likely to enhance hepatic neoplasia by acting as a promoter of growth of early CD81-negative neoplastic hepatocytes, which are resistant to HCV infection, and thus have a proliferative advantage to clonally expand as they participate in compensatory regeneration for the required maintenance of 100% of liver weight (hepatostat).
