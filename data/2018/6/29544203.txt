Study objective:Epidural analgesia may be associated with fewer postoperative complications and is associated with improved survival after colon cancer resection. This study used the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) to assess any association between epidural analgesia (versus non-epidural) and complications after colectomy.Design:Retrospective cohort study.Setting:603 hospitals in the United States reporting data to NSQIP.Patients:From 2014-15 data, 4176 patients undergoing colectomy with records indicating epidural analgesia were matched 1:4 via propensity scores to 16,704 patients without.Interventions:None (observational study).Measurements:Primarily, we assessed the association between epidural analgesia and a composite of cardiopulmonary complications using an average relative effect generalized estimating equations model. Secondary outcomes included neurologic, renal, and surgical complications and length of hospitalization. Sensitivity analyses repeated the analyses on a subgroup of only open colectomies.Main results:We found no association between epidural analgesia and the primary outcome: average relative effect (95% CI) 0.87 (0.68, 1.11); P = 0.25. We found no significant associations with any secondary outcomes. In the 8005 open colectomies, however, there was a significant association between epidural analgesia and fewer cardiopulmonary complications (average relative effect odds ratio [95% CI] of 0.58 [0.35, 0.95]; P = 0.03) and shortened hospital stay (HR for time to discharge [98.75% CI] of 1.10 [1.02, 1.18]; P < 0.001).Conclusions:We found no overall association between epidural analgesia and reduced complications after colectomy. In open colectomies, however, epidural analgesia was associated with fewer cardiopulmonary complications and shorter hospitalization. This may inform analgesic choice when planning open colectomy.
