Introduction:Despite advances in diagnostic and therapeutic means,mortality of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on liver cirrhosis remainsheavy in the absence of curative treatment.Aim:To evaluate survival and to identify prognostic factors during HCC.Methods:A mono centric retrospective study over a period of13 years (January 2002-October 2015), including all patients with HHConcirrhotic liver was performed. Survival analysis was performed accordingto the Kaplan-Meier method. The prognostic factors of survival weredetermined by the Log Rank test.Results:Ninety four patients wereincluded (meanage 66.18 years, sexratio 1.65). Cirrhosiswassecondary to hepatitis B or C in 73.6%). Twentytwo patients responded to the MILAN criteria. Cirrhosiswasrated Child A,B and C in 30.9%, 46.8% and 22.3% of patients, respectively. A Curativetreatment was possible for only 10 patients (11.2%). In our study, meansurvival was 15.1 months and overall survival at 1 year and 2 years were25.5% and 21.3%, respectively. Nine factors associated with shortersurvival were identified : a Child-Pugh stage B or C; the absence ofscreening; an AFP level of> 400ng / ml; the existence of vascularthrombosis; a CHC evolved according to the classification of Milan; anOKUDA III score; CLIP score â‰¥ 3; a BCLC stage C or D; palliative orsymptomatic treatment.Conclusion:Although the best treatment of HCC remainspreventive, theuse of new prognostic scores couldimprove the management of patientsifintegrated in therapeuticalgorithms.
