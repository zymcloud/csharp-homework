Objectives:Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) are a type of noncoding RNA that comprise of longer than 200 nucleotides sequences. They can regulate chromosome structure, gene expression and play an essential role in the pathophysiology of human diseases, especially in tumorigenesis and progression. Nowadays, they are being targeted as potential biomarkers for various cancer types. And many research studies have proven that lncRNAs might bring a new era to cancer diagnosis and support treatment management. The purpose of this review was to inspect the molecular mechanism and clinical significance of long non-coding RNA- differentiation antagonizing nonprotein coding RNA(DANCR) in various types of human cancers.Materials and methods:In this review, we summarize and figure out recent research studies concerning the expression and biological mechanisms of lncRNA-DANCR in tumour development. The related studies were obtained through a systematic search of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library.Results:Long non-coding RNAs-DANCR is a valuable cancer-related lncRNA that its dysregulated expression was found in a variety of malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, glioma, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and lung cancer. The aberrant expressions of DANCR have been shown to contribute to proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cells.Conclusions:Long non-coding RNAs-DANCR likely serves as a useful disease biomarker or therapeutic cancer target.
Long non-coding RNA-DANCR; Valuable biomarker.
