This study aimed to evaluate the effects of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after liver transplantation. Data of 195 patients were retrospectively analysed. Post-reperfusion aspartate (AST), alanine transaminase, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were the primary measures of IRI. Tumour recurrence was the primary endpoint. Post-reperfusion AST was a continuous risk factor for tumour recurrence in patients within Milan criteria (p = 0.035), with an optimal cut-off of 1896 U/L. Recurrence-free survival of patients within Milan criteria and post-reperfusion AST of
