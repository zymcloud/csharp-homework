Background & aims:Reduction in portal pressure by self-expandable polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)-covered transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) is a treatment option for refractory ascites. Data on clinical outcomes after ePTFE-TIPS vs repetitive large-volume paracentesis (LVP) plus albumin (A) administration for the treatment of patients with refractory ascites are limited.Methods:Retrospective comparison of ePTFE-TIPS vs LVP+A in terms of (i) control of ascites, (ii) occurrence of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and (iii) transplant-free survival in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites.Results:Among n = 221 patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites, n = 140 received ePTFE-TIPS and were compared to n = 71 patients undergoing repetitive LVP+A. After ePTFE-TIPS, ascites was controlled without any further need for paracentesis in n = 76 (54%; n = 7 without and n = 69 with diuretics). The need for frequent large-volume paracentesis was significantly higher in the LVP+A group than with ePTFE-TIPS (median 0.67 (IQR: 0.23-2.63) months vs 49.5 (IQR: 5.07-102.60) months until paracentesis, log-rank P Conclusions:ePTFE-TIPS results in superior control of ascites without increasing the risk for overt HE as compared to LVP+A. Although ePTFE-TIPS improved 1-year survival in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites, its use was not independently associated with transplant-free survival.
