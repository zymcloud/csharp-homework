YAP-TEAD complex plays an important role in tumorigenesis. 5-HT is proved to upregulate YAP expression by our previous study and VGLL4 is found to compete with YAP for binding to TEAD in several of cancers. Here, we investigated whether 5-HT could affect progression and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and regulate YAP/VGLL4 balance. We found that 5-HT and YAP/VGLL4 ratio were higher in HCC patients and closely related with progression and poor prognosis. Furthermore, 5-HT level, YAP/VGLL4 ratio and tumor size were proved as independent risk factors of HCC patients in our study. Based on the independent risk factors, nomogram was established to exactly predict prognosis of HCC patients. Additionally, the study revealed that a higher total point of the nomogram was closely correlated with poorer prognosis. As a result, 5-HT might contribute to the progression and poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma via regulating YAP/VGLL4 balance. Therefore, the established nomogram based on the independent risk factors may become an important part of HCC prediction system and YAP/VGLL4 balance may be a potential therapeutic target in future.
