Objective:The purpose of this article is to discuss the use, comparative efficacy, and general technical considerations of percutaneous ablation, alone or in combination with other therapies, for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Conclusion:Percutaneous ablation is a mainstay treatment for early-stage HCC, offering survival comparable to that of surgical resection for small lesions. It can act as a primary curative therapy or bridge therapy for patients waiting to undergo liver transplant. New ablation modalities and combining tumor ablation with other therapies, such as transarterial chemoembolization, can improve clinical outcomes and allow treatment of larger lesions. Combining thermal ablation with systemic chemotherapy, including immunotherapy, is an area of future development.
