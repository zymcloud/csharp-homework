Background and Aim: Liver is the main site of metastases of gastrointestinal cancers, chemotherapy with or without targeted therapy is the standard treatment. Radiologic assessment of tumor response is usually done by the use of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) criteria. RECIST depends on tumor size changes but it does not address morphologic changes as overall attenuation, enhancement and tumor liver interface changes which may shown early before tumor size changes. We aimed to evaluate use of contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) new morphologic criteria in assessment of response in patients with hepatic metastases of gastrointestinal origin. Methods: This study was carried out by cooperation between Clinical Oncology and Nuclear Medicine and Radiodiagnosis Departments, Faculty of Medicine, Menoufia University. During the period from April 2015 to December 2016 forty patients with stage IV gastrointestinal cancers with hepatic metastases were included, CECT was done before and after systemic treatment, response evaluation was done by RECIST 1.1 and morphology response criteriac. Results: By RECIST, partial response (PR) observed in 57.5%, stable disease (SD) 22.5% and progressive disease (PD) in 20% of patients compared to Optimal response 42.5%, incomplete response 35% and no response in 22.5% of patients by Morphologic response criteria. Regarding survival, patients with PR had median survival of 20 months (95% CI, 17.988 to 22.012months) versus 11 months (95% CI, 1.235 to 8.580 months) in SD or PD by RECIST, (P=.002). while by morphology response criteria the median overall survival of optimally responded patients 23 months (95% CI, 20.04 to 27.81months) versus 16 months (95% CI, 5.590 to 5.044 months) in patients with incomplete or no morphologic response (P=.001). Conclusion: Morphologic response criteria are accurate method for assessment of response of hepatic metastases and correlated well with patientsâ€™ survival and better to be incorporated to treatment evaluation.
