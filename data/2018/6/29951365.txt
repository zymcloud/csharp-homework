Liver fibrosis (LF), a common consequence of chronic liver diseases with various etiologies, is characterized by excessive accumulation of macromolecules, including collagen, glycoproteins and proteoglycans, in the liver. LF can result in hepatic dysfunction, cirrhosis, portal hypertension and, in some cases, hepatocellular carcinoma. As the current gold standard for diagnosing LF, liver biopsy, however, is invasive and prone to sampling errors and procedure-related complications. Therefore, developing noninvasive, precise and reproducible imaging tests for diagnosing and staging LF is of great significance. Conventional ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can depict morphological alterations of advanced LF, but have relatively limited capability characterizing early-stage LF. In order to optimize the diagnostic performances of noninvasive imaging techniques for LF across its entire spectrum of severity, a number of novel methods, including US elastography, CT perfusion imaging and various MR imaging-based techniques, have been established and introduced to clinical practice. In this review, we intended to summarize current noninvasive imaging techniques for LF, with special emphasis on the possible roles, advantages and limitations of the new emerging imaging modalities.
