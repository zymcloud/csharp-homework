Aim:To investigate the long-term shunt patency and overall survival of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement using covered stents with or without bare stents over a follow-up period up to 7 years.Materials and methods:A total of 154 patients undergoing TIPS placement were enrolled and analysed retrospectively. They were divided into two groups: those undergoing TIPS placement using covered with bare stents (group A, n=42) and those without bare stents (group B, n=112).Results:The cumulative 5-year primary patency rate was significantly lower in group A than in group B (group A: 0% versus group B: 66.7%; pConclusions:Although TIPS placement using covered with bare stents led to lowered long-term shunt patency than using covered stents alone, the overall survival rates were similar.
