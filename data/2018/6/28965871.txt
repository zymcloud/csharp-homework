Digestive malignancies are the leading cause of mortality among all neoplasms, contributing to estimated 3 million deaths in 2012 worldwide. The mortality rate hassurpassed lung cancer and prostate cancer in recent years. The transcription factor Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1) is a key member of Forkhead Box family, regulating diverse cellular functions during tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. In this review, we focus on recent studies investigating the antineoplastic role of FOXO1 in digestive malignancy. This review aims to serve as a guide for further research and implicate FOXO1 as a potent therapeutic target in digestive malignancy.
