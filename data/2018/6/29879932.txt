Background:The genetic profile for human papilloma virus positive (HPV+) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC) remains largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to sequence tissue material from a large cohort of locoregionally-advanced HPV+ OPSCCs.Methods:We performed targeted deep sequencing of 395 cancer-associated genes in 114 matched tumor/normal loco-regionally advanced HPV+ OPSCCs. Mutations and copy number aberrations were determined.Results:We identified a total of 3459 mutations with an average of 10 mutations per megabase and a median of 28 variants per sample. The most frequently mutated genes were KALRN (28%), SPTBN1 (32%), KMT2A (31%), ZNRF3 (9%), BNC2 (12%), NOTCH2 (25%), FGFR2 (12%), SMAD2 (6%), and AR (13%). Our findings were dominated by COSMIC signature 5 and 12, represented in other head and neck cancers and in hepatocellular carcinomas, respectively.Conclusions:We have identified multiple genetic aberrations in HPV+ OPSCCs, and the COSMIC signature 12 as most prevalent. The mutations harbour both therapeutic and prognostic potential.
