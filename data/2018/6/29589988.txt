Background:Class III obesity is a global health emergency associated with an increase in the incidence of many other diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cancer, obstructive sleep apnea, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, osteoarthritis, infertility, and mental health disorders. Minimal work has been published regarding the efficacy of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in the veteran population to surgically manage morbid obesity.Design:Retrospective analysis of LSG performed at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) between 2010 and 2017. Veterans were followed from their enrollment in the bariatric program until twelve months following LSG. The primary outcome of interest was excess and total weight loss with resolution of associated comorbidities.Results:Excess weight loss at nine and 12 months was 43.5% and 40.7% and total weight loss was 20.1% and 19.0%, respectively. LSG performed at a VAMC resulted in 86.9% improvement in type 2 diabetes mellitus and a 66.1% improvement in hypertension and 74.3% improvement in hyperlipidemia. Approximately 10.0% of diabetics obtained partial and 9.0% obtained complete resolution of their disease. Similarly, 22.0% of Veterans obtained partial and 13.0% obtained complete resolution from hypertension. Complete resolution from hyperlipidemia was achieved in 8.8% of Veterans. There were no postoperative complications or staple line leaks.Conclusion:LSG is a safe and effective tool for morbid obesity with clinical and serological improvements for individuals who are unable to lose weight with medical management alone.
