Objective:Liver metastases occur in approximately 4%-14% of gastric cancer patients and are associated with high mortality. However, no standardized treatment approach is available for these patients. We aimed to assess the clinical outcomes of patients with gastric cancer liver metastases (GCLM) who underwent percutaneous cryoablation.Methods:We retrospectively enrolled 19 patients with 27 metastatic hepatic tumors who underwent cryoablation for liver metastases after gastrectomy for primary gastric cancer. Complications, overall survival (OS), local tumor progression-free survival (PFS), recurrence rates, and quality of life were assessed.Results:After cryoablation therapy, the median OS for all 19 patients was 16.0 months (range, 5-50 months), and the 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 78.9%, 43.4%, and 21.7%, respectively. The median local tumor PFS was 8.0 months (range, 3-24 months), and the local tumor PFS rates at 6 and 12 months were 59.2% and 23.2%, respectively. Overall, patients' quality of life improved after cryoablation therapy (P < 0.05). Complications in this study were mild; no severe complications caused by technique were detected.Conclusions:Cryoablation provided good local control, improved patients' quality of life and had a low complication rate. Our research showed that cryoablation may be an effective palliative treatment for GCLM.
