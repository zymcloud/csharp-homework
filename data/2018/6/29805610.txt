Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can result from hepatitis B or C infection, fibrosis or cirrhosis. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is one of the main growth factors associated with fibrosis or cirrhosis progression in the liver, but its role is controversial in hepatocarcinogenesis. In the present study, the effect of TGF-β on the HCC Huh-7 and Huh-Bat cell lines was evaluated. To study the effect of TGF-β, Huh-7 and Huh-Bat cells were treated with TGF-β and a TGF-β receptor inhibitor (SB431542). Cell survival, cell cycle, numbers of side population (SP) cells and expression of the cancer stem cell marker cluster of differentiation (CD)133, epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers (E-cadherin, α-smooth muscle actin and vimentin) and TGF-β-regulated proteins [phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK), p-c-Jun and p-smad2] were investigated. TGF-β treatment resulted in decreased cell survival with a targeted effect on SP cells. Expression of CD133 and vimentin was upregulated by treatment with the TGF-β receptor antagonist SB431542, but not with TGF-β. By contrast, TGF-β induced accumulation of cells at G0/G1, and upregulated expression of p-JNK, p-c-Jun and p-smad2. However, these effects were blocked when cells were treated with TGF-β plus SB431542, indicating the specificity of the TGF-β effect. The present results indicated that TGF-β has anticancer effects mediated by survival inhibition of cancer stem cells, which may be developed as a novel therapy for HCC.
