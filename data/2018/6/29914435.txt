Background:This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of drug eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) treatment by CalliSpheres速 in Chinese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as the predicting factors for response.Methods:99 patients with HCC were consecutively enrolled in this study. All participants were treated by CalliSpheres速 DEB-TACE. Clinical response was evaluated according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) criteria. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) was used to assess the adverse events and liver dysfunction during and after the operation.Results:Post treatment, 16 patients (16.2%) achieved CR and 59 (59.6%) achieved PR, the ORR was 75.8%. Subgroup analysis showed that patients with higher BCLC stage were of worse CR and ORR rates, and the CR as well as ORR between patients with cTACE history and patients without cTACE history were similar. Univariate logistic regression analysis displayed that number of nodules > 3, higher BCLC stage and previous cTACE might be correlated with worse ORR but with no statistical significance. As to liver function, CTCAE grades of laboratory indexes for liver function were increased at 1 week compared to baseline and recovered to the baseline grades at 1-3 months post operation. Besides, most of the common adverse events were light and moderate in our study.Conclusions:In conclusion, DEB-TACE by CalliSpheres速 was efficient and well tolerated in Chinese HCC patients, and BCLC stage, number of nodules and cTACE history were possibly correlated with treatment response.
