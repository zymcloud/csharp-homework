The Fontan procedures, designed to treat paediatric patients with functional single ventricles, have markedly improved the patient's survival into adulthood. The physiology of the Fontan circuit inevitably increases systemic venous pressure, which may lead to multi-system organ failure in the long-term follow-up. Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD) can progress to liver cirrhosis with signs of portal hypertension. Focal nodular hyperplasia-like nodules commonly develop in FALD. Imaging surveillance is often performed to monitor the progression of FALD and to detect hepatocellular carcinoma, which infrequently develops in FALD. Other abdominal abnormalities in post-Fontan patients include protein losing enteropathy and pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma. Given that these abdominal abnormalities are critical for patient management, it is important for radiologists to become familiar with the abdominal abnormalities that are common in post-Fontan patients on cross-sectional imaging.Teaching points:• Fontan procedure for functional single ventricle has improved patient survival into adulthood. • Radiologists should be familiar with unique imaging findings of Fontan-associated liver disease. • Focal nodular hyperplasia-like nodules commonly develop in Fontan-associated liver disease. • Hepatocellular carcinoma, protein-losing enteropathy, pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma may develop.
