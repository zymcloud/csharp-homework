Aim:Some patients who achieve a sustained virological response (SVR) to interferon (IFN) treatment for chronic hepatitis C prior to hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) experience postoperative recurrence. This study investigated the relationship between obesity and postoperative HCC recurrence in SVR patients.Methods:Fifty-nine patients who had achieved SVR before hepatic resection were evaluated. Patients had a solitary tumor ≤5 cm in diameter or ≤3 lesions each ≤3 cm in size with no macroscopic vascular invasion (Milan criteria). Patient characteristics potentially associated with recurrence risk were investigated.Results:Three-, 5-, and 7-year recurrence-free survival after surgery were 65%, 44%, and 41%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that obesity (P < .01), hypertension (P = .038), and non-anatomical resection (P = .022) were significantly associated with a lower recurrence-free survival rate. In a multivariate analysis, obesity (hazard ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-6.1; P < .01) and non-anatomical resection (hazard ratio, 2.7; 95% CI 1.1-6.2; P = .025) were independently associated with postoperative recurrence. Three-, 5-, and 7-year overall survival rates after surgery were 100%, 80%, and 64% in obese patients and 100%, 92%, and 82% in non-obese patients, respectively (P = .014). However, other variables showed no significant difference in the overall survival rate.Conclusions:Obesity and non-anatomical resection were independent risk factors for HCC recurrence after hepatic resection and successful IFN therapy. Obesity is an important clinical problem to consider to improve postoperative outcomes in such patients.
