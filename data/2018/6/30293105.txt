This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) isolated from Artemia salina against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) both in vitro (HepG2) and in vivo (diethylnitrosamine-induced HCC in rats) and to investigate the involved underlying mechanisms. Administration of CNPs decreased HCC progression as evidenced by (1) induced HepG2 cell death as detected by MTT assay; (2) induced necrosis as indicated by acridine orange/propidium iodide (AO/PI) red staining, annexin V/7-AAD positive staining (detected by flow cytometry), and upregulated expression of necrosis markers (PARP1 and its downstream target, RIP1 genes), but no effect on apoptosis as revealed by insignificant changes in caspase 3 activity and mRNA levels of Bax and AIF; (3) increased intracellular ROS and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in HepG2; (4) decreased liver relative weight, serum levels of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and ALP), total bilirubin, and cancer markers (AFP and GGT), number and area of GST-P positive tumor nodules; and (5) reduced oxidative stress (decrease in MDA levels) and increased activities of SOD, CAT, and GPx enzymes in rat liver. The preventive (pre-treatment) effect of CNPs was better than the therapeutic (post-treatment) effect. Collectively, administration of CNPs inhibited HCC progression in vitro and in vivo, possibly through induction of necrosis, rather than apoptosis, and induction of antioxidant enzyme activities in vivo, but with stimulation of ROS production in vitro. Thus, CNPs could be used as a promise agent for treating HCC after application of further confirmatory clinical trials.
