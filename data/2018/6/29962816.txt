Aim:To determine a panel of serum microRNAs (miRNAs) that could be used as novel biomarkers for diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We initially screened 9 out of 754 serum miRNAs by TaqMan Low Density Array in two pooled samples respectively from 35 HCC and 35 normal controls, and then validated individually by RT-qPCR in another 114 patients and 114 controls arranged in two phases. The changes of the selected miRNAs after operation and their prognostic value were examined.Results:miR-375, miR-10a, miR-122 and miR-423 were found to be significantly higher in HCC than in controls (P < 0.0001), and the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve for the 4-miRNA panel was 0.995 (95%CI: 0.985-1). All the four miRNAs were significantly reduced after surgical removal of the tumors (P < 0.0001), while still higher than normal controls (at least P < 0.05).Conclusion:The four serum miRNAs (miR-375, miR-10a, miR-122 and miR-423) could potentially serve as novel biomarkers for the diagnostic and prognostic of HCC.
