Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the prevalent type of primary liver malignancy. Different noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that negatively regulate gene expression, such as the microRNAs and the long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), have been associated with cell invasiveness and cell dissemination, tumor recurrence, and metastasis in HCC. To evaluate which regulatory ncRNAs might be good candidates to disrupt HCC proliferation pathways, we performed both unsupervised and supervised analyses of HCC expression data, comparing samples of solid tumor tissue (TP) and adjacent tissue (NT) of a set of patients, focusing on ncRNAs and searching for common mechanisms that may shed light in future therapeutic options. All analyses were performed using the R software. Differential expression (total RNA and miRNA) and enrichment analyses (Gene Ontology + Pathways) were performed using the package TCGABiolinks. As a result, we improved the set of lncRNAs that could be the target of future studies in HCC, highlighting the potential of FAM170B-AS1 and TTN-AS1.
