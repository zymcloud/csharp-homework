Aims:Several studies suggested that miR-499 rs3746444 polymorphism was associated with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, other studies did not confirm the result. To derive a more comprehensive estimation of the association between miR-499 rs3746444 polymorphism and HCC risk, we conducted a meta-analysis.Materials and methods:PUBMED, COCHRANE, and WEB OF SCIENCE databases were retrieved for the association studies focused on the relationship between miR-499 rs3746444 polymorphism and the risk of HCC. The strength of the associations between miR-499 rs3746444 polymorphism and the risk of HCC was measured by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results:A statistically significant association between miR-499 rs3746444 polymorphism and the risk of HCC was fond (OR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04-1.52; P = 0.02). In the subgroup analysis of race, Asian population with miR-499 rs3746444 polymorphism showed increased HCC risk (OR = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03-1.62; P = 0.03). In the subgroup analysis of hepatitis virus status, patients with HBV and miR-499 rs3746444 polymorphism showed increased HCC risk (OR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.17-1.64; P = 0.0002). In the subgroup analysis of source of control, both hospital- and population-based studies found significant results (OR = 1.46; 95% CI, 1.12-1.90; P = 0.005; OR = 1.19; 95% CI, 1.01-1.40; P = 0.04).Conclusions:This meta-analysis suggested that mir-499 rs3746444 polymorphism was associated with an increased HCC risk.
