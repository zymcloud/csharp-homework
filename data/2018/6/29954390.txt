Background:Splenosis is the heterotopic autotransplantation and implantation of splenic tissue after splenic trauma or splenectomy. Considering that splenosis often occurs in the mesentery, omentum, and peritoneum, intrahepatic splenosis has seldom been reported. We report a rare case of isolated intrahepatic splenosis in a 54-year-old man who presented with a liver mass thought to be hepatocellular carcinoma.Case presentation:A 54-year-old man was referred to our hospital for further evaluation of a liver lesion. The patient was asymptomatic and had a history of emergent splenectomy after a high-altitude falling accident. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a 4.5 Ã— 3.3 cm lesion that was located in segment IV of the left liver lobe. The lesion had an inhomogeneous enhancement during the arterial phase and diminished enhancement during the portal and equilibrium phases. Similar radiological features were also observed on a contrast magnetic resonance imaging scan. Partial hepatectomy was performed with the suspicion of hepatocellular carcinoma. Pathological examination of the liver specimen revealed intrahepatic splenosis.Conclusion:Splenosis should be considered in differential diagnosis of a liver mass discovered years after splenic trauma or surgery. A proposed scoring system may be helpful in evaluating the suspicious degree of intrahepatic mass to be splenosis. Invasive treatments are not recommended for asymptomatic patients, since the splenosis can provide beneficial immunologic function.
