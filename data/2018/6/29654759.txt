Emerging evidence suggests that small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) have malfunctioning roles in oncogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the role of box C/D small nucleolar RNA U2_19 (snoU2_19) in the tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, we screened snoRNAs differential signatures by performing high-throughput small RNA sequence in HCC tissues and validated that upregulated snoU2_19 was associated with aggressive phenotypes in HCC patients. Aberrant snoU2_19 facilitated HCC cell proliferation, inhibited apoptosis and induced cell cycle progression in vitro analyses. We globally investigated the molecular mechanisms of snoU2_19 in HCC and found that snoU2_19 knockdown inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway through inducing the translocation of β-catenin in cytoplasm. We concluded that snoU2_19 plays a pathological role in the development and progression of HCC, and is a potential therapeutic target for HCC.
