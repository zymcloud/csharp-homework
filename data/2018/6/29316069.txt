Nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) have been shown to decrease the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence. This study evaluated whether high-potency NAs (entecavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF]) reduce the risk of tumour recurrence more potently than low-potency NAs after curative treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC. This study included 607 consecutive HBV-related HCC patients treated with surgical resection or radiofrequency ablation. The patients were categorized into three groups according to antiviral treatment: group A (no antiviral; n = 261), group B (low-potency NA; n = 90) and group C (high-potency NA; n = 256). The primary end-point was recurrence-free survival (RFS). During the duration of follow-up, the median RFS was 29.4, 25.1, and 88.2 months in groups A, B and C, respectively (P
