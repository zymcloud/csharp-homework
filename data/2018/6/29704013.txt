Clinical/methodical issue:Cross-sectional modalities or conventional ultrasound are not always able to sufficiently identify and characterize malignant liver lesions.Standard radiological methods:The evaluation of malignant liver lesions in conventional ultrasound relies on echostructure, shape and borders, but often warrants additional contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies.Methodical innovations:Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a relatively safe imaging technique used for the detection and characterization of malignant liver lesions. The use of a second-generation contrast agent in dynamic real-time imaging allows the visualization of vascularization in any kind of liver lesion as well as liver perfusion during the arterial, portal venous and late phase.Performance:Due to the different enhancement patterns, it is possible to differentiate a liver lesion with high diagnostic accuracy (over 90%).Achievements:CEUS is a helpful complementary technique to cross-sectional imaging for the evaluation of unclear liver lesions and may frequently obviate additional contrast-enhanced MRI or CT studies.Practical recommendations:CEUS enables the detection and characterization of liver lesions in real time.
