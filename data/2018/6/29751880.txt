Tissue diagnosis is the gold standard for mass lesions of the liver, but needle core biopsies may sometimes prove challenging. Presented here is a review of a panel of immunohistochemical stains, including hepatocyte in paraffin 1, arginase-1, polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen, CD10, bile salt export pump, glypican-3, as well as in situ hybridization for albumin RNA, to establish hepatocellular origin in cases in which hepatocellular carcinoma is suspected but the sample is limited or the morphology is challenging, as it may be with cases of scirrhous, fibrolamellar carcinoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma.
