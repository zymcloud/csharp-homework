Background and aims:In the context of the shortage of donors, adult living donor liver transplantation (aLDLT) represents a feasible alternative for patients within as well as beyond the Milan criteria.Methods:From 2001, we performed 42 aLDLTs for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sixteen of the recipients were within the Milan criteria, whereas 26 fulfilled the Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer Group (BCLC) expanded criteria (1 tumor ≤7 cm, 5 tumors ≤3 cm, or tumors 3 ≤5 cm without macrovascular invasion or down-staging to Milan after loco-regional therapies). The objective of the current study was to compare the post-transplantation results of these two groups.Results:Six Milan-in and 16 beyond Milan patients received neo-adjuvant loco-regional therapies. One Milan-in and nine patients from the beyond Milan group presented an explant histological stage beyond Milan. After a median follow-up of 64 months, 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 60.2% and 51.6% in the Milan-in group and 78% and 65% in the beyond Milan group. Five- and 10-year disease-free survival rates were 64.5% and 55.3% in the Milan-in patients and 67.9% and 56.6% in the beyond Milan patients. Being beyond up-to-seven criteria in the histology of the explant was a significant factor for HCC recurrence.Conclusion:The use of aLDLT in patients with HCC within and beyond Milan but within the BCLC expanded criteria offers acceptable survival and recurrence rates. Therefore, we believe that its use in this scenario is justified.
