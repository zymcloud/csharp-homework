Background:Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) has been widely described for colorectal liver metastases with insufficient future liver remnant (FLR). However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poorly defined and not widely accepted.Methods:A retrospective comparison of clinical data, liver volumetry, histological characteristics, and surgical outcomes between nine HCC and four non-HCC patients who underwent ALPPS was performed.Results:Patients with HCC were more likely to have histological evidence of hepatic fibrosis (HCC vs. non-HCC, 66.7 vs. 0%, p = 0.049). Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were otherwise comparable between both groups. FLR growth after ALPPS-Stage 1 was significantly less in HCC patients (HCC vs. non-HCC, 154.5 vs. 251.0 ml, p = 0.012). FLR growth was also significantly decreased in patients with hepatic fibrosis (fibrosis vs. non-fibrosis, 157.5 vs. 247.5 ml, p = 0.033). There was no difference in post-hepatectomy liver failure (HCC vs. non-HCC, 28.6 vs. 25%, p = 0.721) or 90-day mortality (HCC vs. non-HCC, 11.1 vs. 0%, p = NS).Discussion:In our study, HCC patients demonstrated significantly less FLR growth after ALPPS-Stage 1 compared to non-HCC patients. Hepatic fibrosis was also found to negatively impact FLR growth. When considering suitability for ALPPS, patients with HCC may benefit from additional pre-operative assessment of fibrosis.
