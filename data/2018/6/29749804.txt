Aim:To evaluate intravenously injected bovine serum albumin-templated gold nanoparticles (BSA-GNPs) for radiosensitization effects on H22 hepatoma-bearing mice.Materials & methods:BSA-GNPs in different size were injected intravenously with a dose of 4 mg Au/kg. After 30 min injection, the tumor-bearing mice were irradiated with 5 Gy x-ray.Results:BSA-GNPs in 8, 50 and 187 nm were synthesized and have no obvious cytotoxicity to HeLa, HepG2 and HeCat cells when the concentration was up to 32 Î¼M. And no obvious physiological injury of mice occurred when the intravenous injection dose was 4 mg Au/kg. In vivo study indicates 8 and 50 nm BSA-GNPs can inhibit tumor growth through inducing apoptosis in radiotherapy, with enhancement factors 1.93 and 2.02, respectively.Conclusion:BSA-GNPs in 8 and 50 nm are promising radiosensitizers in radiotherapy of subcutaneously transplanted hepatocarcinoma.
