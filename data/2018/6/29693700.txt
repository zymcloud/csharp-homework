The present study aimed to investigate the anticancer effect of sorafenib combined with silencing of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and to assess the underlying molecular mechanisms. Huh‑7 HCC cell line was selected for the present study. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)‑ATF2 sequence was constructed to silence ATF2 expression. The experiment was divided into 6 groups: i) Control; ii) vector; iii) sorafenib (6.8 µM); iv) vector+sorafenib; v) siRNA‑ATF2; and vi) siRNA‑ATF2+sorafenib groups. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were detected following treatments with sorafenib and/or ATF2 silencing. Additionally, expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α and c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) was detected using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The current findings revealed that siRNA‑ATF2 significantly reduced ATF2 expression. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion abilities in the sorafenib and siRNA‑ATF2 groups were significantly reduced compared with the control group (P
