Purpose:Accumulating evidence indicates that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are aberrantly expressed in many cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). lncRNA MYC-induced long non-coding RNA (MINCR) were revealed to be markedly up-regulated in gallbladder cancer and Burkitt lymphoma cells. However, the biological role and function of MINCR in HCC progression are still unknown.Methods:The expression of MINCR in HCC tissues and cell lines was determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. The effects of MINCR in HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were determined using cell-counting kit 8 (CCK8) assay, wound healing assay, and Transwell assays in vitro.Results:MINCR expression was up-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines as compared with that in the negative control. The decreased expression of MINCR in vitro markedly inhibited HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Our results showed that MINCR is important in HCC development and may act as a therapeutic target that regulates HCC cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion, which are involved in HCC tumorigenesis.Conclusions:To the best of our know ledge, MINCR in HCC has not been studied. Our findings showed that this study is the first to reveal that MINCR may act as a therapeutic target in HCC. The in-depth exploration of the molecular mechanism is required to illuminate the molecular mechanisms of MINCR in HCC development.
