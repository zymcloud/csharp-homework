A CT scan was performed on a 67-year-old man newly diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. The scan revealed a low-density lesion in the liver, a left renal nodule, and a right renal cystic mass. Intense F-FDG uptake was observed in the liver lesion and left renal nodule. No abnormal uptake was observed in the right renal mass. In addition, another focal intense uptake was observed in segment VII of the liver. Biopsies revealed intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas in the 2 liver lesions, papillary renal cell carcinoma in the left renal lesion and clear cell renal cell carcinoma in the right renal lesion.
