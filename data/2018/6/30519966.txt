Purpose:We aimed to assess the diagnostic reliability of two indirect biomarkers, APRI and FIB-4, for the staging of liver fibrosis using transient elastography (TE) as reference standard, among HIV/HCV co-infected and HCV mono-infected patients.Methods:This is an observational, retrospective study on subjects who had access to the RESIST HCV from October 2013 to December 2016, a regional network encompassing 22 hospitals and academic centers throughout Sicily. Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of indirect biomarkers for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) < 9.5 kPa (significant fibrosis) and LSM ≥ 12.5 kPa (cirrhosis) were determined by receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves.Results:238 HIV/HCV co-infected and 1937 HCV mono-infected patients were included. Performances of FIB-4 and APRI for the detection of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis proved to be unsatisfactory, with very high false negative and false positive rates among both cohorts. No significant differences were found after stratification of HIV/HCV co-infected patients for BMI < or ≥ 25, ALT < or ≥ 40 IU/L, ALT < or ≥ 80 IU/L, and presence/absence of a bright liver echo pattern on ultrasonography.Conclusions:Differently from other studies, we detected the unreliability of APRI and FIB-4 for the assessment of liver fibrosis in both HCV mono-infected and HIV/HCV co-infected patients.
