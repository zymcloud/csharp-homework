A new polyprenylated polycyclic acylphloroglucinol, garcimultiflorone K (1), has been isolated from the stems of Garcinia multiflora, together with two known compounds, garcimultiflorone A (2) and garcimultiflorone B (3). The structure of new compound 1 was determined through spectroscopic methods including 1D and 2D NMR and MS analyses. The anti-angiogenic and anti-cancer effects of compounds 1-3 were evaluated in human endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and cancer cells. Of these, garcimultiflorone K (1) displayed the most potent anti-angiogenic property by suppressing cell growth and tube formation of EPCs. Compound 1 also exhibited growth-inhibitory activities against human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line SK-Hep-1 and hormone refractory prostate cancer cell line PC-3 with GI50 values of 4.3 ± 1.6 and 6.6 ± 0.4 μM, respectively.
