Aim:To determine if CXCL12 (rs1801157) and CXCR4 (rs2228014) polymorphisms are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) susceptibility, and detect their expressions in peripheral blood.Methods:206 HCC patients, 252 chronic hepatitis B patients, 221 liver cirrhosis patients and 275 healthy volunteers were recruited. Genes CXCL12 and CXCR4 were amplified and genotyped. Their expression in peripheral blood were detected.Results:CXCL12 rs1801157 and CXCR4 rs2228014 polymorphisms were associated with increased susceptibility of HCC, and genotypes GA/AA and CT/TT may be risk factors of HCC (all p Conclusion:CXCL12 and CXCR4 polymorphisms may be risk factors for HCC, and they may be potential HCC markers.
