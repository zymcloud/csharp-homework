Objective:Pathogenesis and progression of liver cancer are correlated with inflammatory response and estrogen level. 17β-estradiol dehydrogenase IV (HSD17B4) is highly expressed in human liver cancer tissues. HSD17B4 participates in liver cancer cell proliferation via suppressing estradiol (E2) activity. This study generated a rat liver cancer model, on which the correlations between HSD17B4 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), proliferating cell nucleus antigen (PCNA) expression were analyzed.Materials and methods:Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned into control and model group (N=30). Diethylnitrosamine was used to induce liver cancer in a rat model. HE staining was used to observe liver injury whilst ELISA was used to measure serum TNF-α and IL-6 levels. The level of serum E2 was quantified by radioimmunoassay. Serum liver function indexes were measured by automatic biochemical analyzer. Protein expressions of HSD17B4, p-Akt, p-ERK and PCNA were measured by Western blot.Results:The inflammatory infiltration and necrosis of hepatocytes were shown in model group by HE staining, along with aggravated liver indexes. Significantly high phosphorylation level of Akt and ERK, along with the increase of HSD17B3 and PCNA expressions, was found in model group (pConclusions:HSD17B4 is over-expressed in rat liver cancer tissues. Its expression was positively correlated with TNF-α, IL-6 and PCNA levels, and probably participates in liver cancer cell proliferation via ERK and Akt signal pathway.
