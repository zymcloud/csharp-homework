Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related deceases worldwide. Early diagnosis is essential for correct management and improvement of prognosis. Proposed for the first time in 2011 and updated for the last time in 2017, the Liver Imaging-Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) is a comprehensive system for standardized interpretation and reporting of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) liver examinations, endorsed by the American College of Radiology to achieve congruence with HCC diagnostic criteria in at-risk populations. Understanding its algorithm is fundamental to correctly apply LI-RADS in clinical practice. In this pictorial review, we provide a guide for beginners, explaining LI-RADS indications, describing major and ancillary features and eventually elucidating the diagnostic algorithm with the use of some clinical examples.
