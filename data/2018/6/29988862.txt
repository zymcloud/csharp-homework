There are several causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but certainly the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the most common. The HCV is able to contribute, both directly and indirectly, to the development of HCC. Determining early HCV clearance before an advanced liver disease develops, is absolutely necessary as this prevents the initiation of the cascade of events induced by HCV that may result in the development of HCC. The early treatment of the infection and the clearance of HCV represents today, in the age of the direct antiviral agents (DAAs), an extraordinary opportunity for true prevention of the development of HCV-related HCC.
