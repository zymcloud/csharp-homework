Background:Our previous study showed that 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) is down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). But its function in HCC remains unknown. This study aimed to reveal the function of HSD17B13 and its clinical significance in HCC.Methods:mRNA levels of HSD17B13 were analyzed in cohort 1 (30 normal, 30 HBV cirrhosis, 60 HBV-related HCC and 60 peritumoral tissue) by real-time PCR. HSD17B13 protein was evaluated in cohort 2 (15 normal, 33 HBV-cirrhosis, 12 dysplastic nodules, 34 HBV-related HCC, and 9 metastatic HCC) using immunohistochemistry. The association between HSD17B13 and the survival of HCC patients was analyzed in cohort 3 (n = 88). The inhibitory mechanism of HSD17B13 on HCC was explored .Results:The mRNA of HSD17B13 and its protein expression were significantly down-regulated in HCC compared to non-tumor specimens (P Conclusions:Lower HSD17B13 in peritumoral tissues was associated with worse recurrence free survival and overall survival of HCC patients. HSD17B13 delayed G1/S progression of HCC cells. HSD17B13 may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.
