The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a transmembrane protein with elevated expression in prostate cancer cells. Breast cancer also shows PSMA expression. We present the case of a 30-year-old woman with triple-negative bilateral breast carcinoma who underwent bilateral mastectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. She developed a left chest wall and liver recurrence after primary therapy. Her recurrent disease was also triple-negative. In view of the known poor prognosis and very limited therapeutic options, we performed Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan to explore the possibility of PSMA-based therapy as a future option after exhausting standard-of-care treatments.
