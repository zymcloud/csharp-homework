Objective:To investigate the values of growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) level in the diagnosis of primary liver cancer and evaluation of chemotherapeutic effect.Patients and methods:92 patients with liver cancer treated from June 2015 to May 2016 were selected as liver cancer group; 53 patients with benign liver lesion were selected as benign liver disease group, and 40 healthy subjects receiving physical examination were selected as healthy control group. Fasting venous blood was drawn from objects of study in the early morning at 1 d after admission and at the last day after chemotherapy (liver cancer group), and the serum GDF-15 level was measured.Results:The serum GDF-15 levels in patients in liver cancer group and benign liver disease group were significantly higher than those in healthy control group and benign liver disease group (p<0.05). The serum GDF-15 levels in patients with stage III and IV liver cancer were significantly higher than those in patients with stage I and II liver cancer, and the serum GDF-15 level in patients with stage IV liver cancer was significantly higher than that in patients with stage III liver cancer (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in serum GDF-15 level among patients with different clinical data (p>0.05). The ROC curve analysis showed that the threshold value of GDF-15 was 1573.23 ng/L, and the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 81.23%, 83.99%, and 83.62%, respectively. The serum GDF-15 level in patients with progressive disease was significantly higher than those in patients with partial remission and stable disease, and the serum GDF-15 level in patients with stable disease was significantly higher than that in patients with partial remission (p<0.05).Conclusions:The serum GDF-15 level has certain clinical values in the diagnosis of primary liver cancer and evaluation of chemotherapeutic effect.
