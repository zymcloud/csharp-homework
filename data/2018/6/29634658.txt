Objective:This study was designed to investigate whether pretreatment fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) lean body mass-corrected parameters could predict the overall survival (OS) better than the established predictors in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:We retrospectively analyzed 61 patients with HCC with pretreatment F-FDG-PET/CT. Besides obtaining clinical factors, we measured both lean body mass-corrected and body weight-corrected PET/CT parameters, including metabolic tumor volume, maximal standardized uptake value of the tumor, total lesion glycolysis, tumor-to-normal liver uptake ratio, and so on. The prognostic value of those factors for OS was assessed by statistical software.Results:In the univariate analysis, PET/CT parameters, ascites, serum Î±-fetoprotein, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transaminase (AST), tumor number, tumor size of the maximal one, vascular invasion, TNM stage, Child-Pugh class, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging, and Okuda staging were significant predictors of OS. In multivariate and Kaplan-Meier analyses, lean body mass-corrected maximum standardized uptake value (lbmSUVmax) more than 3.35 g/ml, AST more than 42.00 U/l, and BCLC staging B-C were significant independent predictors of poor OS. When BCLC staging variable was stratified by four categories instead of two in the multivariate analysis, it was not the statistically significant independent predictor anymore, but lbmSUVmax and AST still were.Conclusion:Pretreatment F-FDG-PET/CT lean body mass-corrected parameters can predict the OS in patients with HCC. Moreover, lbmSUVmax and AST, as the independent predictors of OS, could supplement the prognostic value of the BCLC staging system.
