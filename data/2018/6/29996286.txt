Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of anatomic hepatectomy and non-anatomic hepatectomy in the treatment of single small Hepatocellular carcinoma with MVI. Methods: The clinical data of 84 patients with single small Hepatocellular carcinoma with MVI in Beijing Chaoyang Hospital between January 2008 and December 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients undergoing anatomical hepatectomy were enrolled in the AR group, and the patients undergoing non-anatomic hepatectomy were enrolled in the NR group. The efficacy and survival rate of the two groups were compared. Results: (1) Operation time, numbers of patients with volume of intraoperative blood loss ≥300 ml and number of patients with blood transfusion were (170±41)minutes, 8, 7 in the AR group and (148±35)minutes, 19, 18 in the NR group, respectively, with statistically significant differences between the 2 groups (P<0.05). (2) The 1-year, 2-year and 3-year overall survival rate were 85.7%, 68.6%, 57.1% in the AR group and 79.6%, 53.1%, 42.9% in the NR group, respectively. The 1-year, 2-year and 3-year progression-free survival rate were 80.0%, 62.9%, 51.4% in the AR group and 71.4%, 49.0%, 38.8%, in the NR group, respectively. There were statistically significant differences between the 2 groups both in the overall survival rate and the progression-free survival rate (P<0.05). (3) Prognostic factors analysis of HCC patients with MVI: result of univariate analysis showed that maximum diameter of tumor and surgical procedures were relative factors affecting overall survival and progression-free survival of HCC patients with MVI, AFP level was relative factors affecting progression-free survival of HCC patients with MVI, with statistically significant differences (P<0.05). Result of multivariate analysis showed that maximum diameter of tumor between 3.0 and 5.0 cm and non-anatomic liver resection were independent factors affecting poor overall survival and progression-free survival of HCC patients with MVI, and AFP≥20 μg/L and total bilirubin ≥20 μmol/L were independent factors affecting poor progression-free survival of HCC patients with MVI, with a statistically significant differences (P< 0.05). Conclusion: Anatomic hepatectomy for patients with single small hepatocellular carcinoma with microvascular invasion has better clinical efficacy and safety.
