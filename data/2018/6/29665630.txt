Background/aims:Portal vein invasion (PVI) is a poor prognostic factor in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We intended to compare the effects of surgical resection and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with additional radiation therapy (RT) in HCC patients with PVI.Methods:The subjects comprised 43 patients who underwent surgical resection for HCC with PVI without previous treatment and another 43 patients who received TACE followed by RT (TACE+RT) as initial treatment who were matched for Child-Pugh class, tumor size, and extent of PVI. Disease progression and death after the treatment were examined, and progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between groups. Predisposing factors affecting OS were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses in HCC patients with PVI.Results:The subjects (Age [51, 24-74; median, range], Sex [81/13; male/female], Etiology [78/1/15; hepatitis B virus {HBV}/ hepatitis C virus {HCV}/non-HBV and non-HCV]) were followed for a median of 17 (2-68) months. There were no differences in clinical or tumor characteristics between the resection and TACE+RT groups. The cumulative PFS was not significantly different between groups. The median PFS was 5.6 and 4.0 months in the resection and TACE+RT groups, respectively. However, the cumulative OS was significantly longer in patients treated with resection than in those treated with TACE+RT (P=0.04). The median OS was 26.9 and 14.2 months in the resection and TACE+RT groups, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that surgical resection was an independent predictive factor for better survival outcome.Conclusions:Surgical resection might be an effective treatment in HCC patients with PVI.
