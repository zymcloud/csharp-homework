Aim:To evaluate the association of 12 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) in three onco-long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes (HOTTIP, CCAT2, MALAT1) with the risk and prognosis of hepatocellular cancer (HCC).Methods:Twelve tagSNPs covering the three onco-lncRNAs were genotyped by the KASP method in a total of 1338 samples, including 521 HCC patients and frequency-matched 817 controls. The samples were obtained from an unrelated Chinese population at the First Hospital of China Medical University from 2012-2015. The expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses were conducted to explore further the potential function of the promising SNPs.Results:Three SNPs in HOTTIP, one promoter SNP in MALAT1, and one haplotype of HOTTIP were associated with HCC risk. The HOTTIP rs17501292, rs2067087, and rs17427960 SNPs were increased to 1.55-, 1.20-, and 1.18-fold HCC risk under allelic models (P = 0.012, 0.017 and 0.049, respectively). MALAT1 rs4102217 SNP was increased to a 1.32-fold HCC risk under dominant models (P = 0.028). In addition, the two-way interaction of HOTTIP rs17501292-MALAT1 rs619586 polymorphisms showed a decreased effect on HCC risk (Pinteraction = 0.028, OR = 0.30) and epistasis with each other. HOTTIP rs3807598 variant genotype showed significantly longer survival time in HBV negative subgroup (P = 0.049, HR = 0.12), and MALAT1 rs591291 showed significantly better prognosis in female and HBV negative subgroups (P = 0.022, HR = 0.37; P = 0.042, HR = 0.25, respectively). In the study, no significant effect was observed in eQTL analysis.Conclusion:Specific lncRNA (HOTTIP and MALAT1) SNPs have potential to be biomarkers for HCC risk and prognosis.
