Although the number of reports describing tumors in aged NHP has increased, spontaneous neoplasias in NHP are extremely rare, with the notable exception of prosimians, in which spontaneous hepatic neoplasms arise. In addition to radiography and ultrasonography, superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-enhanced MRI tends to be applied in human practice to non-invasively locate, identify, and size liver tumors and to define the border between neoplastic and normal tissues. Here we report a 13-y-old female cynomolgus monkey with anorexia and serologically normal liver enzymes. After fluid therapy, the condition remained in remission for several months. Later, however, a palpable mass was assessed by using ultrasonography, radiology, and SPIO-MRI; T2-weighted images revealed a clear border between a hepatocellular carcinoma and normal liver tissue. Findings at necropsy supported the imaging data. Serologic assessment after euthanasia revealed a positive reaction to an abnormal form of prothrombin (PIVKA-II). We recommend SPIO-MRI as a practical and useful for diagnosing hepatocellular neoplasias in NHP. This study is the first to demonstrate the applicability of SPIO-MRI for the identification of hepatocellular carcinoma in NHP.
