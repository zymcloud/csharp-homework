As a pattern recognition receptor, pentraxin 3 (PTX3) has been found to exert the pleiotropic roles on a variety of cancers. However, the accurate clinical significance of PTX3 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been well defined. The aim of the present investigation was to determine the expression characteristics, prognostic significance, and the relevant biological effect of PTX3 in HCC. The expression of PTX3 was evaluated in tumor and adjacent liver tissues from 210 HCC patients using immunohistochemistry staining. And it was found that a marked up-regulation in the expression of PTX3 in the HCC specimens, which was remarkably correlated with high serum AFP level (P = 0.006), larger tumor size (P in vivo experiments confirmed PTX3 induced EMT and promoted proliferation and growth of HCC cells. Collectivelly, these data indicated that PTX3 could accelerate HCC progression through activating EMT and served as a potential predictive factor and therapeutic target for HCC.
