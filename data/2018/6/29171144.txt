Background and aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Risk factors for developing HCC include viral hepatitis, alcohol and obesity. Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) bind long-chain free fatty acids (FFAs) and are expressed in a tissue-specific pattern; FABP1 being the predominant hepatic form, and FABP4 the predominant adipocyte form. The aims of this study were to investigate the expression and function of FABPs1-9 in human and animal models of obesity-related HCC.Methods:FABP1-9 expression was determined in a mouse model of obesity-promoted HCC. Based on these data, expression and function of FABP4 was determined in human HCC cells (HepG2 and HuH7) in vitro. Serum from patients with different underlying hepatic pathologies was analysed for circulating FABP4 levels.Results:Livers from obese mice, independent of tumour status, exhibited increased FABP4 mRNA and protein expression concomitant with elevated serum FABP4. In vitro, FABP4 expression was induced in human HCC cells by FFA treatment, and led to FABP4 release into culture medium. Treatment of HCC cells with exogenous FABP4 significantly increased proliferation and migration of human HCC cells. Patient serum analysis demonstrated significantly increased FABP4 in those with underlying liver disease, particularly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and HCC.Conclusions:These data suggest FABP4, an FABP not normally expressed in the liver, can be synthesized and secreted by hepatocytes and HCC cells, and that FABP4 may play a role in regulating tumour progression in the underlying setting of obesity.
