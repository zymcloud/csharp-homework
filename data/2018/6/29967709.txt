We herein reported two rare surgical cases of primary combined hepatocellular-cholangiocellular carcinoma, intermediate-cell subtype (CHC-INT), showing potentially characteristic and specific gross findings on their cut surface: both CHC-INTs demonstrated poorly demarcated and expansive and/or infiltrative hepatic nodules in lobulated margins, appearing clearly whitish in color. We were finally able to accurately diagnose the current lesions after thorough analyses including an appropriate and wide panel of immunohistochemical antibodies. Despite that, all pathologists should be aware that the potentially characteristic gross features of primary CHC-INT might also be one of the powerful supplementary tools for reaching its correct, conclusive diagnosis.
