Background:Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) was reported to be dysregulated in solid tumors and played an important role in cancer progression. However, the clinical and prognostic values of SYK in solid tumors remain unclear. This meta-analysis investigated the association between SYK expression and clinical outcomes in the patients with solid tumors.Methods:A comprehensive literature search was conducted by screening the online electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure. The hazard ratio (HR) with its corresponding 95% CI was used to explore the prognostic value of SYK.Results:We analyzed a total of 1,075 patients from 10 studies, which met the criteria for this meta-analysis. Our pooled results demonstrated that a low expression of SYK did not correlate significantly with shorter overall survival (OS; HR=0.64, 95% CI: 0.34-1.21, P=0.169) or poorer disease-free survival (HR=0.51, 95% CI: 0.13-2.02, P=0.338). However, in a subgroup analysis based on tumor type and test method, under-expression of SYK was positively associated with worse OS in the groups of breast cancer (BC; HR=0.51, 95% CI: 0.32-0.80, P=0.003), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; HR=0.44, 95% CI: 0.29-0.69, P<0.001), methylation (HR=0.39, 95% CI: 0.30-0.51, P<0.001), and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (HR=0.24, 95% CI: 0.09-0.65, P=0.005).Conclusion:This meta-analysis demonstrated that under-expression of SYK may serve as a predictive biomarker for poor prognosis in BC and HCC patients. In other solid tumors, the clinical usefulness should be confirmed by large-scale studies.
