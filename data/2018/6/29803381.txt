Purpose:Our purpose was to demonstrate the prognostic significance of T1 mapping on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging in prediction of recurrence of single HCC after hepatectomy.Materials and methods:One hundred and seven patients with single nodular HCC (≤3 cm) who underwent preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI were included in the study. T1 mapping with syngo MapIt was obtained on a 1.5 T scanner. Radiological features and reduction rate of T1 relaxation time (Δ%) of tumors were assessed by two radiologists. Cumulative recurrence rates were compared between groups of low and high reduction rate of T1 relaxation time. A further classified cumulative recurrence rate of the overall cohort was based on the numbers of independent predictive factors.Results:Reduction rate of T1 relaxation time (P = 0.001) and non-hypervascular hypointense nodules (P = 0.042) in preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI were independently related to recurrence of HCC after hepatectomy. Patients of lower reduction rates group had higher cumulative recurrence rates (P < 0.0001) than patients of higher reduction rates group. A combination of the two risk factors in patients with single HCC had significantly higher recurrence rates compared to those with either or none of the two risk factors.Conclusions:Reduction rate of T1 relaxation time combined with non-hypervascular hypointense nodules can be reliable biomarkers in the preoperative prediction of recurrence of HCC after hepatectomy.
