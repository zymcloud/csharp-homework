Purpose:To assess usefulness of adding contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) to fusion imaging (FI) for percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) inconspicuous on FI alone. Therapeutic outcomes of RFA under CEUS-added FI guidance for HCCs inconspicuous on FI alone were also evaluated.Methods:This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Planning US was performed with FI for 126 patients with a single HCC (1-2 cm) to evaluate the feasibility of RFA by grading lesion conspicuity score using a four-point scale. RFA was performed under CEUS-added FI guidance for HCCs inconspicuous on FI alone. We evaluated how many HCCs initially inconspicuous on FI became conspicuous after adding CEUS. After CEUS-added FI-guided RFA, therapeutic outcomes including rates of technical success, primary technique efficacy, major complications, and local tumor progression were assessed.Results:After adding CEUS, 90.5% (19/21) of all tumors initially inconspicuous on FI became conspicuous, thus enabling direct targeting for RFA. Technical success and primary technique efficacy rates were 94.7% (18/19) and 100% (19/19), respectively. No major complications were observed after RFA. Cumulative local tumor progression rates after RFA were estimated to be 5.3%, 10.8%, and 10.8% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively.Conclusion:Adding CEUS to FI is useful for improving the conspicuity of HCCs inconspicuous on FI alone, thus enabling successful percutaneous RFA with excellent therapeutic outcomes.
