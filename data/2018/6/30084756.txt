Objectives:Each year in the United States, approximately 40000 patients with a liver disorder will progress to end-stage liver disease and about 30000 of those patients will subsequently die from this condition. Liver transplant remains the definitive treatment option for end-stage liver disease, and understanding the causes of posttransplant mortality is an ongoing area of investigation.Materials and methods:In this retrospective cohort study, patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplant between January 2012 and January 2015 at the Johns Hopkins Hospital Liver Transplant Program were reviewed by a single reviewer for cardiac events in the 30 days after transplant or during the index admission.Results:Of the 145 patients included, 30 (20.6%) were identified as having experienced a cardiac event during the defined postoperative period. Overall 1-year mortality for the cohort of 145 patients was 11.7%; however, 1-year mortality in those who had a cardiac event was 36.7% compared with 5.2% in the noncardiac event group (odds ratio = 18.17; P Conclusions:Recipients who experience cardiac events within 30 days after transplant have increased 1-year posttransplant mortality. This highlights the importance of cardiac risk stratification before transplant.
