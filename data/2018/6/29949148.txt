Objective:To investigate the therapeutic effect of metronomic chemotherapy with low-dose Tegafur on patients with primary hepatic carcinoma (PHC) after radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Patients and methods:PHC patients who underwent RFA were assigned to RFA + Tegafur group and RFA group, respectively. Patients in RFA + Tegafur group received metronomic chemotherapy with low-dose Tegafur after RFA. PHC patients in RFA group only received radiofrequency ablation. Therapeutic efficacy of the two groups was prospectively analyzed within 18 months after RFA. Disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS) in both groups were evaluated.Results:Follow-up data showed that DCR in RFA + Tegafur group and RFA group at 9 months after RFA was 93.3% and 73.4%, respectively (p=0.038). Within the 18-month follow-up, median PFS in RFA + Tegafur group and RFA group was 16.25 months and 12.25 months, respectively (pConclusions:Metronomic chemotherapy with low-dose Tegafur after RFA can slow down tumor progression and prolong the progression-free survival of PHC patients.
