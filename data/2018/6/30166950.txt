Ultrasound is an invaluable tool for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and portal hypertension. However, the accuracy of ultrasound in diagnosing cirrhosis in the absence of portal hypertension has not been well studied. Using the specific terms cirrhosis or nodular(ity), a retrospective evaluation was conducted on abdominal ultrasounds performed between 2008 and 2013. Patients with evidence of portal hypertension were excluded from the evaluation. Charts were reviewed for evidence of cirrhosis on liver biopsy performed within 1 year of the ultrasound. Of the 69 patients whose ultrasound findings reported cirrhosis without portal hypertension who underwent liver biopsy, 47 (68%) had histologic evidence of cirrhosis. When patients with advanced fibrosis (F3 or F4) on liver biopsy were included, the sensitivity of the ultrasound improved to 80%. One in 5 biopsies showed only mild to moderate or no fibrosis (F0-F2). Sonographic assessment by experts may falsely suggest or overestimate cirrhosis. In the absence of objective evidence of portal hypertension, caution should be taken in diagnosing cirrhosis based on sonographic interpretation alone.
