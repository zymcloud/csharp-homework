The importance of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in human cancers has gradually been acknowledged. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), several circRNAs have been reported to regulate tumor growth and metastasis. However, the role of hsa_circ_0000673 in HCC remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that hsa_circ_0000673 was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. Moreover, we found that hsa_circ_0000673 knockdown markedly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells in vitro. Besides, hsa_circ_0000673 silence led to delayed tumor growth in vivo. In terms of mechanism, we showed that hsa_circ_0000673 directly associated with miR-767-3p in HCC cells. Via inhibiting miR-767-3p, hsa_circ_0000673 promoted HCC cell proliferation and invasion. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SET was a downstream effector of hsa_circ_0000673/miR-767-3p signaling. We showed that miR-767-3p could significantly promote SET expression by sponging miR-767-3p in HCC cells. Finally, rescue assays indicated that SET expression was essential for the effects of hsa_circ_0000673/miR-767-3p signaling on HCC cell proliferation and invasion. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that hsa_circ_0000673 promoted HCC malignant behaviors via regulating miR-767-3p/SET pathway.
