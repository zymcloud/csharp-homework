Objectives:Accumulating evidence suggests that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) may affect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. However, the mechanism remains unclear. Previous studies have shown that exosomes may promote tumor progression by transporting proteins. Our study aimed to determine the prognostic value of lncRNAs in HCC and the underlying mechanism.Methods:A dataset comprising a HCC cohort of 364 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was analyzed to identify lncRNAs with prognostic value. Co-expression and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were constructed to investigate the mechanism of exosome-related lncRNAs. To confirm the bioinformatics analysis results, 95 pairs of clinical samples were evaluated by digoxigenin-labeled chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH).Results:Five lncRNAs (CTD-2116N20.1, AC012074.2, RP11-538D16.2, LINC00501 and RP11-136I14.5) with significant differences were identified (PConclusion:Our findings provide an independent and effective prognostic model to predict the survival rate of HCC patients. RP11-538D16.2 and CTD-2116N20.1 are highlighted as important exosome-related lncRNAs.
