Background:Liver elastography have been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with higher values; however, it is unclear to identify morbimortality risk on liver transplantation waiting list.Aim:To assess liver stiffness, ultrasound and clinical findings in cirrhotic patients with and without HCC on screening for liver transplant and compare the morbimortality risk with elastography and MELD score.Method:Patients with cirrhosis and HCC on screening for liver transplant were enrolled with clinical, radiological and laboratory assessments, and transient elastography.Results:103 patients were included (without HCC n=58 (66%); HCC n=45 (44%). The mean MELD score was 14.7±6.4, the portal hypertension present on 83.9% and the mean transient elastography value was 32.73±22.5 kPa. The median acoustic radiation force impulse value of liver parenchyma was 1.98 (0.65-3.2) m/s and 2.16 (0.59-2.8) m/s in HCC group. The HCC group was significantly associated with HCV infection (OR 26.84; pConclusion:Elastography, ultrasound and clinical findings are important non-invasive tools for cirrhosis and HCC on screening for liver transplant. Higher values in liver elastography and MELD scores predict mortality.
