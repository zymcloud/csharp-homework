Fibrosis and cancer represent two major complications of chronic liver disease. MicroRNAs have been implicated in the development of fibrosis and cancer, thus constituting potential therapeutic targets. Here, we investigated the role of microRNA-21 (miR-21), a microRNA that has been implicated in the development of fibrosis in multiple organs and has also been suggested to act as an "oncomir." Accordingly, miR-21 was the microRNA that showed the strongest up-regulation in activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in multiple models of fibrogenesis, with an 8-fold to 24-fold induction compared to quiescent HSCs. However, miR-21 antisense inhibition did not suppress the activation of murine or human HSCs in culture or in liver slices. Moreover, genetic deletion of miR-21 in two independently generated knockout mice or miR-21 antisense inhibition did not alter HSC activation or liver fibrosis in models of toxic and biliary liver injury. Despite a strong up-regulation of miR-21 in injury-associated hepatocellular carcinoma and in cholangiocarcinoma, miR-21 deletion or antisense inhibition did not reduce the development of liver tumors. As inhibition of the most up-regulated microRNA did not affect HSC activation, liver fibrosis, or fibrosis-associated liver cancer, we additionally tested the role of microRNAs in HSCs by HSC-specific Dicer deletion. Although Dicer deletion decreased microRNA expression in HSCs and altered the expression of select genes, it only exerted negligible effects on HSC activation and liver fibrosis.Conclusion:Genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of miR-21 does not inhibit the development of liver fibrosis and liver cancer. Moreover, suppression of microRNA synthesis does not significantly affect HSC phenotype and activation. (Hepatology 2018;67:2414-2429).
