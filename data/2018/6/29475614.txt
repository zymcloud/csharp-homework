Background:Resection of hepatocellular carcinoma located in the caudate lobe is challenging because this anatomical location is difficult to approach, especially the caval portion.Methods:We performed resection of the caval portion of the caudate lobe using a ventral approach combined with the resection of segment IV, VII, or VIII for hepatocellular carcinoma in 41 patients (extended segmentectomy group). As a control group, 138 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent segmentectomy for IV, VII, or VIII (segmentectomy group) were studied. We compared surgical outcomes, including postoperative morbidity and survival, between the 2 groups.Results:When compared with the segmentectomy group, platelet count was lower (12.8 × 104/µL [range, 2.4-33.8] vs 14.8 × 104/µL [3.2-41.4], P = .085), operation time was significantly longer (442 minutes [range, 184-710] vs 333 minutes [131-810], P < .001), blood loss was significantly greater (579 mL [range, 25-2688] vs 301 mL [10-3887], P = .001), and the percentage of patients with cirrhosis was greater (19 [46.3%] vs 41 [29.7%], P = .059) in the extended segmentectomy group. However, the morbidity rate (48.7% and 33.3%, P = .096) and median overall survival period (5.2 years; [95% confidence interval, 4.6-6.6] vs 6.2 years, [5.4-9.7], P = .203) were not significantly different between the 2 groups.Conclusion:The ventral approach for the resection of hepatocellular carcinoma in the caval portion of the caudate lobe is a viable alternative to other approaches, especially in patients with insufficient liver function.
