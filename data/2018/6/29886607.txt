Objective: To explore the relationship between genotype and phenotype of ABCB11 deficiency. Methods: Clinical data of two siblings with ABCB11 deficiency were retrospectively analyzed. Related literature from PubMed, CNKI and Wangfang databases was reviewed to date (up to August 2017) with 'ABCB11 gene' or 'bile salt export pump', 'cholestasis' and 'child' as key words. Results: The patients were siblings. Both of them presented as jaundice, pruritus and hepatosplenomegaly since 3 days after birth. Significant laboratory findings on admission of the older sister included high total bilirubin, 170 µmol/L;conjugated bilirubin, 115.8 µmol/L;alanine aminotransferase, 168 U/L;total bile acid 186.3 µmol/L and normal gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. While routine laboratory data of the younger brother were as follows: total bilirubin, 148.8 µmol/L;conjugated bilirubin, 96.3 µmol/L;alanine aminotransferase, 232.8 U/L;total bile acid 226 µmol/L, and normal gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase.Both received ursodeoxycholic acid and fat-soluble vitamins. Liver pathology of the younger brother showed giant hepatocytes with ballooning degeneration, focal necrosis and intrahepatic cholestasis. Both the patients harbor the same compound heterozygous mutations in ABCB11 gene, c.145C>T (p.Q49X) and c.1510G>A (p.E504K). The sister is 9 years old now, with normal liver function. Jaundice faded around 3 months after birth, pruritus relieved at age 5, and medications was stopped since then. The brother progressed to liver failure after an operation on perianal abscess when he was 8-month-old, and received living-related liver transplantation when he was 9 month and 20 days old (from his mother). Now he is 1 year and 5 months old, with normal liver function. Both are under our follow-up. Literature review revealed 18 ABCB11 deficiency patients from 7 families who had apparent different prognoses, within each family the siblings had the same ABCB11 gene mutation. Seven cases relieved after ursodeoxycholic acid therapy and/or partial external biliary diversion, 5 received orthotopic liver transplantation, 2 developed hepatocellular carcinoma and 4 cases died in childhood. Conclusions: The clinical manifestations of ABCB11 deficiency may vary greatly in patients carrying the same genotype, even in siblings. Patients should be managed in individualized maner.
