Kinesin family member C1 (KIFC1, also known as HSET) is a minus end-directed motor protein, which is critical in centrosome clustering. The present study investigated the expression of KIFC1 in paired hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues from 91 patients by immunohistochemical analysis; clinical data were concomitantly collected. KIFC1 was expressed at high levels in HCC tissues, compared with that in peritumoral tissues (54.9 vs. 14.3%; P
