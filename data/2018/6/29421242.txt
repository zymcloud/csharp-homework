Six previously undescribed flavonoids, 2S-5-methoxy-6-methyl-7,2'-dihydroxyflavanone, 5,7,2'-trihydroxy-6-methylflavone, 5,7,6'-trihydroxy-6-methylcoumaronochromone, 2,4',6'-trihydroxy-2'-methoxy-3'-methylchalcone, 6R,11-dimethoxy-9-hydroxyrotenoid, and 6R,11-dimethoxy-9-hydroxy-10-methylrotenoid, along with eight known flavonoids, including 2S-5-methoxy-6-methyl-7,4'-dihydroxyflavanone, not previously reported as a natural product, and seven rotenoids, boeravinone A, B, D, P, F, coccineone B, and mirabijalone E, were isolated from the ethyl acetate soluble fraction of Mirabilis himalaica roots. Their structures were established by the extensive spectroscopic analysis, including HRESIMS, UV, NMR and ECD. All compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against three human cancer cell lines: A375 (melanoma), A549 (lung), and PLC (hepatoma).
