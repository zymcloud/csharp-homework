Background:The optimal therapeutic strategy in UICC stage T3 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients that maximizes both safety and long-term outcome has not yet been determined. Our aim was to compare clinical outcomes following hepatic resection (HR) versus transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for stage T3 HCC.Methods:From 2005 to 2013, 1179 patients with T3 HCC who underwent HR or TACE were divided into two groups, HR group (n = 280) or TACE group (n = 899). The clinical outcomes were compared before and after propensity score matching.Results:The propensity model matched 244 patients in each group for further analyses. After matching, medium overall survival (OS), 1, 3, and 5-year OS rates in TACE group were 11.8 (95%CI, 9.9-13.7) months, 49.6, 16.5, and 8.4%, respectively; which in HR group were 17.8 (95% CI, 14.8-20.8) months, 63.1, 33.3, and 26.4%, respectively; (log rank = 19.908, P Conclusions:Our study revealed that TACE was an option for UICC T3 HCC patients. However, HR seemed to be safe and yield a survival benefit compared with TACE, especially for patients with a good underlying liver function.
