Background/aim: There are various scoring systems for evaluating prognosis in patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) with hepatic encephalopathy. These include the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) classification, Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD), chronic liver failure-sequential organ failure assessment (CLIF-SOFA), and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II). In this study, we aimed to compare the various scoring systems to determine the best system for showing the prognosis of patients with a prior diagnosis of cirrhosis who were hospitalized for hepatic encephalopathy. Materials and methods: Patients with known cirrhosis hospitalized in the internal medicine ICU of the Adana Numune Education and Research Hospital with a diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy were included in the study. Diagnosis and classification of hepatic encephalopathy were done according to the West Haven criteria. The etiology of hepatic encephalopathy was recorded for all patients. APACHE II, CLIF-SOFA, MELD, and CTP scores were calculated for all patients within the first 24 h. Outcomes of patients were recorded as either discharged or deceased. Demographic and biochemical data, duration of hospitalization, and prognostic factors were compared for both groups. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values were calculated for each scoring system. Results: A total of 84 patients were included in the study. The etiologies of encephalopathy were infection (n = 35, 41.7%), variceal bleeding (n = 19, 22.6%), constipation (n = 15, 17.9%), consuming excessive protein (n = 8, 9.5%), hypokalemia (n = 6, 7.1%), and hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 1, 1.2%). Nine patients had grade 1 encephalopathy, 34 patients had grade 2, 27 patients had grade 3, and 14 patients had grade 4. AUROC values were 0.986 (0.970-1.003), 0.974 (0.945-1.003), 0.955 (0.915-0.996), and 0.880 (0.800-0.959) for CLIF-SOFA, APACHE II, CTP, and MELD scores, respectively. Conclusion: We found the best prognostic model for patients who were hospitalized in the ICU for hepatic encephalopathy to be CLIFSOFA, followed by APACHE II, CTP, and MELD scores.
