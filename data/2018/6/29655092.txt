Chronic hepatitis B remains a major global health challenge due to morbidity and mortality from hepatocellular carcinoma and complications of liver cirrhosis. Current treatment regimens are non-curative and, once initiated, treatment is of indefinite duration for the majority. The decision to initiate treatment decisions is based on risk stratification. Advances in our understanding of the natural history of chronic hepatitis B have led to a paradigm shift in recommendations for treatment. Emerging non-invasive biomarkers of disease activity will further enhance disease stratification. In this review, we summarise the guidance from major international societies on treatment for chronic hepatitis B and explore some of the novel approaches to disease assessment.
