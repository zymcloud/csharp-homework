Background:The efficacy of direct-acting anti-viral (DAA) therapy in patients with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unknown.Aim:We prospectively evaluated whether previously treated HCC affects DAA efficacy in a large real-life cohort of cirrhotic patients.Methods:From January to December 2015 all consecutive HCV mono-infected patients with cirrhosis and/or history of HCC attending 10 Italian tertiary liver centres were enrolled. Baseline characteristics and response to therapy were recorded. 1927 patients were enrolled (mean age: 62.1 Â± 10.9 years; 1.205 males). Genotype 1 was the most frequent (67.9%) followed by genotypes 3 (12.4%), 2 (11.2%) and 4 (8.6%). 88.4% and 10.9% of cases were classified Child A and B, respectively, and 14 (Results:The sustained virologic response (SVR) rate at intention-to-treat analysis was 95.1%. It differed significantly across Child classes, that is, 96.3%, 86.1% and 71.4% Child A, B and C, respectively (P Conclusion:This large real-life study proves that the efficacy of DAA in cirrhotic patients is not impaired by successfully treated HCC.
