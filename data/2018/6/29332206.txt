Background:To evaluate the oncological outcomes of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) involving the inferior vena cava (IVC) who received cytoreductive nephrectomy.Methods:This study included 75 consecutive metastatis renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients with inferior vena cava (IVC) tumor thrombus undergoing cytoreductive nephrectomy and tumor thrombectomy followed by systemic therapy.Results:Of the 75 patients, 11, 33, 24 and 7 had level I, II, III and IV IVC thrombus, respectively. Following surgical treatment, 25 (group A), 27 (group B) and 23 (group C) received cytokine therapy alone, molecular-targeted therapy alone and both therapies, respectively, as management for metastatic diseases. The median overall survival (OS) of the 75 patients was 16.2 months. No significant differences in OS were noted according to the level of the IVC tumor thrombus. There were no significant differences in OS among groups A, B and C; however, OS in groups B and C was significantly superior to that in group A. Furthermore, multivariate analysis of several parameters identified the following independent predictors of poor OS-elevated C-reactive protein, liver metastasis and postoperative treatment with cytokine therapy alone.Conclusions:The prognosis of mRCC patients with IVC thrombus undergoing cytoreductive nephrectomy may be significantly affected by the type of postoperative systemic therapy rather than the level of the IVC tumor thrombus. Accordingly, cytoreductive nephrectomy should be considered as a major therapeutic option for patients with mRCC involving the IVC, particularly in the era of targeted therapy.
