Background:Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) can present as a hypervascular or peripherally enhancing tumor in dynamic imaging. We evaluated the effect of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) on prognosis according to post-operative recurrence imaging patterns.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 42 cHCC-CC and 59 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC-control) patients at the Asan Medical Center. We classified recurrent cHCC-CC according to enhancement pattern (globally enhancing: GE cHCC-CC, peripherally enhancing: PE cHCC-CC) and evaluated tumor response, time-to-local progression (TTPlocal), and overall survival (OS).Results:The GE cHCC-CC group had a significantly higher best objective response rate (complete remission + partial response) than the PE cHCC-CC group (36% vs 0%, P = 0.005), and it was comparable to that of the HCC-control group (35.6%, P = 0.97). TTPlocal in the GE cHCC-CC group was significantly shorter than in the HCC-control group (6.6 vs 27.1 months, P Conclusions:The GE cHCC-CC group showed better response and prognosis after TACE than the PE cHCC-CC group, but poorer response and prognosis than the HCC-control group. Enhancement patterns at recurrence were crucially associated with tumor response and overall survival.
