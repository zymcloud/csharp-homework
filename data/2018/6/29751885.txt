Intraoperative consultation requires skills in gross examination and histologic diagnosis, as well as an ability to perform rapid interpretations under time constraints. The aim of this review is to provide surgical pathologists with a framework for dealing with hepatic specimens in the frozen section area by covering common clinical scenarios and histologic findings. Differential diagnoses are considered in relation to primary hepatic neoplasia and metastatic diseases. Benign mimics of malignancy and other pitfalls in frozen section diagnosis of lesional tissue are covered. Finally, assessment of donor liver biopsy for organ transplant evaluation is discussed.
