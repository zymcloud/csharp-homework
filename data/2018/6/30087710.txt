MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been recognized as key regulators of tumorigenesis and progression. Serum miR-302c-3p expression is prominently deregulated in HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the expression of miR-302c-3p and its functional role in HBV-related HCC are rarely investigated. In this study, we found that the expression levels of miR-302c-3p were prominently down-regulated in HCC tissues compared to matched tumor-adjacent tissues. Moreover, miR-302c-3p under-expression was detected in HCC cell lines compared to a normal hepatic cell line LO2. Low miR-302c-3p expression was positively correlated with multiple tumor nodes, venous infiltration and advanced TNM tumor stage of HCC patients. Notably, our follow up data and TCGA data demonstrated that low miR-302c-3p expression predicted a poor survival of HCC patients. Functionally, miR-302c-3p overexpression inhibited migration and invasion of MHCC97H cells in vitro. Additionally, miR-302c-3p knockdown showed an opposite effect on these metastatic behaviors of HepG2 cells. MiR-302c-3p negatively regulated tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 4 (TRAF4) abundance by directly targeting 3'-UTR of TRAF4 mRNA. The expression of TRAF4 was up-regulated in HCC tissues. The level of TRAF4 mRNA was inversely correlated with miR-302c-3p expression in HCC specimens. Mechanistically, miR-302c-3p restrained AKT-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC cells. Importantly, TRAF4 restoration reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-302c-3p on AKT-induced EMT and HCC cell metastasis. MK2206, an AKT inhibitor, inhibited miR-302c-3p knockdown-induced EMT in HepG2 cells. In summary, these results indicate that miR-302c-3p exhibits a tumor suppressive role in HCC by targeting TRAF4. Inhibition of miR-302c-3p/TRAF4 axis may serve as a therapeutic target for HCC.
