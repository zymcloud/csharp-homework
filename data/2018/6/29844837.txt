Primary hepatic carcinoma is a common malignant tumor with poor treatment efficacy. The effect and mechanism of miR-143 in apoptosis of liver carcinoma cells were investigated in the present study. In vitro transfection of liver carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells was performed using artificially synthesized miR-143 mimics. The proliferation of liver carcinoma cells that were treated was detected by MTT assay. Liver carcinoma cells were then stained using the Annexin V-FITC/PI method, and the apoptosis of stained liver carcinoma cells was measured using a flow cytometer. The relative mRNA expression of NF-κB p65 in the intervention and control groups was assayed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the protein expression of NF-κB p65 was detected using western blot analysis. The results showed that, in the intervention group, the proliferation rate of cells transfected using miR-143 mimics was significantly lower than that in the control group, the number of apoptotic SMMC-7721 cells in the intervention group increased, and the protein expression of NF-κB p65 was decreased. Thus, miR-143 may downregulate the protein expression of NF-κB p65, thereby triggering the NF-κB signaling transduction pathway inducing apoptosis of liver carcinoma cells.
