This study aimed to evaluate the capability of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR (GAeMR) to detect presence of capsule appearance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to correlate it with dynamic computed tomography (CT) and pathological features.Sixty-three patients (54: 9 = M: F, mean age 55.8) surgically confirmed HCCs with preoperative CT and GAeMR were included in this retrospective study. Two readers evaluated presence of capsule appearances on CT and GAeMR images in each phase including precontrast (Pre), portal phase (PP), delayed phase (DP), transitional phase (TP), and hepatobiliary phase (HBP). Histologic capsule was compared with CT and GAeMR. Diagnostic performance of CT and GAeMR of each phase for histologic capsule was evaluated and compared by receiver operating characteristic curve. Interobserver agreement was assessed with kappa statistics.Histologically the capsule was complete in 12.7% (8/63) and incomplete in 60.3% (38/63). Four cases (6.3%) were pseudocapsule. Interobserver agreement for capsule appearance on GAeMR was good in Pre (κ = 0.684), moderate in PP (κ = 0.434), poor in TP (κ = 0.187), fair in HBP (κ = 0.395), and moderate on CT in PP (κ = 0.476) and DP (κ = 0.485). Diagnostic performance and sensitivity for the histologic capsule in DP on CT was highest among PP on CT and other phases on GAeMR. DP on CT images showed a higher Az value than PP on CT images with statistical significance (P
