The recent accumulation of molecular profiling data for primary hepatobiliary malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma and biliary tract cancers, has led to a proliferation of promising therapeutic investigations in recent years. Treatment with pathway-specific targeted inhibitors and immunotherapeutic agents have demonstrated promising early clinical results. Key molecular alterations in common hepatobiliary cancers and ongoing interventional clinical trials of molecularly targeted systemic agents focusing on hepatocellular carcinoma and biliary tract cancer are reviewed.
