Objective:To explore the long-term prognosis and health-related quality of life of patients surviving hepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ACLF).Methods:The clinical data were collected from patients with HBV-ACLF, who were hospitalized in our department between November, 2011 and October, 2016 and survived for more than 90 days. The patients were followed for occurrence of newly diagnosed cirrhosis, decompensation events, hepatocellular carcinoma and death. The quality of life of the patients was evaluated using SF-36 score, and the patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and cirrhosis treated during the same period served as controls.Results:A total of 223 ACLF survivors were included in this study. According to the presence of cirrhosis on admission, the enrolled patients were divided into chronic hepatitis B-related ACLF (CHB-ACLF) group (n=130) and liver cirrhosis ACLF (CIR-ACLF) group (n=93). The 12-, 24- and 50-month survival rates in CHB-ACLF group were 97%, 95.7% and 93.9%, respectively, significantly higher than the rates in CIR-ACLF group (91%, 86% and 74%, respectively; P=0.007). In patients with CHB-ACLF, the 12-, 24- and 36-month progression rates of cirrhosis were 37.9%, 58.4% and 68.7% respectively. Multivariate Cox regression identified the peak value of serum creatinine (HR=1.015, P=0.026) and INR (HR=2.032, P=0.006) within 28 days as independent risk factors and serum sodium at baseline (HR=0.84, P=0.035) as an independent protective factor of occurrence of cirrhosis. The score of mental health on SF-36 in ACLF group was significantly lower than the national norms, and the scores for general health and body pain of ACLF patients were significantly higher than those in patients with CHB or cirrhosis.Conclusion:The long-term prognosis of ACLF survivors with and without cirrhosis can be different. Acute attacks are associated with an increased rate of cirrhosis progression in CHB patients who recovered from ACLF, possibly in relation with the severity of extra-hepatic organ injuries. The physical and social functions of long-term survivors of ACLF do not significantly decline, but their psychological status can be affected.
