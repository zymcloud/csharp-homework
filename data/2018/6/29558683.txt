Numerous studies have demonstrated that vanadium compounds are able to improve lipemia and triglyceridemia in both humans and animals. However, the molecular mechanism remains elusive. The present study was conducted to investigate the anti-hyperlipidemic effect of vanadium(IV) complex with 4-chlorodipicolinic acid (VOdipic-Cl)-induced autophagy on hepatic lipid accumulation. To explore the possible underlying mechanisms, primary rat hepatocytes, human hepatoma cell line HepG2, and liver tissue from C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were used. In vitro, cultured primary rat hepatocytes were treated with palmitate (0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 mM) prior to VOdipic-Cl (50, 100, and 200 Î¼M) for 24 h, respectively. In vivo, C57BL/6 mice were fed with high-fat diet for 16 weeks. VOdipic-Cl (10 mg V/kg body weight) was given by daily gavage for 4 weeks. In vitro results showed that VOdipic-Cl significantly inhibited lipid droplet formation by increasing the level of conversion and punctuation of microtubule-associated proteins light chain 3 (LC3) in a dose-dependent manner, and activated liver kinase B-1 (LKB1) and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. Confocal microscopy images also showed that VOdipic-Cl induced sequestration of lipid droplets (LDs) by autophagy. In vivo, VOdipic-Cl attenuated the increase in serum and liver triglyceride levels in the mice fed with high-fat diet, while significantly increased autophagy induction and activated LKB1 and AMPK phosphorylation in the liver. Taken together, these results suggest that VOdipic-Cl reduces hepatic lipid accumulation by inducing autophagy via the activation of LKB1/AMPK-dependent signaling pathway.
