Background and objectives:Ablation is a common treatment modality for malignant primary liver tumors(PLTs), outcomes following laparoscopic (LA) versus open ablation (OA) are ill-defined. This project compares peri-procedural outcomes of LA versus OA for PLTs.Materials and methods:Patients with PLTs undergoing radiofrequency ablation were queried from ACS NSQIP Database (2005-2013) using CPT codes. Patients undergoing percutaneous ablation or hepatic resection were excluded. Multivariable logistic regression analyses determined the association of ablation approach with 30-day morbidity and mortality.Results:Of 5747 with PLTs, 655 (11.4%) ablations were identified: 177 (27.0%) underwent OA, 478 (73.0%) underwent LA. Patients undergoing LA had lower mortality (1.9% vs 5.1%, P = 0.026), lower minor morbidity (2.3% vs 5.7%, P = 0.031), and lower major morbidity (4.2% vs 17.0%, P Conclusion:LA offers decreased peri-procedural morbidity, mortality, and reduced LOS. LA should be the preferred method for hepatic ablation.
