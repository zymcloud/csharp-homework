Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a receptor for bile acids and plays an important role in the regulation of bile acid metabolism in the liver. Although FXR has been shown to affect hepatocarcinogenesis through both direct and indirect mechanisms, potential roles of FXR in epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. We examined the effect of several FXR ligands on EMT-related morphological changes in HCC cell lines, such as HuH-7 and Hep3B cells. FXR agonists (chenodeoxycholic acid, GW4064, and obeticholic acid)—but not an antagonist (guggulsterone)&mdash;induced actin polymerization and expression of N-cadherin and phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase, although they were less effective than transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). FXR agonist treatment enhanced TGF-β-induced EMT morphologic changes and FXR antagonist inhibited the effect of TGF-β. Thus, FXR activation enhances EMT in HCC and FXR antagonists may be EMT-suppressing drug candidates.
