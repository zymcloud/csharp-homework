Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 2 (TNFR2) plays an important role in controlling the progression of antiviral and antitumorr. Evidence suggests that TNFR2 is involved in the pathogenesis of HBV-induced liver injury. We therefore examined whether TNFR2 polymorphisms are associated with the risk of HBV-related liver disease in Chinese population. In this case-control study, 115 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, 86 HBV-related liver cirrhosis patients (LC), 272 HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma patients (HCC) and 269 healthy controls were recruited. TNFR2 rs1061622 and rs1061624 polymorphisms were examined using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that the A allele of rs1061624 was positively associated with the risk of CHB (AA vs. GG, P = 0.026; AA vs. GA+GG, P = 0.021), LC (AA vs. GG, P = 0.027; AA+GA vs. GG, P = 0.036), and HCC (GA vs. GG, P = 0.046; GA+AA vs. GG, P = 0.031). Moreover, subgroup analysis indicated that male subjects have increased risk in developing CHB and LC. Nevertheless, no association was found between rs1061622 polymorphism and HBV-related liver diseases in the overall or subgroup analyses. Our retrospective study suggests that the TNFR2 rs1061624 polymorphism is associated with HBV-related CHB, LC, and HCC in Chinese population, particularly in males.
