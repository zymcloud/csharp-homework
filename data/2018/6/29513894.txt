Background and objectives:Frequently aberrant expression of cytokeratin 7 (CK7) and cytokeratin 19 (CK19) have been observed in several human cancers. In this retrospective study, we aimed at investigating the prognostic significance of CK7 and CK19 in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).Methods:Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess CK7 and CK19 expression on tissue microarrays in training cohort enrolling 214 ICC patients and validation cohort comprising 108 ICC patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox's proportional hazards regression, and nomogram were applied to evaluate the prognostic significance of both CKs.Results:Both CK7 and CK19 expression were significantly up-regulated in ICC compared to their non-tumor counterparts, and positively correlated with aggressive tumor phenotypes, like lymph node metastasis and larger tumor size. Furthermore, high expression of either CK7 or CK19 predicted a significantly dismal postoperative survival. Integrated analysis of CK7 and CK19 expression was identified as a better indicator for survival probability. Notably, the nomogram integrating CK7/CK19 index had a perfect prognostic performance as compared with current staging systems. The results were further confirmed in the validation cohort.Conclusions:CK7/CK19 index was an independent adverse prognostic factor for ICC patients' survival, and may be helpful to improve postoperative risk stratification and individualized treatment strategies.
