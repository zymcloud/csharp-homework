Background:Despite curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma, patients have a high probability of recurrence. We examined indications for liver resection in cases of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Patients undergoing a second liver resection (n=210) or treatment by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (n=184) for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma of up to 3 lesions were included. We developed a prediction score based on prognostic factors and compared survival according to this prediction score.Results:The prediction score was based on 3 independent variables identified by survival analysis in 210 patients undergoing a second liver resection and included age ≥ 75 years, tumor size ≥ 3.0 cm, and multiple tumors. Each patient was assigned a total score. Median overall survival in patients undergoing a second liver resection with scores of 0, 1, and 2/3 were 7.9 years (95% confidence interval, 5.6-NA), 4.5 years (3.8-6.2), and 2.6 years (2.1-5.3), respectively (P Conclusion:Liver resection is recommended as first-line therapy for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with a score of 0, while those with score 2/3 should be considered candidates for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization.
