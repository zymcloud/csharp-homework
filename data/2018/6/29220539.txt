Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a male-dominant cancer, and androgen receptor (AR) has been linked to the pathogenesis of HCC. However, AR expression and its precise role in HCC remain controversial. Moreover, previous antiandrogen and anti-AR clinical trials in HCC failed to demonstrate clinical benefits. In this study, we found that AR is overexpressed in the nucleus of approximately 37% of HCC tumors, which is significantly associated with advanced disease stage and poor survival. AR overexpression in HCC cells markedly alters AR-dependent transcriptome, stimulates oncogenic growth, and determines therapeutic response to enzalutamide, a second generation of AR antagonist. However, AR inhibition evokes feedback activation of AKT-mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) signaling, a central regulator for cell growth and survival. On the other hand, mTOR promotes nuclear AR protein expression by restraining ubiquitin-dependent AR degradation and enhancing AR nuclear localization, providing a mechanistic explanation for nuclear AR overexpression in HCC. Finally, cotargeting AR and mTOR shows significant synergistic anti-HCC activity and decreases tumor burden by inducing apoptosis in vivo.Conclusion:Nuclear AR overexpression is associated with the progression and prognosis of HCC. However, enzalutamide alone has limited therapeutic utility attributed to feedback activation of the AKT-mTOR pathway. Moreover, mTOR drives nuclear AR overexpression. Cotargeting AR and mTOR is a promising therapeutic strategy for HCC. (Hepatology 2018;67:2271-2286).
