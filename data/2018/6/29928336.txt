Locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated by radiotherapy (RT) may be suited for further treatment with surgery. As a critical mediator of the post-RT immune response, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and its associated proteins may serve as prognostic factors for patients with HCC treated by post-RT surgery. In the present study, a total of 20 patients with HCC treated by post-RT surgery were enrolled. Resected tumor and peritumoral liver tissues were used to construct tissue microarrays that were assessed with immunohistochemical staining for the expression levels of TLR4, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). The overall (OS) and disease-free (DFS) survival outcomes for each patient were assessed, and the severity of radiation-induced liver diseases (RILDs) was detected. The patients with low TLR4 or TRAIL expression exhibited significantly better OS times than those with high TLR4 (P=0.003) or TRAIL (P=0.007) expression, whereas the median DFS times for patients with low VEGFR2 or TRAIL were significantly longer than those with high VEGFR2 (P=0.003) or TRAIL (P=0.008) expression. No significant differences in OS or DFS times were identified according to the expression of TLR4, VEGFR2 or TRAIL in peritumoral liver tissue, although more severe RILDs were identified in patients with the high expression of these factors in the peritumoral liver tissue post-RT (P
