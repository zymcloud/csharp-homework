Colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (CRNDE), as a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), has attracted increasing attention in recent years and has been documented to be at abnormally high expression in various types of cancer, such as colorectal cancer, glioma, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, and breast cancer. It could not only be used as a clinical biomarker for the early diagnosis and prognosis evaluation in a variety of cancers but also promote the development and progress of various tumor cells. Moreover, it is involved in the targeting regulation of multiple microRNAs and the activation/inhibition of multiple signaling pathways. In this review, we presented a systematic summary of the potential carcinogenicity and clinical value of CRNDE in the current evidence, so as to provide reference for early diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, and targeted therapy of various clinical cancers.
