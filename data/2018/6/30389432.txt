Background:Spontaneous tumor rupture (STR) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a life-threatening condition. This study investigates the influences of STR on the observed survival and conditional survival of patients received hepatectomy.Methods:A retrospective cohort of patients who underwent hepatectomy from 2009 to 2013 was divided into tumor rupture group and non-rupture group. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used for comparison of the observed survival and conditional survival probabilities between these two groups.Results:89 pairs of patients who had comparable background and tumor characteristics were created using PSM analysis. There was significant association between STR and increased risk of OS no matter when before or after PSM (p Conclusions:This study identified STR but not PFS as an independent risk factor influencing OS, in patients with HCC following hepatectomy. In selected patients with STRHCC, hepatectomy should be performed with acceptable outcomes.
