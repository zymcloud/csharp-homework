Background:Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and entecavir (ETV) are recommended as the first-line choices regarding the treatment of chronic hepatits B. The impact of the two antiviral agents on prognosis of Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be explored. We aim to investigate whether CHB-related HCC patients receiving TDF and ETV have a different prognosis.Methods:233 CHB-related compensated cirrhosis patients were divided into groups according to the nucleut(s)ide patients received. The results of TDF and ETV groups were reviewed and compared. The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of both groups were analyzed and compared.Results:233 CHB-related compensated cirrhosis patients from 2013 October to 2014 November were included in our study. 107 and 126 patients received TDF and ETV monotherapy, respectively. Child-Pugh score, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin level, status of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and serum HBV DNA level were compared between groups. DFS in TDF-treatment group were significantly longer than it in ETV-treatment group (p < 0.05). multi-variant analysis indicated that TDF duration was significantly associated with lower probability of HCC development, (hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval range, 0.33-0.84, p < 0.05).Conclusion:Anti-virus regimen containing TDF benefits for the prognosis of CHB-related liver cirrhosis patients.
