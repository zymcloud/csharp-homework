Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a worldwide malignance, and the underlying mechanisms of this disease are not fully elucidated. In this study, the existence and function of achaete-scute homolog-1 (ASH1)-miR-375-YWHAZ signaling axis in HCC were determined. Our experiments and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) sequencing data analyses showed that ASH1 and miR-375 were significantly downregulated, whereas YWHAZ was significantly upregulated in HCC. Furthermore, we found that ASH1 positively regulates miR-375, and miR-375 directly downregulates its target YWHAZ. Gain- and loss-of-function study demonstrated ASH1 and miR-375 function as tumor suppressors, whereas YWHAZ acts as an oncogene in HCC. Animal experiment indicated that YWHAZ small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (si-YWHAZ) delivered by nanoliposomes could suppress the growth of hepatoma xenografts and was well tolerant by nude mice. Further studies revealed that YWHAZ was involved in several protein networks, such as cell autophagy, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), apoptosis, cell cycle, invasion, and migration. In addition, the patient group with ASH1-high-expression-miR-375-high-expression-YWHAZ-low-expression was correlated with a better clinical prognosis compared with the opposite expression group. In conclusion, we proved the existence of ASH1-miR-375-YWHAZ signaling axis and interpreted its important role in driving HCC tumor progression.
