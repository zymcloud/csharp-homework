Objective: To explore the clinical value of 3D-DSA technology in the diagnosis and treatment guidance of hepatic artery chemoembolization. Methods: Liver cancer patients in the treatment groups were collected to receive 3D-DSA imaging guidance at the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University between March and May 2017. In addition, routine 2D-DSA imaging was selected for treatment-received group. Intra-operative blood vessels and tumor-like lesions were observed. The total exposure dose (CAK, unit mGy), cumulative irradiation intensity per unit area (DAP, unit mGy.cm2) and dosage of contrast agent (ml) were calculated separately for two groups of patients. The same senior physicians and technicians operated both groups of patients. Comparisons of measurement were analyzed by t-test and chi-square test was used for count data. Results: Data of twenty patients were collected from the two groups. Tumor location, target vessels structure and shape of development were clear in all patients in the treatment group. The control group had 17 cases of tumor development and the target vascular structure was clear in 16 cases. CAK mean treatment group was lower than control group (554.11 + 38.87) mGy and (644.53 + 26.70) mGy, and DAP mean treatment group was lower than the control group (125.25 + 7.54) mGy·cm(2) and (143.49 + 6.18) mGy·cm(2). The two groups were compared (P value < 0.05), and the differences were statistically significant. The mean dose of contrast agent in the two groups were lower than control group (64.42 + 3.92) ml, (70.79 + 4.47) ml, and the differences between the two groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusion: 3D-DSA imaging technology can provide effective diagnosis and guidance in the treatment of hepatic artery chemoembolization. It can effectively reduce the radiation exposure dose and radiation intensity, and it is of high clinical value for interventional embolization of liver cancer.
