Background:Tumor-associated antigen overexpression, which has been reported in many types of cancers, may trigger autoantibody secretion. The present study was designed to test whether levels of circulating autoantibodies to survivin protein-derived antigens is altered in liver, esophageal, breast, and lung cancers.Methods:Patients with liver (144), esophageal (159), breast (124), and lung cancers (267), and healthy volunteers (362) were recruited for the study, and serum samples were collected for ELISA autoantibody analysis.Results:Compared with the control group, survivin autoantibody levels were significantly higher in serum from patients with breast cancer and lung cancer, but were significantly lower in serum from patients with liver cancer (p < 0.05). In stage I and II lung cancer, the best-fit areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.731 (standard error [SE] = 0.023; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.687-0.776) and the sensitivity, with 90% specificity, was 23.7%.Conclusion:Analysis across four types of malignancies revealed that the survivin autoantibody had good specificity and sensitivity in lung cancer. Circulating autoantibodies to survivin could be a potential biomarker for the early lung cancer diagnosis.
