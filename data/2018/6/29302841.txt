Background:The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients treated by cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN), and the accuracy of the GPS as a prognostic factor.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients who underwent CN for mRCC between March 1984 and August 2015. In accordance with the GPS criteria, the patients were classified into three groups: GPS 0: C-reactive protein (CRP) â‰¤ 1.0 mg/dl and albumin â‰¥ 3.5 g/dl; GPS 1: CRP > 1.0 mg/dl or albumin < 3.5 g/dl; and GPS 2: CRP > 1.0 mg/dl and albumin < 3.5 g/dl.Results:We enrolled 170 patients (72% male; median age 63.5 years). Fifty-six (33%), 67 (39%), and 47 (28%) patients had a GPS of 0, 1, and 2, respectively. The median overall survivals after CN were 52.4, 19.1, and 8.9 months for patients with a GPS of 0, 1, and 2, respectively (P < 0.0001). In addition to the GPS, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS), Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk classification, histology, sarcomatoid change, clinical T stage, primary tumor size, number of metastatic organs, non-regional lymph node metastasis, and liver metastasis were included in the Cox hazards regression model. Multivariate analysis of these factors revealed that the GPS was an independent prognostic factor of overall survival (P < 0.0001). Harrell's concordance index in the multivariate prognostic model based on ECOG-PS, MSKCC risk criteria, histology, sarcomatoid change, clinical T stage, primary tumor size, number of metastatic organs, non-regional lymph node metastasis, and liver metastasis was 0.609, which increased to 0.652 after the inclusion of the GPS.Conclusions:GPS represents an independent prognostic factor for patients who undergo CN for mRCC.
