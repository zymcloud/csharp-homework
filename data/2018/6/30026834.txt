Background: The Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score is commonly used for prognosis prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The CLIP includes the Child-Pugh grade, which is relatively subjective, for hepatic encephalopathy assessment. A newly developed scoring system called albumin-bilirubin grade (ALBI grade), consists of albumin and bilirubin to assess liver function reserve objectively. Here, we substituted the ALBI grade for the Child-Pugh grade to establish the ALBI-CLIP scoring system and validated its prognostic value in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients treated with trans-catheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed HBV-related HCC patients who received TACE therapy. Baseline characteristics were collected and evaluated to classify patients according to ALBI-CLIP, CLIP and TNM systems. Univariate analyses using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test, as well as multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards regression model, were conducted to detect independent prognostic factors for overall survival. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and a likelihood ratio test (LRT) were both utilized to compare the values of ALBI-CLIP, CLIP and TNM staging systems in predicting survival. Results: With a total of 389 patients included in the current study, 301 (77.4%) and 88 (22.6%) were classified as Child-Pugh grade A and B, respectively. However, 152 (39.1%), 227 (58.4%) and 10 (2.5%) patients were correspondingly classified into ALBI grade 1, 2 and 3. The areas under the curves of ALBI-CLIP, CLIP and TNM systems were 0.804, 0.778 and 0.734, respectively, for predicting 3-month survival; 0.796, 0.778 and 0.733, respectively, for 6-month survival; 0.697, 0.687 and 0.644, respectively, for 1-year survival; and 0.618, 0.612 and 0.569, respectively, for 2-year survival. The LRT indicated that the ALBI-CLIP and the CLIP had similar values of χ2 and Akaike information criterion (AIC) while the TNM system had the smallest χ2 value (χ2 = 12.1, 11.9, 10.5; AIC = 2620.2, 2620.5, 2621.1 for ALBI-CLIP, CLIP and TNM, respectively). Conclusions: In conclusion, our present study suggested that the ALBI-CLIP scoring system retained the prognostic value of the CLIP in HBV-related HCC treated with TACE therapy.
