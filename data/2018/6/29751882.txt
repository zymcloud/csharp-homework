Systemic hematopoietic disorders may present on liver biopsy, and rare cases of primary hepatic lymphoma (PHL) may be encountered. Hepatopathologists must be familiar with the full spectrum of hematopoietic disorders involving the liver and be prepared to exclude benign mimics. PHL, which is confined to the liver without extrahepatic involvement, can present as solitary or multiple nodules, raising consideration for carcinoma on imaging, or may mimic benign inflammatory conditions, posing a diagnostic challenge. This article describes clinical, morphologic, and immunophenotypic features of some of the most common hematopoietic neoplasms involving the liver, along with differential diagnosis and recommended ancillary testing.
