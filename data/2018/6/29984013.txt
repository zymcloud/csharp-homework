Background. The concept of fluorescence-guided navigation surgery based on indocyanine green (ICG) is a developing interest in many fields of surgical oncology. The technique seems to be promising also during hepatic resection. Case Presentation. We reported our experience of ICG-fluorescence-guided liver resection of metastasis located at VIII Couinaud's segment from colon squamous cell carcinoma of a 74-year-old male patient. Results. After laparotomy, the fluorescing tumour has been clearly identified on the liver surface. We have also identified that a large area of fluorescent parenchyma that gets from the peripheral of the lesion up to the portal pedicle such as the neoplasia would interest the right biliary tree in the form of neoplastic lymphangitis. This datum was not preoperatively known. Conclusion. Fluorescent imaging navigation liver resection could be a feasible and safe technique helpful in identifying additional characteristics of lesion. It could be a powerful tool but further studies are required.
