Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent causes of cancer-related death. Sorafenib, a multitarget angiogenesis inhibitor, is an approved frontline treatment for advanced HCC in Western countries, although a complete response (CR) to treatment is infrequently reported. Capecitabine, an oral fluoropyrimidine, has been shown to be effect in both treatment-na√Øve patients and those previously treated with sorafenib. To date, however, only one case of sustained CR to metronomic capecitabine has been reported.Case presentation:We describe three cases of advanced HCC treated with metronomic capecitabine where a CR was obtained. In the first case, capecitabine was administered as first line therapy; in the second case, capecitabine was used after intolerance to sorafenib; while in the third case, capecitabine was administered after sorafenib failure.Conclusion:Capecitabine is a potentially important treatment option for patients with advanced HCC and may even represent a cure in certain cases.
