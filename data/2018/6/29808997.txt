Successful siRNA therapy requires suitable delivery systems with targeting moieties such as small molecules, peptides, antibodies, or aptamers. Galactose (Gal) residues recognized by the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) can serve as potent targeting moieties for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. However, efficient targeting to HCC via galactose moieties rather than normal liver tissues in HCC patients remains a challenge. To achieve more efficient siRNA delivery in HCC, we synthesized various galactoside derivatives and investigated the siRNA delivery capability of nanoparticles modified with those galactoside derivatives. In this study, we assembled lipid/calcium/phosphate nanoparticles (LCP NPs) conjugated with eight types of galactoside derivatives and demonstrated that phenyl Î²-d-galactoside-decorated LCP NPs (L4-LCP NPs) exhibited a superior siRNA delivery into HCC cells compared to normal hepatocytes. VEGF siRNAs delivered by L4-LCP NPs downregulated VEGF expression in HCC in vitro and in vivo and led to a potent antiangiogenic effect in the tumor microenvironment of a murine orthotopic HCC model. The efficient delivery of VEGF siRNA by L4-LCP NPs that resulted in significant tumor regression indicates that phenyl galactoside could be a promising HCC-targeting ligand for therapeutic siRNA delivery to treat liver cancer.
