Aim:This study was designated to evaluate the frequency of anatomic variations of the pancreaticobiliary union.Materials and methods:Our research was observational, comparative and analytical. The investigation was conducted from January 2016-May 2017. This study included 63 patients from Clinic of Gastroenterology and Hepatology - Prishtina, assessed pancreaticobiliary union with Magnetic Resonance cholangiopancreatography.Results:Union of the common bile duct and the major pancreas was biliary-pancreatic type The angle between common bile duct and the major pancreas duct had different sizes average 35.6°. We did not distinguish significant statistical significance in the size of the pancreaticobiliary angle. In men, the union angle was from the average 36.9°, while in females was average 34.3°. No correlation between the age and size of the angle between common bile duct and the major pancreas duct.Conclusions:The union of the common bile duct and the major pancreas duct was in most cases B-P Type. The common channel and angle between common bile duct and the major pancreas duct were normal in most cases.
