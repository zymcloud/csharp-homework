Adult hepatoblastoma (AHB) is a rare liver tumor with a poor prognosis in adolescents and adults. This contrasts with hepatoblastoma in children and is not fully understood. Here we describe two adolescents with AHB who were treated in our hospital. Adolescents are likely to receive less intensive chemotherapy protocols and are treated in hospitals with less experience in pediatric oncology, resulting in poor outcome. More research is necessary for optimal treatment of AHB in adolescents. Adolescents with AHB should be referred to hospitals experienced in pediatric oncology and receive intensive chemotherapy, followed by hemihepatectomy.
