Liver tumor-initiating cells (TICs), the drivers for liver tumorigenesis, accounts for liver tumor initiation, metastasis, drug resistance and relapse. Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway emerges as a critical modulator in liver TIC self-renewal. However, the molecular mechanism of Wnt/β-catenin initiation in liver tumorigenesis and liver TICs is still elusive. Here, we examined the expression pattern of 10 Wnt receptors (FZD1-FZD10), and found only FZD6 is overexpressed along with liver tumorigenesis. What's more, a divergent lncRNA of FZD6, termed lncFZD6, is also highly expressed in liver cancer and liver TICs. LncFZD6 drives liver TIC self-renewal and tumor initiation capacity through FZD6-dependent manner. LncFZD6 interacts with BRG1-embedded SWI/SNF complex and recruits it to FZD6 promoter, and thus drives the transcriptional initiation of FZD6 by chromatin remodeling. WNT5A, a ligand of FZD6, is highly expressed in liver non-TICs and drives the self-renewal of liver TICs through lncFZD6-BRG1-FZD6-dependent manner. Through FZD6 transcriptional regulation in cis, lncFZD6 activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling in liver TICs. LncFZD6-BRG1-Wnt5A/β-catenin pathway can serve as a target for liver TIC elimination. Altogether, lncFZD6 promotes Wnt/β-catenin activation and liver TIC self-renewal through BRG1-dependent FZD6 expression.
