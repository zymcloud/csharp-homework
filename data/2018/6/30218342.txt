Background:There is no consensus regarding the optimal surgical treatment for transplantable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with well-compensated cirrhosis. Our aim was to compare outcomes between Child-Pugh A (CPA) cirrhotics who underwent liver resection or transplantation for HCC.Methods:Clinicopathologic data were retrospectively collected for all surgically treated HCC patients between 7/1992 and 12/2015. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated from the time of operation or diagnosis (intention-to-treat analysis including patients removed from the transplant list). The average overall cost including pre-operative and post-operative procedures was calculated for each group.Results:Of the 513 surgically treated HCC patients, 184 had CPA cirrhosis and fulfilled the Milan criteria (MC). Of those, 95 (52%) were resected and 89 (48%) were transplanted. Twenty-two patients were removed from the transplant list. Transplanted patients were younger (p Conclusions:Since OS is similar between CPA cirrhotics within the MC undergoing resection or transplantation for HCC, but cost is significantly higher for transplantation. Resection should be considered for first-line treatment.
