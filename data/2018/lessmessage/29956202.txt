Obesity is fast becoming a major disorder for mankind. Numerous lifestyle factors play a role in the rising obesity epidemic, including changes in the diet and the lack of physical activity. Unfortunately, more than two-thirds of the adult population in developed countries is considered overweight and more than a third of them are obese. In addition to the well-publicized association of obesity with type II diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, emerging evidence indicates that obesity represents a major risk factor for fatty liver diseases and fatty liver disease-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
