Background/aims:Previous studies have confirmed that microRNAs are involved in the metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of malignancies. In this study, we examined whether miR-650 promotes the migration, invasion, and EMT of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells by targeting the large tumor suppressor kinase 2 gene (LATS2).Methods:qRT-PCR was used to detect expression of miR-650 in HCC tissues and paired normal tissues. MTT and Transwell assay were used to observe the effect of miR-650 on proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells. Western blot assay and Immunohistochemistry were performed to demonstrate association between miR-650 expression level and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related protein. Mechanistically, Reporter luciferase assay was performed to reveal whether large tumor suppressor kinase 2 (LATS2) was a direct target of miR-650 in HCC cells.Results:We observed that miR-650 levels were largely up-regulated in HCC tissues, and that the increased expression was closely associated with the adverse clinical features of HCC patients. Additionally, the expression of LATS2, which was identified as a direct target of miR-650, can counteract the effects of miR-650 in HCC. Furthermore, we demonstrated that high miR-650 expression levels and low LATS2 expression levels in tumors may indicate a poor prognosis for HCC patients.Conclusion:In conclusion, the miR-650/LATS2 pathway may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and an attractive therapeutic target for HCC patients.
