Background and methods:In an attempt to develop potent antitumor agents, the synthesis of a series of N-(6-substituted benzothiazol-2-yl)-2-[(5-(arylamino)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)thio]acetamides (1-14) was described and their cytotoxic effects on A549 human lung adenocarcinoma, MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma, HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma and NIH/3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines were investigated using MTT assay.Results:Phenyl-substituted compounds (8-14) were found to be more effective than naphthyl-substituted compounds (1-7) on cancer cells. Compounds 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14 were identified as the most potent anticancer agents on MCF-7 and HepG2 cell lines and therefore their effects on DNA synthesis and apoptosis/necrosis in MCF-7 cell line were evaluated. Among these compounds, N-(6-methoxybenzothiazol-2-yl)-2-[(5- (phenylamino)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)thio]acetamide (13) was the most selective anticancer agent against MCF-7 and HepG2 cell lines with a SI value of 100. On the other hand, compounds 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14 inhibited DNA synthesis in MCF-7 cell line in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analyses clearly indicated that the compounds showed significant anticancer activity against MCF-7 cell line via the induction of apoptosis dose dependently.Conclusion:According to in vitro assays, compounds 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14 stand out as promising candidates for further studies.
