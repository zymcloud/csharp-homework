Background:Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a standard therapy used in the treatment of intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, balloon-occluded TACE (B-TACE) has been developed.Purpose:This study aimed to clarify the effects of B-TACE in patients with HCC, with a focus on which drug is suitable to suspend in Lipiodol for B-TACE.Methods:We retrospectively evaluated 35 patients with HCC treated with B-TACE. Factors associated with enhanced time to progression (TTP) after B-TACE were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:A total of 35 patients with HCC (40 nodules) were treated with B-TACE between June 2013 and August 2016. Epirubicin was used in 25 nodules and miriplatin was used in 15 nodules. Epirubicin (15.1 months) was significantly better than miriplatin (3.2 months) in prolonging the local TTP after B-TACE (p = 0.0293). Epirubicin showed a positive tendency in TE4 (100% tumor necrosis) rate when compared with miriplatin (p = 0.058). Achievement of TE4 was the only significant factor associated with better TTP after B-TACE. Epirubicin- and TACE-na√Øve statuses were significant factors in achieving TE4 with B-TACE.Conclusion:To enhance the TTP with B-TACE, TE4 should be achieved. Epirubicin is a more optimal anticancer drug (as a Lipiodol suspension) than miriplatin for achieving TE4 with B-TACE.
