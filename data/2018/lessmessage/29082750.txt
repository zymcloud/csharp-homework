Baseline adherence to cirrhotic quality improvement measures was assessed and a system to improve adherence with provider performance feedback was developed, with impact of feedback measured over time. A 6-year retrospective database was created of cirrhotic patients seen between 2006 and 2012, and reviewed for hepatitis A and B serologies, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening, variceal screening, and vaccinations. Cumulative performance feedback was distributed to providers. In all, 265 charts were reviewed retrospectively. Charts were reviewed prospectively at 30 days, 60 days, 6 months, and 12 months. Variceal screening, alpha-fetoprotein, HCC imaging, Pneumovax, lifetime influenza vaccination, hepatitis B vaccination, and hepatitis A serology compliance improved from baseline until 6 months. Hepatitis A vaccination declined at 60 days, but improved from baseline at 6 months. Hepatitis B serology improved from baseline over 12 months. Results were compared graphically. Periodic "cumulative provider performance feedback" is a simple and effective method to improve and maintain adherence to quality measures for cirrhosis.
