Background:Interferon-α (IFN-α) is an adjuvant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but some HCC patients do not respond to treatment with IFN-α.Methods:We performed loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments to examine the role of ISG15 in the IFN-α sensitivity of LH86, HLCZ01, SMMC7721, and Huh7 cell lines and tumor samples.Results:The overexpression of ISG15 reduced apoptosis in Huh7 and LH86 cells in the presence of IFN-α, whereas the shRNA-mediated knock down of ISG15 expression increased apoptosis in both Huh7 and LH86 cells. We identified a putative miR-370 target site in the 3'-UTR in the ISG15 mRNA, and the level of miR-370 expression in HCC cell lines reflected the level of IFN-α-induced apoptosis exhibited by each. Both HCC cell lines and tumor samples had significantly lower levels of miR-370 than the control cells and tissues (PConclusions:Our findings suggest that miR-370 functions as an HCC tumor suppressor and regulator of IFN-α sensitivity and that miR-370 might be a useful prognostic marker for HCC patients.
