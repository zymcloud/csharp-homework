Objective:To determine if the density of general practitioners (GPs) had an impact on overall survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and stage of HCC at initial diagnosis in a North-Eastern region of France.Methods:This retrospective study was performed with 246 consecutive HCC patients referred to a multidisciplinary meeting dedicated to hepatobiliary tumors in the Reims University Hospital from 2012 to 2016. The following data were collected: clinico-biological and radiological data, GP density in patient residence area, stage of HCC at diagnosis, treatment. Survival curves were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and compared with log-rank test.Results:Fifty-one patients (20.7%) were living in a low GP density area (2.2 to 6.8 GPs/10000 inhabitants) and 195 (79.3%) in a high GP density area (6.8 Ã  12.6 GPs/10000 inhabitants). Overall survival of patients living in a low GP density area was not statistically different from that of patients living in a high GP density area (median survival of 11.7 and 14.8 months respectively; p = 0.58). The tumor stage at initial diagnosis and the delay between diagnosis and case presentation at the multidisciplinary meeting were not significantly different between high and low GP density areas.Conclusion:In a cohort of patients with HCC referred to a regional multidisciplinary meeting dedicated to hepatobiliary cancers, the GP density in residence area of patients with HCC did not influence significantly their survival nor the stage of HCC at diagnosis.
