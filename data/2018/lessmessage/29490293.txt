Background/aims:TGF-β1 is beneficial during early liver disease but is tumor-progressive during late stages especially for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus, exploring the underlying mechanisms may provide information about a potentially therapeutic role of TGF-β1 in HCC.Methods:Western blot and real-time quantitative PCR were used to quantify FGFR4 expression in HCC cell lines and a normal liver cell line. After constructing the best silencing FGFR4 expression vector, migration and invasiveness of TGF-β1 in HCC was studied in vitro and in vivo. Western blot was used to study the mechanism of TGF-β1 induction on FGFR4 expression with various inhibitors.Results:HepG2 cell lines had the most FGFR4 expression, and data show that silencing FGFR4 suppressed cell proliferation, invasion and migration in HCC induced by TGF-β1 in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, TGF-β1 induced FGFR4 expression through the ERK pathway.Conclusion:Promoting FGFR4 expression via the ERK pathway, TGF-β1 contributes to HCC invasion and metastasis.
