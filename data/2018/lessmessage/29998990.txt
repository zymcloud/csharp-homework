A 79-year-old woman presented with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. Imaging findings suggested hepatocellular carcinoma although the serum levels of tumor markers were within the normal range. Thus, we performed hepatectomy of S5 and components separation. Histologically, the tumor was diagnosed as reactive lymphoid hyperplasia of the liver. In reactive lymphoid hyperplasia of the liver, a preoperative diagnosis of a malignant tumor was made followed by a definitive diagnosis after resection. Hence, it is imperative to consider reactive lymphoid hyperplasia as a type of liver tumor that is distinct from hepatocellular carcinoma.
