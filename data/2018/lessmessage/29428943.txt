Objective:To compare the outcome of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy (HAIC + RT) versus sorafenib monotherapy in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and major portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT).Methods:This retrospective study included 108 HCC patients with PVTT of the main trunk or first branch and Child-Pugh â‰¤7. Sixty-eight received HAIC + RT and 40 received sorafenib. Patients were then assigned to the HAIC + RT group (n = 36) and the sorafenib group (n = 36) through case-control matching. The decision to treat with HAIC + RT or sorafenib was left to the attending physician.Results:The median overall, progression-free, and postprogression survival were significantly longer in the HAIC + RT group than in the sorafenib group (9.9 vs. 5.3, p = 0.002; 3.9 vs. 2.1, p = 0.048; and 3.7 vs. 1.9 months, p = 0.02, respectively). Multivariate analysis identified HAIC + RT (hazard ratio = 2.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-3.57; p = 0.01) as a significant and independent determinant of overall survival.Conclusions:In patients with advanced HCC and major PVTT, survival was significantly longer in those treated with HAIC + RT than with sorafenib.
