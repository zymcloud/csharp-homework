Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has emerged as an effective loco-regional treatment modality for malignant hepatic tumors. Indeed, studies have demonstrated that RFA of early stage hepatocellular carcinomas can provide comparable overall survival to surgical resection. However, the incidence of local tumor progression (LTP) after RFA is significantly higher than that of surgical resection. Thus, to overcome this limitation, multiple electrode radiofrequency (RF) systems that use a multi-channel RF generator have been developed, and they demonstrate better efficiency in creating larger ablation zones than that using the conventional RFA with a single electrode. Furthermore, RFA with multiple electrodes can allow the "no-touch" ablation technique which may also help to reduce LTP. Another technique that would be helpful in this regard is multi-modality-ultrasound fusion imaging, which helps to not only more accurately determine the target lesion by enabling the RFA of small, poorly visible or invisible tumors, but also improve the monitoring of procedures and determine the appropriateness of the ablation margin. In addition, new energy sources, including microwave and cryoablation, have been introduced in imaging-guided tumor ablation. In this review, these recently introduced ablation techniques and the results of the most current animal and clinical studies are discussed.
