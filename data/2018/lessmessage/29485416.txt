Background:Tripartite motif containing 14 (TRIM14) has been reported to play a critical role in tumor development. However, little is known about TRIM14 expression and its clinical significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression and prognostic value of TRIM14 in patients with HCC.Materials and methods:The mRNA and protein levels of TRIM14 in HCC were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. The association of TRIM14 expression with clinicopathological factors, overall survival (OS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) was analyzed.Results:TRIM14 expression was significantly upregulated in HCC-related tissues. High TRIM14 expression correlated with C-reactive protein (p = 0.01), alanine aminotransferase (p = 0.02), tumor size (p = 0.005), lesion number (p = 0.023), vascular invasion (p = 0.041), tumor/node/metastasis (TNM) stage (p = 0.001), and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage (p = 0.003). In addition, high TRIM14 expression was associated with poor OS and RFS (both p Conclusion:TRIM14 is a potential prognostic predictor for OS and RFS in patients with HCC.
