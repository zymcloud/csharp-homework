Introduction:Various transarterial embolotherapies for different hepatic etiologies are performed through the celiac axis (CA). However, this pathway is not always patent due to the extensive stenosis or occlusion of the origin of CA. In such situations, the pancreaticoduodenal arcades (PDAs) catheterization is the main alternative to gain access to the hepatic arteries as demonstrated in clinical studies.Presentation of case:We report two cases of life-threating hepatic hemorrhage indicated for emergency transarterial embolization (TAE).Discussion:The massive hemorrhage was due to spontaneous rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the first case and due to post liver blunt trauma in the second case. Owing to severe stenosis of the origin of CA, PDAs were used as a salvage alternative route for emergency TAE of hepatic arteries.Conclusion:Endovascular management of massive hepatic hemorrhage in cases of inaccessibility to hepatic arteries through CA is a highly challenging situation in which the technical success depends on the operator experience, choice of the material and anatomical knowledge of hepatic arterial collateral supply.
