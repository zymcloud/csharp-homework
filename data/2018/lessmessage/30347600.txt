Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most fatal malignancies worldwide with high lethality. However, the exact mechanism of liver tumorigenesis is still unclear. AnnexinA7 (ANXA7) is a Ca2+-binding protein which is involved in membrane organization and dynamics and indicated a role of ANXA7 in cancer. However, the action of ANXA7 in hepatocellular carcinoma and the relative mechanism is still indistinct.Objective:To gain more insight into the biological function of ANXA7 and assess its possible influence on proliferation and metastasis capacity of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells with the relative mechanism.Methods:ANXA7 was down-regulated by RNA interference in both HepG2 and smmc-7721 cells. The decreased cell proliferation was detected by MTT method and colony formation assay. To confirm the result of cell proliferation, Ki-67 and cyclinD1 expression was examined by Western Blot. The increased apoptosis capacity of the cells was detected with cell cytometry and PI staining respectively. Bcl-2 and Bax expression was further investigated by Western blot and the decreased ration of Bcl-2/Bax might explain the increased apoptosis.Results:Cell metastasis showed significantly limited ability which was tested by wound healing assay and Transwell assay. Meanwhile, the key biomarkers of cell metastasis E-cadherin expression increased while MMP-9 decreased. Furthermore, we found that ANXA7 played its role via MAPK/ERK pathway.Conclusions:ANXA7 might involve in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma and act as an oncogene which might be a potential therapeutic target for treatment.
