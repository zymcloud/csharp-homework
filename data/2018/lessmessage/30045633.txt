In this study, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse xenograft model, MTT assay, colony formation, nuclear staining, and Annexin-V/PI staining assays were used to evaluate the effect of Qingjie Fuzheng granules (QFG) on cell proliferation and apoptosis of HCC cell in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, Western blotting was performed to detect the expression of Fas, FasL, Bcl-2, Bax, and the activation of caspase-3/-8/-9. The results showed that QFG reduced tumor weight ( P
