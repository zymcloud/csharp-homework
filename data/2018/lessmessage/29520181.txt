Objective:To evaluate the efficacy and prognostic factors associated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with microwave ablation (MWA) versus TACE alone for a large solitary or multinodular hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).Materials and methods:This retrospective study involved 258 patients with a large solitary or multinodular HCCs (not more than 10 tumors) who underwent TACE + MWA (n = 92) or TACE alone (n = 166) between July 2011 and April 2015. Local tumor control, survival outcomes, and complications were compared between the two groups. Prognostic factors for time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:The median duration of follow-up was 21.2 months (range, 4-45 months). The median TTP and OS were 12.5 months and 26.6 months, respectively, for the TACE + MWA group and 6.7 months and 17.1 months, respectively, for the TACE group (p < 0.001). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 85.9, 59.8, and 32.6%, respectively, for the TACE + MWA group and 59.0, 40.4, and 11.4%, respectively, for the TACE group (p < 0.001). The corresponding recurrence rates were 47.8, 78.3, and 94.6% for the TACE + MWA group, respectively, and 74.7, 96.4, and 97.6%, respectively, for the TACE group (p < 0.001). Logistic regression analyses showed that the treatment method, tumor size, and tumor number were significant prognostic factors for TTP and OS.Conclusion:TACE + MWA appears to have more advantages compared to TACE in prolonging OS, with a satisfactory TTP, for inpatients with solitary large or multinodular HCCs. Treatment method, tumor size, and tumor number are significant prognostic factors for TTP and OS. Further randomized, multi-center, prospective trials are required to confirm the findings of this study.
