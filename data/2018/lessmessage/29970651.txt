Aim:The aim of this is study is to assess the efficacy and safety of conversion capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) in Chinese patients with potentially resectable colorectal liver metastases (CLMs).Patients and methods:Thirty patients (median age 57.5 years) with potentially resectable CLMs were treated with XELOX in a single-arm, open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter clinical trial.Results:The objective response rate in the 30 patients was 40% (95% confidence interval: 22.7%-59.4%), and the rate of conversion to resectable CLMs was 43.3%. Patients who underwent liver resection (n = 11) had a longer median progression-free survival and overall survival than those who did not. XELOX showed an acceptable safety profile.Conclusion:XELOX may effectively convert potentially resectable CLM into resectable CLM, providing survival benefits with a favorable safety profile.Clinical trials.gov identifier:NCT 00997685.
