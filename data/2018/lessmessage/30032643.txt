Lenvatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR1-3), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR1-4), platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), and rearranged during transfection (RET). These receptors are important for tumor angiogenesis, and lenvatinib inhibits tumor angiogenesis by inhibiting function of these receptors. Phase I trials of lenvatinib were conducted at the same time in Japan, Europe, and the United States, and tumor shrinkage effects were observed in thyroid cancer, endometrial cancer, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, sarcoma, and colon cancer. Lenvatinib is a promising drug that has shown therapeutic effects against various solid tumors. Adverse events, such as hypertension, proteinuria, diarrhea, and delayed wound healing, can occur with lenvatinib treatment. Managing these adverse events is also important for the use of lenvatinib. In this mini-review article, we outline the current state, toxicity, and future prospects of lenvatinib toward thyroid cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and lung cancer.
