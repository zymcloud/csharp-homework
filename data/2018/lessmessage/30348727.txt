Background:Patients with liver metastasis from breast cancer (LMBC) are usually offered systemic therapy. However, for those with progressive liver disease and limited extra-hepatic conditions, local liver management becomes an option. Herein we present our experience with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC).Patients and methods:From 1999 to 2018, 42 patients with LMBC, who had progressive liver metastasis after systemic therapy, were treated with HAIC. A catheter was placed angiographically into the hepatic artery and remained there for 5 consecutive days. One cycle of chemotherapy consisted of mitoxantrone, 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid, and cisplatin. This treatment was repeated at monthly intervals. The medical records were reviewed and analyzed for hepatic tumor response, progression-free survival, overall survival and adverse effects.Results:Complete response was observed in two patients (5%), partial response in 18 patients (43%) and stable disease in eight patients (19%). Fourteen patients (33%) had progressive disease after HAIC. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 8.4 and 19.3 months, respectively. There was no death related to HAIC. The patients with response to the treatment had a significant survival benefit (p<0.005).Conclusion:HAIC can be an option for those with progressive liver disease who are heavily pretreated while their extra-hepatic conditions are minimal or stable.
