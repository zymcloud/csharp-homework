Aim:To confirm whether cirrhosis is indispensable for the non-invasive diagnostic criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-endemic areas.Methods:Between January 2014 and December 2014, a total of 409 patients with pathologically proven focal liver lesions who underwent contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) were recruited from our institution. Clinical liver cirrhosis, HBV/HCV infection and HCC-typical vascular pattern of the targeted lesion on CEUS were evaluated. The following 3 criteria were applied to these patients to diagnose HCC: criterion 1, clinical liver cirrhosis and HCC-typical vascular pattern; criterion 2, HBV/HCV infection and HCC-typical vascular pattern; criterion 3, HBV/HCV infection or clinical liver cirrhosis and HCC-typical vascular pattern. Pathological reports were considered the gold standard.Results:A total of 311 patients had confirmed HCC by pathology. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and area under the ROC curve for criterion 1 were 29.6, 90.8, 44.3, 91.1, 28.9, and 0.60% respectively. For criterion 2, they were 83.3, 74.5, 81.2, 91.2, 58.4, and 0.79%, respectively, and for criterion 3, they were 86.2, 72.5, 82.9, 90.9, 62.3, and 0.79% respectively.Conclusions:In HBV-endemic areas, when using the HBV/HCV infection instead of cirrhosis as the precondition of the non-invasive diagnostic criteria for HCC, we should be aware of the potential false positive. Cirrhosis still plays an important role in the non-invasive diagnostic criteria for HCC because of the high specificity.
