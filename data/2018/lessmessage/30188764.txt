Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is diagnosed in both cytological and histological specimens on the basis of distinct nuclear morphology. These features may not be prominent in some PTC variants and may be seen in some benign conditions. It is necessary to differentiate PTC from other neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions since it affects treatment strategy and patients' fate. Emerin is a type II integral membrane protein of the inner nuclear membrane that has a characteristic staining pattern in PTC. CD56 is a homophilic membrane glycoprotein that is expressed in thyroid follicular epithelial cells and adrenal glands. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of emerin (positivity, percentage, and highlighting nuclear features) and CD56 (positive versus negative) both singly and in combination for differentiation of PTC from other neoplastic and nonneoplastic mimics. This study was performed on 50 cases of PTC, 9 cases of follicular adenoma (FA), and 12 cases of nonneoplastic thyroid lesions using immunohistochemistry for detection of emerin and CD56. Positive emerin expression was seen in 82% of PTC and in 16.7% of nonneoplastic cases with an absence of expression in FA. CD56 was expressed in 88.9% of FA, 91.7% of nonneoplastic cases and in a minority of PTC cases (6%). Positive emerin revealed 82% sensitivity and 90% specificity, while emerin-highlighted nuclear changes was more specific (95%). Negative CD56 expression revealed 84% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Combined positive emerin (including highlighting nuclear changes) and negative CD56 showed 72% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Positive emerin expression (moderate/strong) and its highlighting nuclear changes combined with negative CD56 could be a very helpful procedure in difficult and overlapping cases with high diagnostic validity (high specificity and positive predictive value).
