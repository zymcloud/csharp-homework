Background/aims:Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the transport of long-chain fatty acids for β-oxidation. Increasing evidence has indicated that CPT1A plays an important role in carcinogenesis. However, the expression and prognostic value of CPT1A in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been extensively studied.Methods:Here, we collected 66 post-operative liver cancer tissue samples. Gene profile expression was tested by RT-PCR. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed and multivariate analysis with Cox's Proportional Hazard Model was used for confirming the selected markers' predictive efficiency for HCC patients' survival. A simple risk scoring system was created based on Cox's regression modeling and bootstrap internal validation.Results:Cox multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that CPT1A, tumor size, intrahepatic metastasis, TNM stage and histological grade were independent risk factors for the prognosis of HCC patients after surgery. Our genetic and clinical data-based (GC) risk scoring system revealed that HCC patients whose total score≥3 are more likely to relapse and die than patients whose total score Conclusions:The genetic and clinical data-based risk scoring model can be a promising predictive tool for liver cancer patients' prognosis after operation.
