Purpose:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCV being a ribonucleic acid virus has considerable sequence variability. Assessment of viral load and genotype is necessary for designing treatment strategies and monitoring for viral resistance among HCV-infected cases. HCC is the most common form of liver cancer, often occurring in people with chronic hepatitis B or C. We undertook this study to observe genotype distribution of the virus in HCV patients from Mumbai.Materials and methods:Between January 2017 and December 2017, the study was conducted on 120 chronic hepatitis outpatients from a tertiary care hospital, Mumbai, after obtaining ethics approval. All these diagnosed cases of HCV were subjected to molecular diagnosis in a research institute, Mumbai, by real-time polymerase chain reaction-based techniques.Results:Males were more preponderant than females with HCV infection, and the highest number of HCV-infected cases was observed in the age group of 41-50 years. Genotype 3 (n = 70; 58.3%) accounted for the highest number of cases followed by genotypes 1b (n = 29; 24.2%) and then 1a (n = 14; 11.7%). Mixed genotypes 1b + 3 and individual genotype 4 were found in two cases each (1.7%). A total of three samples (2.5%) were found with untypeable genotype.Conclusion:The major HCV genotype observed was 3 which is difficult to treat with direct-acting antivirals, owing to the more rapid progression of liver disease, increased rates of steatosis (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), a higher risk for cancer (HCC). We believe this study is the first one to address the prevalence of mixed genotypes and untypeable genotype from India.
