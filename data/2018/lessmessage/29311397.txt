Aim:The objective of this study was to evaluate short- and long-term survival after surgical treatment between young and older hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients beyond the Milan criteria.Material and methods:One hundred fifty-seven HCC patients (â‰¤ 55 years old) were categorized into group A, and one hundred fifty-eight HCC patients (> 55 years old) were categorized into group B. Postoperative complications and overall survival were retrospectively analyzed.Results:Older HCC patients had a higher rate of delayed extubation after surgery and suffered more complications after surgery, especially major complications. Intraoperative blood transfusion, liver fibrosis/cirrhosis and delayed extubation were risk factors related to postoperative complications. Microvascular invasion (MVI), tumor diameter, postoperative alpha-fetoprotein and the presence of satellites were independent risk factors for long-term survival. Young patients had more advanced tumors. Overall survival rates at 1, 3 and 5-years were 78.1%, 45.1% and 27.4% for young patients, respectively, and 86.5%, 57.5% and 42.4% for older patients, respectively (p = 0.007).Conclusion:The category A group had poorer tumor characteristics and worse prognoses than the category B group.
