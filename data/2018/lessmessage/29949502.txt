Purpose:Ceftriaxone elimination occurs through breast cancer resistance transporter (BCRP) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) which are expressed on the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. Eltrombopag, a thrombopoetin receptor agonist used in the treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura, is reported in in vitro studies as an inhibitor of intestinal BCRP but not an inhibitor of hepatic BCRP. Thus, the present study evaluates the effect of therapeutic doses of eltrombopag on the clinical pharmacokinetics of intravenous ceftriaxone.Methods:Healthy adult (n=12) were treated with oral doses of eltrombopag (0, 25 or 50 mg) 28 and 4 h prior to intravenous ceftriaxone administration (1g). Serial blood samples were collected up to 48 h after ceftriaxone administration and plasma samples were analysed by LC-MS/MS using 50 μL aliquots (total concentration) and 100 μL (unbound concentration).Results:A method to analyze total and unbound ceftriaxone in plasma using LC-MS/MS was developed and validated with linearity from 1 to 200 μg/mL. Both methods are sensitive, precise and accurate with coefficients of variation less than 15% in the study of inter- and intra-assay precision and accuracy. Ceftriaxone pharmacokinetics in healthy adults were described using a bicompartmental model, with a mean clearance of 0.96 L/h (CI95% 0.71-1.20) and AUC0-∞of 1106 mg.h/mL (CI95% 811-1400) for volunteers that received only ceftriaxone; clearance of 0.95 L/h (CI95% 0.77-1.13) and AUC0-∞ of 1083 mg.h/mL (CI95% 876-1290) for volunteers that received ceftriaxone plus 25 mg of eltrombopag and clearance of 0.96 L/h (CI95% 0.74-1.19) and AUC0-∞ of 1072 mg.h/mL (CI95% 872-1273) for volunteers that received ceftriaxone plus 50 mg of eltrombopag.Conclusions:The results do not support the existence of a clinical pharmacokinetic drug interaction involving hepatic BCRP in human subjects receiving intravenous ceftriaxone and oral eltrombopag.
