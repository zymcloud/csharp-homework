Introduction:Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the gallbladder is extremely rare, and accounts for about 3% of all malignant gallbladder neoplasms.Presentation of case:We report the case of a 58-year-old woman who presented with acute onset epigastric pain radiating to the back. The initial diagnosis, based on radiological images, was an incidental gallbladder mass with multiple gallstones. A staging laparoscopy was performed, followed by exploratory laparotomy with radical cholecystectomy. Segments 4b and 5 of the liver and the first part of the duodenum with the transverse colon were also resected. Histopathology of the gallbladder mass revealed invasive moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with infiltration of liver segments 4b and 5, the first part of the duodenum, and two pericaval lymph nodes (with lymphovascular and perineural invasion). The primary tumour was scored as pT3, pN2, M1, stage IVB, based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer classification, version 7. The patient was discharged postoperatively and started adjuvant chemotherapy.Discussion:The best option for treating early-stage gallbladder cancer is radical surgery, while adjuvant chemo-radiation can also be beneficial. Our patient did not exhibit the typical symptoms of gallbladder cancer, and radiography was required for her diagnosis. Thus, additional work is needed to improve the detection of squamous cell carcinoma to improve the prognosis of patients like our own.Conclusion:Clinicians must be alert to the possibility of squamous cell gallbladder carcinoma, and gallbladder neoplasms should be among the possibilities considered during the differential diagnosis of symptoms related to the gallbladder.
