Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading cancer in the world, susceptible to potentially curative liver resection (LR) in selected cases. Centrally located HCC (CL-HCC) are sited in central liver segments and may require complex LR because of their relationship to major vascular and biliary structures and deep parenchymal location. Even though extended segment-oriented resections are recommended for oncological reasons, more conservative LR may be indicated in patients with cirrhosis to preserve an adequate function of the future remnant liver (FRL). To extend the indication to LR and to increase the safety of the surgical procedure, preoperative portal vein embolization (PVE) or sequential transarterial embolization/chemoembolization (TAE/TACE) and PVE have been widely used, to induce atrophy of the embolized segments involved by the tumor and compensatory hypertrophy of the FLR. The most appropriate surgical strategy for small uninodular CL-HCC remains controversial, and should be decided according to the features of the tumor at preoperative imaging, the relationship with major intrahepatic vessels and the expected function of the FRL. We report here two cases of elderly cirrhotic patients with unifocal small CL-HCC, where the surgical strategy was decided according to the kind of relationship of the tumor with the hepatic hilum at preoperative imaging. In the first case there was no clear evidence of neoplastic infiltration of the hilar vessels, so that a minor conservative LR was preferred. In the second patient the tumor was suspected to infiltrate the right portal vein, and a major LR was performed after sequential TACE/PVE.Key words:Centrally located, Future remnant liver, Hepatocellular carcinoma, Liver cirrhosis, Liver resection, Portal vein embolization, Transarterial chemoembolization.
