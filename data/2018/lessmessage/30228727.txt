Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common cause of chronic liver disease that can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. This review provides brief answers to common questions clinicians may have about NASH. The diagnosis of NASH currently requires a liver biopsy, although non-invasive tests are being evaluated and may supplant liver biopsy in the near future. Treatment is focused on lifestyle modifications, with new medications currently in clinical trials.
