Background:Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is an over accumulation of triglyceride in the liver without alcohol consumption. Its major cause is insulin resistance. Patients with NAFLD can develop liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that regulate post-transcriptional gene silencing. Previous research reported that miR-29 family (a, b and c) and miR-122 have an important role in regulating insulin resistance related to NAFLD.Objective:The purpose of this study was to investigate that miR-29 and miR-122 can be possible biomarkers for non-invasive diagnosis of NAFLD.Method:Serum samples were collected from 58 NAFLD patients and 34 healthy controls. MiRNAs were extracted from serum by using microRNA purification kit followed by polyuridylation, reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR. Also, we analyzed the correlation between miR-29 and miR-122 and level of liver inflammation in NAFLD patients.Results:We found that the serum miR-29a levels in NAFLD patients were significantly lower (P = 0.006) than the control group, while miR-29c levels were unchanged, and miR-29b levels were undetectable. However, we found that serum miR-122 levels in NAFLD patients were significantly higher (P Conclusion:The levels of miR-29a and miR-122 might be beneficial and compelling as possible biomarkers for non-invasive diagnosis of NAFLD.
