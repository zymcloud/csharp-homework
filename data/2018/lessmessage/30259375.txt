Vascular disease is one of the top five causes of death and affects a variety of other diseases, such as heart, nervous system, and metabolic disorders. Vascular dysfunction is a hallmark of ischemia, cancer, and inflammatory diseases and can accelerate the progression of diseases. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a new type of noncoding RNAs with covalent bond ring structure, which have been reported to be abnormally expressed in many human diseases. circRNAs regulate gene expression through the sponging of microRNAs (miRNAs) and can also be used as disease biomarkers. Here we will summarize the functions of circRNAs in vascular diseases, including vascular dysfunction, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus-related retinal vascular dysfunction, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, carotid atherosclerotic disease, hepatic vascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma, aortic aneurysm, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
