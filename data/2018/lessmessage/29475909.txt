Background/aim:Hyaluronan (HA) is used as a biomarker of liver fibrosis, which is a key risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We examined the effects of prolonged pharmacological inhibition of HA synthesis on liver carcinogenesis.Materials and methods:Liver tumors were induced in mice by administering 0.03% thioacetamide (TAA) in drinking water over a 12-month period. Animals simultaneously received either a diet containing of an inhibitor of HA synthesis [4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU)], or a control diet.Results:Addition of 4-MU resulted in a significantly higher number of tumors compared to TAA treatment alone. Moreover, addition of 4-MU resulted in a dose-dependent increase in maximum tumor size.Conclusion:While local HA suppression has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on HCC in vitro and in tumor cell implantation experiments, the present results indicate that systemic inhibition of HA synthesis by 4-MU supplementation facilitates hepatic carcinogenesis in vivo.
