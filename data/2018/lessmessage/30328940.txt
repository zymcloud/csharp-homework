Uveal melanoma is the most common adult primary intraocular cancer. Although liver metastasis is common to the natural history of the disease, metastasis to the fellow eye is extremely rare. Here we report the case of a 59-year-old man with choroidal melanoma in his right eye who underwent enucleation at a different center. The patient was referred to our service 21 months postoperatively, complaining of decreased vision. He was found to have a new pigmented choroidal tumor in his left eye associated with liver disease. Ocular ultrasonography and liver biopsy with histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis were performed and confirmed the diagnosis. Few similar cases have been described in the literature. The differential diagnosis included primary bilateral choroidal melanoma and metastatic choroidal tumor from a primary skin melanoma.
