The pathogenesis of NAFLD is multi-faceted and mechanisms underlying the progression from simple steatosis to NASH have not been fully deciphered. The emerging field of epigenetics, an inheritable phenomenon capable of changing gene expression without altering DNA sequence, unveils a new perspective on the development of NAFLD and subsequent progression to HCC. In fact, numerous studies have highlighted the potential involvement of unhealthy daily habits such as physical inactivity and over-nutrition in the onset and development of NAFLD through epigenetic mechanisms. This chapter will discuss several epigenetic modulations including DNA methylation, histone modifications, functions of non-coding RNAs as well as RNA methylation implicated in the pathogenesis of NAFLD-HCC. On the basis of currently wealthy knowledge of DNA epigenetics, the rapidly growing field of RNA epigenetics will certainly drive forward a new avenue of research direction shedding light on the advancement of better diagnostics, prognostics and therapeutics in the coming era of precision medicine.
