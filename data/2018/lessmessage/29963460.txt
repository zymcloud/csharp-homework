Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections represent one of the major public health problems in global context. More than 2 billion people in the world have been infected with this virus at some point of time in their life and millions are chronically infected, indicating that chronic HBV-infected subjects remain as a living source of HBV transmission. The public health impact of this is tremendous. Considerable numbers of chronic HBV-infected individuals would eventually develop progressive liver diseases and their complications like hepatic failure, liver cirrhosis (LC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Epidemiological studies have suggested that about 0.6 to 1.2 million people die annually from HBV-related liver diseases. These figures about death due to HBV and sufferings from HBV-related diseases indicate a notion of medical emergencies about HBV. In addition to these, the impact of HBV on health care delivery system moves beyond these numbers of HBV-related patients and HB-related deaths. This is because significant insights have already been developed about epidemiology, virology, and pathogenesis of HBV. Also, an effective and widely used preventive vaccine is available against HBV. In addition to these, antiviral drugs against HBV have been developed from early 1980s and several such drugs are now available commercially in the open market around the worldwide. Unfortunately, the ongoing therapeutic regimens could not stand the test of time and new insights about HBV pathogenesis are required for the development of new, novel, and evidence-based therapies for chronic HBV infections.
