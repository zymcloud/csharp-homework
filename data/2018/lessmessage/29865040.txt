Background:Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) and Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) have been considered as indicators for prognosis in various cancers. However, the prognostic values of NLR and PLR have never been tested in gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) with hepatic involvement.Objective:The aim of the current study was to assess the prognostic significance of NLR, PLR, and other candidate biomarkers in GBC with liver involvement.Methods:Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were utilized to pinpoint the cut-off values for NLR, PLR, and Monocyte-Lymphocyte Ratio (MLR). Univariate analyses were employed to estimate the impact of NLR, PLR, MLR, and other inflammatory indexes on median survival. Multivariate analyses were used to verify the independent prognostic predictors.Results:Eighty four patients were enrolled from 2009 to 2017. The cut-off values for NLR, PLR, and MLR were 3.20, 117.75, and 0.25, respectively. Univariate analyses revealed that TNM stage, NLR, PLR, MLR, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, and carcinoembryonic antigen were significantly associated with decreased survival in GBC with hepatic involvement. Advanced TNM stage (P< 0.001) and elevated preoperative NLR (P= 0.002) were significantly associated with lower median survival periods, as revealed by multivariate analyses.Conclusions:These findings suggest that preoperative NLR may be an independent prognostic factor in evaluating prognosis in GBC with liver involvement.
