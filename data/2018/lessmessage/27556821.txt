Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a global health problem associated with chronic liver disease. Precursor lesions are described, and the correct diagnosis of liver nodules is paramount when considering liver transplantation. We evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-2 in HCC and precursors lesion in a single institution series of whole liver explants between 2013 and 2015, evaluating morphologic and clinical variables. The study comprised 67 patients (32.8% female) and 107 nodules. The mean age of the patients was 52.7 years (29 to 70 y). There were no significant epidemiologic differences among malignant lesions, dysplastic nodules, and regenerative nodules. Angiopoietin-2 expression was significantly more expressed in carcinoma when compared with regenerative lesions (P
