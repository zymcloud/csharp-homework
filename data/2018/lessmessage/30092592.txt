Background/aims:The aim of the current study was to identify potential prognostic long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) biomarkers for predicting survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and bioinformatics analysis.Methods:RNA sequencing and clinical data of HCC patients from TCGA were used for prognostic association assessment by univariate Cox analysis. A prognostic signature was built using stepwise multivariable Cox analysis, and a comprehensive analysis was performed to evaluate its prognostic value. The prognostic signature was further evaluated by functional assessment and bioinformatics analysis.Results:Thirteen differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) were identified and used to construct a single prognostic signature. Patients with high risk scores showed a significantly increased risk of death (adjusted P Conclusions:The novel lncRNA expression signature identified in the present study may be a potential biomarker for predicting the prognosis of HCC patients.
