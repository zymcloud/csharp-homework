Objective:To evaluate the comparative therapeutic efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and hepatic resection (HR) for breast cancer liver metastases (BCLMs).Methods:Studies that had examined the outcomes for both RFA and HR for BCLM were identified by searching the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Pooled analyzes of the overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and short-term outcomes of BCLM were performed.Results:Patients with BCLM gained many more survival benefits from HR than from RFA with regard to the 3-year OS rate (combined odds ratio (OR) 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29-0.59, PConclusions:HR takes precedence over RFA in the treatment of patients with BCLM, considering the better survival rate. RFA gives rise to fewer complications and can be carried out with a shorter hospital stay, compared to HR. RFA should be reserved for patients who are not optimum candidates for resection.
