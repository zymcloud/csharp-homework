Obesity reaches the dimensions of the global epidemic. It directly contributes to an increase in the prevalence of systemic diseases associated with obesity. Obesity and overweight globally cause 3.5 million deaths annually [1]. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has become the most common chronic liver disease in developed countries and is considered to be a liver manifestation of metabolic syndrome. The extent and burden of the disease are increasing and reaching epidemic proportions because of its close association with the epidemic of obesity and diabetes mellitus type [2]. It affects 30 % of the adult population [2]. There is an alarming increase in prevalence among children and adolescents. However, in the group of patients with high cardiometabolic risk, we can see a significantly higher prevalence of NAFLD. Prevalence in obese patients is 75 -92 %, in diabetic patients prevalence is between 60 -70 % [3]. A significant proportion of patients with NAFLD will suffer from a progressive form of the disease - non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is associated with the development of advanced liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and its complications. The growing prevalence of NASH in the near future will bring the advanced cohort of our patients to the stage of an advanced liver disease. If the adverse epidemiological trend is not reversed, in the next decade the most common cause of liver transplantation will be NASH. A steadily rising trend can be seen in an increase in the number of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma causally related to NASH [4]. Treatment based on the influence of key pathogenetic mechanisms could alter the individual's future as well as the global burden arising with NASH. New molecules with anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects will play a key role in the future. Key words: cirrhosis - insulin resistance - metabolic syndrome - NASH.
