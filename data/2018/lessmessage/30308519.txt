Background/aims:The roles and related mechanisms of RNA binding protein FUS (fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma) are unclear in numerous cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot, cell viability, transwell migration and invasion, tumor spheres formation and in vivo tumor formation assays were used to examine the effects of FUS on HCC progression in HuH7 and MHCC97 cells. Additionally, transcriptome analysis based on RNA-sequencing data, qRT-PCR, western blots, luciferase reporter and RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were used to explore the LATS1/2 (large tumor suppressor kinases 1/2)-related mechanisms contributing to FUS functions. Finally, qRT-PCR and western blot analysis were used to detect the levels of FUS and LATS1/2 in HCC and adjacent normal tissues, and the correlation between them in HCC tissues.Results:Overexpression of FUS decreased cell viability, migration, invasion and stemness. Moreover, FUS interacted and stabilized LATS1/2 stability, and thus promoted LATS1/2 expression and activated Hippo pathway. Finally, FUS and LAST1/2 levels were positively correlated and significantly down-regulated in HCC tissues.Conclusion:We demonstrate that FUS/LATS1/2 axis inhibits HCC progression via activating Hippo pathway.
