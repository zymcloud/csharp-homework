Introduction and aim:The prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are increasing. Type 2 diabetes mellitus may aggravate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, increasing the risk of developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. This study aims to determine the effect of type 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin therapy on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in the patients with morbid obesity.Material and methods:Clinical, anthropometric and laboratory data were analyzed together with intraoperative liver biopsies from morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery.Results:219 patients with morbid obesity were evaluated. Systemic arterial hypertension (55.9% vs. 33.8%, p = 0.004) and dyslipidemia (67.1% vs. 39.0%, p < 0.001) were more prevalent in patients with diabetes when compared to patients without diabetes. In multivariate analysis, type 2 diabetes mellitus was an independent risk factor for severe steatosis (RR = 2.04, p = 0.023) and severe fibrosis (RR = 4.57, p = 0.013). Insulin therapy was significantly associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (RR = 1.89, p = 0.001) and fibrosis (RR = 1.75, p = 0.050) when all patients were analysed, but when only patients with diabetes were analysed, insulin therapy was not associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or fibrosis.Conclusion:Type 2 diabetes mellitus plays an important role in the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease as an independent risk factor for severe fibrosis.
