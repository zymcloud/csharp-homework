Objectives:Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a rare type of liver cancer. No clinically useful prognostic factors have been reported for patients with advanced ICC. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical prognostic factors of patients with advanced ICC receiving gemcitabine plus cisplatin combination therapy (GC) as standard first-line chemotherapy.Methods:A retrospective analysis was performed of the data of patients with ICC treated at our institution from March 2011 to January 2016. We used the Cox regression model and estimated the hazard ratios of potential prognostic factors for survival.Results:Of 216 patients with biliary tract cancer receiving GC as first-line chemotherapy, we extracted data for 77 patients who were diagnosed with ICC and received GC as first-line chemotherapy. The median overall survival was 13.8 months (95% CI, 8.9-18.6). In multivariate analysis, pretreatment serum lactate dehydrogenase (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.53, p = 0.005), C-reactive protein (HR: 3.06, p = 0.001), and carcinoembryonic antigen (HR: 2.39, p = 0.03) levels were significantly associated with overall survival.Conclusions:Readily available clinical laboratory values reliably predicted the prognosis of ICC patients receiving GC therapy. If validated in other studies, these results may provide a useful tool for individual patient-risk evaluation and the design and interpretation of future trials.
