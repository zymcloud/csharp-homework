No ideal cross-linking agent has been identified for decellularized livers (DLs) yet. In this study, we evaluated structural improvements and biocompatibility of porcine DLs after cross-linking with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Porcine liver slices were decellularized and then loaded with AgNPs (100 nm) after optimization of the highest non-toxic concentration (5 Âµg/mL) using Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and EAhy926 human endothelial cell lines. The cross-linking effect of AgNPs was evaluated and compared to that of glutaraldehyde and ethyl carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide. The results indicated that AgNPs improved the ultra-structure of DLs' collagen fibres with good porosity and increased DLs' resistance against in vitro degradation with good cytocompatibility. AgNPs decreased the host inflammatory reaction against implanted porcine DL slices in vivo and increased the polarization of M2 macrophages. Thus, structural and functional improvements of Porcine DLs could be achieved using AgNPs.
