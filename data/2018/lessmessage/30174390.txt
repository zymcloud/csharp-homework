Hepatitis C virus (HCV) represents a global burden on healthcare that affects over 150 million people worldwide. In the past, HCV genotype 3 was considered difficult to treat relative to other genotypes. Genotype 3 has been associated with a higher rate of complications, including fatty liver disease, fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and mortality. However, with the advent of first- and second-generation direct-acting antivirals, genotype 3 can be treated effectively. Additionally, these new drugs are well tolerated by patients and have significantly fewer side effects compared to ribavirin and interferon-based regimens. However, while great strides have been made in overcoming biological barriers, our next challenge lies in overcoming economic and financial obstacles if we are to eradicate HCV genotype 3. Herein, we review the clinical features associated with HCV genotype 3, current and emerging treatment regimens, and challenges associated with treatment.
