Aims:The study aimed to evaluate the effects of tolvaptan treatment on survival of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis with refractory ascites.Methods:This multicenter, retrospective, observational study included patients with cirrhosis who were treated with tolvaptan for hepatic ascites refractory to conventional diuretics. Patients who could and could not decrease accompanying diuretics within 1 month after tolvaptan administration were defined as the "Decreased" and "Not-decreased" groups, respectively.Results:Median body weight change 1 week after tolvaptan treatment was -1.95 kg, with the 50% of patients experiencing a 2 kg/week reduction. Spot urinary sodium was found to be a better predictor of tolvaptan response than liver function and liver fibrosis markers. Median survival was significantly longer (not reached versus 116 days, p = 0.005) and serum creatinine concentrations 12 weeks after tolvaptan administration significantly lower (0.99 vs. 1.55 mg/dL, p Conclusions:The maintenance of renal function is essential in enhancing survival of patients with cirrhosis. Doses of diuretics should be adjusted appropriately during tolvaptan treatment.
