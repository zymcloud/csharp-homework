Aim:In Japan, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) refractoriness for hepatocellular carcinoma has been defined as an insufficient therapeutic effect after â‰¥2 procedures. Insufficient TACE for intrahepatic lesions is defined as the presence of > 50% viable lesions (ineffective) or an increase in their number (progressive). This study aimed to examine the possibility of earlier evaluation of TACE refractoriness.Methods:Patients who underwent TACE for hepatocellular carcinomas > 3 cm in size or with > 3 nodules at our hospital between 2010 and 2014 were analyzed. The cases assessed as TACE insufficient for the first time were divided into 2 groups: the "either" group, evaluated as either "ineffective" or "progressive," and the "both" group, that is, both "ineffective" and "progressive."Results:The study participants included 40 of 212 consecutive patients who underwent TACE, divided into the either (n = 23) and both (n = 17) groups. Seventeen of 23 (73.9%) patients in the either group and all 17 (100%) in the both group had TACE refractoriness (p = 0.0295).Conclusions:Patients with both "ineffective" and "progressive" lesions are extremely likely to be TACE -refractory at a significantly higher frequency than are those with either condition. Thus, when both of these factors are observed, switching to other therapies should be considered.
