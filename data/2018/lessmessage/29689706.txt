Background:People with biomarkers above cut-off values normally have higher risk to develop pre-malignancies and malignancies.Objective:Here we investigate if serological TK1 protein (STK1p), AFP, CEA and PSA below cut-off values predict development of pre-cancer.Methods:The mean values and the concentration distribution of STK1p, AFP, CEA and PSA were determined in a cohort of 56,178 persons participating a health screening group, consist of people with non-tumor diseases, pre-malignancy and diseases associated with the risk process of malignancy. A health disease-free group (n= 428) was selected among the 56,178 participants and used as controls.Results:The STK1p below cut-off value (⩽ 2 pM) showed partly (51.6%) an almost normal concentration distribution and partly (43.9%) an extensive tail in the health screening group, which was not found in the disease-free group. Due to the extensive tail in the distribution, the mean value of STK1p increased significantly (p= 0.0001) from 0.38 ± 0.30 pM in the health disease-free group to 0.69 ± 0.55 pM in the group below the cut-off value. No significantly differences in the concentration distribution and the mean values among gender and ages were observed. On the other hand, there were no difference in the concentration distributions and the mean values of AFP, CEA and PSA between the health disease - free group and the group below cut-off values, as well as between gender and ages. Of interest, the elevated mean value of STK1p of the group below the cut-off value was correlated to pre-malignancy and diseases associated with the risk process of malignancy in liver and prostate. No such correlations were found with AFP, CEA and PSA.Conclusion:STK1p is a potential proliferating biomarker for early discover of persons in the risk to develop or already have pre-malignancies or diseases associated with the risk process of malignancy.
