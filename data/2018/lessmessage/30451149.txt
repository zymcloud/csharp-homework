HCV is a carcinogen that is well established as a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. Evidence that HCV plays a role in the development of extrahepatic malignancies is less robust; however, epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated an association between HCV infection and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The strongest evidence for a link between HCV and tumourigenesis is the clear association between viral eradication, as indicated by achievement of sustained virological response, and remission of B-cell NHL. All-oral direct-acting antiviral-based therapies are effective in patients with HCV-associated NHL and well tolerated. For this reason, it is important that clinicians assess HCV-infected patients for HCV-associated extrahepatic malignancies so patients can receive timely diagnosis and treatment.
