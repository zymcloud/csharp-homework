We aimed to investigate whether coffee, green tea, and caffeine intake are associated with liver cancer risk, using data of a prospective cohort study. This study included 30,824 participants (14,240 men and 16,584 women) aged 35 years or older in the Takayama study, which was launched on September 1, 1992. The consumption frequencies of coffee and green tea were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire. Caffeine intake was estimated from the consumption frequencies of caffeine-containing beverages and foods and their caffeine content per serving. The incidence of liver cancer was confirmed using regional population-based cancer registries. During the follow-up period of 16 years, a total of 172 participants developed liver cancer. The adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in relation to coffee consumption were 0.65 (95% CI: 0.46-0.93) for less than once per day, 0.63 (95% CI: 0.39-1.02) for once per day, and 0.40 (95% CI: 0.20-0.79) for twice per day or more, compared with nondrinkers. No associations with green tea, black tea and caffeine intake were observed. The present study confirmed that coffee consumption significantly reduces liver cancer risk and raises the possibility that caffeine intake might not account for the association.
