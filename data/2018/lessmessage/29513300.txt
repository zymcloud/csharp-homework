Chronic hepatitis C is often asymptomatic and may progress over the years to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although the prevalence and incident cases are decreasing, the peak mortality of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related complications is ahead of us in most countries. The economic impact of this burden is enormous. Scaling up the identification of new opportunities to facilitate the road toward HCV elimination includes increasing screening, awareness, and the number of prescribing physicians. Screening should occur within the context of linkage-to-care and patient retention across the care continuum. Awareness and access to treatment in different countries are not systematic as countries have diverse healthcare organizations so that treatment eligibility and availability criteria vary significantly. The simplicity of oral regimens with direct-acting antiviral drugs that are effective across HCV genotypes expands the number of physicians who can prescribe them with accessible treatment models. The ultimate aim is the elimination of HCV by 2030.
