Purpose:To investigate the feasibility of three-dimensional contrast-enhanced ultrasound (3DCEUS) fusion in evaluating ablative margin (AM) after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and compare with those of computed tomography (CT) fusion.Patients and methods:In total, 55 patients (47 men, 8 women; mean age, 56.0 Â± 10.6 years) with 55 HCCs were included. Pre- and post-RFA 3DCEUS images were fused to assess AM immediately after RFA. The AM measured on fusion imaging was categorized into two groups: (A) AM Results:For 3DCEUS fusion, registration success rate was 96.4% (53/55). AM evaluation resulted in 28 tumors in group A and 25 tumors in group B. For CT fusion, AM evaluation resulted in 31 tumors with AM Conclusions:3DCEUS fusion enables AM evaluation for HCC immediately after RFA with comparable accuracy to CT fusion. AM
