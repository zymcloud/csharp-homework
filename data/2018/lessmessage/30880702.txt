Background:Hepatitis C is an emerging infection in India, which is known to progresses to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The persistence of chronic HCV infection is due to the existence of various genotypes and its various subtypes. There are seven different genotypes of HCV. These genotypes vary in their severity to cause infections as well as their response to treatment.Aim:This study aims at identifying the predominant genotypes of HCV in a population of patients presenting in a tertiary care center in Central Kerala.Settings and design:This study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital and medical college, located in Central Kerala in the Department of Microbiology from January 2014 to June 2015.The sample size was 600 and a high risk group of patients attending the gastroenterology department, deaddiction centre and health care workers were screened.Materials and methods:Serum samples were subjected to EIA, either rapid card or ELISA. Serum samples that were positive for HCV antibodies were confirmed by PCR. Twenty seven samples were positive for HCV antibodies by ELISA/rapid card, out of which 16 were confirmed by PCR. These 16 samples were subjected to gene sequencing to identify the genotype.Results:The prevalent genotypes isolated in this study was genotype 1, 3 and 4. Genotype 1 and 3 was predominantly seen transmitted by blood transfusions and multiple hemodialysis. The variability in laboratory parameters like SGOT and SGPT and its ratio with each genotype was also evaluated.Conclusion:To conclude, the occurrence of genotype 4 at a similar level to genotype 1 shows diffusion of new genotype in Kerala.
