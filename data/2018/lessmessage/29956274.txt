The use of monoclonal antibody (mAb) has become a unique means of targeted therapy for human cancers. mAb-based therapies have shown survival benefits by applying alone or in combination with chemotherapeutics. Being a humanized biomolecule with exquisite target specificity, mAb demonstrated effects in a relatively lower dose range with limited off-target harm to the patients. Nowadays, novel targets involved in tumorigenic mechanisms and biomarkers expressed exclusively on cancer cell surface are being constantly discovered. The potential effects of their specific mAb could be investigated in the preclinical cancer model. In this chapter, we outlined our experimental procedures in determining the feasibility of novel mAb in the preclinical cancer model, with an example of progranulin (PGRN/GEP) mAb against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor in mouse model. This chapter included the establishment of subcutaneous and orthotopic HCC tumor in mouse model, the injection of the mouse monoclonal antibody in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, the assessment of tumor development, and the analyses of the molecular changes of the tumor cells.
