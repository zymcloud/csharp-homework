Purpose:The purpose of this study is to report CyberKnife experience in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver metastasis (LM).Materials and methods:Fifty liver lesions in 31 consecutive patients with liver lesion [mean age 54.5 years (range 32-81 years), 77% were male patient, GTV 90cc in 8 patients respectively. Eighty percentage (25/31) had prior treatment (chemotherapy 18 patient & TACE in 7 patients). Dosage schedule was 21-45Gy/3# (mean PTV dose 33Gy, Prescription isodose 84%, target coverage 94%). Mean CI, nCI & HI were 1.19, 1.31 & 1.18 respectively. Mean liver dose was 5.4 Gy, 800 cc liver dose 11.1 Gy.Results:At mean follow-up of 12.5 months (range 1.9-44.6 months), 19 patients were expired and 12 were alive (nine patient with stable disease, two local progression, and one with metastasis). Median overall survival (OS) of all patients are 9 months (1.9-44.6 months), in HCC patients 10.5 months (2.1-44.6 months) and MT 6.5 months (1.9-24.6 months) respectively. Gr-I-II GI toxicities were in 11/50 (22%) patients. OS was influenced by PS (Karnofsky Performance Status 70-80 vs. 90-100: 9.9 vs. 16.4; P = 0.024), Child-Pugh (CP A/B vs. C: 23.6 vs. 6.5; P = 0.069), cirrhosis (only fatty liver vs. diffuse cirrhosis: 17.8 vs. 10.6; P = 0.003), prior treatment (no Rx vs. prior Rx: 30.1 vs. 8.2; P = 0.08), number of lesions (single vs. multiple: 16.4 vs. 6.9; P = 0.001), and target volume (<10 cc vs. >90 cc: 24.6 vs. 11.2; P = 0.03).Conclusion:Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a safe and effective treatment. Patient related factors such as performance status, Child-Pugh classification, cirrhosis status, prior treatment, number of liver lesion & target volume (GTV) influence the survival functions.
