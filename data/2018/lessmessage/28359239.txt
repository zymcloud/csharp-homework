Advanced liver cancers and biliary cancers represent diseases with dismal prognosis because of frequent local invasion and metastasis. Effective therapeutic agents for these cancers have not been established. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) constitute a novel class of promising, selective anticancer agents and recent studies have elucidated their unique features. Moreover, clinical trials are demonstrating promising results. Numerous OVs are being tested in preclinical models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The lead agent Pexa-Vec (pexastimogene devacirepvec, JX-594), a recombinant Wyeth strain vaccinia virus, has demonstrated preliminary evidence of safety and efficacy for HCC in clinical trials. Few other OVs have entered clinical testing. Relatively few preclinical studies and clinical trials exist for biliary cancers. In this review, we introduce various approaches using OVs to treat the intractable hepatobiliary cancers.
