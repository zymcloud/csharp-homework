Aim:This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of surgical treatment for metastases accompanied by modern targeted therapies and to evaluate the performance of the Leuven-Udine (L.U.) prognostic groups model.Methods:This retrospective analysis included 97 consecutive patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mR.C.C.) who underwent surgery for metastases at Helsinki University Hospital between 2006 and 2017. The endpoints were overall survival (O.S.), cancer-specific survival (C.S.S.), recurrence-free survival (R.F.S.) and interval from diagnosis to oncological treatment.Results:The median follow-up time was 46 months (interquartile range, I.Q.R. = 24-74). The estimated median O.S. was 67 months (I.Q.R. = 30-130). A radical surgical result at metastasectomy was achieved in 46 of 97 patients (47%). Of those 46 patients, 28 (61%) experienced recurrence after complete metastasectomy. Median R.F.S. after complete metastasectomy was 10 months (I.Q.R. = 3-37). Five-year O.S. was 59% for patients with complete metastasectomy and 44% for patients with non-complete metastasectomy (p = .035). The median interval from diagnosis to the initiation of targeted oncological treatment was 19 months for patients with non-complete metastasectomy and has hitherto not been reached for patients with complete metastasectomy (p = .006). A statistically significant validation of the prognostic value of the L.U. prognostic groups for predicting C.S.S. was not obtained (p = .420).Conclusions:Metastasectomy is an option for selected patients with mR.C.C. Complete resection should be attempted when feasible. The data failed to support the prognostic significance of the L.U. model in patients with mR.C.C.
