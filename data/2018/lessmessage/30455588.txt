Aim of the study:To evaluate the efficacy of sequential combination therapy using sorafenib and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) in patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B/C hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Material and methods:We recruited 98 BCLC stage B/C HCC patients at our institute, who received either sorafenib monotherapy or planned sequential sorafenib-HAIC combination therapy. A total of 26 patients (combination group) received sorafenib for one or two months, followed by HAIC with a single dose of cisplatin-lipiodol suspension and a continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil. Sorafenib-HAIC cycles were repeated every 2-3 months. The remaining 72 patients (control group) were treated with sorafenib alone. Clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes were compared between the groups. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) using propensity scores was applied to adjust for the between-group differences in baseline characteristics.Results:The combination group had a significantly lower frequency of extrahepatic metastasis and BCLC stage C disease compared with the control group but had more intrahepatic lesions. The crude median overall survival (OS) was 17.1 months in the combination group compared with 9.7 months in the control group (p = 0.01). The objective response rate was 23.1% in the combination group vs. 6.9% in the control group (p = 0.06). Multivariate analysis identified receipt of sorafenib-HAIC combination (HR: 0.521, 95% CI: 0.297-0.915, p = 0.02) and α-fetoprotein (≥ 400 ng/ml) at baseline as independent factors associated with OS. After adjustment with IPW the combination group still had significantly better OS than the control group (p = 0.04).Conclusions:The sequential sorafenib-HAIC combination can be an effective and promising treatment option for selected patients with BCLC stage B/C HCC.
