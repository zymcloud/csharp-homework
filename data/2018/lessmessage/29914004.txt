Background:Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play an important role in pathogenesis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, circRNA expression profiles in hepatitis B Virus (HBV)-related HCC remain to be studied.Methods:Total 13 HBV-related HCC patients were enrolled for study. Three HCC and 3 paired adjacent non-tumorous (NT) tissues from 3 patients were performed for microarray. Ten pairs of HCC tissues were used to verify the identified up-regulated and down-regulated circRNAs obtained from the microarray data by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Total RNA was isolated and treated with Rnase R to remove linear RNA, then hybridized to the array to screen for circRNAs. Bioinformatics analyses including clustering, differential expression, annotation of circRNA/microRNA (miRNA) interactions, Go analysis and KEGG pathway analysis, were performed.Results:Based on the microarray data, we found significantly up-regulation of 24 circRNAs and down-regulation of 23 circRNAs in the HCC samples compared to NT samples (fold change â©¾ 2.0 and PConclusion:In this study, we comprehensively explored the expression of differentially expressed circRNAs in HBV-related HCC, and our results indicate that circRNA_101764 may play an important role in the development of HCC.
