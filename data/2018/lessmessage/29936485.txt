Background/aim:Our previous cDNA microarray study revealed increased cellular mRNA levels of a panel of genes, including kallikrein-8 (KLK8), after long-term telbivudine treatment in chronic hepatitis B patients. The aim of this study was to verify whether serum protein levels of KLK8, a cancer-related enzyme, are indeed increased after telbivudine treatment.Patients and methods:A total of 83 chronic hepatitis B patients receiving telbivudine for >2 years were retrospectively analyzed. Serum KLK8 protein and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) changes were compared before and after treatment.Results:Both serum KLK8 protein and eGFR increased significantly after long-term telbivudine treatment (paired t-test: KLK8, p<0.001; eGFR, p=0.001). No direct correlation was found between KLK8 increase and eGFR change. However, eGFR change was positively associated with post-treatment KLK8 levels following adjustment for body height (p<0.001).Conclusion:Telbivudine treatment resulted in increased levels of serum KLK8 protein. Furthermore, eGFR increase was associated with body height-adjusted, post-treatment KLK8 levels.
