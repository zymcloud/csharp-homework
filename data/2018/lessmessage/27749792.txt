Purpose:To report a case of unilateral multifocal melanoma in a patient with germ line BRCA-associated protein 1 mutation.Methods:Case report.Results:A 67-year-old white woman with a family history of lung and liver cancers developed blurred visual acuity of 20/30 in the left eye. She was discovered to have two independent pigmented choroidal melanomas in the macula and superotemporally, both demonstrating overlying subretinal fluid and orange pigment. Both melanomas were treated with a single custom-designed Iodine 125 brachytherapy device. Upon systemic evaluation, asymptomatic renal cell carcinoma was found, and blood lymphocyte testing for germ line BRCA-associated protein 1 mutation was positive.Conclusion:Multifocal choroidal melanoma is exceedingly rare. Patients with uveal melanoma, especially if multifocal, and those with other systemic malignancy or family history of cancers should be tested for germ line BRCA-associated protein 1 mutation. Lifelong monitoring for other systemic malignancies is advised.
