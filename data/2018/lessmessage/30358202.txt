Purpose:Efficient and adequate evaluation of therapeutic response in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an evolving field. We aimed to evaluate apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in the prediction of response to sorafenib and prognosis in patients with advanced HCC.Methods:Baseline magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed before treatment. After sorafenib started, clinical and radiological response were evaluated at approximately 3 months later. ADC measurements were performed by a 12- year experienced radiologist who evaluated MR before and after sorafenib therapy.Results:A total of 17 patients (median age 60 years, range 51-66 and M/F ratio=3.25/1) were analyzed. A significant increase in ADC levels in responders was observed 3 months after sorafenib therapy. Baseline and post-sorafenib ADC values were not significantly associated with mortality (hazard ratio/HR baseline ADC=1.003, p=0.98) and after sorafenib (HR 0.480, p=0.48, respectively).Conclusion:Advanced HCC patients with a favorable response to sorafenib had a significant increase in ADC value at the first radiological evaluation. The predictive and prognostic role of ADC for overall survival is still unknown and further research is needed to investigate any possible association.
