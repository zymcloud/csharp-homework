Background:The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade is a newly proposed model for assessing the hepatic function. This study aimed to compare the value of the ALBI score with Child-Pugh score, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and indocyanine green (ICG) R15 in predicting posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF).Methods:Patients undergoing curative resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between January 2014 and June 2017 were enrolled. The values of the Child-Pugh score, MELD score, ICG R15 and ALBI score in predicting PHLF were evaluated.Results:A total of 473 HCC patients were enrolled. The ALBI score was identified as an independent predictor of PHLF. The AUCs for the Child-Pugh score, MELD score, ICG R15 and ALBI score in predicting PHLF were 0.665, 0.649, 0.668, and 0.745 respectively. Multivariable analyses revealed that the ALBI score was an independent predictor of PHLF regardless of the hepatectomy subgroups, but the Child-Pugh score and MELD score were not significant predictors of PHLF both in major and minor hepatectomy subgroups, and ICG R15 was only a significant predictor of PHLF in minor hepatectomy subgroup.Conclusion:The ALBI score showed superior predictive value of PHLF over Child-Pugh score, MELD score and ICG R15. We propose to use the ALBI score to evaluate surgical risk for HCC patients undergoing hepatic resection.
