Obesity increases death rates of all cancers including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (NAFLD-HCC). NAFLD is considered as hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and is a multi-system disease. Recent prevalence studies have intensively reported the association of obesity, metabolic risk factors and HCC incidence and mortality. Mechanistic studies suggested that immune response, PI3K/AKT/mTOR/PTEN pathway, mitochondrial dysfunction and genetic alterations are important mediators in the progression of NAFLD-HCC from metabolic disorder. In this book chapter, we attempt to collate current research on NAFLD-HCC that lead to our understandings on how metabolic disorders may intersect with cancer development. We also discussed the prevention options of NAFLD-HCC in view of obesity and metabolic disorder. These studies have extended our knowledge on the complicated mechanism of NAFLD and HCC, and provided the prevention options of NAFLD-HCC in patients with obesity and metabolic diseases.
