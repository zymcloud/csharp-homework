Objective:This study aims to explore the rule of changes in serum GGT activity, as well as GGT/ALT and AST/ALT ratios, in primary hepatic carcinoma (PHC) patients with different alpha-fetal protein (AFP) levels.Methods:GGT, AST and ALT were detected in 370 PHC patients with positive HBs-Ag using a automatic biochemical analyzer, and AFP was detected using a Roche E170 modular analytics immunoassay analyzer. GGT level, as well as AST/ALT and GGT/ALT, ratios were compared among PHC patients with different AFP levels.Results:As shown in Table 1, GGT levels were 109.59 ± 111.06, 151.13 ± 190.43, 135.86 ± 107.62, 151.36 ± 176.59 and 172.58 ± 188.84, respectively, in the groups of primary PHC patients with AFP levels of ⩽ 10, 10-100, 100-200, 200-400 and ⩾ 400 ng/ml; and the differences among these groups were not statistically significant (P> 0.05). AST/ALT ratios were 1.55 ± 1.02, 1.30 ± 0.81, 2.02 ± 1.89, 2.12 ± 1.11 and 1.73 ± 1.25, respectively; and the differences among these groups were not statistically significant (P> 0.05). GGT/ALT ratios were 3.43 ± 3.12, 3.57 ± 5.70, 3.57 ± 2.94, 3.89 ± 4.58 and 3.43 ± 3.61, respectively; and the differences among these groups were not statistically significant (P> 0.05).Conclusion:For patients with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis after hepatitis B, no matter how AFP level is, when liver function report reveals increased GGT, AST/ALT > 1 and GGT/ALT > 1 (that is, AST > ALT and GGT > ALT), even if AFP is negative, we should also be alert to the existence of PHC.
