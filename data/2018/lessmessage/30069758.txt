Regorafenib (BAY 73-4506, Stivarga®) is an oral diphenylurea multi-kinase inhibitor that targets angiogenic (VEGFR1-3, TIE2), stromal (PDGFR-β, FGFR), and oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (KIT, RET, and RAF). Regorafenib is the first small-molecule multi-kinase inhibitor to achieve survival benefits in metastatic colorectal cancer that has progressed after all standard therapies. Consequently, Regorafenib was FDA approved for this indication in 2012. In addition, Regorafenib treatment resulted in a significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) after progression on standard treatments and is also FDA-approved in this indication since 2013. In 2017, Regorafenib has been FDA approved for the treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) previously treated with Sorafenib. In this situation, Regorafenib significantly improved PFS and overall survival (OS) compared to placebo. Regorafenib has also been examined in several clinical trials (mostly phase II) in different tumor entities, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), soft-tissue sarcoma (STS), and additional phase II trials ongoing (e.g., second- and third-line treatment for medullary thyroid cancer, NCT02657551).
