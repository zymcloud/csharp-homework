Since the introduction of direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-based combination therapies in September 2014 for patients with chronic hepatitis-C (CH-C), numerous patients have been diagnosed with hepatitis-C virus (HCV)-associated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) during the screening performed prior to DAA therapy. The present study was conducted on the antiviral therapy for CH-C in two phases:i) the interferon (IFN) phase between January 2011 and August 2014 and ii) the DAA phase between September 2014 and September 2016. During the DAA phase, HCCs were detected in eight patients who were referred to our hospital for anti-HCV therapy. In contrast, HCCs were detected in only two patients during the IFN phase. The number of patients with newly detected HCC in the DAA phase (20.5%) who were referred for the anti-HCV therapy was significantly higher than that in the IFN phase (1.7%). Owing to the high efficacy and safety of the DAA therapy, the number of patients referred to our hospital for anti-HCV therapy increased from 40.5 persons/year in the IFN phase to 80.3 persons/year in the DAA phase. The average ages of patients in the DAA and IFN phases were 68 and 61 years, respectively. The increase in the number of patients with newly detected HCC referred for the anti-HCV therapy in the DAA phase could be attributed to the increase in the number of referred patients for anti-HCV therapy and the aging of these patients in the DAA phase. All the eight patients with newly detected HCC who were referred for anti-HCV therapy in the DAA phase received curative treatments. The median age, rate of liver cirrhosis, and median tumor size of the patients were 69 years, 13%, and 16mm. Therefore, the findings of this study indicate that DAA therapies not only eradicate HCV infection but also contribute to the early diagnosis of HCC by encouraging the HCV-infected patients to visit hospitals and by promoting active network between hepatologists and family physicians.
