Background/aim:Individual components of the metabolic syndrome (MS) such as obesity or diabetes mellitus impair the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following curative treatment approaches or transarterial therapies. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the impact of these factors on the overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced HCC treated with sorafenib.Methods:Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the impact of individual components of the MS on the OS of 152 consecutive patients with advanced HCC treated with sorafenib.Results:The presence of overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and of the MS itself did not impair the median OS. Multivariate analysis showed that Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status â‰¥1 (hazards ratio [HR] 2.03), presence of macrovascular invasion (HR 1.71), Child-Pugh score B/C (HR 2.19), tumor grading G3 (HR 2.17), no prior HCC treatment (HR 2.34), and the presence of 2 or more out of 5 individual components of the MS (HR 0.65) were independent prognostic factors regarding the median OS.Conclusions:Our investigations do not confirm a negative prognostic role of individual components of the MS or the MS itself for patients with advanced HCC treated with sorafenib.
