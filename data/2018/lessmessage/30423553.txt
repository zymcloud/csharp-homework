Background/aims:The long-noncoding RNA colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (CRNDE) gene was first found to be activated in colorectal neoplasia. Now, it also has been found to be upregulated in many other solid tumors. Whether CRNDE affects tumorigenesis remains unknown.Methods:We conducted bioinformatics, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blot analysis, cell proliferation assay, colony formation assay, wound healing assay, cell migration and invasion assays, RNA immunoprecipitation, and reporter vector construction and luciferase assays.Results:CRNDE was upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The overexpression of CRNDE promoted HCC cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion in intro and in vivo, and acted as an oncogene in HCC progression. Furthermore, CRNDE impaired miR-136-5P expression in a RISC manner, and a reciprocal repression feedback loop was possible between CRNDE and miR-136-5P. We found that the neighboring mRNA of CRNDE was IRX5, and IRX5 increased the tumorigenicity of HCC cells. IRX5 was a potential downstream target gene of miR-136-5P. MiR-136 regulated IRX5 by interacting with its 3'UTR. In addition, miR-136-5P was involved in the CRNDE-regulated expression of IRX5.Conclusion:CRNDE acted as a tumor oncogene by exhibiting oncogenic properties of human HCC and revealed a novel CRNDE-miR-136-5P-IRX5 regulatory network in HCC. CRNDE may be considered to be a potential target for HCC therapies based on its ability to upregulate IRX5, and it deserves further investigation.
