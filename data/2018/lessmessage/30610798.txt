Purpose:Serum predictors for early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been investigated. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) has been widely reported to promote the survival of many types of cancer cells. However, the potential of serum S1P as a diagnostic marker in HCC has not been well characterized. The aim of this study was to identify the relationship between serum S1P and the risk of HCC.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed serum S1P in 63 HCC patients and 39 normal people. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to define the cut-off value of S1P in the serum. Chi-square test, t-test and multivariate regression analysis were used to investigate the association between serum S1P and individual clinicopathologic parameters.Results:S1P showed significantly higher level in healthy subjects (1.372±0.116 μM) than that in patients (1.372±0.116 μM). Serum S1P in HCC patients was positively correlated to globulin (t = -3.122, p=0.003), hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA copies (x2=4.386, p=0.036) and negatively related to AST (x2=2.870, p=0.09). Besides, part of the amount of serum S1P was negatively correlated to albumin (correlation coefficient (β) = -0.056) and positively correlated to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (β=0.016) according to the regression analysis.Conclusions:These results suggested that serum S1P could be used as an auxiliary marker for HCC diagnosis, and used to monitor HBV infection in patients with HCC.
