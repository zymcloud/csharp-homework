A 2015 CADTH Rapid Response report identified systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and economic evaluations on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of yttrium-90 microsphere radioembolization for the treatment of primary or secondary liver cancer, but no evidence on uveal melanoma liver metastasis was found. With increasing interest in comparing the impact of selective internal radiotherapy with radioisotopes (SIRT) to other treatment therapies such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), this Rapid Response report aims to review the comparative clinical and cost-effectiveness of radioembolization with yttrium-90 microspheres versus other options for the treatment of adult patients with uveal melanoma liver metastasis.
