Introduction:The rising proportion of elderly patients (aged 80 yearsor above) in our population means that more elderly patients are undergoing hepatectomy.Methods:Five-hundred and thirty patients who underwent hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were retrospectively analyzed with respect to their preoperative status and perioperative results, including remnant liver regeneration. The remnant liver volume was postoperatively measured with multidetector CT on postoperative day 7 and 1, 2, 5, and 12 months after surgery. An elderly group (aged 80 or older) was compared with a non-elderly group (aged less than 80 years).Results:Underlying diseases of the cardiovascular system were significantly more common in the elderly group (57.8%, p = 0.0008). The postoperative incidence of Clavien-Dindo Grade IIIa or higher complications was 20.0% in the elderly group and 24.3% in the non-elderly group, and this difference was not significant. As for regeneration of the remnant liver after resection, this was not morphologically delayed compared to the non-elderly group.Conclusions:In this study, we have demonstrated that safe, radical hepatectomy, similar to procedures performed on non-elderly patients, can be performed on patients with HCC aged 80 and older with sufficient perioperative care.
