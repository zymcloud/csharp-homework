Background:In a developing country like India with intermediate level of prevalence of hepatitis B, most of the patients remain undiagnosed as they are asymptomatic. The purpose of the study was to diagnose asymptomatic HBsAg positive patients from the general population and evaluate further the potential clinical implications of IDAHS.Methods:Asymptomatic subjects with unknown HBV status were screened free of cost for hepatitis-B surface antigen. Those who tested positive for HBsAg were further tested to identify those who were potential candidates for anti-viral therapy. To explore the relevance of our screening we assessed potential implications of HBsAg detection.Results:A total of 30,836 patients were screened in medical camps over the period of 7 years. Out of these 704 (2.3%) subjects were found to be positive for HBsAg. Distress of being diagnosed with HBV was expressed by 649 (92%) of the positive subjects. High cost of further testing and antiviral therapy, leading to inability to pursue further management was elicited in 510 (72%) of the positive subjects. HBV DNA was detected in 349 (59%) out of 592 subjects, out of which 236 (67%) had high viral load.Conclusion:Incidental detection of asymptomatic HBsAg positive subjects was seen in 2.3% of subjects. One third of these patients had an actively replicating virus and required antiviral therapy. Financial support was required in 72% of the subjects for further HBV management. Detecting HBsAg in asymptomatic person in an endemic community has considerable health and psycho-economic impact on the individual.
