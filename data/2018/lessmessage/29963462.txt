Bangladesh is one of the countries facing huge burden of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatocellular carcinoma is the third commonest cancer in the country and it is just behind to cancer of the lung and cancer of the stomach. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is responsible for 66% of HCC in Bangladesh. Presumptive prevalence of HBV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) may be as high as 5.4 and 0.84%, respectively, in Bangladesh, and liver diseases occupied 8 to 12% of admission in medicine wards of Public Medical College. In this mini review, I would like to highlight the impact of HBV and HCV in the development of HCC and the management of HCC from a Bangladesh perspective. How to cite this article: Noor-E-Alam SM.
