Background:Adoptive immunotherapy (AIT) has been adopted as an adjuvant treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after curative therapy. However, the outcomes of AIT remain controversial.Purpose:The purpose of this study is to analyze the safety and efficacy of AIT with the recurrence rate and mortality.Materials and methods:We identified eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that adopted AIT to HCC after curative treatments. A meta-analysis was carried out to assess the recurrence rate and mortality.Results:Eight RCTs with 964 patients were included in the study. The overall analysis showed that AIT treatment can not only decrease the 1-year (risk ratio [RR] =0.59, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.48-0.72, P 0.05).Conclusions:This review provides available evidences that AIT, especially the treatment of LAK, can be used to decrease the early recurrence and mortality of postoperative HCC but may not the long term.
