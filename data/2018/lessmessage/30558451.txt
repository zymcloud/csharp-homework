Background:This study explored the potential of ablation therapy on membrane fluidity changes in diethylnitrosamine (DEN) induced hepatic cancer.Methods:Male Wistar rats were segregated into four groups viz., normal control, DEN treated, ablation therapy treated, and DEN ablation therapy treated. We assessed the viscosities as well as fluidity parameters in isolated brush border membranes using the membrane extrinsic fluorophore pyrene.Results:DEN treatment successfully induced hepatic cancer in the livers of rats and ablation therapy worked well in terms of therapy. DEN treatment resulted in a significant rise in lipid peroxidation (LPO) and significant decrease in the, reduced glutathione levels (GSH). A significant decrease was also noticed in the activities of glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) following DEN treatment. On the other hand, ablation therapy treatment to DEN-treated rats resulted in a significant decrease in the LPO levels but caused a significant rise in the levels of GSH. Moreover, the activities of GR, GST, SOD, CAT, and GPx showed significant improvement after ablation therapy treatment. The results further demonstrated a marked decrease in membrane microviscosity following DEN treatment. On the other hand, a significant increase was noticed in both excimer/monomer ratio and fluidity parameter in DEN-treated rats. However, membrane microviscosity and the fluidity alterations were significantly restored back to near normal with ablation therapy treatment.Conclusions:The study, therefore, concluded that ablation therapy holds good therapeutic potential against DEN-induced hepatic cancer.
