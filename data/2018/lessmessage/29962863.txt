Objective:To preliminarily evaluate the diagnostic performance of an unenhanced MRI for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with a case-control study design.Materials and methods:The case group consisted of 175 patients with initially-diagnosed HCC, who underwent a 3T liver MRI. A total of 237 HCCs were identified. The number of HCCs that were smaller than 1 cm, 1 cm â‰¤ and Results:In the per-patient analyses, the sensitivity and specificity of reader 1 were 86.3% (151/175) and 87.5% (63/72), respectively; while those of reader 2 were 82.9% (145/175) and 76.4% (55/72), respectively. When excluding HCCs smaller than 1 cm, the sensitivity of reader 1 and 2 were 88.0% (147/167) and 86.2% (144/167), respectively. In the per-lesion analyses, the sensitivities of reader 1 and reader 2 were 75.9% (180/237) and 70.5% (167/237), respectively.Conclusion:The per-patient sensitivity and specificity of non-contrast MRIs were within a reasonable range for the initial diagnosis of HCC. Non-contrast MRIs may have a potential for surveillance of HCC. Further confirmatory diagnostic test accuracy studies are needed.
