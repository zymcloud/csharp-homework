Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death worldwide. In China, the situation is even worse as cancer incidence and mortality continue to increase rapidly. Although tremendous progress has been made toward HCC treatments, the benefits for liver cancer patients are still limited. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and develop novel therapeutic methods. Neuronally expressed developmentally downregulated 4 (NEDD4), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, plays a critical role in the development and progression of various types of human cancers. In our study, NEDD4 acts as an oncoprotein in both QGY7703 and SMMC7721 liver cancer cell lines. We found that depletion of NEDD4 by siRNA transfection led to inhibition of cell growth, invasion and migration, and promotion of apoptosis. In contrast, overexpression of NEDD4 via plasmid transfection resulted in facilitated cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and decreased apoptosis. Importantly, we observed that tumor suppressor LATS1, also a core component of Hippo pathway, was negatively regulated by NEDD4 in liver cancer cells. Our findings suggested that NEDD4 may be involved in the HCC progression via regulating LATS1 associated signaling pathway. Therefore, targeting NEDD4-LATS1 signaling could be a potential therapeutic option for HCC treatment.
