Extrahepatic spread of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is uncommon; and, pelvic metastasis, in particular, is extremely rare. A 71-year-old woman was admitted for evaluation of pelvic solitary solid mass. She had undergone a left lobectomy 28 years previously. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a heterogeneous mass in the right pelvic cavity, whereas no space-occupying lesions or ascites were detected in the liver. CA 125 levels were within normal limits; however, serum alpha-fetoprotein levels were markedly elevated. She underwent laparoscopic pelvic mass excision, total hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Histopathologic findings and immunochemical staining results indicated metastatic HCC. Herein, we report an unusual case of a patient with solitary recurrence in the pelvic cavity 28 years after initial diagnosis and treatment.
