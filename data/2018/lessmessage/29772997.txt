Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has emerged as a prominent cancer in both developing and developed countries. Due to the increasing burden of HCC patients, massive resources are expended in their management. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to identify new molecular players that could be targeted to halt cancer development in the early phases. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), which were previously thought to lack value, have the potential to play a pivotal role in the present era of personalized and translational research. Several recent studies have reported the involvement of ncRNAs in initiating, regulating, and nurturing HCC. This review provides insights regarding recently reports of noncoding RNAs and their diverse roles in initiation and development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
