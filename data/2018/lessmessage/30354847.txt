Objective: To assess the clinical efficiency and feasibility of ultrasound-guided percutaneous microwave ablation (US-PMWA) assisted by a three-dimensional (3D) visualization platform for treating a single large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (diameter â‰¥5 cm).Methods: We included 40 patients with a single large HCC from May 2015 to August 2017. Nineteen patients who underwent US-PMWA assisted by a 3D visualization platform formed the 3D group; 21 patients without 3D visualization assistance formed the control group. Preoperative planning and post-procedural evaluation were performed successfully with the 3D visualization treatment platform. Thermal ablative parameters, survival and recurrence were compared between groups.Results: The primary efficacy rate and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate in the 3D group were higher than those in the control group (p = .007 and p = .014, respectively). The number of inserted probes in the 3D group was higher than that in the control group (p = .016). The overall survival (OS) rate in the 3D group was comparable to that of controls (p = .745). Estimated 3-year OS and RFS rates were 38.5% and 64.6% in the 3D group and 34.4% and 18.8% in the control group, respectively. Treatment effects were evaluated using a tumor map and confirmed by traditional contrast-enhanced ultrasound in the 3D group. After the first treatment, nine patients (47.4%) achieved complete ablation with a 5-mm safety margin. No major complications related to ablation occurred.Conclusions: US-PMWA assisted by a 3D visualization treatment platform can improve treatment efficiency and appears to be a safe, effective and innovative technique to manage a single large HCC.
