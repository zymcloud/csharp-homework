Background/aims:MicroRNA-142-3p (miR-142-3p) is dysregulated in many malignancies and may function as a tumor suppressor or oncogene in tumorigenesis and tumor development. However, few studies have investigated the clinical significance and biological function of miR-142-3p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The expression levels of taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1), miR-142-3p, and zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) were evaluated in HCC tissues and cell lines by quantitative real-time PCR. MTT and colony formation assays were used to detect cell proliferation ability, transwell assays were used to assess cell migration and invasion, and luciferase reporter assays were used to examine the interaction between the long noncoding RNA TUG1 and miR-142-3p. Tumor formation was evaluated through in vivo experiments.Results:miR-142-3p was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues, but TUG1 was upregulated in HCC tissues. Knockdown of TUG1 and upregulation of miR-142-3p inhibited cell proliferation, cell migration, cell invasion, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). miR-142-3p was found to be a prognostic factor of HCC, and the mechanism by which TUG1 upregulated ZEB1 was via direct binding to miR-142-3p. In vivo assays showed that TUG1 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation and the EMT in nude mice.Conclusion:The results of this study suggest that the TUG1/miR-142-3p/ ZEB1 axis contributes to the formation of malignant behaviors in HCC.
