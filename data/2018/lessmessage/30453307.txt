Background/aims:An increasing number of studies have suggested that circular RNAs (circRNAs) have vital roles in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. However, the function of circRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poorly characterized.Methods:We investigated the levels of circRNAs in patients with HCC to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers. We examined circRNA expression profiles in liver tumors and paired non-cancerous liver tissues from three HCC patients with cancer thrombus using a circRNA microarray. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to find circRNAs with significantly altered expression levels between tumors and their paired non-tumor tissues. We confirmed our initial findings by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were also applied to identify a candidate circRNA with the optimal specificity and sensitivity. Finally, X-tile software was adopted to calculate the most efficient cut-off value for hsa_circ_0091579 expression.Results:Microarray analysis identified 20 unique circRNAs that were differentially expressed between tumor and non-tumor tissues (P Conclusion:Hsa_circ_0091579 may play a critical role in HCC progression and serve as a potential biomarker for the prognosis of patients with HCC.
