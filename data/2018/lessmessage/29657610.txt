Introduction:Diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is considerably delayed, being frequently done in the non-curative stage of disease. The reason for delayed diagnosis is indolent course in early stages and/or unspecific symptoms indistinguishable from underlying cirrhosis. Hitherto methods used for screening of HCC have important limitations. TRIMprob is a non-invasive method, which showed utility in detection of cancers located in prostate, breast, or urinary bladder.Aim:To determine the diagnostic accuracy of TRIMprob in detecting HCC in cirrhotic liver.Material and methods:Forty-five patients were prospectively enrolled according to final clinical diagnosis into a group of cirrhosis and HCC or a group of cirrhosis without HCC. A control group consisted of 33 healthy subjects. Hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) and guided biopsy. The TRIMprob examination was performed in each patient. Three wave frequencies were used: 465, 930, and 1395 MHz.Results:In patients with HCC the intensity of return signal using wave a frequency of 465 MHz was significantly reduced in patients with HCC in comparison to healthy subjects (p < 0.0005), but not to cirrhotic patients without HCC. Moreover, cirrhosis was associated with significantly decreased TRIMprob signal in comparison to healthy liver (p < 0.002). In ROC analysis an optimal cut-off value for detection of HCC was 106 units, which yielded 80% sensitivity.Conclusions:TRIMprob identifies HCC with good sensitivity; however, the accuracy of this method to identify HCC in screening circumstances may be hindered by attenuation of the resonance interaction signal by cirrhosis itself.
