Goals:To evaluate the predictive value of hypoalbuminemia on liver transplant (LT) waitlist survival and probability of receiving LT among adults with end-stage liver disease (ESLD).Background:Growing evidence reports on the negative prognostic value of hypoalbuminemia among ESLD patients awaiting LT.Methods:Using 2003 to 2015 United Network for Organ Sharing data, we retrospectively evaluated the impact of mild-moderate (2.5 to 3.4 g/dL) and severe hypoalbuminemia (Results:Among 128,450 adults listed for LT, 27.1% had normal albumin (â‰¥3.5 g/dL), 53.7% mild-moderate hypoalbuminemia (2.5 to 3.4 g/dL), and 19.2% severe hypoalbuminemia (Conclusions:ESLD patients with hypoalbuminemia have lower probability of LT despite significantly higher waitlist mortality compared with patients with normal albumin. If validated by further studies, incorporation of albumin into prognostication systems may improve the performance of US donor organ allocation systems.
