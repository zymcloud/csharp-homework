Mongolia is located between Russia and China. The total population of Mongolia as of December 2017 is estimated to be 3.2 million people. According to our previous study results, the prevalence of HBV was 11.8%, and anti-HDV was detected in 4.8% among the HBsAg-positive subjects. Interestingly, most HCV infection is caused by genotype 1b. Among all HBV DNA-positive samples, 98.5% were classified into genotype D, and regarding HDV genotypes, all HDV RNA-positive samples, 100%, were classified into genotype I. The second study is the baseline survey of a Nationwide Cancer Cohort Study. Prevalence of HBsAg was 10.6%. Additionally, HCV infection was observed in 9.9%, and 0.8% were coinfected with HBV and HCV among the general population aged from 10 to 64 years. The third study investigated the population-based prevalence of hepatitis B and C virus in apparently healthy population of Ulaanbaatar city, Mongolia. The anti-HCV prevalence was 9.0%. In addition, the prevalence of HBV was 8.0%. The fourth study is on the prevalence of HCV and coinfections among nurses in a tertiary hospital in Mongolia. The prevalence of HCV was 18.9%. Additionally, HBV infection was observed in 23.1%, and 1.2% were coinfected with HCV and HBV. Mongolia has the highest HCC incidence in the world (78.1/100,000, 3.5* higher than China). As a result, the Mongolia government has launched The National Viral Hepatitis Program, which is a comprehensive program that involves all aspects from prevention to care and disease control to meet a reduction goal for morbidity and mortality due to HBV, HCV, and HDV. Consequently, access to antiviral therapies is now improving in Mongolia. How to cite this article: Baatarkhuu O, Gerelchimeg T, Munkh-Orshikh D, Batsukh B, Sarangua G, Amarsanaa J.
