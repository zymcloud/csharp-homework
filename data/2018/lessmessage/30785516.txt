Background:The infection for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality through its evolution to liver cirrhosis, end-stage liver complications and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, the new drugs for the HCV infection, based on direct antiviral agents, have changed the outcomes in this setting.Objective:To assess death incidence, during the wait for the treatment with the new drugs, and to analyze which independent variable (age, sex, ascite, HDA, albumin, α-fetoprotein, platelets and Meld score) had relation with death.Methods:Prospective study with cirrhotic patients by HCV. Inclusion: cirrhotic patients by hepatic biopsy (METAVIR), clinic or image, detectable RNA (HCV). Exclusion: Other stages of hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Descriptive statistic in continue variables. Fisher Exact and Kaplan Meier and Cox Regression Analysis to assess the association of variables studied with death. PResults:A total of 129 patients were included. Of this, 73% were men. Mean age was 57.8±12.1, albumin of 3.5±0.6 mg/dL, platelets of 123.4±59.6 and Meld score of 10.59±3.56. The time of observation was 11.2±3.26 months, and the number of death 9/129 (6,9%). The Kaplan-Meier showed association between death with albumin lower than 2.9 (0.0006), MELD score higher than 15 (0.007) and α-fetoprotein higher than 40 ng/mL (Conclusion:We conclude that, patients with advanced cirrhosis should be prioritized for treatment with direct antiviral agents.
