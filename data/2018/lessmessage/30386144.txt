Objective:To compare the therapeutic efficacy between conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) and combined therapy using cTACE and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in ultrasound (US)-invisible early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:From January 2008 to June 2016, 167 patients with US-invisible early stage HCCs were treated with cTACE alone (cTACE group; n = 85) or cTACE followed by immediate fluoroscopy-guided RFA targeting intratumoral iodized oil retention (combined group; n = 82). Procedure-related complications, local tumor progression (LTP), time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS) were compared between the two groups. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors.Results:There was no major complication in either group. The cTACE group showed higher 1-, 3-, and 5-year LTP rates than the combined group; i.e., 12.5%, 31.7%, and 37.0%, respectively, in the cTACE group; compared to 7.3%, 16.5%, and 16.5%, respectively, in the combined group; p = 0.013. The median TTP was 18 months in the cTACE group and 24 months in the combined group (p = 0.037). Cumulative 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 100%, 93.2%, and 87.7%, respectively, in the cTACE group and 100%, 96.6%, and 87.4%, respectively, in the combined group (p = 0.686). Tumor diameter > 20 mm and cTACE monotherapy were independent risk factors for LTP and TTP.Conclusion:Combined therapy using cTACE followed by fluoroscopy-guided RFA is a safe and effective treatment in US-invisible early stage HCCs. It provides less LTP and longer TTP than cTACE alone.
