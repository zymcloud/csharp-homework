Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the primary malignant tumor of the liver that is directly derived from parenchymal cells. It is usually encountered in patients already suffering from a long-established liver disease that has evolved past the stage of liver cirrhosis. It is usually associated with viral liver infections, alcohol consumption or other dietary habits that lead to liver damage. Metastases are not rare and are usually found incidentally after a period of monitoring the main liver disease. We present here a rare case of HCC metastasis found in the right gluteal region, in a hepatitis C virus-infected patient also displaying lung tumor lesions. Diagnosis of both the metastasis and of the primary tumor were found during the same hospital visit, employing contrast-enhanced computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound (US), with positive biopsy of the metastatic lesion, performed under US guidance. The patient received oncological treatment, with good prognosis and stable evolution during the next eight months since diagnosis.
