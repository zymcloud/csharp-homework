Objective:To meta-analytically compare combined transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and surgical resection (SR) for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within the Milan criteria.Materials and methods:PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched for studies comparing these two therapies that were published between January 2006 and August 2017. Overall survival rate (OS), recurrence-free survival rate (RFS), major complications and the average length of hospital stay were compared between these two therapies. Meta-analytic pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated using TACE plus RFA as the base category.Results:Seven case-control studies and one randomized trial were identified. Meta-analytic results revealed that, compared with SR, TACE plus RFA had significantly higher 1-year OS (OR for survival = 0.50, p = 0.009) and lower major complications (OR = 1.88, p = 0.02) after therapy. Three studies reported on the length of hospital stay. The average length ± standard deviation reported in individual studies for SR and TACE plus RFA groups was 19.8 ± 8.4 days and 7.4 ± 2.2 days, respectively; 18.7 ± 4.9 days and 11.5 ± 6.9 days, respectively; and 16.6 ± 6.7 days and 8.5 ± 4.1 days, respectively (p < 0.0001 for all studies). Three or 5-year OS and 1-, 3-, or 5-year RFS did not significantly differ between the two therapies.Conclusion:Combined TACE plus RFA may be an alternative to SR for the treatment of patients with HCC within Milan the criteria. Non-randomized design in most of the original studies was a limitation.
