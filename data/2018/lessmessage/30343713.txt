Clinical outcome for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is dictated by development of cirrhosis, portal hypertension and its associated complications; including for some, a predisposition toward hepatocellular carcinoma. However rates of clinical progression vary, and accurately identifying disease course is of critical importance to patients, clinicians, as well as industry, who are committed to developing new effective and life-prolonging therapy as well as treating symptoms that appear disproportionate to underlying disease severity. Patients seek reassurance and guidance as to their own prognosis, and clinicians wish to confidently recognise those at highest risk of poor outcomes as equally as they strive to reassure individuals with a more favourable disease trajectory. International registries have facilitated a much greater knowledge of disease incidence and heterogeneity of presenting phenotypes. In so doing they highlight the opportunity to provide a more individualized estimate of the clinical course that patients experience, and have led to a renewed approach to risk stratification; both in terms of 'hard outcomes' and also disease-associated complications in PBC specifically.
