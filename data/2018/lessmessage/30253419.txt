Background:This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and safety of resection of sarcoma liver metastases, and to identify possible prognostic factors for long-term survival.Methods:All patients who underwent resection of liver metastases of sarcoma in the Netherlands from 1998 to 2014 were included. Study data was retrospectively collected from patient files. Survival rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.Results:Some 38 patients treated in 16 hospitals were included (15 male, 23 female). The median age was 57 years (37-80 years). The most common histological subtype was leiomyosarcoma (63%). The predominant site of primary tumour was the abdomen (59%). R0 resection was achieved in 16 patients. Mortality was 3 and 16% of included patients had 1 or more complications. The median follow-up period was 18 months (range 1-161). After liver resection, 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival were 88, 54, and 42% respectively. Median overall survival was 46 months (1-161 months). One- and three-year progression-free survival (PFS) after liver resection were 54 and 19% respectively. Median PFS was 16 months (1-61 months).Conclusions:Liver surgery for sarcoma metastases is safe and leads to a relatively good survival. The choice for surgical treatment should always be discussed in a multidisciplinary sarcoma and liver team.
