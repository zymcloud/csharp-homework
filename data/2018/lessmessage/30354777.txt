Purpose:It is unclear which kind of interventional therapies is the best when treating early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We conducted Bayesian network meta-analyses to compare local tumor progression (LTP), total tumor recurrence and survival rates and to rank the best intervention arm.Materials and methods:A literature search of Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane library and Clinicaltrials.gov was conducted and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the outcomes of interventional therapies on early-stage HCC were enrolled. The quality assessment was conducted using Cochrane Collaboration's tool, while the outcome synthesis of the network meta-analysis was conducted using R-3.3.4 software.Results:A total of 35 RCTs were enrolled for further analysis. Using network meta-analysis, it was demonstrated that radiofrequency ablation (RFA) plus adjuvant therapies achieved the best performance in decreasing the LTP rate in early-stage HCC, while hepatic resection ranked as the best arm among all the interventional techniques for LTP at 3 years. Meanwhile, hepatic resection and RFA plus adjuvant therapies were the top two best arms in decreasing total recurrence. Furthermore, RFA plus adjuvant therapeutics ranked the best in achieving overall survival outcome, followed by hepatic resection. For disease-free survival, hepatic resection was the best, while for LTP-free survival, the difference among the included treatments was not significant.Conclusions:Our network meta-analysis showed that RFA-based adjuvant therapies might be the most effective interventions in achieving the best outcomes, while hepatic resection exhibited the best performance in several situations in treating early-stage HCC. More RCTs are needed to draw more solid conclusions.
