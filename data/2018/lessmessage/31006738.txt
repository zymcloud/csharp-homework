A 70-year-old man presented with right renal cell carcinoma with inferior vena caval tumor thrombus into the right atrium. CT Scan presented local invasion and lymph node metastasis. We estimated inoperative case, so he was started sunitinib. After 5 month he had general fatigue and admitted to our hospital. He diagnosed serious adverse events of fulminant hepatitis and left ventricular systolic dysfunction and discontinued sunitnib. After drug discontinuance reduction of tumor and tumor thrombus were detected. 7-months later, we showed the increase of tumor and the improvement of the left ventricular systolic dysfunction. We performed right renal nephrectomy and it passes now in 14 months after surgery, but doses not show a recurrence, metastasis.
Sunitinib; fulminant hepatitis; inferior vena caval tumor thrombus.
