Background:Golgi protein 73 (GP73) is a potential serum marker for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the diagnostic value of GP73 for HCC remains controversy, and little is known about the relationship between serum GP73 concentration and clinical characteristics of HCC. This study was designed to analyze the clinical values of GP73 in diagnosing HCC and the relationship between GP73 level and clinical characteristics in HCC patients.Materials and methods:In this study, a total of 443 serum samples including 180 patients with HCC, 61 patients with liver cirrhosis (LC), 99 chronic hepatitis patients, and 103 healthy individuals were enrolled from November 2011 to April 2013. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and chemiluminescent immunoassay were used to detect the serum level of GP73 and other biomarkers.Results:GP73 level in HCC group was significantly higher than LC group, chronic hepatitis B group, and healthy control group. In HCC group, GP73 level significantly increased in patients with lymphatic metastasis; moreover, GP73 level in Child-Pugh Class B and C groups was statistically significantly higher than that in Child-Pugh Class A group (P Conclusion:GP73 was better than AFP for the diagnosis of HCC, and the expression of serum GP73 is related with the clinical characteristics of HCC patients.
