Aim:Micronesians are a rapidly growing population in Hawaii and the continental U.S. Hepatitis B is prevalent in Micronesia, but the consequences in those migrating to the U.S. are unclear. This study characterizes hepatocellular carcinoma in Micronesians with comparisons to other Pacific Islanders.Methods:A retrospective evaluation was undertaken of 40 Micronesian and 142 Non-Micronesian Pacific hepatocellular carcinoma patients diagnosed in a large clinical practice in Hawaii from 1993-2017.Results:All Micronesians were born outside of the U.S. Micronesians were younger at diagnosis (52.0 vs 60.2 years, had higher rates of hepatitis B (80% vs 31.2%), a family history of hepatocellular carcinoma (17.5% vs 4.4%) and more tumors Conclusion:Hepatocellular carcinoma in Micronesians is primarily Hepatitis B-related. Micronesians were equally likely to have hepatocellular carcinoma found with screening, undergo transplant and had better survival. Our study emphasizes the need for hepatitis B screening and hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance in Micronesians.
