Background:In resource-constrained areas, generic direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have considerably reduced the cost of hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy while there remain significant costs related to the baseline and follow-up virologic assays.Aim:The aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of HCV therapy in Myanmar with pan-genotypic generic DAA sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) and with and without the baseline genotype testing, while the duration of treatment and use of ribavirin (RBV) was dictated by cirrhosis and prior treatment failure.Methods:Between September 2016 and June 2017, data from the 359 participants who completed treatment with SOF/VEL (± RBV) for 12-24 weeks were analyzed. Two hundred one patients did not have the baseline HCV genotype tested.Results:Regimens included SOF/VEL for 12 weeks (n = 43), SOF/VEL/RBV for 12 weeks (n = 275), or SOF/VEL/RBV for 24 weeks (n = 41). The mean age was 52 years, 44% were men (n = 159), 41 (11.4%) had a history of previous DAA therapy, 7 (1.9%) had a history of hepatocellular carcinoma, and 55 (15.3%) had cirrhosis. Overall, the sustained viral response (SVR)12 rate was 98.6% (354/359) and with a good adverse event profile. SVR rates were similar to those with and without baseline genotype testing and also across all genotypes in those who had genotype tested.Conclusions:In Myanmar, generic and pan-genotypic SOF/VEL ± RBV is a highly effective and safe treatment for HCV, regardless of the HCV genotype, and therefore, the requirement for the baseline genotype can be eliminated. Future strategies should include elimination of treatment and end of treatment HCV RNA testing to enhance treatment uptake and further reduce cost.
