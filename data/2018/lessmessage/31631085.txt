To investigate the efficacy and safety of first-line Pazopanib advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC): a single-institution study. (Patients and methods) We gathered 23 RCC patients treated between April 2014 and February 2018 in our institution and examined the treatments outcome and adverse events (AEs). (Results) Their risk criteria were categorized as follows: Favorable (n=2), Intermediate (n=12) and Poor (n=9) by International mRCC Database Consortion (IMDC). Median progression free survival (PFS) was 8.6 months and median overall survival (OS) was unreached. Best response (BR) of Pazopanib was partial response (PR): n=10, 50.0%, stable disease (SD): n=8, 40.0% and progression disease (PD): n=2, 10.0% (Three patients had no evaluable data,). AEs of Grade3 had liver dysfunction (n=3), thrombocytopenia (n=2), hand-foot syndrome (n=1), vomiting (n=1) and bowel bleeding (n=1). (Conclusion) The fist-line pazopanib demonstrated good clinical benefit with well-tolerance.
