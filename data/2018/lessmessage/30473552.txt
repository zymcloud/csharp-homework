This research aimed to investigate the differential expression of apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cells and the effects on proliferation and apoptosis of cancer cells. Immunohistochemical techniques were used to detect the expression of APE1 in 80 cases of HCC and the corresponding paracancerous tissue microarrays; meanwhile, Western blots were used to detect the expression of APE1 in both human HCC BEL-7402, BEL-7405, HCC-9204, Hep3B, HepG2, SMMC-7721 and Huh-7 cells, and normal hepatocyte L-02 cells. The relationship between APE1 expression and clinical pathological characteristics of HCC was statistically analyzed. APE1 shRNA vector was constructed in Hep 3B cells to establish a stably transfected cell line, using Western blots to determine the interference efficiency. Cell proliferation activity was detected with MTT assays, while apoptosis was detected with the Annexin V-FITC/PI double-labeling technique. The expression of APE1 in HCC tissues and cells was significantly up-regulated, and its expression was significantly different from TNM staging and histopathological grading. Down-regulation of APE1 expression significantly reduced the proliferative activity and increased the apoptosis rate of Hep 3B cells. In conclusion, APE1 demonstrates cancer progression potential at the clinical, tissue and cell level. It provides a new idea and theoretical basis for APE1-based clinical diagnosis, prognosis determination and molecular targeted therapy in treatment of HCC.
