The treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma has long been hopeless due to an absence of effective molecules and an underlying cirrhosis, compromising tolerance to conventional chemotherapy. A targeted anti-angiogenic therapy, sorafenib, has been the only option for a decade before new oral molecules have been finally validated. Immunotherapy, intended to correct the immunosuppressive context frequently associated with this tumor, has shown very promising results and could profoundly challenge the therapeutic algorithm of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
