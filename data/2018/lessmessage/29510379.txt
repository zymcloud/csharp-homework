Objective:The aim of this study was to describe real-world lung neuroendocrine tumor (NET) treatment patterns.Methods:This study examined cytotoxic chemotherapy (CC), somatostatin analogues (SSA), targeted therapy (TT), interferon, and liver-directed therapies in 2 US claims databases. Patients ≥18 years with ≥1 inpatient or ≥2 outpatient claims for lung NET, initiating pharmacologic treatment between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2014, were identified and followed until the end of enrollment or study end, whichever occurred first.Results:A total of 785 newly pharmacologically treated lung NET patients were identified: mean (SD) age was 58.6 (9.1) years; 54.0% were female; 78.2% started first-line therapy with CC, 18.1% with SSA, and 1.1% with TT. Mean duration of first-line treatment was 397 days for SSA, 142 days for CC, and 135 days for TT. 74.1% of patients received no pharmacological treatment beyond first-line. The most common second-line treatment was SSA.Conclusions:Most patients received CC as first-line treatment, with SSA being less common. SSA-treated patients remained on therapy for > 1 year, compared to < 5 months for CC. The high proportion of patients using chemotherapy and the low proportion receiving second-line treatment seems consistent with treatment guidelines for small cell lung cancer rather than for NET. Future studies are warranted to describe reasons for treatment choice, discontinuation, and switching.
