Background:The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of major hepatectomies for metastasis in elderly colorectal cancer patients, for whom limited data exist in the literature.Methods:From January 2006 to January 2013, 3,034 patients underwent hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastasis in 32 French surgical centers. Repeat hepatectomies were excluded from the study. Based on a 1: 4 propensity score matching model, 42 patients aged ≥80 (OG) were matched with 168 patients <80 years (YG) in order to obtain 2 well-balanced and homogeneous groups with regards to therapy and prognostic factors.Results:The unmatched cohort consisted of 744 patients (OG: n = 42; YG: n = 702). After PS matching, there was no difference in terms of general morbidity, rates of Dindo-Clavien score ≥III (OG: 16% vs. YG: 21%, p = 0.663), surgical morbidity (OG: 16% vs. YG: 21%, p = 0.663), reoperation (OG:10% vs. YG: 5%, p = 0.263), 90-day mortality (OG: 0% vs. YG:2%, p = 1), and total median hospital stay (OG: 12 vs. YG: 12, p = 0.972). Both groups experienced similar 3- and 5-year overall survival (82 and 82% OG vs.78 and 67% YG) and disease-free survival (40 and 35% OG vs. 45 and 35% YG at 3 and 5 years).Conclusions:No difference in perioperative and postoperative outcomes and disease-free and overall survival was found. Major hepatectomy in selected octogenarian patients is safe and feasible.
