Background/aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a high morbidity as well as mortality and is believed to be one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide. The long non-coding RNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) is involved in numerous cancers, including HCC. This study aimed to explore the role of MALAT1 in HCC progression.Methods:The expression levels of MALAT1 and Vimentin in HCC tissues and relative pair-matched adjacent normal liver tissues were analyzed by RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry. Using bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase assay, we examined the correlation between MALAT1 and miR-30a-5p. Dual-luciferase assay and western blotting suggested that Vimentin was a target of miR-30a-5p. A wound healing assay and transwell assays were employed to determine the effect of MALAT1 and miR-30a-5p on cell migration and invasion in HCC.Results:Our data demonstrated that the levels of MALAT1 and Vimentin were upregulated in HCC tissues and that miR-30a-5p was a direct target of MALAT1. Silenced MALAT1 and overexpressed miR-30a-5p each inhibited cell migration and invasion. Additionally, dual-luciferase assay and western blotting demonstrated that MALAT1 could competitively sponge miR-30a-5p and thereby regulate Vimentin.Conclusion:Our data suggest that MALAT1 acts as an oncogenic lncRNA that promotes HCC migration and invasion. Therefore, the MALAT1-miR-30a-5p-Vimentin axis is a potential therapeutic target and molecular biomarker in HCC.
