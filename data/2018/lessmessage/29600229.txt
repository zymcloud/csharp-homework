Background:In Egypt, there has been a remarkable increase in the proportion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among chronic liver diseases patients. This rising proportion may be explained by the increasing risk factors as hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, improvement of the diagnostic tools of HCC as well as the extended survival among patients with cirrhosis to allow time for some of them to develop HCC. The aim of this study was to study the epidemiology of HCC in Nile delta over the last decade.Methods:The study was carried out on patients diagnosed as HCC in liver cancer clinic in Tanta University Hospital, Egypt, from January 2005 to January 2015. This retrospective study reviewed the files of HCC patients with special stress on age, sex, residence, occupation, smoking, and viral markers.Results:Over the last decade, 1440 HCC patients were diagnosed or referred to liver cancer clinic in Tropical Medicine Department in Tanta University Hospital from January 2005 to January 2015. The mean age of HCC patients was 56.13 Â± 9.53 years. Nearly, half of the patients with HCC were smokers and quarter of HCC patients were diabetics. HBV surface antigen-positive patients were only 3.26%, and the majority of patients were HCV-Ab positive (94.86% of patients).Conclusions:In Nile delta, hepatitis C rather than hepatitis B was linked to the development of HCC in our region which may be related to the high prevalence of HCV in this area.
