The development and progression of numerous complex human diseases have been confirmed to be associated with microRNAs (miRNAs) by various experimental and clinical studies. Predicting potential miRNA-disease associations can help us understand the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of diseases and promote the development of disease treatment and diagnosis. Due to the high cost of conventional experimental verification, proposing a new computational method for miRNA-disease association prediction is an efficient and economical way. Since previous computational models ignored the hubness phenomenon, we presented a novel computational model of Bipartite Local models and Hubness-Aware Regression for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (BLHARMDA). In this method, we first used known miRNA-disease associations to calculate the Jaccard similarity between miRNAs and between diseases, then utilized a modified kNNs model in the bipartite local model method. As a result, we effectively alleviated the detriments from 'bad' hubs. BLHARMDA obtained AUCs of 0.9141 and 0.8390 in the global and local leave-one-out cross validation, respectively, which outperformed most of the previous models and proved high prediction performance of BLHARMDA. Besides, the standard deviation of 0.0006 in 5-fold cross validation confirmed our model's prediction stability and the averaged prediction accuracy of 0.9120 showed the high precision of our model. In addition, to further evaluate our model's accuracy, we implemented BLHARMDA on three typical human diseases in three different types of case studies. As a result, 49 (Esophageal Neoplasms), 50 (Lung Neoplasms) and 50 (Carcinoma Hepatocellular) out of the top 50 related miRNAs were validated by recent experimental discoveries.
