A 76-year-old female was referred to our hospital because of liver dysfunction. Abdominal contrasted computed tomography (CT) revealed a tumor of 7.5cm in the hepatic hilar area. Based on the biopsy, the tumor was diagnosed by as combined hepatocellular-cholangiocellular carcinoma (with stem-cell features). The tumor was considered unresectable;hence, the patient underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). However, a CT scan revealed the treatment to be ineffective. Subsequently, systemic gemcitabine (GEM) chemotherapy was administered and tumor shrinkage was observed with reperfusion of the umbilical portion of the left portal vein. The patient's condition is currently stable 17 months after diagnosis, with no tumor regrowth on account of repeated TACE and GEM therapy. The present case of unresectable combined hepatocellular-cholangiocellular carcinoma was successfully treated using TACE and systemic GEM chemotherapy.
