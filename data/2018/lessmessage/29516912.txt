Objective:The aim of study was to investigate anticancer effect of Viburnum opulus (VO) on Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) bearing mice that treated with different concentrations of VO.Materials and methods:For tumor transplantation; mice were inoculated with 1 Ã— 106 EAC cells intraperitoneally and than divided into five groups (n = 9). Two hours after inoculation; experimental groups were treated daily with VO extract at doses of 1000 mg/kg, 2000 mg/kg, 4000 mg/kg.Results:Extracts obtained from gilaburu juice can have hinder effect on tumor cell growth.Conclusion:As far as we known, this is the first study about in vivo antitumoral activity of VOon Ehrlich ascites tumor model, and consequently VO extract exhibited anticancer activity against EAC-bearing mice.
