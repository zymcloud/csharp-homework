The early diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma is often challenging. In a recent study in 134 patients (Arbelaiz, Hepatology 2017; 66:1125-1143), it was reported that specific proteins found in serum extracellular vesicles of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, hepatocellular carcinoma,orcholangiocarcinomamay be useful as noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic tools. This current article critically appraises this study.
