Aim:Worldwide, hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death and occurs 3 times more commonly in males than females. Current surveillance practices do not fully address gender differences in HCC.Methods:Clinical characteristics and survival were compared between males and females using a prospectively collected database of HCC patients.Results:In a cohort of 1206 patients, 307 (25%) were female who presented with older age, more non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/steatohepatitis (NAFLD/NASH), family history of HCC, and hypertension. Males (75%) were more likely to use alcohol and cigarettes. Females were more likely to undergo HCC surveillance, have smaller tumor size at diagnosis, and less vascular involvement. Males who met Milan criteria were more likely to undergo liver transplant than women who met the criteria. Median/mean survival was similar between the genders. Multivariate analysis showed that NAFLD/NASH was predictive of mortality for both males and females, age and smoking were predictive of mortality for males, and transplant was predictive of survival for males.Conclusion:Gender differences in HCC appear related to both behavioral risk factors and biologic factors. Older females with HCC have more NAFLD/NASH and may be overlooked by current surveillance guidelines. These gender disparities may lend support to future studies of gender-based HCC screening.
