Background/aims:Accumulated evidence indicates that lncRNA NEAT1 has important roles in various malignant tumors. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis to explore the exact role of NEAT1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The effects of NEAT1 on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were measured by in vitro experiments. The expression level and clinical value of NEAT1 in HCC was evaluated based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Oncomine, and in-house real-time quantitative (RT-qPCR). Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were conducted to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms of NEAT1.Results:NEAT1 siRNA not only inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells but also induced HCC cell apoptosis. A total of four records from TCGA, Oncomine, and RT-qPCR analysis were combined to assess the expression level of NEAT1 in HCC. The pooled standard mean deviation (SMD) indicated that NEAT1 was up-regulated in HCC (SMD = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36-0.73; P Conclusions:NEAT1 contributes to the deterioration of HCC and provides a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and therapy of HCC.
