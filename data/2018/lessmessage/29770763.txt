Purpose:We aimed to develop and validate a radiomics nomogram for preoperative prediction of microvascular invasion (MVI) in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 304 eligible patients with HCC were randomly divided into training (n=184) and independent validation (n=120) cohorts. Portal venous and arterial phase computed tomography data of the HCCs were collected to extract radiomic features. Using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm, the training set was processed to reduce data dimensions, feature selection, and construction of a radiomics signature. Then, a prediction model including the radiomics signature, radiologic features, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, as presented in a radiomics nomogram, was developed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The radiomics nomogram was analyzed based on its discrimination ability, calibration, and clinical usefulness. Internal cohort data were validated using the radiomics nomogram.Results:The radiomics signature was significantly associated with MVI status (P Conclusion:The radiomics nomogram, as a noninvasive preoperative prediction method, shows a favorable predictive accuracy for MVI status in patients with HBV-related HCC.
