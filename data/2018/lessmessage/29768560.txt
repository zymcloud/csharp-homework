Introduction:The etiology of several hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases remains largely unknown. Although Fasciola hepatica has been associated with liver fibrosis in Latin America, it has not yet been associated with HCC. This study aimed to determine the existence of specific IgG antibodies against F. hepatica in the serum samples of HCC patients.Methods:In total, 13 serum samples from 13 HCC patients were screened using Fas2-ELISA.Results:Fas2-ELISA demonstrated negative results in all HCC patients included in this study.Conclusions:The pre-existence of F. hepatica infection in HCC patients needs to be further investigated in epidemiological and experimental studies.
