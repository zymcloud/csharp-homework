An 80-year-old man had a medical history of chronic hepatitis C and pancreatoduodenectomy. We detected recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma, and performed transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, instead of radiofrequency ablation or surgery, because of the patient's medical history of bile duct reconstruction and liver dysfunction. On the second day, he was diagnosed with a gas-forming liver abscess and underwent liver abscess drainage. Clostridium perfringens and sordellii were detected by aspiration and the blood culture. Meropenem and Clindamycin were administered intravenously. He was treated shortly after the occurrence before the involvement of severe hemolysis and recovered from the acute phase.
