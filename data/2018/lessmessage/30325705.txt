In the United States, Asian Americans account for 50-60% of hepatitis B virus infections, leading to higher rates of liver cancer in this population. While some city-wide data have reported hepatitis B infection rates among young adults as high as 10-20%, little research has examined factors that impact hepatitis B beliefs, or the most effective strategies for reaching this particular population to promote hepatitis B awareness. An online survey was conducted with young Asian American adults (n = 418), aged 18-29 years old, to better understand their health information seeking, social media usage, and hepatitis B-related behaviors and beliefs. Results indicated that doctors and health organizations were the most trusted sources of health information, while the Internet was the most common source of health information. The majority of participants (99.8%) reported using social media and indicated they engaged in health-related behaviors on social media. Several factors, including non-receipt of hepatitis B vaccine, engaging in more health-related social media activities, and a higher mean score for difficulty with health information seeking, were significantly related to higher perceived susceptibility to hepatitis B. Future research should explore the effectiveness of using social media to reach young Asian American adults to promote hepatitis B awareness.
