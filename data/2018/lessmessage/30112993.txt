Background & method:In this ongoing research, it is aimed to investigate the synthesis, structure identification and effects on urokinase-type plasminogen activators (uPA) and its receptor levels of 4-(3H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridin-2-yl)-N-substituted benzamide and benzamidine derivatives. uPA levels obtained from 4b and 7d administration were similar to 5-FU (5-fluorouracil) for colorectal carcinoma cells (pConclusion:uPAR levels obtaining from 4b and 7d administration were similar to 5-FU for both cell lines colorectal (Colo205, CCL-222) and hepatocellular (HepG2, CCL-23) carcinoma cells (p
