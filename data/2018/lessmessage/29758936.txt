Background:With the rising number of percutaneous ablation therapies in malignant liver lesions there is a need of reliable diagnostics after the intervention to differentiate between reactive changes and tumor.Purpose:To assess the success of percutaneous ablation therapies for malignant liver lesions using CEUS with perfusion analysis.Material and methods:Retrospective analysis of perfusion analysis for 67 patients with 94 malignant liver lesions, treated with ablation therapies. The lesions were 70 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), 18 metastases, 4 cholangiocellular carcinomas (CCC), 2 lesions remained unclear. CEUS was performed after bolus injection of 1.6-2.4 ml of sulfur-hexafluoride microbubbles. The perfusion analysis was calculated using Peak, TTP, mTT and AUC with integrated software during the late arterial to early portal-venous phase for approximately 9 sec (5-15 sec). For the evaluation of the success after percutaneous treatment the perfusion results were compared to the follow-up control after 6 months with CT and MRI and CEUS.Results:Perfusion analyses after percutaneous treatment of malignant liver lesions showed highly significant perfusion differences when comparing the center to the surrounding tissue and the margins (pConclusions:Using CEUS and perfusion analysis, a critical analysis of post-ablation defects in malignant liver lesions is possible. With the help of pseudo-colors, remaining tumor-vascularization can be detected.
