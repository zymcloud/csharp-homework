Purpose:Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health challenge across the world. Before the introduction of Direct-Acting Antivirals (DAAs), managing and treating the disease and its possible complications (cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma) placed a considerable financial burden on public health resources. This study estimates the financial burden of managing HCV in Greece before the introduction of DAAs.Patients and methods:We reviewed the clinical records of 146 consecutive patients with chronic HCV that were regularly followed-up at two tertiary hospitals in Athens. Public health resources utilization was recorded by category for consultations, hospitalizations, medications [for the pre-DAAs: pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) regimens), and laboratory and imaging tests. Overall disease burden was stratified according to fibrosis stage in four categories [F1-F2, F3-F4, decompensated cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) - liver transplantation (LT)]. All cost calculations were based on current prices in the Greek Public Health System.Results:The average cost per patient on treatment was €8,629 for F1-F2 patients, €13,302 for F3-F4 patients, €14,678 for patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and €48,152 for patients with HCC or LT. Main cost drivers were medications (75.6 % of total cost), laboratory and imaging tests (12.4 %) and hospitalizations (11.4 %). Hospitalization cost grew significantly as the disease progressed.Conclusions:Chronic hepatitis C places a substantial economic burden on the Greek Public Health System. This burden is expected to increase exponentially as patients move to more advanced disease stages. Robust interventions to deter chronic HCV infection progression should be considered beneficial from a long-term economic perspective. HIPPOKRATIA 2018, 22(3): 127-131.
