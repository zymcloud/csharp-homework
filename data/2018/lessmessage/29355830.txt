Background:HBV antiviral therapy has the potential to reduce the burden of HBV-related liver disease by suppressing HBV DNA replication to undetectable levels, reducing the progression of liver fibrosis and reducing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Treatment outcomes and long-term benefits require adherence to medication regimens. This study aimed to identify the prevalence and factors associated with non-adherence to antiviral therapy.Methods:A cross-sectional survey of patients receiving HBV antiviral therapies was conducted in three Sydney hospitals. Participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to assess the associations between non-adherence (defined as missing more than 1 day of medication in the last 30 days) and demographic, socio-economic, disease, treatment, health-care system and individual-related factors.Results:Of the 277 participants, 66 (23.8%) were non-adherent, missing a mean 1.7 days of medication (sd 4.8) in the last 30 days. In multivariate analysis, non-adherent behaviour declined with age (odds ratio [OR] 0.9, 95% CI 0.97, 0.99; PConclusions:Almost a quarter of participants in the current study were non-adherent. Adherence is potentially modifiable through person-centred education, collaborative models of patient care and interventions designed to improve health literacy and establish medication routines. Findings have the potential to improve health service delivery to patients at risk of non-adherence to HBV antiviral therapy.
