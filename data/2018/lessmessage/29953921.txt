Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites of the host cells. A commonly accepted view is the requirement of internal membranous structures for various aspects of viral life cycle. Organelles enable favourable intracellular environment for several viruses. However, studies reporting organelle dynamics upon viral infections are scant. In this review, we aim to summarize and highlight modulations caused to various organelles upon viral infection or expression of its proteins.
