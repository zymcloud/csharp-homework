Background:Although spontaneous tumour rupture is a life-threatening complication of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), staged hepatectomy for HCC controlled after transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) could provide a better prognosis. Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) has been accepted worldwide and has been expanded from minor resection to anatomical major resection. We herein report the first case of pure laparoscopic left hepatectomy for ruptured HCC controlled after TAE.Case report:A 66-year-old man was transferred to our Institute because of abdominal pain and decreased consciousness. Ruptured HCC in segment IV and massive intra-abdominal haemorrhage were diagnosed. Emergency TAE was performed, achieving haemostasis. Reduction of intra-abdominal haemorrhage was confirmed at the 3-month follow-up, and no intrahepatic metastasis or peritoneal dissemination was present. Therefore, we performed elective laparoscopic left hepatectomy for the remaining HCC 110 days after TAE. Although dense adhesion was found in the upper right peritoneal cavity and greater omentum enveloping the remaining haemorrhage on the underside of the liver, there was no disseminated involvement in the peritoneal cavity. The operative time was 194 minutes, and intraoperative blood loss was 100 g. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 6.Conclusion:Major LLR may be an option for staged hepatectomy in patients with ruptured HCC controlled after TAE.
