Introduction:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes a host of disease spectrum ranging from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis, cirrhosis liver, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD can occur at all ages, and the highest prevalence is found in the age group of 35-55 years. NAFLD is becoming the commonest cause leading to hepatic cirrhosis, but there is no prescribed therapy for this common condition. Reduction in body weight may reverse the condition.Aim:To find the prevalence of NAFLD in a cohort of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy in this part of the country and also to evaluate the usefulness of routine liver biopsy for the diagnosis of NAFLD.Materials and methods:Interventional type of cross-sectional study. In all, 200 consecutive patients underwent a liver biopsy at the end of a standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and detailed histopathological examination was done. Clinical, biochemical, demographic, and anthropometric variables were obtained prospectively. NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) was obtained for each patient. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 22.Results:A total of 200 patients (140 females and 60 males) were included in the study. In all, 138 patients were categorized as non-nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), 39 patients as borderline/suspicious NASH, and 23 patients had definitive NASH. A higher body mass index, weight, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, alkaline phosphatise, and weight circumference were found in patients with NASH.Conclusion:The high prevalence of NAFLD in patients with gallstone disease may justify routine liver biopsy during cholecystectomy to establish the diagnosis, stage, and possibly direct therapy.
