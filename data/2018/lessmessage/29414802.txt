Background/aims:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, we aimed to obtain further information on HBV pathogenesis, and to search for novel putative molecules for anti-HBV therapy.Methods:We utilized Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) to identify the secretory proteins that are differentially expressed in the HBV DNA-transfected HepG2.2.15 cell line and its parental HepG2 cell line. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to assess the clinical relevance of the observations. Small interfering (si)RNA-based silencing transfection methods were carried out to study the function of ENPP2.Results:Totally, 133 unique proteins were identified as differentially expressed in HepG2.2.15 cell line compared with HepG2 cell line. Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 2 precursor (ENPP2) is one of the most significantly up-regulated secretory proteins associated with HBV replication. This differential expression of ENPP2 was further validated by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, Western Blot and immunohistochemical analysis. To study the function of ENPP2, we knockdown ENPP2 expression in HepG2.2.15 cell line by RNA interference. ENPP2 silencing increased HBV replication approximately 2.3-fold by enhancing, via the type I IFN signaling pathway, HBV cccDNA (covalently closed circular DNA) translation into viral RNA. Moreover, attenuation of ENPP2 expression inhibited both the invasion and migration ability of hepatoma cells in vitro via interacting with the molecules in the tumor microenvironment.Conclusion:Our study demonstrates that ENPP2 may be a novel anti-HBV target and indicate that suppression of its expression may inhibit the invasion and migration ability of hepatoma cells.
