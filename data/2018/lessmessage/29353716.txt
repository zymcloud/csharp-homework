Purpose:To evaluate outcomes and risk factors associated with hypervascularization in hypovascular, hepatobiliary phase (HBP) hypointense nodules (HHNs) without T2 hyperintensity on gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) images in chronic liver disease patients.Materials and methods:222 HHNs were analyzed. Multivariate analysis with a Cox proportional hazard regression model was used.Results:41 nodules became hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). History of HCC, hyperintensity on T1WI or DWI, and higher growth rate were risk factors for hypervascularization (P Conclusion:History of HCC, hyperintensity on T1WI or DWI, and higher growth rate were associated with nodular progression to hypervascular HCC.
