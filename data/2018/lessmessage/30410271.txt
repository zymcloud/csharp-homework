"Purple urine bag syndrome" (PUBS) is a rare but distressing presentation of urinary tract infection (UTI) among moribund patients on indwelling urinary catheter. A 56-year-old woman with carcinoma of the left breast and metastasis in vertebrae and liver was bed ridden. She was on Foley's catheter for 9 months, with the last catheter changed 3 weeks back. A 75-year-old woman presented with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for 2 years and moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the right parotid region (8 months). She experienced fall and fracture of femur, bed ridden, and on Foley's catheter for 7 years. She had facial wound with maggots for 3 days. Both the women developed purple-colored urine with no other symptoms of UTI. No investigations were carried out and they were empirically treated with nitrofurantoin, catheter change reassurance, and increased fluid intake. Urine color was normal by a week. PUBS can be managed easily at home with simple antibiotics, adequate hydration, and family/patient counseling in palliative care settings.
