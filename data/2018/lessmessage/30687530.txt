Helicobacter Pylori (HP) persistently colonizes the stomach in about 50% of the globe population and it is the main risk factor for peptic ulcer, as well as for gastric adenocarcinoma and MALT gastric lymphoma. The treatment for HP revolutionized the management of the peptic ulcer disease, providing permanent healing in many cases. Preventing colonization of HP would be the primary prevention of gastric malignancy and peptic ulceration. At the same time, the presence of HP provides protection for some diseases (gastroesophageal reflux disease and its complications, esophageal adenocarcinoma, asthma), the eradication of the microorganism having negative repercussions. HP has an increasingly recognized role in other extragastric pathologies. Thus, immune thrombocytopenic purpura has improved after treating HP infection. There are controversial association with ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. The current article highlights an important association between HP infection and a range of hepatobiliary disorders such as biliary lithiasis (where even an etiological role is involved), cholestatic syndromes (primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cholangitis), chronic hepatitis B virus, chronic hepatitis C virus, with an evolution towards cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
