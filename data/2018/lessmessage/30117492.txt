Background/aims:To compare the survival benefits of surgical resection (SR) with those of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in elderly patients (≥65 years) with single hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ≤5 cm.Patients and methods:Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, a total of 461 patients who underwent SR and 575 patients who underwent RFA were enrolled from 2004 to 2012. Overall survival (OS) and liver-cancer-specific survival (LCSS) comparisons were conducted between the two groups before and after propensity score matching (PSM).Results:Elderly patients with early-stage HCC had a lower rate of utilization of liver transplantation, and they were more likely to receive SR or RFA as their first-line treatment compared with younger patients (P 75 years) and tumor size (≤3.0, 3.1-5.0 cm), the SR group still presented better OS and LCSS than the RFA group (all P 0.05), both before and after PSM.Conclusion:Treatment strategies for elderly patients (≥65 years) with single HCC ≤5 cm should emphasize SR as the primary therapy, while RFA can be an alternative to SR for those> 75 years with single HCC ≤3 cm.
