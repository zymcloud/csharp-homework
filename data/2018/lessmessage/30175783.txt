Natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in tumor immunity and infection control. The natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) NKp46, NKp44 and NKp30 are involved in the control of the activation of NK cells. Few reports have investigated the ligands of NCRs. We previously reported the NCRs binding affinity to heparin and glycosaminoglycans. We also showed that multimeric sialyl Lewis X-expressing transferrin, secreted by human hepatoma HepG2 cells, binds to NKp46 and NKp44, but not to NKp30. In this study, we investigated the binding between NCRs and glycolipids. The possible binding of glycolipids to NCRs was screened by microarray, using the recombinant extracellular domain of NKp46, NKp44 and NKp30 tagged with 6Ã—His (rNKp46, rNKp44 and rNKp30). We found that rNKp44 binds to Globo-A. However, we did not detect the interaction between rNKp46 or rNKp30 and any of the glycolipids investigated. Direct binding assays supported the results of the microarray screening. Therefore, we concluded that Globo-A is a novel ligand for NKp44 but not NKp46 and NKp30, and showed differences in the ligand selectivity of NCRs.
