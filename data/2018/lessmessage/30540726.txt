Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a neoplasm with significant incidence and prevalence in the world. In large percentage it originates from a cirrhotic liver. Liver transplantation under special conditions is effective in the simultaneous treatment of both conditions. Information is scarce in Latin America. This is a cross-sectional study of the first 200 liver transplants of our series (Years 2000-2015). During this period, 26 (13%) patients had a diagnosis of HCC. Of the 26 transplanted with HCC, 21 (81%) patients were male. The average age was 59.7 years. The most frequent cirrhotic etiology was NASH with nine (35%) cases, followed by HCV and OH with six (23%). The average of AFP pre-transplant was 113.3. Downstaging was performed in four patients. The overall survival obtained is 90.9% over 5 years. The recurrence-free survival in our series is 95.5% at 5 years.
