Background:With aging populations increasing in developed countries, the prevalence of elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is expected to rise. The aim of this study was to determine the short- and long-term outcomes of HCC surgery in elderly patients (â‰¥75 years) using propensity score matching.Methods:The study group included 421 patients who underwent hepatectomy as their initial treatment with curative intent. The patients were divided into elderly (n = 111) and non-elderly (n = 310) groups. We applied propensity score matching - taking into consideration patient background, blood examination, and tumor factors - to minimize the effect of potential confounders. We then compared the results before and after the propensity matching.Results:Before propensity matching, the elderly group included significantly more patients with a high American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (p Conclusion:Hepatectomy for HCC in elderly patients is justified.
