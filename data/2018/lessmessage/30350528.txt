Background and aim:We researched the relationships between serum potassium level and prognostic scores and complications of cirrhosis, and mortality.Methods:This study was performed retrospectively in Turkish High Specialty Training and Research Hospital between 2009 and 2015. Patients who had missing patient files and electrolyte disorder for another reason, showed complications at the time of application and were using diuretics were excluded from the study.Results:218 patients were included in the study. During the follow-up period, 23.4% (n: 51) of the entire population passed away. Compared to the patients who survived, the patients who passed away had higher HCC and HES development rate, mean Child-Pugh and MELD score and lower mean blood potassium level. The stepwise multivariable Cox regression model which included significant independent predictors showed that ChildPugh score (HR: 1.29; p 3.4 mmol/L, the patients with a potassium level â‰¤ 3.4 mmol/L had higher mortality rate, HCC and HES development rate, mean Child-Pugh and mean MELD scores.Conclusion:Hypokalemia is an important prognostic factor in cirrhotic patients.
Child-Pugh; MELD; hyponatremia.
