Background/aims:Hepatoblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric liver cancer. circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in fine-tuning gene expression and are often deregulated in cancers. However, the expression profile and clinical significance of circRNAs in hepatoblastoma is still unknown.Methods:Circular RNA microarray was conducted to identify hepatoblastoma-related circRNAs. GO analysis, pathway analysis, and miRNA response elements analysis was conducted to predict the potential roles of differentially expressed circRNAs in hepatoblastoma. MTT assays, Ki67 staining, and Transwell assays were conducted to clarify the role of circRNA in hepatoblastoma in vitro. Bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experiments were conducted to clarify the mechanism of circRNA-mediated gene regulation in hepatoblastoma cell.Results:869 differentially expressed circRNAs were identified between hepatoblastoma and adjacent normal liver samples, including 421 up-regulated circRNAs and 448 down-regulated circRNAs. The significant enriched GO term of hepatoblastoma-related circRNAs in biological process, cellular component, and molecular function were "chromosome organization", "cytoplasm", and "organic cyclic compound binding". Tight junction signaling pathway was ranked the Top 1 potentially affected by circRNA-mediated regulatory network. circ_0015756 was significantly up-regulated in human hepatoblastoma specimens and metastatic hepatoblastoma cell lines. circ_0015756 silencing decreased hepatoblastoma cell viability, proliferation, and invasion in vitro. circ_0015756 acted as miR-1250-3p sponge to regulate hepatoblastoma cell function.Conclusions:circRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of hepatoblastoma. circ_0015756 is a promising target for the prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of hepatoblastoma.
