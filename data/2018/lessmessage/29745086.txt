Purpose:Advanced gastric cancer (AGC) has a dismal prognosis. Platin-5-fluorouracil (CF) combination chemotherapy is the most widely used protocol and addition of a taxane (TCF) seems to increase survival and toxicity rates. We aimed to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of TCF as compared to CF in patients older than 65 years and compare them with the patients younger than 65 years.Methods:A total of 341 patients with AGC have been treated at six different oncology centers in Turkey between 2010 and 2014 and evaluated retrospectively. The characteristics of the patients whose tumors were histologically confirmed and whose survival data were available were registered and analyzed. The study group consisted of 234 patients younger than 65 years (group 1) and 107 patients older than 65 years (group 2). All of the data obtained from the patients were statistically analyzed.Results:The median age of the patients was 58.2 years and the mean follow-up time 14.4 months. For the entire group, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 9 and 13 months, respectively. Using TCF over CF regimen increased the OS by 4.2 months (i.e., group 1 and 2 together). For group 2, patients with liver metastases and without surgery of the primary tumor were treated with significantly more TCF as compared to CF, respectively. Although TCF yielded significantly higher PFS and OS in group 1 (p=0.0001 and p=0.017), there was no significant difference in group 2 as compared to CF. Also, grade 3-4 toxicity was statistically defined as one of the possible reasons of worsened OS in patients older than 65 years and receiving TCF.Conclusions:The addition of taxanes to CF backbone leads to a significant increase in both PFS and OS in patients younger than 65 years of age but the triplet regimen with taxanes does not provide superior survival in patients older than 65 years of age.
