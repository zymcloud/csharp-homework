Introduction:As the incidence of liver cancer continues to increase in the setting of cirrhosis, parenchyma-sparing liver resection is increasingly necessary. A technique is described that involves using a sling made from 1-inch-wide packing gauze to retract and rotate the liver to divide the right triangular and coronary ligaments and mobilize segment 7. The right lobe is rotated anteriorly and counterclockwise, allowing access and parenchymal transection of segment 7 under ultrasonographic guidance.Case presentation:Seven patients with tumors in segment 7 underwent resection with the technique described above: 4 had Child's A cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 1 had metastatic colon cancer, 1 had an adenoma, and 1 had a symptomatic hemangioma. Tumor size ranged between 2.5 and 7.7 cm. Blood loss during resection was between 150 and 500 mL. No patients required transfusion as a result of surgery. With the exception of 1 patient with Clostridium difficile colitis, the average hospital stay was 3.8 days.Management and outcome:Parenchyma-sparing laparoscopic resection of segment 7 is feasible and can be safely performed using a sling for intracorporal hepatic retraction, manipulation, and positioning. Given the risk of HCC recurrence, laparoscopic liver resection may also be better suited for subsequent salvage liver transplant because of less perihepatic adhesions.
