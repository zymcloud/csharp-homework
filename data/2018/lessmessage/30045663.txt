Testis expressed 10 (Tex10), a new core component of the pluripotency circuitry, has been reported to positively regulate embryonic stem cell (ESC) super-enhancers to promote ESC self-renewal; however, the expression and function of Tex10 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver cancer stem cells remains unclear. The present study was designed to investigate the expression patterns of Tex10 with immunohistochemistry, western blotting and RT-qPCR in samples from HCC patients and HCC cell lines. The results obtained show that Tex10 was highly expressed in HCC tissues, and elevated Tex10 protein levels positively correlate with the poorly differentiated carcinoma. Likewise, we found that Tex10 expression in the high-metastasis HCCLM3 potential cell line was higher than that in the low-metastasis HepG2 potential cell line, and Tex10 expression in liver cancer stem cells was also higher than that in adhered HCC cells. In addition, Tex10 knockdown decreased stem cell marker expression and drug resistance. Tex10 promoted cancer stemness through activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway. Taken together, our study demonstrates that Tex10 plays a potent carcinogenic role in HCC tumorigenesis by maintaining cancer stem cell properties through activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway and promoting chemo-resistance. Thus, targeting Tex10 may provide a novel and effective therapeutic strategy to suppress the tumorigenicity of advanced HCC.
