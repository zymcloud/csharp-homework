Background:Data about the molecular pathogenesis of hepatitis C-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still challenging.Objectives:Therefore, we tried to investigate the epigenetic study of three nominated genes (APC, P14, and E-cadherin) in the pathogenesis of HCV-related HCC in Egyptian.Methods:Between March 2016 and March 2017, the DNA methylation, and quantification using (epigenetic ELISA kit) for E-cadherin, APC, and P14 genes were studied in three groups of patients: HCV related liver cirrhosis without HCC group (LC-group; n= 20), HCC on top of HCV-related cirrhosis (HCC-group; n= 20), and a third apparently healthy control group (control-group; n= 10).Results:E-cad methylation showed non-significant differences between groups. P14 methylation was occurred only in HCC-group (45%). APC methylation was the highest in HCC group (70%). Methylation level was high in HCC group in comparison to both LC and control groups (P 2.9 ng/ml predicts HCC in LC-group with 90% sensitivity and 80% specificity and at level > 2.3 ng/ml had 95% sensitivity and 90% specificity in control-group. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy were 90%, 60%, 69.2, 85.7 and 75% respectively.Conclusion:Aberrant DNA methylation of multiple genes is associated with disease progression in HCV related cirrhosis. Moreover, early detection of promotor methylation of these may sever as good biomarker for early detection and therapeutic targets in high risk patients.
