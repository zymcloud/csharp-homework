Purpose:This study aimed to evaluate the utility of virtual monoenergetic images for detecting washout of small (â‰¤2 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the equilibrium phase.Methods:We performed 120-kVp-equivalent linear-blended (M120) and monoenergetic reconstructions from 40 to 90 keV by standard (40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90) and novel noise-reduced (nMERA: 40+, 50+, 60+, 70+, 80+, 90+) monoenergetic reconstruction algorithms. Image quality and tumor visibility of delayed washout of HCCs in the equilibrium phase were compared between standard monoenergetic reconstruction algorithm and nMERA by objective and subjective analyses.Results:Contrast-to-noise ratio of the tumor at 40+ was the highest, whereas the score of tumor visibility peaked at 50+. The score of overall image quality at 40+ was significantly lower than those on all other image series, and the image quality among other image series were not significantly different.Conclusions:Virtual monoenergetic image reconstructed with nMERA 50+ was most appropriate to detect washout of small HCCs.
