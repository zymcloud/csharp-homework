Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is recognized as a major causative agent of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite rapid progress in the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAA) against HCV infection in recent years, cost-effective antiviral drugs with more affordable prices still need to be developed. In this study, we screened a library of natural compounds to identify natural HCV inhibitors. The library of the pure compounds extracted from Chinese herbs deposited in the chemical bank of National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine (NRICM), Taiwan was screened in the cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc) system. We identified the flavone or flavan-based compounds amentoflavone, 7,4[Formula: see text]-dihydroxyflavanone, and orobol with the inhibition of viral entry, replication, and translation of the HCV life cycle. Amentoflavone and orobol also showed inhibitory effects on resistant-associated variants to the NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir. The results of this study have the potential to benefit patients who are intolerant to the adverse effect of pegylated interferon or who harbor resistant strains refractory to treatment by current direct-acting antiviral agents.
