Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhosis is diagnosed, most of times, when it is not susceptible to curative treatment. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a palliative therapeutic option with heterogeneous results. The HAP score stratifies patients who will benefit from the first TACE.Objective:To evaluate if the HAP score is a prognostic factor of HCC treated with TACE.Materials and methods:Retrospective cohort study in cirrhotic patients with HCC and first TACE at the Edgardo Rebagliati Martins National Hospital, Lima-Peru, from June 2011 to June 20139. The HAP score was applied, mortality and survival were observed with a follow-up of 36 months.Results:We included 54 patients with age of 67.7±9.9 years, 59.3% Child-Pugh A and 40.7% Child-Pugh B, MELD score of 11±2.7; 51.9 and 40.7% were BCLC A and B, respectively; 66.7% had a single tumor and 70.4% had a predominant tumor Conclusions:The HAP score is a useful tool to guide the management decisions of cirrhotic patients with HCC requiring TACE due to its value in predicting mortality and survival.
