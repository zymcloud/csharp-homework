Background:Alzheimer-associated neuronal thread protein (AD7c-NTP) has been found to be a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD).Objective:The aim of the present study was to investigate the distribution of Alzheimer-associated neuronal thread protein and its relationship to common chronic diseases in the general population.Methods:Urine samples of 1,805 participants were collected from four districts (Xi Cheng, Fang Shan, Tong Zhou, and Yan Qing) in Beijing. The assessment in this study included a questionnaire that captured participants' demographic information, use of medication and histories of disease, neurological examinations, psychometric evaluations, physical and clinical examinations, and laboratory tests.Results:Urine AD7c-NTP level was increased among the population over 60 years old and females exhibited higher levels than males. These results controlled for other demographic factors such as education levels, employment status, body mass index and current residence. The urine AD7c-NTP levels exhibited no association with non-neurological diseases (0.3346±0.4482 ng/ml), such as hypertension (0.3445±0.4187), stroke (0.3652±0.4010), diabetes (0.3319±0.4371), dyslipidemia (0.3440±0.4314), renal insufficiency (0.3223±0.3909), cancer (0.5055±1.0006), chronic lung disease (0.2911±0.2852), chronic liver disease (0.5579±0.6726), severe depression symptoms (0.5186±0.7040), and mild depression symptoms (0.3669±0.3811).Conclusions:Cut-off values for urine AD7c-NTP levels for different age groups and genders should be established. AD7c-NTP levels proved relatively stable in the body and were not impacted by demographic factors or common chronic diseases.
