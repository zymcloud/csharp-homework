Background:The role of liver resection for metastatic breast carcinoma is still debated.Methods:Fifty-one resected patients were reviewed. All patients received adjuvant chemotherapy after resection of the primary tumor. Clinicopathological characteristics and immunohistochemistry expression of estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), human epidermal growth factor (HER2), or Ki67 were evaluated.Results:The median number of metastases was 2; single metastases were present in 24 (47%) patients. The median tumor diameter was 4 cm. Major hepatectomies were performed in 31 (61%) patients. Postoperative mortality was null. Postoperative morbidity was 13.7%. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 92, 36, and 16% respectively. Eleven (21.6%) patients survived longer than 5 years and 8.9% are alive without recurrence 10 years after surgery. At the univariate analysis, tumor diameter, lymph node status, PR receptor status, and triple positive receptors (ER+/PR+/Her2+) were significantly related to survival. At the multivariate analysis, tumor diameter, PR receptor, and triple negative status were significantly related to the long-term outcome.Conclusion:Liver resection seems to be a safe and effective treatment for metastases from breast cancer, and encouraging long-term survival can be obtained with acceptable risk in selected patients. Tumors less than 5 cm and positive hormone receptor status are the best prognostic factors.
