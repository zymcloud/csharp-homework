Combined treatment with transarterial chemoembolization for intrahepatic lesions and transarterial embolization for peritoneal metastases was performed through hepatic artery, gastroduodenal artery, and superior mesenteric artery.Results:Treatment resulted in an objective response of 85.7% Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. No severe adverse effects were observed.Conclusions:Transarterial interventional therapy can be performed safely and may improve the prognosis of HCC patients with peritoneal metastases.
