Background and rationale:The Transplanted Organ Questionnaire (TOQ), developed in France, is a disease-targeted instrument designed to evaluate what the transplanted organ represents to the recipient in patients who have undergone liver transplantation. The present study sought to validate a version of the TOQ for use in the Brazilian population. Translation and cross-cultural adaptation were carried out in accordance with international standard practices. Convergent validity was measured by correlations between TOQ domains and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), while reliability was assessed by measurement of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient), reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient), sensitivity to change (effect size), and floor and ceiling effects.Results:The study sample comprised 122 liver transplant recipients, with a mean age of 56.7 ± 9.9 years, treated at the outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital in Southern Brazil. The sample was largely male (57.4%), and the predominant indication for liver transplant was hepatocellular carcinoma (34.4%). The mean total TOQ score was 32.9 ± 18.0. Cronbach's alpha for the total score was 0.89 (95%CI 0.86-0.92). Correlations between TOQ and BDI domains were acceptable, with the rejection domain correlating most strongly (r = 0.37; p ≤ 0.001). In conclusion, the Brazilian Portuguese version of the TOQ exhibited good psychometric performance, suggesting that it can be a useful tool in the Brazilian cultural context.
