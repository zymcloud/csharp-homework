Purpose:The aims of this study were to evaluate treatment responses and predictive factors for overall survival (OS) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) treated with iodine-125 (125I) brachytherapy.Methods and materials:Seventy-seven HCC patients with PVTT underwent 125I brachytherapy after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological evaluation were performed before and after treatment, as well as at 4-6 weeks intervals for 7 years to assess the efficacy and toxicity of therapy. Treatment response was assessed using modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors. OS and predictive factors for each subgroup were evaluated after treatment.Results:In total, 11 patients (14.29%) achieved complete response, and 41 patients (53.25%) achieved partial response. The response rate (complete response + partial response) was 67.53% (52/77). The median OS was 9 months. The multivariable Cox regression model indicated that post-treatment tumor size with PVTT (p = 0.016, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.889, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.127 to 3.166) and baseline hemoglobin (p = 0.013, HR=0.518, 95% CI: 0.308 to 0.872) and alkaline phosphatase (p = 0.002, HR=2.275, 95% CI: 1.338 to 3.868) levels were significant independent predictors of OS.Conclusions:125I brachytherapy results in favorable treatment responses in HCC patients with PVTT. Notably, post-treatment tumor size and baseline hemoglobin and alkaline phosphatase levels are significant independent predictive factors for OS and provide the most predictive information regarding OS.
