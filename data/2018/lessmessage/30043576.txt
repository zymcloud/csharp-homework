Cutaneous melanoma (CM) with liver lesions is uncommon in Asia and found in only 14-20% of all cases. Here, we report the case of a 70-year-old male patient with cutaneous melanoma with metastases to the liver. Computerized tomography (CT) revealed multiple hepatic cystic lesions, and hepatic puncture biopsy was used for definitive diagnostics. The primary lesion was found on the patientÂ’s scalp. We briefly reviewed the literature to summarize the recent progress in diagnosis and treatment of metastatic cutaneous melanoma. Examination of pathology data is still considered the gold standard of diagnosis, while imaging is used to detect metastases, assess the stage of disease and monitor the patients. Metastasectomy, whenever possible, may benefit most patients. Systemic therapies remain the mainstay of the treatment, with some important breakthroughs reported in the recent years. New treatments, such as adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation, are still in the early stages.
