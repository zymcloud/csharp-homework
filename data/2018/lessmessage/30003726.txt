Purpose:To identify microRNAs (miRNAs) directly regulating the proto-oncogene Bmi-1 expression in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.Methods:Four HCC cell lines, including HepG2, Bel7404, Huh7, and PLC5, the normal hepatocellular cell line MIHA, and 30 HCC biopsies were included in this study. Potential miRNAs, which interact with Bmi-1 and are involved in the development of HCC were identified through bioinformatic analyses. The expression of miRNA and Bmi-1 in HCC cell lines and HCC tissues was analyzed using fluorescence protein analysis, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and Western blotting.Results:Bioinformatic analysis suggested that miR-218 is a potential miRNA regulating Bmi-1 expression. Fluorescence protein analysis, RT-qPCR, and Western blotting confirmed the direct interaction between miR-218 and Bmi-1. In addition, increased expression of Bmi-1 was detected in HCC cell lines and HCC tissues. In most HCC tissues, the expression of miR-218 was decreased and was associated with increased expression of Bmi-1.Conclusion:miR-p218 downregulates the expression of the proto-oncogene Bmi-1 in HCC, and it may be an effective target for the treatment of this disease.
