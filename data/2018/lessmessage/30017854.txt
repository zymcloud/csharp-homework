Schistosomiasis affects approximately 207 million people in 76 countries. The association between hepatocellular carcinoma and Schistosoma mansoni infection has been investigated. Studies using animal models suggest that the parasite may accelerate the oncogenic process when combined with other factors, such as hepatitis C virus infection or exposure to a carcinogen. Herein, we report a case series of six hepatocellular carcinoma patients from Northeast Brazil, with negative serology for both hepatitis B and C virus, submitted to liver transplantation, whose explant showed evidence of schistosomal liver fibrosis. Since all patients enrolled in this study were submitted to liver transplantation, we were able to access the whole explanted liver and perform histopathological analysis, which is often not possible in other situations. Although 50% of them showed signs of liver failure, no cirrhosis or any liver disease other than schistosomal fibrosis had been detected. These uncommon findings suggest that Schistosoma mansoni infection might predispose to hepatocellular carcinoma development, regardless of the absence of other risk factors.
