Objective:To evaluate the efficiency and safety of percutaneous ablation of the tumor feeding artery (PAA) before radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) under ultrasound guidance.Patients and methods:In total, 94 patients with hypervascular HCC and tumor feeding artery visible by contrast-enhanced ultrasound were prospectively randomized to receive either PAA combined with RFA (RFA + PAA) or RFA alone. This study was registered at the clinical trials registry website (No. NCT03143140). The mean tumor size was 3.2 ± 0.9 cm (2.0-5.0 cm). The mean follow-up was 23.7 ± 9.7 months (4-44 months). The technical success, local tumor progression and intrahepatic distant recurrence rates were compared. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test.Results:The local tumor progression rate was lower for the PAA + RFA group than for the RFA group (8.5% vs 21.3%, p Conclusions:PAA appears to be an effective and safe technique for the treatment of hypervascular HCC, with a lower local tumor progression rate than that of conventional RFA.
