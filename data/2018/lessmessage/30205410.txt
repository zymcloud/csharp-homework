Background/aims:Our recent study indicated that the serum microcystin-LR (MC-LR) level is positively linked to the risk of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Gankyrin is over-expressed in cancers and mediates oncogenesis; however, whether MC-LR induces tumor formation and the role of gankyrin in this process is unclear.Methods:We induced malignant transformation of L02 liver cells via 35 passages with exposure to 1, 10, or 100 nM MC-LR. Wound healing, plate and soft agar colony counts, and nude mice tumor formation were used to evaluate the tumorigenic phenotype of MC-LR-treated cells. Silencing gankyrin was used to confirm its function. We established a 35-week MC-LR exposure rat model by twice weekly intraperitoneal injection with 10 Î¼g/kg body weight. In addition, 96 HCC patients were tested for tumor tissue gankyrin expression and serum MC-LR levels.Results:Chronic low-dose MC-LR exposure increased proliferation, mobility, clone and tumor formation abilities of L02 cells as a result of gankyrin activation, while silencing gankyrin inhibited the carcinogenic phenotype of MC-LR-treated cells. MC-LR also induced neoplastic liver lesions in Sprague-Dawley rats due to up-regulated gankyrin. Furthermore, a trend of increased gankyrin was observed in humans exposed to MC-LR.Conclusion:These results suggest that MC-LR induces hepatocarcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo by increasing gankyrin levels, providing new insight into MC-LR carcinogenicity studies.
