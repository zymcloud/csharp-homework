Objectives:The aim of this study was to evaluate the chemopreventive potential of vanillic acid against 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced hamster buccal pouch oral carcinogenesis.Materials and methods:Determine the tumor incidence, tumor volume and burden, assessment of the status of Phase I and Phase II detoxification enzymes were measured in the liver and buccal mucosa of hamsters using specific colorimetric methods.Results:One hundred percent tumor formation was observed in DMBA alone treated hamsters. Phase I and Phase II detoxification enzymes status were significantly altered DMBA-induced oral carcinogenesis. Vanillic acid (200 mg/kg bw p.o) significantly restored the biochemical variables of liver and buccal mucosa in DMBA + vanillic acid treated hamsters to near normal range compared with DMBA alone treated hamsters.Conclusion:The present study thus shows chemopreventive potential of vanillic acid in DMBA-induced hamster buccal pouch carcinogenesis. Vanillic acid improves the phase I and phase II detoxification enzymes in DMBA treated hamsters.
