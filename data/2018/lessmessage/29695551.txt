We investigated the anti-metastatic action of nicotine- and tar-removed cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on highly metastatic mouse Colon-26 cells using syngeneic BALB/c mice. Colon-26 cells were injected into the spleen of mice, cells were grown in the spleen as the primary lesion, and some metastasized from the spleen to liver and established a metastatic lesion. CSE (10, 30, and 100%) was intraperitoneally administered daily to the mice for 14 days after tumor inoculation. As a result, the relative spleen weights of CSE-administered mice did not differ significantly from those of the control mice. However, the relative liver weights of CSE 30%-administered mice significantly decreased compared to control mice. In order to identify the active component in CSE, we examined the action of methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) on the invasiveness of Colon-26 cells. MVK significantly reduced the invasiveness of cells. MVK may be a candidate active component of CSE.
