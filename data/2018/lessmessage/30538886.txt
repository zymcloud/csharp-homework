Introduction:To report on SBRT as a bridge to OLT for patients with HCC and Child-Pugh ≥8 cirrhosis.Methods:Retrospective review of 15 patients, treated from 2010-2017. Three patients excluded secondary to delisting from prohibitive substance. Twelve patients (17 lesions) included for final analysis. Hepatic SPECT functional treatment planning utilized.Results:The median age of 60 years with a median CP 9 and MELD 14. The median SBRT dose was 40 Gy in 5 fractions, and median tumor size was 2.3cm (1.2-5.3cm). Median follow-up and survival was 40-months and 46-months, respectively. One patient succumbed to renal/hepatic failure before OLT. Radiographic response was 80%. pCR at explant was 46%. No grade ≥ 3 acute toxicities. Median time to progression of CP ≥ 2 was 9.7-months and MELD progression was not met before OLT.Conclusion:SBRT with functional treatment planning can be used safely as a bridge to OLT in select patients with CP ≥8 cirrhosis.
