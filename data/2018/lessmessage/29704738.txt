Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rare in non-cirrhotic liver. Achievement of sustained virological response (SVR) reduces even more the risk.Presentation of case:Liver resection for small HCC was performed in cleared HCV infection non-cirrhotic 62-year-old man. Methacronous oligometastatic recurrences in intolerant to NexavarÂ® side-effects patient, were treated by multiple innovative microinvasive approaches: bilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy, thoracic wall resection, laparoscopic sacrum cryoablation combined with hadron-therapy.Discussion:Therapies allowed the patient to lead 6 years satisfying QoL with only a small residual presacral disease stable at 8 months.Conclusion:Microinvasive surgery may be a valid resource of therapy in indolent HCC limited distant recurrences.
