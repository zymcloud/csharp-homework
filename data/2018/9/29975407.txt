Background:Minnesota has the second largest Hmong population in the United States. The objective of the current study was to estimate the cancer incidence among Hmong individuals in Minnesota between 2000 and 2012 to determine targets for screening and interventions.Methods:Cancer cases in Minnesota between 2000 and 2012 were obtained from the Minnesota Cancer Surveillance System, and proportional incidence ratios (PIRs) were calculated. The 2000 and 2010 US Census reports were used to obtain total population estimates. Age-adjusted cancer incidence rates (AAR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for Hmong individuals, Asian/Pacific Islander individuals, and all Minnesotans using direct method and Poisson regression.Results:Compared with all Minnesotans, the Hmong had elevated PIRs and AARs for malignancies related to infections, including nasopharyngeal, stomach, liver, and cervical cancers. The AAR ratios in Hmong versus all Minnesotans were found to be significantly increased for nasopharyngeal (AAR, 15.90; 95% CI, 9.48-26.68), stomach (AAR, 2.99; 95% CI, 2.06-4.33), liver (AAR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.04-3.02), and cervical (AAR, 3.88; 95% CI, 2.61-5.77) cancers. The AARs in Hmong versus all Minnesotans were significantly lower for all-cause cancer (AAR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.35-0.44); cancers of the breast, lung, and colorectum; melanoma; and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Compared with Asian/Pacific Islander individuals, the rates in Hmong were significantly higher for melanoma and cervical cancer, with AAR ratios of 2.23 (95% CI, 1.09-4.56) and 1.59 (95% CI, 1.01-2.49), respectively.Conclusions:Compared with all Minnesotans, the Hmong have an increased incidence of cancers related to infectious agents. These findings indicate a need for cancer prevention and screening programs in this population.
