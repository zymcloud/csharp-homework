We investigated the efficacy of nivolumab treatment in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who discontinued nivolumab treatment due to reasons other than disease progression. Of the 34 patients, 3 patients discontinued nivolumab therapy due to adverse events and were subsequently observed without additional treatment. The first patient discontinued nivolumab after 14 cycles of treatment due to type 1 diabetes mellitus and has maintained partial remission for 8 months. The second patient discontinued nivolumab after 11 cycles of treatment due to interstitial pneumonitis, and durable response was confirmed for 5 months. However, multiple lung lesions reappeared at 6 months after discontinuing nivolumab. The third patient discontinued nivolumab due to elevated liver enzymes after three cycles of treatment. At the time of discontinuation, a new liver lesion appeared, but the lesion decreased in size at 6 months after discontinuation. In the present study, a relatively durable response was observed in three patients who discontinued nivolumab without additional treatment.
