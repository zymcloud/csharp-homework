Objectives:To assess the impact of all-oral direct-acting antiviral agent (DAA) regimens on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with cirrhosis.Methods:This was a multicentre prospective cohort study recruiting HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with a new diagnosis of compensated cirrhosis. Patients were followed up until HCC, death or the censoring date (March 2017). The primary endpoint was the emergence of HCC. The incidence rate (IR) (95% CI) of HCC in different groups was computed. Time-to-event analyses were performed to identify predictors of HCC emergence.Results:The study included 495 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with cirrhosis. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 59 (27-84) months, 22 (4.4%; 95% CI 2.6-6.3) patients developed an HCC. The IR (95% CI) of HCC was 0.93 (0.06-1.42) per 100 person-years (PY). Three hundred and three (61%) patients achieved sustained virological response (SVR) during follow-up, 79 after interferon (IFN)-based regimens and 224 after an all-oral DAA regimen. The IR (95% CI) of HCC after all-oral DAA was 0.35 (0.14-0.85) per 100 PY whereas it was 1.79 (1.11-2.88) per 100 PY in the remaining cohort (P = 0.0005). When only patients with SVR were considered, the IR (95% CI) of HCC after all-oral DAA was 0.32 (0.12-0.86) whereas it was 0 per 100 PY among those with SVR after IFN-based therapies (P = 0.27). Achieving SVR with an all-oral DAA regimen during follow-up was independently associated with a lower risk of HCC emergence (subhazard ratio 0.264; 95% CI 0.070-0.991; P = 0.049).Conclusions:SVR with all-oral DAA regimens reduces the risk of HCC in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with compensated cirrhosis.
