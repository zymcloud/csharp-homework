Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can cause chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are important factors in the formation of the HBV capsid and in genome replication during the viral life cycle. Hsp90 is known to promote capsid assembly. However, the functional roles of Hsp70 in HBV capsid assembly with Hsp90 have not been studied so far. Using microscale thermophoresis analyses and in vitro nucleocapsid formation assays, we found that Hsp70 bound to a HBV core protein dimer and facilitated HBV capsid assembly. Inhibition of Hsp70 by methylene blue (MB) led to a decrease in capsid assembly. Moreover, Hsp70 inhibition reduced intracellular capsid formation and HBV virus particle number in HepG2.2.15 cells. Furthermore, we examined synergism between Hsp70 and Hsp90 on HBV capsid formation in vitro. Our results clarify the role of Hsp70 in HBV capsid formation via an interaction with core dimers and in synergistically promoting capsid assembly with Hsp90.
