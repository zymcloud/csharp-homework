Infection by chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the major causes of liver cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Viral DNA integration into the host cell genome is a key mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the molecular characterization and the potential clinical implications of HBV DNA integration into patients suffering from different hepatitis and HCC remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed HBV integrations in patients with hepatitis B and HCC using HBV probe-based capturing and next-generation sequencing. The results revealed that the sizes of the HBV integrations ranged from 28 bp to 3215 bp, including the full-length HBV DNA sequence. The integration breakpoints were preferentially distributed in the viral enhancer, X protein, and core protein regions of the HBV genome. The number of HBV integrations followed an increasing trend from hepatitis to HCC, which was positively correlated with the HBV virus load in patients with hepatitis. The number of HBV integrations in the HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B group was significantly greater than that in the other hepatitis B groups (P FSHB (follicle stimulating hormone beta subunit; DFS P = 0.05, OS P = 0.186), and LPHN3 (latrophilin-3; DFS P = 0.493, OS P = 0.033). This study determined the underlying mechanism of HBV DNA integration in liver diseases and laid the foundation for future studies on the pathogenesis of liver cancer.
