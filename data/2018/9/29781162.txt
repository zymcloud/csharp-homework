Current guidelines recommend ultrasound (US) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance in cirrhosis. We assess predictors of decreased US sensitivity for detecting HCC. At a single center in the United States, all HCC patients evaluated for liver transplantation (LT) received an abdominal US. From 2007-2015, consecutive patients presenting for untreated lesions found on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 3 months of US were compared with US findings. Multivariate logistic regression models compared US sensitivities by patient characteristics. Of 1007 patients completing LT evaluation, 47.5% had indeterminate or previously treated nodules and were excluded; 10.4% had imaging that was too far apart or nondiagnostic. Median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) of the cohort (n= 352) was 11 (interquartile range [IQR], 9-14), median body mass index (BMI) was 28 kg/m2 (IQR, 25-32 kg/m2 ), 39% had received locoregional therapy, and 10% had moderate/large ascites. Per-patient sensitivity of US compared with CT/MRI was 0.82 (95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.86). Patients with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 had a US sensitivity of 0.76 versus 0.87 for BMI < 30 kg/m2 (P = 0.01). MELD and ascites did not affect sensitivity. US sensitivity was decreased in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) versus other etiologies (0.59 versus 0.84; P = 0.02). Relative to CT/MRI, US is significantly less sensitive in patients with NASH or BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 . Further study is necessary to examine the added value of cross-sectional imaging for patients with NASH or obesity.
