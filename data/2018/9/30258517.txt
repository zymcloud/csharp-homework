Portal vein thrombosis is an uncommon finding that typically arises in the context of cirrhosis. In the acute setting, it may present with abdominal pain, portal hypertension, ascites, gastrointestinal bleeding, or mesenteric ischemia. Local risk factors that predispose its formation include: cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatitis, and intraabdominal infection. Systemic factors, including hypercoagulable states and sepsis, also pose an increased risk. JAK2 V617F positive myeloproliferative disorders are associated with systemic prothrombotic states and are a less frequently identified cause of portal vein thrombosis. We present a case of acute unprovoked portal vein thrombosis diagnosed in a 59-year-old male without local disease factors. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and ultrasound demonstrated the presence of portal vein thrombosis with neighboring periportal and pancreatic head edema. Peripheral blood testing detected the presence of JAK2 V617F mutation. The patient was discharged on 6-month anticoagulation therapy and outpatient follow-up.
