Previous studies have revealed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) function as crucial regulators in various biological processes, including tumorigenesis. Although the expression of lncRNA TP73-antisense RNA1 (AS1) has been identified in hepatocellular carcinoma and glioma, the biological function of TP73-AS1 in gastric cancer (GC) remains unclear. Thus, the present study employed a comprehensive analysis on the function of lncRNA TP73-AS1 in GC. The aim of the present study was to determine the clinical significance and biological function of TP73-AS1 in human GC tissues and cells. Additionally, the expression of TP73-AS1 was increased in GC tissues and cell lines and increased expression level of TP73-AS1 was associated with poor prognosis in patients with GC. Functional assays revealed that silencing of TP73-AS1 may suppress cell proliferation and enhance the chemotherapeutic response of GC cells to cisplatin through targeting the high mobility group 1/receptor for advanced glycation endproducts signaling pathway. Collectively, the results of the present study demonstrated that TP73-AS1 may be a novel lncRNA for the clinical prognosis of GC and a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of GC.
