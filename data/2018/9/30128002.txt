Liver cancer is often associated with chronic liver diseases. Treatment with percutaneous irreversible electroporation (IRE) may preserve liver function. In the present study, the clinical data of 29 patients with liver tumors between July 2015 and December 2016, all of whom underwent liver IRE at Fuda Cancer Hospital, Guangzhou, China was retrospectively reviewed. All the patients survived the treatment. Of the 29 patients, 7 were positive for hepatitis B, 15 had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 7 had pancreatic cancer with liver metastases. All patients survived IRE. Despite liver-protective treatment prior to IRE, the mean alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels were significantly elevated 1-2 days after IRE, to 540 and 712 U/l, respectively; however they had returned to the preoperative values by 2 weeks following IRE. Prior to IRE, the mean total bilirubin and direct bilirubin measurement levels were normal; however, 8-10 days after IRE, they had increased to 24 U/l and 12 µmol/l, respectively, and had returned back to the preoperative levels by 2 weeks after IRE. This first group included all patients. The result of the 4 subgroups of cancer patients demonstrated a variation between different measurement days and recovery with patients positive for the hepatitis B virus taking the longest duration to recover (17±3 days) meanwhile patients with pancreatic cancer with liver metastases took the shortest time to achieve recovery (10.78±2 days). The findings of the present study indicate that hepatic injury caused by IRE is transient and self-limiting in patients with liver tumors.
