Background:Assessing hepatic functional reserve before hepatectomy is beneficial to reduce the incidence of posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF). This study aimed to compare the ability of the Child-Pugh score, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, and retention test at 15 minutes (indocyanine green [ICG]-R15) to assess hepatic functional reserve.Methods:A total of 185 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing hepatectomy were enrolled in this study. The ability of Child-Pugh score, MELD score, and ICG-R15 predicting severe PHLF were compared.Results:A total of 23 patients (12.4%) developed severe PHLF. Multivariate analyses identified that platelet count, ICG-R15, clinically significant portal hypertension, and major resection were independent factors for predicting severe PHLF. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of ICG-R15 for predicting severe PHLF was higher than that of both Child-Pugh score and MELD score. With an optimal cutoff value of 7.1%, the sensitivity and specificity of ICG-R15 for predicting severe PHLF were 52.2% and 89.5%, respectively. Both the incidence of severe PHLF and mortality in patients with ICG-R15 >7.1% were significantly higher than the figures for patients with ICG-R15 â‰¤7.1%.Conclusion:ICG-R15 is more accurate than the Child-Pugh score and MELD score in predicting hepatic functional reserve before hepatectomy.
