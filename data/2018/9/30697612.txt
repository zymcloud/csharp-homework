Background and aim:A reliable classification for predicting postoperative prognosis and perioperative risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is required to make a precise decision for HCC treatment. In the present study, we assessed the perioperative and prognostic importance of indocyanine green (ICG) testing, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade, and ALBI-TNM (ALBI-T) score using consecutive resected HCC cases.Methods:Between 1998 and 2011, 273 consecutive patients who underwent primary and curative hepatectomy for HCC were identified. Among these 273 cases, 235 Child-Pugh class A patients were enrolled in the present study.Results:Correlation analysis showed that the value of linear predictor for ALBI grade was significantly correlated with ICG 15-minute retention rates (r = 0.51, P < 0.0001). Survival analysis for both recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) showed there were significant differences between the two groups stratified by stage or ALBI-T score (stage, RFS: P = 0.01, OS: P = 0.003; ALBI-T, RFS: P < 0.0001, OS: P < 0.0001). In addition, Cox proportional hazard model identified ALBI-T score was a significant predictor for both RFS and OS (RFS, P = 0.001; OS, P = 0.004). Furthermore, ALBI-T score could predict perioperative risk in hepatectomy such as longer operation time and excessive intraoperative blood loss.Conclusions:This study showed a robust association of ALBI-T score with postoperative HCC patient survival and perioperative risk in hepatectomy. ALBI-T score can be used as a simple and powerful tool for assessing HCC patients with further study.
