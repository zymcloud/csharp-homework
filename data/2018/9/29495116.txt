Background & aims:The European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria and the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors are used for assessing the treatment outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma. We investigated the inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of the European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria and modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with sorafenib.Methods:A total of 99 patients with treatment-naive advanced hepatocellular carcinoma receiving sorafenib were included. The κ-values for the inter- and intra-observer agreement of the treatment response were calculated.Results:Inter-observer agreement for baseline tumour number was excellent, as reflected by the high κ-value. The κ-statistics showed "excellent" concordance between the 2 sets of measurements by observer A regarding the overall responses using the European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria (κ = .948, agreement rate = 84.8%) and modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (κ = .944, agreement rate = 83.8%; all P .8) were obtained.Conclusions:The reproducibility of the European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria and modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors in assessing treatment outcomes was high in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with sorafenib.
