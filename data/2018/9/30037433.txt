Accumulating evidence suggest that dysregulated expression of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays a critical role in human tumorigenesis. However, little is known about the lncRNA implicated in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. In this study, we performed data mining in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) data set and identified the a spectrum of differentially expressed lncRNAs implicated the EMT process of HCC, and functionally validated their roles in LM3 cells. Especially, lncRNA WDFY3-AS2-, LINC00472-, MIAT-, and MEG3-associated genes were significantly enriched in EMT-linked pathways. Loss-of-function study showed that genetic silencing of WDFY3-AS3, MIAT, and MEG3, but not LINC00472, resulted in reduced N-cadherin expression, cell migration, and cell invasion. Collectively, our results identify several lncRNAs that regulate the EMT process of HCC, which provides critical information for HCC tumorigenesis and potential therapeutic targets.
