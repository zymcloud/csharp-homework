Linc-POU3F3 showed an up-regulated tendency and functioned as tumor promoter in glioma, esophageal cancer and colorectal cancer. There was no report about the expression pattern and clinical value of linc-POU3F3 in hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, the purpose of our study is to explore the clinical significance and biological role of linc-POU3F3 in hepatocellular carcinoma. Our results suggested that levels of linc-POU3F3 were dramatically increased in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and cell lines compared with paired normal hepatic tissues and normal hepatic cell line, respectively. Levels of linc-POU3F3 were positively correlated with clinical stage, tumor size, vascular invasion and metastasis. Moreover, high-expression of linc-POU3F3 was an independent prognostic factor for hepatocellular carcinoma patients. The gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that linc-POU3F3 expression significantly promoted tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In addition, linc-POU3F3 expression was negatively correlated with POU3F3 mRNA and protein expressions in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, and negatively regulated POU3F3 mRNA and protein expressions in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In conclusion, our study supports the first evidence that linc-POU3F3 plays an oncogenic role in hepatocellular carcinoma, and represents a potential therapeutic strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
