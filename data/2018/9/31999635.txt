Introduction:Viral genotype and variation in host genes involved in the immune response may predict the treatment response in patients infected with HCV. The present study was designed to determine the distribution pattern of HCV and host genotypes in Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) patients and their association with virological response and other risk factors.Methodology:Two hundred and fifty (n = 250) HCV positive patients were included in the study. HCV and Interleukin 28B (IL28B) genotyping was carried out by PCR-RFLP.Results:Viral genotype 3 was the predominant genotype seen in 187 (74.8%) patients. Wild genotype predominated in rs12979860, rs12980275 and rs8099917 SNP of IL28B gene. A significant difference was found in end stage virological response (EVR) between HCV genotype 1 infected patients with wild and variant genotype for rs12980275 and rs8099917 SNPs respectively (P Conclusions:The viral genotype and IL28B polymorphisms are important factors to personalize antiviral therapy of patients with CHC.
