Liver cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in China, ranking fifth in malignant tumors and the third in tumor-related deaths. As a membrane-related protein, the asymmetric distribution of cell fate determinant Numb plays a key role in cell differentiation. Research reports that Numb may be closely associated to the occurrence and development of tumors. Recently, scholars have gradually valued its important role in liver cancer. This article briefly reviews the structure of Numb molecule, relationship between Numb and tumorigenesis, the molecular mechanism of Numb-regulated tumors, and the role of Numb in the development of liver cancer.
