Rho GTPase activating protein 9 (ARHGAP9), a member of RhoGAP family, has been identified as a RhoGAP for Cdc42 and Rac1. Here, we aimed to clarify the expression and functional role of ARHGAP9 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). By analyzing TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) LIHC (liver hepatocellular carcinoma) database, we found that ARHGAP9 expression was lower in HCC tissues than in normal liver tissues, and that patients with ARHGAP9 lower expression had a significant shorter overall survival time than those with ARHGAP9 higher expression. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), transwell assays and in vivo experimental lung metastasis assay revealed that ARHGAP9 overexpression could inhibit HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as HCC lung metastases. By next-generation RNA-sequencing, we identified that a transcription factor, Forkhead Box J2 (FOXJ2), was significantly induced by ARHGAP9 overexpression in HepG2 cells. Ectopic expression of FOXJ2 in HCC cell lines also exerted inhibitory effects on cell migration and invasion. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of ARHGAP9 on HCC cell migration and invasion was significantly attenuated by FOXJ2 knockdown. Luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that ARHGAP9 enhanced the transcription of E-cadherin (CDH1) via FOXJ2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay demonstrated that FOXJ2 modulated the transcription of E-cadherin (CDH1) by directly binding to its promoter. Furthermore, Pearson's correlation analysis indicated that the mRNA levels of ARHGAP9 in HCC tissues were positively correlated with the mRNA levels of FOXJ2 and CDH1. These data clearly show that ARHGAP9/FOXJ2 inhibit cell migration and invasion during HCC development via inducing the transcription of CDH1.
