The evolutive profile of inactive HBV carriers is variable. Patients can remain inactive, or may evolve into chronic active hepatitis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Aim: to describe the long-term outcome of chronic hepatitis B inactive carriers followed at HÃ´pital Principal de Dakar. This is a retrospective study including all inactive HBV carriers, followed since 2001, and with regular monitoring of at least 5 years. Transaminases, viral load and screening for hepatocellular carcinoma were performed every 6 to 12 months. We included 52 patients. The mean follow-up was 76.2 months (60-162), the mean age 36 years (13-62 years) and the sex ratio 0.93 (25 men, 27 women). Four patients (7.7%) had an ALT above the normal. Eleven patients (21.1%) had persistently elevated viral load greater than 2000 IU/ml, while in three cases (5.8%), this increase was transient. Twenty-six patients (50%) had a detectable viral load, but still below 2000 IU/ml. Twelve patients (23.1%) had an undetectable viral load for the duration of monitoring. Eleven patients (21.2%) underwent liver biopsy. The activity or fibrosis were minimal in all cases (A or F = 1) or absent (A or F = 0). Only four patients (7.7%), had HBs seroconversion after a follow-up of six, seven and ten years. There was no focal lesion or cirrhosis detected during the follow-up. After a follow-up of at least 5 years, inactive HBV carriers remain inactive in 92.3% of cases. Their evolutive profile is characterized by an absence of elevated liver enzymes but with fluctuations of the viral load. HBs seroconversion rate is low and the risk of progression to hepatocellular carcinoma almost nil.
