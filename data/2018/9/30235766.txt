This study is to investigate quantitative measures and heterogeneity of perfusion parameters in the differential diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hemangioma.In total, 32 HCC and 44 hemangioma (types 1, 2, and 3) cases were included in this retrospective study. Hepatic artery coefficient (HAC), portal vein coefficient (PVC), and arterial enhancement fraction (AEF) were calculated. Tumor heterogeneity was analyzed. Perfusion parameters and corresponding percentiles were compared between the HCC and hemangioma (especially atypical hemangioma) cases, as well as between the substantial lesion part and surrounding normal tissue.The mean value, and the 10th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of PVC were significantly lower in the HCC cases than the types 1 and 2 hemangioma cases (P .05).Quantitative measurement of perfusion parameters and heterogeneity analysis show significance differences in the early detection and differential diagnosis of HCC and hemangioma cases, which might contribute to increasing the diagnostic accuracy.
