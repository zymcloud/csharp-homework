Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection is a complex clinical entity that has an estimated worldwide prevalence of 1-15%. Most clinical studies have shown that progression of disease is faster in HBV-HCV coinfected patients compared to those with monoinfection. Hepatocellular carcinoma development appears to have higher rate in coinfections. Viral replication in coinfected cells is characterized by a dominance of HCV over HBV replication. There are no established guidelines for treatment of HBV-HCV coinfection. Studies on interferon-based therapies and direct-acting antivirals have shown varying levels of efficacy. Clinical reports have indicated that treatment of HCV without suppression of HBV increases the risk for HBV reactivation. In this review, we appraise studies on both direct-acting antivirals and interferon-based therapies to evaluate the efficacy and rates of reactivation with each regimen. Screening for and prevention of coinfection are important to prevent serious HBV reactivations.
