Growing evidence suggests that aberrant microRNA (miRNA) expression contributes to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and progression. However, the potential role and mechanism of miR-665 in the progression of liver cancer remains largely unknown. Our current study showed that miR-665 expression was upregulated in HCC cells and tissues. High expression of miR-665 exhibited more severe tumor size, vascular invasion and Edmondson grading in HCC patients. Gain- or loss-of-function assays demonstrated that miR-665 promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Tyrosine phosphatase receptor type B (PTPRB) was downregulated in HCC tissues, and was negatively correlated with miR-665 expression. Through western blotting and luciferase reporter assay, PTPRB was identified as a direct downstream target of miR-665. Restoration of PTPRB reverses the effects of miR-665 on HCC migration, invasion, and cell proliferation. A mechanistic study showed that PTPTRB mediated the functional role of miR-665 through regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway. In conclusion, our results suggested that miR-665 was a negative regulator of the PTPRB and could promote tumor proliferation and metastasis in HCC through decreasing Hippo signaling pathway activity, which can be a potential target for HCC treatment.
