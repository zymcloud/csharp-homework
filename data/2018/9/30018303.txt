Despite highly effective and well-tolerated regimens for treating hepatitis C virus (HCV), patients face barriers in accessing treatment. In addition to suboptimal HCV screening programs and lack of effective linkage-to-care, other barriers include strict requirements from some payers to cover treatment. This study reports insurance status and Hispanic ethnicity as predictors of not receiving treatment. These barriers occur despite the fact that HCV is the most common indication for liver transplantation and cause of hepatocellular carcinoma in the U.S. Therefore, it is critical that policymakers bring all the stakeholders together and develop a national policy to eradicate HCV infection from the U.S.
