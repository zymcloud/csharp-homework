Corticotropin releasing hormone binding protein (CRHBP) mediates the reaction between corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and corticotropin releasing hormone receptors (CRHRs). It is expressed in a number of organs, and the expression of CRHBP is associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression. The aim of the present study was to investigate CRHBP expression levels in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its association with patient clinicopathological characteristics as well as prognosis. The expression of CRHBP was examined by immunohistochemistry in 169 HCC tissues and 151 adjacent non-tumorous tissues. The results were validated by western blotting using patient tissues and liver cancer cell lines. The association of CRHBP expression with clinicopathological patient characteristics and survival rate was analyzed statistically. Expression of CRHBP was detected in 142/151 (94.0%) non-tumorous liver tissues, and 84/169 (49.7%) HCC tissues (P
