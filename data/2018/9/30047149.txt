Background:The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with a history of curatively-treated HCC is higher than in patients with no history of HCC even after sustained virologic response (SVR).Aim:To investigate differences in the patterns of HCC development after SVR in patients with a history of curatively-treated HCC and those with no history of HCC, based on gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI) findings.Methods:EOB-MRI was performed in 164 patients with HCV cirrhosis who achieved SVR by interferon-free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy just before the start of therapy. Changes in EOB-MRI findings after SVR were compared prospectively between patients with (n = 62) and without (n = 102) a history of HCC.Results:The incidence of HCC after SVR was higher in patients with a history of HCC (P Conclusion:Direct emergence of hypervascular HCC and a higher prevalence of NHHNs before DD therapy contributed to the higher incidence of HCC after SVR.
