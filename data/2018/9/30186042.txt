Background:Recent studies have suggested that B7-H6, a new member of the B7 family of ligands, not only is a crucial regulator of NK cell-mediated immune responses but also has important clinical implications due to its abnormal expression in many human cancers. We have previously reported that higher B7-H6 expression levels in ovarian cancer tissues are positively correlated with tumor metastasis and cancer progression. To date, the expression of B7-H6 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the clinical significance of B7-H6 expression still remain elusive.Methods:In the present study, the expression level of B7-H6 was examined in both HCC tissues and HCC cell lines (HepG2 and SMMC-7721). And the clinical significance of B7-H6 was analyzed as well.Results:Our results revealed that B7-H6 was expressed abnormally in HCC tissues, which was greatly related to tumor size. The TCGA data also showed that the B7-H6 mRNA expression level was significantly negatively correlated with the survival of HCC patients. Next, to investigate the functions of B7-H6 in HCC, we successfully constructed B7-H6 knockdown expression human HCC cell lines using the RNA interference technology. Our studies showed that reduced expression of B7-H6 in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells significantly attenuated cell proliferation as well as cell migration and invasion. Besides, depletion of B7-H6 greatly induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. And also B7-H6 knockdown in HCC cell lines dramatically decreased the C-myc, C-fos and Cyclin-D1 expression.Conclusions:Our present findings suggested that B7-H6 played an important role in oncogenesis of HCC on cellular level, and B7-H6 could be employed to develop immunotherapeutic approaches targeting this malignancy.
