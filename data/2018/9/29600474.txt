Objectives:To compare combined percutaneous radiofrequency ablation and ethanol injection (RFA-PEI) with hepatic resection (HR) in the treatment of resectable solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with 2.1-5.0 cm diameter.Methods:From June 2009 to December 2015, 271 patients whom underwent RFA-PEI (n = 141) or HR (n = 130) in three centres were enrolled. The overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) between groups were compared with Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests. Complications, hospital stay and cost were assessed.Results:The OS rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 93.5%, 72.7%, 58.6% in RFA-PEI group and 82.3%, 57.5%, 51.8% in HR group (p = 0.021). The corresponding 1-, 3- and 5-year RFS rates were 65.8%, 41.3%, 34.3% in RFA-PEI group and 50.5%, 33.8%, 28.4% in HR group (p = 0.038). For patients with 2.1-3.0 cm tumours, the 1-, 3- and 5-year OS after RFA-PEI and HR were 98.0%, 82.3%, 74.2% and 89.4%, 65.1%, 61.9%, respectively (p = 0.024). The corresponding RFS were 79.6%, 54.7%, 45.1% in RFA-PEI group, and 57.6%, 43.9%, 31.7% in HR group, respectively (p = 0.020). RFA-PEI was superior to HR in major complication rates, length of hospital stay and cost (all p Conclusion:RFA-PEI had a survival benefit over HR in the treatment of solitary HCCs, especially for those with 2.1-3.0 cm in diameter.Key points:• RFA-PEI provided superior survival to HR in solitary HCC with 2.1-5.0 cm in diameter. • RFA-PEI is superior to HR in complications, length of hospital stay and cost. • RFA-PEI might be an alternative treatment for solitary HCC within 5.0 cm in diameter.
