Objectives:To assess safety and efficacy of 90Y resin microspheres administration using undiluted non-ionic contrast material (UDCM) {100% Omnipaque-300 (Iohexol)} in both the "B" and "D" lines.Materials and methods:We reviewed all colorectal cancer liver metastases patients treated with 90Y resin microspheres radioembolization (RAE) from 2009 to 2017. As of April 2013, two experienced operators started using UDCM (study group) instead of standard sandwich infusion (control group). Occurrence of myelosuppression (leukopenia, neutropenia, erythrocytopenia or/and thrombocytopenia), stasis, nontarget delivery (NTD), median fluoroscopy radiation dose (FRD), median infusion time (IT), liver progression-free (LPFS) and overall survivals (OS) was evaluated. Complications within 6 months post-RAE were reported according to CTCAE v3.0 criteria.Results:Study and control groups comprised 23(28%) and 58(72%) patients, respectively. Median follow-up was 9.1 months. There was no statistically significant difference in myelosuppression incidence within 6 months post-RAE between groups. Median FRD and IT for study and control groups were 44.6 vs. 97.35 Gy/cm2 (p = 0.048) and 31 vs. 39 min (p = 0.006), respectively. A 38% lower stasis incidence in study group was not significant (p = 0.34). NTD occurred in 1/27(4%) study vs. 5/73(7%) control group procedures (p = 1). Grade 1-2 and grade 3-4 toxicities between study and control group patients were 36%(8/22) vs. 45%(26/58), p = 0.61 and 9%(2/22) vs. 16%(9/58), p = 0.72, respectively. There was no difference in LPFS and OS between groups.Conclusion:Administration of 90Y resin microspheres using UDCM in both lines is safe and effective, resulting in lower fluoroscopy radiation dose and shorter infusion time, without evidence of myelosuppression or increased stasis incidence.
