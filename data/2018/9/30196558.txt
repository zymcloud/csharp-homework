Introduction:Quality/core measures have been collected for over 10 years. Studies have demonstrated hospital performance is related to postoperative outcomes. We hypothesize that hospital quality measures are associated with long-term survival following surgical resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The National Cancer Data Base was queried for all HCC cases. Individual hospitals were deidentified. Quality markers were defined as hospital-specific median length of stay (LOS), 30-day mortality rate and readmit rate. A Cox regression stratified by stage estimated survival. To minimize confounding, a landmark analysis was estimated for patients that survived greater than 30 days.Results:A total of 16 202 HCC patients underwent surgical resection and 996 (6.1%) died within 30 days following surgery. Calculated by unique hospital, median 30-day death rate was 4.6% (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.2% to 7.6%). Thirty-day readmit rate was 2.6% (IQR: 0% to 5.9%) and median LOS was 8.0 days (IQR: 6.5 to 9.2). In the multivariate Cox regression, 30-day death rate (hazard ratio [HR], 1.89; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.32 to 2.71) and longer LOS (HR, 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.02) were associated with worse survival. Higher 30-day readmission rate was associated with improved survival (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.97).Conclusions:Hospital-level surrogate markers of surgical quality appear to be significantly associated with HCC survival following resection. Patients treated in higher 30-day mortality centers, experienced worse outcomes. Individual hospitals should critically review disease-specific outcomes following resection to identify areas for improvement.
