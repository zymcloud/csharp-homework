Purpose:This study aimed to explore serum lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) levels and investigate their prognostic value in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after curative resection.Materials and methods:One cohort of 102 healthy individuals, one cohort of 172 HCC patients, and one cohort of 171 HCC patients undergoing curative resection were studied to evaluate serum Lp(a) levels and their prognostic significance, using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests.Results:The Lp(a) levels in HCC patients were significantly lower than those in healthy individuals. Furthermore, the levels in HCC patients were significantly associated with recurrence. HCC patients were stratified into high Lp(a) (>20 mg/L) and low Lp(a) (≤20 mg/L) groups, using an optimal cutoff point for the Lp(a) of 20 mg/L. Low Lp(a) levels significantly correlated with tumor recurrence and survival time; HCC patients with low Lp(a) levels had higher recurrence rates and shorter survival time than those with high Lp(a) levels; Lp(a) was an independent prognostic factor for relapse-free survival and overall survival, and retained its prognostic value for α-fetoprotein ≤400 ng/mL and tumor size ≤5 cm subgroups in the training and validation cohorts.Conclusion:Lp(a) was a promising and useful marker for assessing and monitoring recurrence and prognosis of patients with HCC, and improving Lp(a) levels may be a promising therapeutic strategy in HCC patients.
