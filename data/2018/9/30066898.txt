Long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) offer great potential as cancer biomarkers. Owing to the limited sensitivity and specificity of α‑fetoprotein (AFP) for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the present study used an lncRNA microarray to screen aberrantly expressed lncRNAs in HCC tissues. Subsequently, the expression profile of the target lncRNAs was investigated in plasma from patients with HCC or hepatitis B virus‑positive chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis (HCH), as well as from healthy volunteers. A total of six aberrantly expressed lncRNAs were identified in HCC tissues and corresponding normal tissues, from which only small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (SNHG1) expression in HCC tissues demonstrated a good correlation with those in plasma from HCC patients. Subsequent analysis revealed that high plasma SNHG1 expression levels were correlated with tumor size, TNM stage and AFP levels. Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that SNHG1 yields an excellent diagnostic ability to differentiate between patients with HCC and unaffected control patients, which was superior to that of AFP. The combination of SNHG1 with AFP may be able to distinguish HCC from HCH or healthy volunteers with the area under the curve values of 0.86 and 0.97, respectively. In summary, it was demonstrated that plasma SNHG1 has great potential as a sensitive and reliable biomarker for the diagnosis of HCC.
