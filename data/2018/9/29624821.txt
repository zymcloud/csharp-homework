There is no consensus about factors that increase risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with chronic hepatitis B who have achieved seroclearance of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). To assess the available evidence about risk factors for HCC after HBsAg seroclearance, Scopus, EMBASE, PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched for relevant studies published through 15 September 2017. A total of 28 studies involving more than 105 411 patients with chronic hepatitis B were included. HBsAg seroclearance occurred spontaneously in 7656, while it occurred after interferon or nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy in 1248. The rate of HBsAg seroclearance was 6.77%. Incidence of HCC was significantly lower among patients who experienced HBsAg seroclearance than among those who remained HBsAg-positive (1.86% vs 6.56%, P
