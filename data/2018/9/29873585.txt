Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of disease, including hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. NAFLD carries the risk of progression to cirrhosis with its associated complications and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is now the most common liver disease in the Western world and its prevalence is increasing. While the association between NAFLD and type 2 diabetes has been well documented, there is significantly less understanding of the pathophysiology and progression of NAFLD in patients with other endocrine disorders affecting metabolism in various ways. Some of the more common endocrine disorders such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, hypothyroidism, and hypogonadism are known in clinical practice to be associated with NAFLD. Medications that alter the endocrine system such as tamoxifen and adrenal steroids have also been attributed to significant NAFLD. The key to management of NAFLD at this time are dietary changes and exercise to achieve weight loss. Unfortunately, a large proportion of the patients with these endocrine disorders are unable to achieve either. This review aims to examine and summarize the current published literature that have evaluated the association between NAFLD and the above endocrine disorders and potential therapeutic interventions in each case.
