Introduction:Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication in cancer patients, and is associated with worse prognosis in such population. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) poses high risk for VTE; however, data is scarce regarding the characteristics and consequences of VTE in HCC patients.Method:We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records (EMR) of 270 patients diagnosed with HCC from 2000 to 2015 in Cook County Health and Hospitals System. We report the cumulative incidence of VTE in the present cohort, and identified through multivariate logistic regression the independent risk factors of the development of VTE. Overall prognosis of patients with and without VTE were presented and compared.Results:Sixteen cases (5.93%) of VTE were documented in the present study. In multivariate analysis, obesity, Child B cirrhosis, intra-hepatic lesions more than 3, and multi-organ extrahepatic metastasis were significantly associated with VTE development (p Conclusions:Obesity, Child B cirrhosis, more intra-hepatic lesions, and multi-organ extrahepatic metastasis are associated with cancer-associated VTE. VTE will adversely affect the prognosis of patients with HCC; therefore, primary thromboprophylaxis may be warranted in such population.
