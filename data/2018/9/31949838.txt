Human hepatocytes are a primary site of infection and replication of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). It is tempting to conclude that tissue specificity is controlled via virus-hepatocyte specific interactions at various steps during the viral lifecycle. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatotropism of HBV are not fully clear. To address this issue, this study aims to identify hepatic factors that contribute to the regulation of the lifecycles of hepatitis viruses- especially HBV- and to clarify their regulatory mechanisms. We established oval-like cell lines (Hdo cells) by introducing a set of reprogramming factors (OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, LIN28, and NANOG) into human hepatoma HuH7 cells that are susceptible to HBV. Hdo cells exhibit a bi-directional differentiation potential. We found that Hdo cells maintained support for the replication of HBV but not of HCV. The level of particle-associated HBV DNA secreted into the culture medium was higher in the Hdo cells. Still, the HBs antigen level was lower than in parental HuH7 cells, suggesting that the regulation of HBV gene expression was affected by the reprogramming of HuH7 cells. A microarray analysis determined that the expression of host factors was largely comparable among of HuH7 and Hdo cells. In contrast, Hdo cells lost their susceptibility to HCV infection and to replication of the viral subgenome replicon RNA. Our results suggest that epigenetic reprogramming of human hepatoma cells potentially changes their permissivity to HBV. Furthermore, Hdo cells can be used as powerful tools to identify cellular determinants that change their expression during reprogramming or hepatic differentiation.
