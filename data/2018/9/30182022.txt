Purpose:This study was designed to analyze factors related to the success of salvage liver transplantation (SLT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While liver resection (LR) is considered the best locoregional therapy in HCC, there is a high recurrence rate. SLT may be the best treatment option when feasible.Methods:Patients who underwent living donor SLT for recurrent HCC after LR from November 1996 to May 2017 were included. Patient demographic data, clinical and pathologic characteristics, operative data, hospital course, and follow-up data regarding initial LR, locoregional therapy after recurrence and SLT were reviewed. Prognostic factors for recurrence were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard ratio.Results:Eighty-five of 123 SLT patients were included. Patients who had five or more locoregional therapies prior to SLT (hazard ratio [HR], 3.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45-9.64, P = 0.006), hepatitis B (HR, 9.20; 95% CI, 1.13-74.89; P = 0.04), outside Milan criteria at the time of SLT (HR, 2.66, 95% CI, 1.26-5.63; P = 0.011) and an alpha-fetoprotein level above 1,000 ng/mL at the time of recurrence after initial LR (HR, 6.48; 95% CI, 1.83-22.92; P = 0.004) and at the time of transplantation (HR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.26-5.63; P = 0.011) were related to significant risk of recurrence.Conclusion:Continuing five or more locoregional therapies for recurrent HCC after LR is related to poor recurrence-free survival after SLT.
