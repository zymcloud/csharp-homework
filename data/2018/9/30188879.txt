BACKGROUND Allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1) is a cytoplasmic protein cloned from activated macrophages in human and rat allografts. AIF-1 has been identified as a modulator of inflammatory response, and recently published studies have shown its increased expression in carcinogenesis. However, there are still limited data on the potential functional role of AIF-1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIAL AND METHODS We evaluated the expression of AIF-1 in 104 cases of paired HCC and adjacent non-cancerous liver tissues using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and qPCR analysis, and sought to determine whether its expression was correlated with clinicopathological features. In vitro assays, including cell proliferation and migration assays, were used to study the effects of AIF-1 knockdown in L02 human hepatocyte, and Huh7 and SMMC7721 liver cancer cell lines. RESULTS Expression of AIF-1 was increased in HCC compared to adjacent normal liver tissues and was positively correlated with median tumor size (p=0.046), number of tumor deposits (p=0.009), the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage (p=0.004), and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) (p
