Purpose:To assess the added value of intratumoral ancillary features to conventional enhancement pattern-based diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Materials and methods:A total of 773 consecutive patients with surgically resected 773 primary hepatic tumors (699 HCCs, 63 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, and 11 benign nodules) who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI were retrospectively identified. Enhancement patterns and three ancillary features of capsule, septum, and T2 spotty hyperintensity were assessed by two radiologists. Performance of enhancement pattern-based diagnosis of HCC was compared to diagnosis of HCC based on enhancement pattern plus ancillary features.Results:Enhancement patterns were positive (arterial diffuse hyperenhancement with washout) for 562 (72.7%) tumors, negative (no arterial hyperenhancement and no washout) for 75 (9.7%), and inconclusive (either no arterial hyperenhancement or no washout) for 136 (17.6%). Capsule was observed in 498 (64.4%) tumors, septum in 521 (67.3%), and T2 spotty hyperintensity in 107 (13.8%). The accuracy and sensitivity of HCC diagnosis was improved significantly after adding at least one ancillary feature compared with enhancement pattern-based diagnosis of HCCs (79.9% vs. 91.1% for accuracy, p Conclusion:Adding intratumoral ancillary features of capsule, septum and T2 spotty hyperintensity to conventional enhancement patterns on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI improved accuracy and sensitivity, while maintaining specificity for HCC diagnosis.
