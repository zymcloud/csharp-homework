Objective:To evaluate the accuracy of CT for small, hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and assess the enhancement patterns on CT.Materials and methods:Ninety-nine patients who underwent cone-beam CT hepatic arteriography (CBCT-HA) during initial chemoembolization for HCC suspected on CT were enrolled in this study. A total of 297 hypervascular HCCs (142 ≥ 1 cm, 155 Results:For the 297 HCCs, the enhancement patterns according to size were as follows: type I ≥1 cm in 114 HCCs; type I Conclusion:Many subcentimeter sized hypervascular HCCs were frequently missed or not evident on CT at the initial diagnostic workup. CT has limitations for diagnosing HCCs that are
