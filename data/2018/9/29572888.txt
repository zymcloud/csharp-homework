Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. PRDI-BF1 and RIZ homology domain containing 8 (PRDM8) is a key regulator in neural development and testis steroidogenesis; however, its role in liver carcinogenesis remains to be investigated. In this study, PRDM8 was found to be down-regulated in HCC, which was linked with shorter recurrence-free survival. Lentiviral-based overexpression and knockdown approaches showed that PRDM8 inhibited HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. PRDM8 caused G1/S cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis. An in vivo tumor model confirmed the antitumor role of PRDM8 in HCC growth and metastasis. Mechanistic study showed that PRDM8 suppressed the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascade through the regulation of nucleosome assembly protein 1-like 1 (NAP1L1). Conclusion: PRDM8 as a functional tumor suppressor is frequently down-regulated in HCC. Through regulating NAP1L1, PRDM8 inhibits PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in HCC. PRDM8 is a potential target for therapies of HCC. (Hepatology 2018).
