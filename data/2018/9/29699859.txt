Background:Hepatectomy with a sufficient margin is often impossible for hepatocellular carcinomas that are close to the large intrahepatic vascular structures, and macroscopically complete resection along the tumor capsule is the only choice. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical significance of macroscopic no-margin hepatectomy (MNMH).Methods:Among patients undergoing macroscopically curative resection for untreated hepatocellular carcinoma, outcomes were compared between patients undergoing MNMH (n = 87) and those undergoing hepatectomy with a macroscopic margin (n = 192).Results:MNMH was significantly associated with a longer operation time (P Discussion:MNMH is technically demanding and results more frequently in a microscopically positive surgical margin, however, it can yield a long-term outcome comparable to hepatectomy with a macroscopic margin even in patients with otherwise unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.
