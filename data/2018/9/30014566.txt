Recent evidence highlighted that the accurate assessment of liver fibrosis is important for evaluating the progression of chronic liver disease. During the past decade, many non-invasive methods have been developed to reduce the need for core-needle biopsy in fibrosis staging and to overcome its limitations, such as invasiveness, high cost, low reproducibility, and poor patient consent. The diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is promising for use in clinical practice to evaluate not only liver fibrosis, but also survival and major clinical end-points such as liver decompensation, portal hypertension, development of hepatocellular carcinoma, and surgical outcomes. Together with other clinical markers, MRE can be used to better categorize patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, and assign them to different classes of risk for significant clinical outcomes. This review discusses clinical applications of MRE in the management strategy of patients with chronic liver disease.
