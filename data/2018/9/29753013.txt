In recent years, actively targeted drug delivery systems have been utilized in pre-clinical studies for site-specific delivery of drugs, which reduces toxicities associated with chemotherapy. This study reports the preparation of the tumor homing ligand, transferrin (Tf) anchored methoxy-polyethylene glycol-poly(d,l-Lactide) polymeric micelles (Tf-PP). Curcumin which possess wide anti-cancer activity was loaded into the micelles. Tf-PPC with average particle size of 132.16 ± 1.37 nm and encapsulation efficiency of 88.27 ± 2.53% showed a sustained drug release. The efficacy of Tf-PPC was studied in vitro in Tf-overexpressing human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) and human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. The mouse embryo fibroblast (NIH-3T3) cells were used as control cells. Tf-PPC showed higher internalization compared to non-targeted micelles (PPC). The curcumin-mediated cytotoxicity increased significantly following Tf-PPC treatment in both the tested cell lines. In NIH-3T3 cells, Tf conjugation did not differ in comparison to the non-targeted micelles. Further, the efficiency of Tf-PPC was studied in three-dimensional (3D) HeLa tumor spheroids. The Tf-PPC was efficiently internalized by the spheroidal structures, causing higher cytotoxicity and apoptosis compared to PPC. These results reveal that the newly developed, Tf-PPC could be employed as an effective chemotherapy in the treatment of Tf- overexpressing cancers.
