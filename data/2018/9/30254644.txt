Background: There is still a dispute over an issue of the clinical pathology and prognostic of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Here, we undertook this meta-analysis to survey the conceivable role of PD-L1 in HCC. Method: We searched databases like MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar for relevant studies published in English up to February 13, 2018. We implemented the appraisal of the eligible studies according to the choice criterion. We used Hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) to evaluate the prognostic role of PD-L1 for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Odds ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95% CI were calculated to evaluate the connection between PD-L1 and clinicopathological features. Publication bias was tested. Results: 13 studies, which published range from 2009 to 2017 were contained in this meta-analysis, involving 1,843 patients with HCC. The results indicated that high PD-L1 could predict shorter OS (HR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.09-2.27, P < 0.00001) as well as poorer DFS (HR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.20-3.58, P = 0.009). Additionally, high PD-L1 expression was correlated to liver cirrhosis (OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.10-2.50, P = 0.02), poorer tumor Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage (OR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.10-0.88, P = 0.03) and portal vein invasion (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.04-3.68, P = 0.04), but had no correlation with age, gender, tumor size, number of tumors, AFP, vascular invasion, HBVs-Ag, Anti-HCV, differentiation or TNM stage. Besides, no significant publication bias was found among these identified studies. Conclusion: The meta-analysis suggested that PD-L1 overexpression could foresee worse OS and DFS in HCC. Moreover, the PD-L1 expression has to bear on liver cirrhosis, portal vein invasion, and BCLC stage.
