Despite recent advancements in therapeutic options for advanced hepatobiliary cancers, there remains an unmet need for innovative systemic treatments. Immunotherapy has shown an ability to provide prolonged clinical benefit, but this benefit remains limited to a small subset of patients. Numerous ongoing endeavors are investigating novel immunotherapy concepts. Immunotherapies that have demonstrated clinical efficacy in hepatobiliary cancers include PD-1 inhibitor therapy and CTLA-4 inhibitor therapy. Novel immunotherapy concepts include targeting emerging checkpoint proteins, bispecific T-cell engagers, combinatorial trials with checkpoint inhibitors, oncolytic virotherapy and chimeric antigen receptor T cells. The goal for these new treatment strategies is to achieve a meaningful expansion of patients deriving prolonged clinical benefit from immunotherapy.
