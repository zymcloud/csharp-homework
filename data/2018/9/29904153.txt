Mouse models are the basis of preclinical and translational research in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Multiple methods exist to induce tumour formation in mice, including genetically engineered mouse models, chemotoxic agents, intrahepatic or intrasplenic injection of tumour cells and xenograft approaches. Additionally, as HCC generally develops in the context of diseased liver, methods exist to induce liver disease in mice to mimic viral hepatitis, fatty liver disease, fibrosis, alcohol-induced liver disease and cholestasis. Similar to HCC in humans, response to therapy in mouse models is monitored with imaging modalities such as CT or MRI, as well as additional techniques involving bioluminescence. As immunotherapy is increasingly applied to HCC, mouse models for these approaches are required for preclinical data. In studying cancer immunotherapy, it is important to consider aspects of antitumour immune responses and to produce a model that mimics the complexity of the immune system. This Review provides an overview of the different mouse models of HCC, presenting techniques to prepare an HCC mouse model and discussing different approaches to help researchers choose an appropriate model for a specific hypothesis. Specific aspects of immunotherapy research in HCC and the applied mouse models in this field are also highlighted.
