Objective:This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and hepatic resection for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) involving portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT).Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 323 HCC patients involving PVTT. Among them, 134 patients underwent 3D-CRT, while 189 controls treated with hepatic resection (HR). Survival rate and prognostic analysis were performed using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analyses.Results:The 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival (OS) of RT group and HR group was 54% vs 62%, 33% vs 47%, and 18% vs 43%, respectively (P = 0.003). In the subgroup of PVTT type analysis, the 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS in RT group was 65%, 39%, and 19%, respectively, while that in HR group was 83%, 53%, and 42%, respectively, in type I PVTT (P Conclusion:3D-CRT appears to be an effective treatment for patients with HCC involving type II/III PVTT.
