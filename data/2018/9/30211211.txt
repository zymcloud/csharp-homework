Von Meyenburg complexes (VMCs) are a rare type of ductal plate malformation. We herein report two Chinese families with VMCs, and the suspicious gene mutation of this disease. Proband A was a 62-year-old woman with abnormal echographic presentation of the liver. She received magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination and liver biopsy, and the results showed she had VMCs. Histologically proved hepatocellular carcinoma was found 1 year after the diagnosis of VMCs. Proband B was a 57-year-old woman with intrahepatic diffuse lesions displayed by abdominal ultrasonography. Her final diagnoses were VMCs, congenital hepatic fibrosis, and hepatitis B surface e antigen-negative chronic hepatitis B after a series of examinations. Then, all the family members of both proband A and proband B were screened for VMCs by MRI or ultrasonography. The results showed that four of the 11 family members from two families, including two males and two females, were diagnosed with VMCs. DNA samples were extracted from the peripheral blood of those 11 individuals of two VMCs pedigrees and subjected to polymerase chain reaction amplification of the polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 (PKHD1) gene. Two different mutation loci were identified. Heterozygous mutations located in exon 32 (c.4280delG, p.Gly1427ValfsX6) in family A and exon 28 (c.3118C>T, p.Arg1040Ter) in family B were detected. We speculate that PKHD1 gene mutations may be responsible for the development of VMCs.
