It has been noted that inflammatory were intimately associated with the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid play crucial roles in chronic inflammation. Accordingly, there is an intricate relationship between eicosanoids and HCC, being supported by the epidemiological, clinical, and basic science studies. Herein, we intend to provide bioanalytical insights into the role of eicosanoids in HCC progression, from cell proliferation, angiogenesis migration, to apoptosis. Also, the analytical methods and biochemistry of eicosanoids are described.
