Background/aim:The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels before the first curative hepatectomy for metastatic colorectal cancer as a predictor of recurrence.Patients and methods:Between 2003 and 2010, 66 patients (45 male and 21 female) who underwent a first curative hepatectomy for metastatic colorectal cancer in our hospital were evaluated retrospectively. The mean patient age was 65.2 years (range=31-80 years). A total of 28 patients had synchronous liver metastasis, and the other 38 patients developed metachronous liver metastasis.Results:The 5-year relapse-free survival rate after the first hepatectomy of the 16 patients with normal serum CEA level was 61.1%, whereas that of the 50 patients with abnormal serum CEA level was 34.3% (p<0.001). Among patients whose serum CEA levels were abnormal, the 5-year relapse-free survival rate after the first hepatectomy of the 34 patients with serum CEA levels less than 50 ng/ml was 48.1%, whereas that of the 16 patients with serum CEA level equal to or greater than 50 ng/ml was 6.3% (p<0.001). All eleven patients whose serum CEA levels were at least 100 ng/ml developed recurrence within one year after hepatectomy.Conclusion:Serum CEA levels before the first curative hepatectomy for metastatic colorectal cancer seem to be a predictor of recurrence.
