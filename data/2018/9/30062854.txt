The low radical surgery rate of pancreatic cancer leads to increased local recurrence and poor prognosis. Gemcitabine (GEM) is the preferred chemotherapeutic for pancreatic cancer. However, systemic chemotherapy with GEM has reached a bottleneck due to its serious side effects after frequent injections. In this study, GEM is successfully enwrapped into electrospun fibers via microsol electrospinning technology to form a stable core-shell fibrous structure. The GEM release rate can be adjusted by altering the thickness of the hyaluronan-sol inner fiber and the quantity of loaded GEM, and the release can be sustained for as long as three weeks. In vitro assays show that these electrospun fibers effectively inhibit pancreatic cancer cells and promote apoptosis. In vivo studies show that the fibrous membranes are better for inhibiting the growth of residual tumors than that of integrated tumors. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry results show that GEM-loaded fibers promote a higher cell apoptosis rate than does systemically injected GEM in residual tumors. In addition, the local delivery of GEM with fibers significantly reduces liver toxicity. In summary, a core-shell electrospun fiber for the controlled and localized delivery of GEM, which greatly improves the treatment of residual tumors and prevents pancreatic tumor recurrence, is developed.
