An in vivo animal model that mimics human cancer could have various applications that deliver significant clinical information. The currently used techniques for the development of in vivo cancer models have considerable limitations. Therefore, in this study, we aim to implement cell sheet technology to develop an in vivo cancer model. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is successfully developed in nude rats using cell sheets created from HCC cell line cells. The cancer cell sheets are generated through intracellular adhesion and the formation of a stratified structure, controlled by the extracellular matrix. This allows for the HCC sheet transplantation into the liver and the creation of a tumor-bearing animal model within a month. In addition, the role of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the development of this cancer model is investigated. In addition to the HCC cell line sheet, another two cell sheets are created: a sheet of HCC cells and bone marrow MSCs (BMMSCs) and a sheet of HCC cells and umbilical cord MSCs (UCMSCs). Sheets that have a combination of both HCC cells and MSCs are also capable of producing a tumor-bearing animal. However, the addition of MSCs reduces the size of the formed tumor, and this adverse effect on tumor development varies depending on the used MSCs' source. This indicates that a cell sheet made of certain MSC subtypes could be utilized in tumor management and control.
