Objective: To investigate the clinical, radiological and pathological features of visceral parasitic migration of the liver. Methods: Seven cases of visceral parasitic migration of liver were identified at the Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Medical School of Nanjing University from January 2008 to July 2017. Clinical data, enhanced CT image and pathological features were analyzed, combining with literature review. Results: There were 5 male and 2 female patients. Five patients presented with abdominal pain or discomfort as the first symptom. Two patients were admitted to the hospital for physical examination with liver nodule. Blood eosinophils were mildly to moderately increased in 4 cases. Enhanced CT showed the liver irregular beaded nodules that showed no significant enhancement of arterial phase. Mild enhancement of round lesions (ring lesion) was seen in a few cases before surgery. By histopathology, the lesions showed central geographic necrosis, surrounded by epithelioid granuloma and inflammatory cell bands. A large number of eosinophils and scattered multinucleated giant cells were found, especially at the peripheral of the lesion. Charcot-Leyden crystals were present in all case and parasitic migrans was found in one case. Conclusions: Visceral parasitic migration of liver is a rare liver disease and is easily misdiagnosed as other benign or malignant liver tumors. Combining clinical data, enhanced CT images and pathological examination can improve the preoperative and postoperative diagnosis of the disease.
