HCV genotype 2a strain JFH-1 replicates and produces viral particles efficiently in human hepatocellular carcinoma (huh) 7.5 cells, which provide a stable in vitro cell infection system for the hepatitis C virus (HCVcc system). Natural killer (NK) cells are large lymphoid cells that recognize and kill virus-infected cells. In this study, we investigated the interaction between NK cells and the HCVcc system. IL-10 is a typical immune regulatory cytokine that is produced mostly by NK cells and macrophages. IL-21 is one of the main cytokines that stimulate the activation of NK cells. First, we used anti-IL-10 to neutralize IL-10 in a coculture of NK cells and HCVcc. Anti-IL-10 treatment increased the maturation of NK cells by enhancing the frequency of the CD56+dim population in NK-92 cells. However, with anti-IL-10 treatment of NK cells in coculture with J6/JFH-1-huh 7.5 cells, there was a significant decrease in the expression of STAT1 and STAT5 proteins in NK-92 cells and an increase in the HCV Core and NS3 proteins. In addition, rIL-21 treatment increased the frequency of the CD56+dim population in NK-92 cells, Also, there was a dramatic increase in the expression of STAT1 and STAT5 proteins in rIL-21 pre-stimulated NK cells and a decrease in the expression of HCV Core protein in coculture with J6/JFH-1-huh 7.5 cells. In summary, we found that the functional activation of NK cells can be modulated by anti-IL-10 or rIL-21, which controls the expression of HCV proteins as well as HCV RNA replication.
