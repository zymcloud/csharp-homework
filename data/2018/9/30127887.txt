Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a poor prognosis due to its asymptomatic onset and susceptibility to metastasis. The survival of patients with advanced HCC is 6-12 months. As a first-line medicine for the control of hepatitis B virus, interferon (IFN) is also capable of inhibiting tumor growth and modulating immunity. However, treatment of HCC with lung metastasis using IFN has been rarely reported. The present study reports the case of one patient with HCC having lung metastasis who underwent a one-time treatment with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and was subsequently completely cured by single peginterferon α 2a (PEG-IFNα2a); and has survived up to 108 months. A 53-year-old male patient diagnosed with HBV-related HCC with lung metastasis underwent TACE using floxuridine (FUDR) 500 mg, cisdiamine dichloroplatinum (CDDP) 20 mg, mitomycin 10 mg, and ultrafluid lipiodol 10 ml, together with local thoracic aorta chemotherapy using FUDR 250 mg and CDDP 20 mg. His metastatic lung cancer aggravated. However, after 9 months of treatment with subcutaneous injections of PEG-IFNα 2a once per week, the metastatic lung foci gradually shrunk until disappearance and the HCC lesion stabilized without progression. According to the World Health Organization criteria for the efficacy of solid tumors, this was a case of complete response. Upon follow-up up to 108 months his metastatic lung cancer had disappeared and HCC did not recur. Therefore, IFN intervention may be an appropriate novel adjuvant therapy for patients with HCC with lung metastasis and requires further attention and study.
