Background:Although risk factors for the long-term mortality of liver transplantation are well described, there is a lack of detailed study regarding these factors for adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT).Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 528 adult LDLT recipients in our hospital. The risk factors were analyzed for overall deaths more than 5 years post-LDLT.Results:Over the 20-year follow-up, 137 patients died. Patient survival at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years post-LDLT was 87.8%, 81.8%, 79.4%, and 72.8%, respectively. The independent risk factors for more than 5 years post-LDLT overall death were hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 38.9; P Conclusions:Not only malignancies and rejection but also bile duct stenosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis had significant impacts on late period post-LDLT mortality.
