Background:Misregulation of the p53-mdm2 loop function is a major mechanism to promote hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). RBM38, a member of the RNA recognition motif (RRM) family of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), plays a fundamental role in the posttranscriptional control of gene expression and regulatory functions in human tumors. A novel RBM38-p53-mdm2 autoregulatory feedback loop has been demonstrated. However, its mechanistic role in HCC remains unclear.Methods:In the present study, we investigated the role and molecular mechanism of misregulation in the p53-mdm2 loop function by RBM38 in HCC. First we investigated the correlation of RBM38 activity and p53-mdm2 loop function in liver cancer cells and HCC tissues by western blot and quantitative RT-PCR. We then conducted functional assays to investigate the molecular roles of RBM38 in inhibiting liver cancer cells aggressiveness in vitro and suppressing tumorigenicity in vivo.Results:We observed RBM38 protein expression was commonly silenced coupled with increased mdm2 and decreased wild type (wt) p53 in liver cancer cells and HCC tissues compared to the corresponding normal liver cells and adjacent liver tissues. RBM38 mRNA level was significantly lower in HCC than adjacent liver tissues, whereas mdm2 and wtp53 mRNA levels were similar between HCC and adjacent liver tissues. This implied that deactivation of RBM38 could disrupt the p53-mdm2 loop and promote HCC, even though p53 and mdm2 transcript amounts were stable. Then, we generated stable liver cancer cell lines with overexpressed RBM38 (RBM38-OE) and found that up-regulation of RBM38 could inhibit mdm2 and restore wtp53 expression. Luciferase assay shown that RBM38 destabilized the mdm2 transcript through binding to multiple AU-/U-rich elements in mdm2 3'-UTR. Furthermore, functional assays showed that ectopic expression of RBM38 could induce liver cancer cell apoptosis and senescence, inhibit proliferation and colony growth, and suppress migration and invasion in vitro. Lastly, RBM38 could suppress HCC tumorigenicity in vivo.Conclusion:Our findings suggested that RBM38 may be a core contributor in stabilizing the p53-mdm2 loop function to prevent HCC, and a potential novel target to provide a therapeutic strategy for HCC by inhibiting mdm2 and rescuing p53 from inactivation.
