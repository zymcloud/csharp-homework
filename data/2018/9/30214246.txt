Background:The present meta-analysis was aimed to evaluate the effects of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy/transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) on the survival/disease-free survival (DFS) rate in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT).Methods:The relevant trials were collected using a database search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, the China Journal Full-text Database, and the National Institute of Health Clinical Trials Database. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival/DFS rates were considered to be the primary end points. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by reanalyzing the data using different statistical approaches.Results:Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. When compared with surgery alone, the pooled OR showed that the postoperative adjuvant therapy significantly increased the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates for HCC patients with PVTT (the pooled OR and 95% CI of the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates, respectively, were as follows: 2.72, 1.98-3.74; 1.62, 1.13-2.33; 1.99, 1.20-3.29). In addition, when compared with surgery alone, subgroup analysis showed that the postoperative chemotherapy improved the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of HCC patients with PVTT.Conclusion:Compared with surgery alone, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy can improve the 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of HCC patients with PVTT. However, postoperative TACE can only increase the 1-year survival rate. However, due to the limitations of this meta-analysis, additional relevant trials are required to confirm these findings.
