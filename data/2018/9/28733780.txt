Laparoscopy is considered the gold standard approach to perform left lateral sectionectomy (LLS). Furthermore, laparoscopy for cirrhotic patients can reduce intraoperative bleeding and postoperative morbidity when compared to open surgery. Although robotic surgery is feasible for both minor and major liver resections, it remains a work in progress and only few series reported this approach for cirrhotic patients. We reported two cases of 62-year-old men, both with hepatitis C virus and alcoholic cirrhosis, but with compensated liver functions (MELD 9-10 and Child-Pugh A5-A6). The patients were diagnosed with a single lesion in the left lobe. Robotic LLS was performed using intraoperative ultrasound to confirm findings of pre-operative image, and linear staplers were used to control left lobe inflow and outflow. The specimens were removed through Pfannenstiel incision in both patients. Both procedures followed the same standardization. The total operative time was 250 and 151 min with estimated blood loss of 100 and 70 ml, respectively, for cases 1 and 2. The procedures were made without Pringle maneuver and postoperative course was uneventful with hospital discharge at third and fourth postoperative day, respectively. The pathology examination confirmed a 2.5- and 4.5-cm hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively; both presented negative margins and cirrhosis. Robotic LLS seems to be as feasible as conventional laparoscopic approach as a stepwise procedure in a robotic learning curve for liver resection. Its benefits can also be offered to selected cirrhotic patients.
