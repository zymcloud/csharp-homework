Background/objectives:Little is known about the role of allopurinol use on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The study aimed to examine the association between allopurinol use and HCC in Taiwan.Methods:Using the database from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program, we designed a case-control study that consisted of 4901 subjects aged 20-84 years with newly diagnosed HCC as the case group, and 4901 subjects aged 20-84 years without HCC as the control group, from 2000 to 2013. Ever use of allopurinol was defined as a subject who had at least a prescription for allopurinol before the index date. Never use was defined as a subject who never had a prescription for allopurinol before the index date. The OR and 95% CI for HCC associated with allopurinol use was measured by the multivariable logistic regression model.Results:After adjustment for confounding factors, the adjusted OR of HCC was 0.93 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.07) for subjects with ever use of allopurinol, compared with never use. The adjusted OR of HCC was 1.01 for subjects with increasing cumulative duration of allopurinol use for every 1 year (95% CI 0.92 to 1.12), compared with never use. The adjusted OR of HCC was 0.99 for subjects with increasing cumulative dosage of allopurinol use for every 50 mg (95% CI 0.94 to 1.05), compared with never use.Conclusions:No statistical association can be detected between allopurinol use and HCC risk in Taiwan. There are no duration-dependent and dosage-dependent effects of allopurinol use on the risk of HCC.
