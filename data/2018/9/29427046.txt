Objective:To describe Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced liver MR imaging findings in colon and rectal cancer patients who received Oxaliplatin.Conclusion:Spectrum of hepatobiliary phase imaging findings include diffuse heterogeneous dysfunction, macronodular and micronodular FNH-like lesions, and coexistence of periportal increased liver function with FNH-like lesions. Differentiation of these benign lesions from metastasis is crucial to avoid biopsy in patients with colorectal cancers and may allow better understanding of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome pathophysiology and regenerative response of liver.
