Aim:This randomized phase III trial compared hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) followed by uracil/tegafur (UFT) and leucovorin (LV) versus UFT/LV alone for patients with curatively resected liver metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC).Methods:The study was designed to include 280 patients to be randomized to receive either HAI with 5-FU followed by UFT/LV (Arm A) or UFT/LV alone (Arm B) to assess whether HAI chemotherapy improved disease-free survival (DFS).Results:Forty-four patients were randomized. Three-year DFS was relatively worse in the experimental arm although this difference was not statistically significant (43.5% in Arm A vs. 58% in Arm B; hazard ratio [HR], 1.304; P = 0.534). The experimental arm also tended to have a worse 3-year overall survival rate (80.2% in Arm A vs. 85.2% in Arm B; HR, 2.255; P = 0.192). There was no significant difference in the frequency of Grade 3 or higher toxicities between the two arms.Conclusion:Although this study was limited by a small sample size after early study termination, our analysis found that HAI with 5-FU followed by UFT/LV did not improve the DFS of patients with curatively resected liver metastases from CRC compared with UFT/LV alone. The future studies are necessary to evaluate the survival benefit of HAI in combination with newer systemic chemotherapeutic agents for patients with resectable liver metastases from CRC.
