Background It has been reported that both of the miR-132/212 (micro-RNA) cluster members, miR-132 and miR-212, are downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma. Nevertheless, the expression pattern and clinical utility of serum miR-132/212 in hepatocellular carcinoma are still unknown. Methods In this study, serum concentrations of miR-132 and miR-212 were measured in 80 hepatocellular carcinoma patients, 51 controls with chronic liver diseases and 42 healthy volunteers by using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results In hepatocellular carcinoma patients, serum concentrations of miR-132 and miR-212 were significantly reduced and strongly correlated (r = 0.603, p
