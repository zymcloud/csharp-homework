Alcohol liver disease (ALD) is one of the major chronic liver diseases worldwide, ranging from fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and potentially, hepatocellular carcinoma. Epidemiological studies suggest a potential link between ALD and impaired circadian rhythms, but the role of hepatic circadian proteins in the pathogenesis of ALD remains unknown. Here we show that the circadian clock protein BMAL1 in hepatocytes is both necessary and sufficient to protect mice from ALD. Ethanol diet-fed mice with liver-specific knockout (Bmal1-LKO) or depletion of Bmal1 develop more severe liver steatosis and injury as well as a simultaneous suppression of both de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation, which can be rescued by the supplementation of synthetic PPARα ligands. Restoring de novo lipogenesis in the liver of Bmal1-LKO mice by constitutively active AKT not only elevates hepatic fatty acid oxidation but also alleviates ethanol-induced fatty liver and liver injury. Furthermore, hepatic over-expression of lipogenic transcription factor ChREBP, but not SREBP-1c, in the liver of Bmal1-LKO mice also increases fatty acid oxidation and partially reduces ethanol-induced fatty liver and liver injury. Conclusion: we identified a protective role of BMAL1 in hepatocytes against ALD. The protective action of BMAL1 during alcohol consumption depends on its ability to couple ChREBP-induced de novo lipogenesis with PPARα-mediated fatty oxidation. (Hepatology 2018).
