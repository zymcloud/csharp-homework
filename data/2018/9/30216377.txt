Objective:Establishing normal liver stiffness (LS) values in healthy livers is a prerequisite to differentiate normal from pathological LS values. Our aim was to define normal LS using two novel elastography methods head-to-head and to assess the number of measurements, variability and reproducibility.Materials and methods:We evaluated shear wave elastography (SWE) methods integrated in Samsung RS80A and GE S8 by obtaining LS measurements (LSM) in 100 healthy subjects (20-70 years). Transient Elastography (TE) was used as reference method. Data were analyzed according to age, sex, BMI and 5 vs. 10 measurements. All subjects underwent B-mode ultrasound examination and lab tests to exclude liver pathology. Interobserver variation was evaluated in a subset (n = 24).Results:Both methods showed excellent feasibility, measuring LS in all subjects. LSM-mean for GE S8 2D-SWE was higher compared to TE (4.5±0.8 kPa vs. 4.2±1.1, p<0.001) and Samsung RS80A (4.1±0.8 kPa, p<0.001). Both methods showed low intra- and interobserver variation. LSM-mean was significantly higher in males than females using 2D-SWE, while a similar trend for Samsung SWE did not reach significance. No method demonstrated statistical significant difference in LSM across age and BMI groups nor between LSM-mean based on 5 vs. 10 measurements.Conclusion:LSM was performed with high reproducibility in healthy adult livers. LSM-mean was significantly higher for GE S8 2D-SWE compared to Samsung RS80A and TE in healthy livers. Males had higher LSM than females. No method demonstrated statistical significant difference in LSM-mean across age- and non-obese BMI groups. Our results indicate that five LSM may be sufficient for reliable results.
