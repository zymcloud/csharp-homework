Purpose:This study evaluated the outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with small normal liver volume (NLV) treated with proton beam therapy (PBT) and introduced estimated standard liver volume (eSLV) as a new constraint.Materials and methods:HCC patients with NLV Results:Twenty-two patients were treated between November 2015 and December 2016. The 1-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 40.4% and 81.8%, respectively. The 1-year in-field failure-free rate was 95.5%. NLV ranged from 483.9 to 795.8 cm3 (median = 673.8 cm3), eSLV ranged from 889.3 to 1290.0 cm3 (median = 1104.5 cm3), and the resulting NLV/eSLV ratio ranged from 44.3 to 81.2% (median = 57.7%). Non-irradiated liver volume (NILV) ranged from 232.9 to 531.6 cm3 (median = 391.2 cm3). The NILV/eSLV ratio ranged from 21.2 to 48.0% (median = 33.3%). NLV in the patients who received Conclusion:From the viewpoint of minimal liver toxicity occurring in our patients with NLV 20% and an rV30/eSLV ratio of >30% are acceptable.
