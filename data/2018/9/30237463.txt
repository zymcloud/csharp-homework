Rab3A is a small Ras-like GTPase critical for membrane traffic. Although the functions of Rab3A have been reported in several cancers, the roles of Rab3A in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have never been determined. To investigate the potential roles of Rab3A in HCC progression, we first determined Rab3A levels in HCC tissues and observed upregulated mRNA and protein levels of Rab3A in most tumor tissues. However, in vitro data showed that decreasing Rab3A in most HCC cell lines conferred no significant effects and overexpressing Rab3A in PLC/PRF/5 cells even inhibited migration and invasion. Meanwhile, the upregulation of Rab3A in HCC patients did not correlate with metastasis or overall survival of HCC patients. These contradict data suggested that Rab3A might act as metastatic suppressor and its effects might be attenuated in most HCC cells. Further experiments revealed that O-GlcNAcylation on Rab3A was key for attenuating Rab3A-mediated effects by regulating its GTP-binding activity, and verified the effects of Rab3A and its aberrant O-GlcNAcylation on HCC metastasis in vitro and in vivo. We also found that Rab3A and its O-GlcNAcylation had opposite roles in mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (mtOXPHOS), and their functions on HCC metastasis were partially depended on their effects on metabolic reprogramming.
