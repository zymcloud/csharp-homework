Background and aim:In September 2015, sofosbuvir and ledipasvir were approved for clinical use in Japan for patients infected with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus. We conducted a postmarketing prospective cohort study to elucidate the safety and efficacy of this therapy in a real-world setting.Methods:We treated 509 patients using standard doses of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir for 12 weeks. As sustained virological response (SVR) in 2 patients could not be evaluated, 507 patients were finally analyzed. Patients with daclatasvir plus asunaprevir failure were excluded.Results:Four patients (0.8%) discontinued treatment due to adverse events. SVR rates for the overall cohort, patients Conclusions:In this real-world setting, sofosbuvir and ledipasvir were a safe treatment even in patients â‰¥75 years old. When patients without pre-existing NS5A RASs and daclatasvir plus asunaprevir failure are selected, extremely high SVR rates can be achieved irrespective of age.
