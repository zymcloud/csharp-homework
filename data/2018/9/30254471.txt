Background:Study on the relationship between glutathione-S-transferase Pi 1 (GSTP1) and P16 promoter region methylation and the risk of hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-related HCC) has produced inconsistent results.Objectives:To assess the correlation between GSTP1 and P16 promoter methylation frequency and HBV-related HCC susceptibility.Methods:All relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure literature databases before December, 2017. The OR and the corresponding 95% CI were calculated to investigate the risk of GSTP1 and P16 promoter methylation rate and HBV-related HCC. Sensitivity analysis was performed and publication bias was estimated using the Begg's and Egger's test.Results:Our meta-analysis identified the relationships of GSTP1 (six studies including 213 HBV-related HCC tumor tissues) and P16 (nine studies with 287 HBV-related HCC tumor tissue) promoter methylation with HCC risk. Compared with normal liver tissue and cirrhosis, the pooled ORs of GSTP1 promoter region methylation in HBV-related HCC cancer tissues were 6.05 (95% CI =1.20-30.52) and 5.21 (95% CI =2.19-12.41), respectively. Compared with paracancerous tissue, normal liver tissue, cirrhosis, and chronic hepatitis B as controls, the pooled ORs of P16 promoter region methylation in HBV-related HCC cancer tissues were 7.18 (95% CI =2.31-22.33), 24.89 (95% CI =3.38-183.03), 5.92 (95% CI =1.78-19.68), and 12.12 (95% CI =0.75-196.50).Conclusion:In summary, our meta-analysis found strong associations between GSTP1 and P16 gene promoter methylation and an increased HBV-related HCC susceptibility. Moreover, GSTP1 and P16 methylation in promoter region could obviously increase the risk of HBV-related HCC in patients with cirrhosis, indicating that these would be promising biomarkers for early clinical diagnosis of HBV-related HCC.
