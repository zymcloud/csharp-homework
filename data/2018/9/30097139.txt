Objective:Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a highly prevalent medical condition, which may lead to severe complications including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Its chronic course and its association with obesity and diabetes mellitus augment the long-term impact of NAFLD on patients' health and quality of life (QoL) and put great strain on healthcare systems worldwide. Research is growingly focusing on NAFLD patients' QoL in an attempt to describe the full spectrum of disease burden and tackle its future consequences. Relevant studies are characterized by sample heterogeneity and provide conflicting findings which should be interpreted with the use of a systematic and integrative approach. In this context, our aim was to conduct a systematic literature review on the topic of NAFLD patients' QoL.Methods:We performed a systematic search of PubMed, ScienceDirect and GoogleScholar databases according to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) protocol.Results:Our search yielded 14 suitable articles reporting data from almost 5000 patients. All authors agree that NAFLD patients' QoL is impaired especially in the physical sub-domain. In addition, several demographic, clinical and histopathological parameters have emerged as major determinants of patients' QoL. However, future studies are needed to further clarify these issues.Conclusions:NAFLD patients report poor physical QoL. QoL impairment is associated with a variety of disease-related parameters, mostly the presence of fatigue and cirrhosis.
