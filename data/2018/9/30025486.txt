Background:Major treatments for small hepatocellular carcinoma (SHCC) include percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), percutaneous acetic acid injection (PAI), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), or surgical resection (SR). We aimed to compare these therapies concerning with effectiveness and safety.Methods:Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase were searched for randomized controlled studies (RCTs) from inception to 30 April 2017. Odds ratios (OR) for proportion dead (PD), local recurrence (LR) and adverse events (AEs).Results:Fourteen RCTs were identified. Compared with SR, PEI (OR 2.79, CrI 1.25, 6.45, p Conclusions:SR was superior to PEI. Although SR achieved highest cumulative ranking probabilities in clinical efficacy, it obtained a low benefit-to-risk ratio for patients. RFA was superior to the other ablative therapies. For tumor sizes > 2 cm or â‰¤ 2 cm in diameter, SR conferred non-significant effects compared with other therapies for SHCC.
