The present study has demonstrated that P-5m octapeptide (P-5m) has therapeutic potential in metastatic human hepatocarcinoma, possibly through the modulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the antitumor effect of P-5m combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) on the treatment of hepatoma 22 (H22) hepatocarcinoma malignant ascites in a mouse model. The inhibitory effect on the growth of mouse ascites tumors was monitored by measuring body weight gain, survival time, ascites volume, numbers of tumor cells, DNA synthesis and peritoneal capillary permeability analysis. The present data revealed a significant reduction in ascites volume and cell count in mice that were treated with P-5m plus 5-Fu. Furthermore, the median survival time in mice in the combination group was prolonged compared with the disease control group. Moreover, a significant reduction in the total H22 ascites cell count in mice from the combination group was observed when compared with the disease control group. P-5m plus 5-Fu was able to induce the cell cycle arrest and inhibit the peritoneal capillary permeability of the mice. To conclude, the present study indicated that P-5m may have therapeutic potential in ascites caused by hepatocellular carcinoma.
