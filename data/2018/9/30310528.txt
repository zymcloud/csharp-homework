Human Mpv17-like protein (M-LPH) has been suggested to participate in prevention of mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. To clarify the molecular mechanism of M-LPH function, we knocked out M-LPH in human hepatoma HepG2 using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. An increase in mtDNA damage in M-LPH-KO HepG2 cells was demonstrated by PCR-based quantitation and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) measurement. Furthermore, confocal immunofluorescence analysis and Western blot analysis of mitochondrial extracts demonstrated that M-LPH-KO caused reductions in the protein levels of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), an essential factor for transcription and maintenance of mtDNA, and two DNA repair enzymes, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) and DNA ligase 3 (LIG3), both involved in mitochondrial base excision repair (BER). Accordingly, it was suggested that the increase in mtDNA damage was due to a cumulative effect of mtDNA instability resulting from deficiencies of TFAM and diminished ability for BER arising from deficiencies in BER-related enzymes. These findings suggest that M-LPH could be involved in the maintenance of mtDNA, and therefore mitochondrial function, by protecting proteins essential for mtDNA stability and maintenance, in an integrated manner.
