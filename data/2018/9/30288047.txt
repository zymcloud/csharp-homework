Apatinib (Aitan®, brand name in China) is a new anti-antiangiogenic agent that has recently been approved for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer (GC) in China. Nevertheless, its therapeutic efficacy against other types of advanced solid tumors remains unclear. This meta-analysis examines the short-term efficacy and safety of apatinib or combination therapy for GC, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); and provides a discussion of its anti-angiogenesis therapy applications. Seven clinical studies met the inclusion criteria. The treatment of cancers using apatinib was more successful compared to therapy without apatinib. Both objective response rates (ORRs) and disease control rates (DCRs) were significantly improved in the apatinib group compared to those in the control group (RR=2.18, 95% CI 1.30-3.65; RR=2.09, 95% CI 1.21-3.60). The DCR of 850 mg qd and 750 mg qd were higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). Based on the short-term acute adverse reactions of apatinib, significant differences between groups were found for hypertension, urine protein, hand foot syndrome, and gastrointestinal reactions (diarrhea), while no significant differences were found for myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting. Moreover, the results showed that apatinib prolonged patient survival (HR=0.38, 95% CI: 0.28-0.52), and the effect was more pronounced in patients treated with 750 mg qd or 850 mg qd of apatinib than in those treated with a dose of ≤500 mg qd. Additionally, compared to its second-line application, the third-line application was shown to further reduce the risk ratio in patients. Furthermore, overall survival was longer in patients treated with apatinib. Apatinib was shown to have certain short-term effects and survival benefits on GC, HCC, and NSCLC with controllable adverse effects.
