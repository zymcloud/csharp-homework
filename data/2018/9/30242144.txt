BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to compare the expression levels of mRNA of the B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI-1) and the WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) genes and their protein products in tissues from patients with liver cancer with normal liver tissues from patients without liver cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS The liver cancer group (N=56) included patients with available tissue samples of histologically confirmed liver cancer. The control group (N=24) included histologically confirmed normal liver tissue samples. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot were used to detect and compare protein expression of Bmi-1 and WWOX in liver tissues in the liver cancer group and the control group. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect and compare mRNA expression of BMI-1 and WWOX in liver tissues in the liver cancer group and the control group. Expression levels of the protein and mRNA levels and the clinicopathological features including patient prognosis in liver cancer were evaluated statistically using analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS There were significant differences in the expression levels of protein and mRNA of BMI-1 and WWOX between the liver cancer group and the control group. BMI-1 mRNA and protein expression were significantly increased, and WWOX mRNA and protein expression were significantly reduced in liver cancer tissue, compared with normal liver tissue (p
