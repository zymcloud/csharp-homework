Background:Whether microwave ablation (MWA) challenges the standard role of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in treating early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear.Aim:To compare the efficacy of MWA vs RFA for treating primary HCC within the Milan criteria.Methods:From January 2002 to January 2017, the oncological outcomes after MWA (126 patients) and RFA (436 patients) were analysed by propensity score matching.Results:Before propensity score matching, for overall patients, MWA resulted in similar 5-year overall survival to RFA (80.1% vs 75.8%, P = 0.190) but better 5-year recurrence-free survival (28.1% vs 19.6%, P = 0.036). For solitary HCC ≤ 3 cm, MWA resulted in comparable 5-year overall survival (81.8% vs 77.1%, P = 0.170) to RFA but better 5-year recurrence-free survival (34.6% vs 24.0%, P = 0.042). After propensity score matching, MWA resulted in better 5-year overall survival (79.3% vs 68.4%, P = 0.021) and 5-year recurrence-free survival (27.9% vs 6.4%, P Conclusions:RFA is inferior to MWA for treating HCC within the Milan criteria, but has comparable efficacy to MWA for solitary HCC ≤ 3 cm.
