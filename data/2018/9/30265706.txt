Background and objectives:Although the burden of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) continues to increase worldwide, genetic factors predicting progression to cirrhosis and decompensation in NAFLD remain poorly understood. We sought to determine whether gene expression profiling was associated with clinical decompensation and death in patients with NAFLD, and to assess whether altered DNA methylation contributes to these changes in gene expression.Methods:We performed a retrospective analysis of 86 patients in the Duke NAFLD Clinical Database and Biorepository with biopsy-proven NAFLD whose liver tissue was previously evaluated for gene expression and DNA methylation using array based technologies. We assessed the prospective development of liver and cardiovascular disease related outcomes, including hepatic decompensation as identified by the development of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocellular carcinoma, or variceal bleeding as well as stroke and myocardial infarction via medical chart review.Results:Of the 86 patients, 47 had F0-F1 fibrosis and 39 had F3-F4 fibrosis at index liver biopsy. Gene expression probe sets (n = 54,675) were analyzed; 42 genes showed significant differential expression (pConclusion:We found differential gene expression, correlated to changes in DNA methylation, at multiple BCAT1 loci in patients with cardiovascular outcomes and/or hepatic decompensation. BCAT1 catalyzes the transformation of alpha-ketoglutarate to glutamate and has been linked to the presence and severity of NAFLD, possibly through derangements in the balance between glutamate and alpha-ketoglutarate. Given the potential for BCAT1 to identify patients at risk for poor outcomes, and the potential therapeutic implications, these results should be validated in larger prospective studies.
