Purpose:Arginine depletion interferes with pyrimidine metabolism as well as DNA damage repair pathways. Preclinical data indicates that pairing pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG 20) with fluoropyrimidines or platinum enhances cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo in arginine auxotrophs.Methods:This is a single-center, open-label, phase 1 trial of ADI-PEG 20 and modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) in treatment-refractory hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other advanced gastrointestinal tumors. A 3 + 3 dose escalation design was employed to assess safety, tolerability, and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ADI-PEG 20. A RP2D expansion cohort for patients with HCC was employed to define the objective response rate (ORR). Secondary objectives were to estimate progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and to explore pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity. Eligible patients were treated with mFOLFOX6 intravenously biweekly at standard doses and ADI-PEG-20 intramuscularly weekly at 18 (Cohort 1) or 36 mg/m2 (Cohort 2 and RP2D expansion).Results:Twenty-seven patients enrolled-23 with advanced HCC and 4 with other gastrointestinal tumors. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed in cohort 1 or 2. The RP2D for ADI-PEG 20 was 36 mg/m2 weekly with mFOLFOX6. The most common any grade adverse events (AEs) were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, and fatigue. Among the 23 HCC patients, the most frequent treatment-related Grade â‰¥ 3 AEs were neutropenia (47.8%), thrombocytopenia (34.7%), leukopenia (21.7%), anemia (21.7%), and lymphopenia (17.4%). The ORR for this group was 21% (95% CI 7.5-43.7). Median PFS and OS were 7.3 and 14.5 months, respectively. Arginine levels were depleted with therapy despite the emergence of low levels of anti-ADI-PEG 20 antibodies. Arginine depletion at 4 and 8 weeks and archival tumoral argininosuccinate synthetase-1 levels did not correlate with response.Conclusions:Concurrent mFOLFOX6 plus ADI-PEG-20 intramuscularly at 36 mg/m2 weekly shows an acceptable safety profile and favorable efficacy compared to historic controls. Further evaluation of this combination is warranted in advanced HCC patients.
