Although anlotinib, a multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor has been reported have antitumor effects in many preclinical and clinical trials, little is known about its effect on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we have shown the antitumor effects of anlotinib on HCC. Data indicated that anlotinib application significantly inhibited HCC cell viability, proliferation, colony formation, and prompted apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, animal experiments also illustrated that anlotinib alleviated HCC progression. Mechanically, we demonstrated that anlotinib treatment downregulated the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and Survivin, but upregulated pro-apoptotic molecule Bax, which accounts for its therapeutic effect on HCC. Pathway analysis has shown decreased phosphorylation levels of Erk and Akt. Together, this study suggests that anlotinib may have a direct antitumor progression effect on HCC by inhibiting Bcl-2 and Survivin expression, promoting Bax expression via inactivating Erk and Akt pathways and could be a promising agent treating HCC.
