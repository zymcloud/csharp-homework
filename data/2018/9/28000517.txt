Objectives:A natural experimental design was coupled with propensity score matching to assess the risks of anxiety and depression and to assess the longitudinal effects of anxiety and depression on healthcare utilisation and mortality in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:This nationwide population-based cohort study retrospectively analysed 7304 patients treated for HCC during 1996-2010. Generalised estimating equations were used to estimate differences-in-differences models for examining the effects of anxiety and depression disorders.Results:Independent risk factors for anxiety and depression in the HCC patients were female gender (hazard ratio (HR) 1.45; P Conclusions:Anxiety disorders and depression disorders are associated with a significantly increased overall survival rate in HCC patients. However, further studies are needed to investigate this association.
