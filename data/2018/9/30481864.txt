Objective: To investigate the prognostic value of albumin/globulin ratio on postoperative survival outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: Data of 630 patients with HCC, who underwent surgical resection from February 2009 to July 2013, were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into low-value group (A/G < 1.5, defined as L group) and high-value group (A/Gâ‰¥1.5, defined as H group), and their distribution characteristics were observed with the normal A/G threshold value. Independent risk factors' affecting survival and prognosis was analyzed with univariate and multivariate Cox's regression model. Survival trend of all patients with low-value and high-value groups in A, B and C of Barcelona stage (BCLC stage) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Multivariate analysis showed that preoperative A/G ratio (P = 0.007), alpha-fetoprotein (P < 0.001), gamma-glutamyltransferase (P = 0.006), RBC (P = 0.014), international normalized ratio (P = 0.009), preoperative BCLC staging (P < 0.001) and number of tumors (P = 0.003), and intraoperative blood transfusion (P < 0.001) were independent prognostic factors affecting long-term survival in HCC patients. The median overall survival time in-group L was 15 months, significantly lower than that in group H of 42 months (P < 0.001). Stratified analysis showed that the short-term survival advantage of patients with high A / G value was limited to those with Barcelona stage A (P < 0.001), and disappeared in patients with Barcelona stage B and C (P > 0.05). The long-term survival advantage existed in patients with Barcelona stage A (P < 0.001), B (P < 0.05), and disappeared in C (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Preoperative albumin/globulin ratio can predict postoperative prognosis and survival, and direct towards the treatment for early stage of HCC and thus representing as an indicator of high clinical value.
