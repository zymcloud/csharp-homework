Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting men worldwide with a high recurrence rate following therapy. F-fluciclovine, is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved radiopharmaceutical for PET imaging in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. It targets increased amino acid transporters in the cell membrane of cancer cells. We report a case of incidentally detected hepatocellular carcinoma showing F-fluciclovine uptake in a 71-year-old man with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.
