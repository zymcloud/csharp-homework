Background:Genetic polymorphisms in lncRNA HULC may affect the susceptibility and clinical outcome of cancer. We aimed to investigate the association of HULC tagSNPs with the risk and prognosis of hepatocellular cancer, as well as the influence of the SNPs on lncRNA expression level.Methods:A total of 1338 samples were recruited in the risk study. Among them, 351 HCC patients were involved in the prognosis study. SNP genotyping was performed using KASP method and lncRNA expression was detected by Real-time PCR.Results:We found a promoter SNP, rs1041279, was associated with a 1.41-fold increased HCC risk (P = 0.032). In the stratified analysis, rs1041279 had greater ORs for the increased HCC risk in the male subgroup (P = 0.014, OR = 1.54). Furthermore, multi-logistic regression analysis revealed a two-way interaction effect of smoking-rs2038540 SNP on HCC risk (OR = 4.20). And MDR analysis consistently demonstrated a SNP-environmental interaction among smoking-drinking-rs2038540 SNP as the best model for predicting HCC risk (P = 0.0107). In our study, no significant association was found between HULC SNPs and the overall survival (P > 0.05), and no significant effect was observed of rs1041279 SNP on lncRNA-HULC expression (P > 0.05).Conclusion:lncRNA-HULC rs1041279 SNP and the interaction of rs2038540 SNP with environmental factors could enhance HCC risk.
