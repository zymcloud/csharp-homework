The community of microorganisms in the intestine, namely gut microbiome lives in symbiosis with the host, contributing to its homeostasis and influencing it simultaneously. It can be suspected that gut microbiome plays a central role in the pathophysiology of intestinal and extraintestinal diseases: determining their development, progress and complications. Recently, intestinal microbiome has become a highlighted field of interest and important topic in research, especially in hepatology. It is in the focus of relevant research as the liver is the organ which meets nutrients, bacterial components, toxins and metabolites at first, as a filter. The evolvement of different liver diseases - just like alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, steatohepatitis, cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma - correlates with the changed composition and activity of gut microbiome. Thus, it can be hypothesized that pre-, pro- and antibiotics could have an impact on the treatment of these diseases. In our review article, the relationship between intestinal flora and liver diseases with different etiologies as well as therapeutic possibilities are discussed. Orv Hetil. 2018; 159(36): 1465-1474.
