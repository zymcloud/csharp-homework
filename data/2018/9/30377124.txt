Objective:To explore the role of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A1 (eEF1A1) in regulating the invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and the possible mechanism.Methods:qRT-PCR and Western blotting were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression of eEF1A1 and NOB1 in different HCC cell lines and normal liver cells. The invasion and migration abilities of HCC cells with eEF1A1 knockdown or overexpression were examined using Transwell chamber assay and RTCA assay, and the changes in NOB1 mRNA and protein expressions in the cells were detected. The effects of increasing NOB1 expression in HCCLM3-sheEF1A1 cells and decreasing NOB1 expression in eEF1A1-overexpressing MHCC97h cells on eEF1A1 expression and cell invasion and migration abilities were analyzed using Western blotting, Transwell chamber assay and RTCA assay.Results:The expressions of eEF1A1 and NOB1 were significantly increased in positive correlation in HCC cells as compared with normal hepatocytes. Knockdown of eEF1A1 significantly decreased the invasion and migration of HCC cells and reduced the mRNA and protein expression of NOB1 (P < 0.01). Overexpression of eEF1A1 significantly enhanced invasion and migration of HCC cells and increased NOB1 mRNA and protein expressions (P < 0.01). Increasing NOB1 expression in HCCLM3-sheEF1A1 cells led to the restoration of NOB1 expression and cell invasion and migration abilities (P < 0.01), whereas decreasing NOB1 in MHCC97h-eEF1A1 cells resulted in inhibition of NOB1 expression and cell invasion and migration (P < 0.01).Conclusions:eEF1A1 positively regulates the expression of NOB1 to promote the invasion and migration of HCC cells in vitro.
