Heterogeneous ribonucleoproteinA1 (hnRNPA1) is a documented tumor biomarker known to be aberrantly expressed in a number of types of human cancer. However, to the best of our knowledge, its prognostic value for surgically resected HCC (RHCC) in the high incidence areas of China has not been described; the association between hnRNPA1 expression, pre-operative neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) is also not understood. In the present study, hnRNPA1 expression was retrospectively measured in two independent cohorts of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent surgery to remove the primary cancer at one center in Fujian, an area with a high incidence of HCC in China. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to quantify hnRNPA1 expression in RHCC tissues. The survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the prognostic significance of hnRNPA1, NLR and PLR was analyzed using the log-rank test. The relevant prognostic factors were identified by multivariate Cox regression analysis. RT-qPCR and western blotting revealed that hnRNPA1 was upregulated in HCC tissues (P400 Âµg) proved to be a good diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for this specific population of patients. Finally, a correlation may also exist between hnRNPA1 expression and other markers of systemic inflammation.
