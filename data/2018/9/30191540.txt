We report a patient with recurrent refractory small cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix, in whom combined therapy with paclitaxel, cisplatin, and bevacizumab (TP+Bev) was effective. Small cell cervical carcinoma is a rare malignancy and its outcome is reported to be poor. The patient was a 45-year-old woman who visited a local hospital with the chief complaint of irregular vaginal bleeding and was referred to our department. The results of a smear test and examination of a tissue biopsy specimen suggested small cell carcinoma. FIGO stage II A disease was diagnosed by MRI and CT. She underwent radical hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy, and pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection. Although postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was performed, local recurrence was found at three years after surgery. She received radiation therapy to the whole pelvis, bilateral inguinal regions, and site of recurrence. However, multiple liver metastases were detected and the tumor was considered to be refractory. Subsequently, she received TP+Bev as systemic chemotherapy, after which the local recurrence disappeared and the liver metastases became smaller.
