Concurrent laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is rare and no prior report has been found through a PubMed search. Here we report such a case of a 51-year old obese male presenting with hoarseness and trouble swallowing for 2 to 3 months. Imaging findings of computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast were suspicious for a T3N2 supraglottic laryngeal cancer. Laryngeal biopsy showed a well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). As part of the evaluation of the laryngeal SCC, MRI abdomen showed an enhancing mass (4.6 cm in the greatest dimension) with diffusion restriction and capsular retraction in the right lobe of the liver. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsy of the liver revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, that was strongly and diffusely positive for CK7 and CK19, weakly positive for CDX2, and negative for HepPar 1, glypican 3, CK20, PSA and TTF1. The immunohistochemistry profile was consistent with cholangiocarcinoma. This is a unique case of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma with concurrent cholangiocarcinoma. The prognosis was poor and the patient was placed in hospice care in two months after the diagnoses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of synchronous laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of the diseases are discussed.
