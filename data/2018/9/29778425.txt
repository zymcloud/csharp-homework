Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer around the world, along with high mortality and metastasis rate. Our present study aimed to explore the role of LncRNA HOTAIR in the progression of HCC. Our data showed that HOTAIR was overexpressed in HCC tissues and cell lines (Huh7, Hep3B, HepG2, MHCC97H). Overexpressed HOTAIR promoted invasion and migration of HCC cells (Huh7) by enhancing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Besides that, miR-23b-3p was predicted to be a target of HOTAIR and decreased expression of miR-23b-3p was observed in HCC tissues and cell lines. The up-regulation of HOTAIR strongly decreased the expression of miR-23b-3p. The further luciferase report confirmed the targeting reaction between HOTAIR and miR-23b-3p, suggesting that the expression of miR-23b-3p was negatively regulated by HOTAIR. Moreover, the zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) protein was predicted to be a target of miR-23b-3p. The expression of ZEB1 was negatively regulated by miR-23b-3p while positively regulated by HOTAIR. Besides that, transfection with miR-23b-3p mimic counteracted the promoting effects of HOTAIR on invasion, migration and EMT of HCC cells. Our in vitro experiments suggested that HOTAIR promoted invasion and migration of HCC cells through enhancing EMT via sponging miR-23b-3p from ZEB1. Finally, the in vivo experiments indicated that HOTAIR could promote metastasis of HCC by enhancing EMT in vivo. Taken together, our study demonstrated that the HOTAIR-miR-23b-3p-ZEB1 axis may provide a new perspective for treatment of HCC.
