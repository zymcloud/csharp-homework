Background:Occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) is recognized as a risk factor for cirrhosis and hepato-cellular carcinoma. However, OBI brings together a large spectrum of patients who might harbor different characteristics and prognosis.Methods:We analyzed the databases of a university hospital in Paris to identify OBI among patients (n = 3966) concomitantly tested for hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and serology during a 7-year period. OBI patients were gathered into clinical entities according to their clinical records.Results:Forty-seven OBIs were identified (1.2%). All patients had detectable anti-HBc, isolated (n = 26) or associated with anti-HBs (n = 21). The proportion of OBIs was 3.4% for patients with isolated anti-HBc and 4.2% for patients with both anti-HBc and anti-HBs. Four clinical categories of OBI patients were identified: patients with a passed HBV infection with HBs Ag clearance (group A, 23.4%); HBV-exposed patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy (group B, 29.8%); HIV/HBV-coinfected patients with therapy discontinuation (group C, 17%); HBV-exposed patients with severe liver conditions (group D, 29.8%). Significant follow-up was available for 32 patients, showing a more deleterious prognosis in group D patients, associated more with their underlying condition than the OBI status.Conclusions:OBI is a heterogeneous condition with various clinical implications.
