The effect of different doses of ulinastatin on cellular immunity and hepatorenal functions in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal-carcinoma surgery was observed and analyzed. The 200 patients with laparoscopic colorectal-carcinoma surgery in our hospital were selected as research subjects and divided into 4 groups containing equal patients, namely, saline group, 0.5 x 104U/kg ulinastatin group, 1 x 104U/kg ulinastatin group, and 1.5 x 104U/kg ulinastatin group, which were denoted as group A, group B, group C and group D, respectively. The treatment effect of patients in 4groups was observed and compared. By observing the Narcotrend cerebral state index (NT index), the results showed that NT index at tracheal intubation, pneumoperitoneum beginning, pneumoperitoneum 30min, resection of tumor, end of operation in 4 groups was significantly lower than that at preoperative anesthesia (T0) (p<0.05); differences in hepatorenal values (AST, ALT, BUN and Cr) among 4 groups at T0 were of no statistical significance (P>0.05); each index in T cell subsets in the postoperative third days (T1) was significantly lower than that at T0; indexes of T cell subgroup of group B, C and D at T1 were higher than that of group A at T1 (p<0.05). For 4 groups, the difference in liver and kidney function indicators at T1 and T0 was of no statistical significance, p>0.05. Different doses of ulinastatin have a certain effect on cellular immunity in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal-carcinoma surgery and do not significantly affect hepatorenal function.
