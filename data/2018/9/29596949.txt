Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major cause of complications and death in many countries. The possible causal relation between T2D and cancer has been the aim of many research investigations. In view of the importance of the topic we carried out a narrative review of observational studies to summarize the available evidence of the association between T2D and cancer. To deal with the problem of abundance of published studies, we reviewed up to December 2017, the literature of meta-analyses of observational studies first, then we reviewed cohort studies not reported in meta-analyses because of more recent publication. We found that the association of T2D with risk of colorectal cancer was robust, whereas the evidence of the associations with other cancer sites was lower. Some of the observed associations could be overestimated, due to publication bias, unmeasured confounders (such as obesity) and surveillance bias. In conclusion a probable causal association of T2D with risk of colorectal cancer was confirmed. A possible causal association with pancreatic, endometrial, hepatocellular and gallbladder carcinoma was also found. Substantial uncertainty exists for other cancer sites.
