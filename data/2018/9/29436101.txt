Background & aims:We evaluated survival outcomes and prognostic factors associated with survival after TACE in a large cohort of 331 patients with HCC with segmental PVTT.Methods:From 1997 to 2015, a total of 331 patients were included in this study from among 507 patients who underwent TACE as a first-line treatment for HCC with segmental PVTT.Results:After TACE, the median survival of the whole cohort was 10.7 months, and the 1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival rates were 44.9%, 16% and 12% respectively. Objective tumour response after TACE was achieved in 53.8% of patients. Multivariable Cox regression analyses confirmed that up-to-11 criteria, extrahepatic metastasis, Child-Pugh class, and tumour response to TACE were independent prognostic factors for patient survival. The expected median survival times among patients with 0, 1 and 2-4 risk factors were 29.1, 15.1 and 5.3 months respectively. The 30-day mortality and major complications rates after TACE were 0.9% and 5.4% respectively.Conclusions:TACE was well-tolerated and effective in selected patients with HCC with segmental PVTT. We found that four risk factors were associated with decreased length of patient survival after TACE: a major tumour burden (up-to-11 criteria out), extrahepatic spread, Child-Pugh class B liver function and nonregression to TACE. TACE may not be recommended for HCC patients with segmental PVTT with 2-4 risk factors because of poor survival outcome.
