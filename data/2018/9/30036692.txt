Background:Bile leakage is a major cause of morbidity after hepatectomy. This study aimed to identify the predictive factors for bile leakage after hepatectomy.Materials and methods:Between January 2011 and December 2016, 556 patients underwent a liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma with curative intent, and were enrolled to participate in this study. The incidence of postoperative bile leakage (POBL) was determined and the predictive factors for POBL were identified using univariate and multivariate analysis.Results:POBLs occurred in 28 patients (5.0%). The multivariate analysis identified a history of stereotactic body radiotherapy, a body mass index 2, Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis, a central hepatectomy, and an operation time ≥375 min as risk factors that were associated with POBL. When the study cohort was grouped according to the number of the predictive factors present, the incidence of POBL increased as the number of the extant independent predictive factors increased. The POBL rate was 45.0% in patients with ≥3 predictive factors.Conclusion:We determined that POBL was associated with operative mortality and identified five independent predictive factors associated with POBL. Risk stratification using these predictive factors may be useful for identifying patients at a high risk of POBL.
