Background:Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) with laparoscopic sentinel lymph node dissection (ESN) and endoscopic full-thickness gastric resection with laparoscopic sentinel lymph node dissection (Hybrid-natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery, Hybrid-NOTES) are minimally invasive treatment options for early gastric cancer (EGC) beyond the indications of ESD. This study aimed to evaluate the short- and long-term clinical outcomes of ESN and Hybrid-NOTES.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed patients who had undergone ESN or Hybrid-NOTES for EGC from January 2009 to March 2013. A total of 48 patients, including 21 undergoing ESN and 27 undergoing Hybrid-NOTES, were enrolled. All patients had cancer stage T1N0M0, EGC less than 5 cm in size, and suspected submucosal invasion according to imaging or biopsy-proven diffuse-type histology.Results:In ESN and Hybrid-NOTES, the curative resection rates were 76.5% and 90.9% of patients, respectively. In the ESN group, 5 patients underwent an additional gastrectomy (1 for lymph node metastasis (LNM), 3 for surgical complications, and 1 for noncurative resection). In the Hybrid-NOTES group, 6 patients underwent additional gastrectomy, (1 for LNM, 3 for surgical complications, and 2 for noncurative resection). Of the 37 patients who were followed up in the long-term (a median follow-up of 59.8 months), one was found to have liver metastasis after ESN and received palliative chemotherapy.Conclusions:ESN and Hybrid-NOTES have shown favorable long-term outcomes despite their technical limitations. These methods may be utilized as a bridge between ESD and gastrectomy in cases of EGC with a high risk of LNM beyond the ESD indications.
