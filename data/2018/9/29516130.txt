Purpose:Radioembolisation is part of the multimodal treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at specialist liver centres. This study analysed the impact of prior treatment on tolerability and survival following radioembolisation.Methods:This was a retrospective analysis of 325 consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HCC, who received radioembolisation with yttrium-90 resin microspheres at eight European centres between September 2003 and December 2009. The decision to treat was based on the clinical judgement of multidisciplinary teams. Patients were followed from the date of radioembolisation to last contact or death and the nature and severity of all adverse events (AEs) recorded from medical records.Results:Most radioembolisation candidates were Child-Pugh class A (82.5%) with multinodular HCC (75.9%) invading both lobes (53.1%); 56.3% were advanced stage. Radioembolisation was used first-line in 57.5% of patients and second-line in 34.2%. Common prior procedures were transarterial (chemo)embolisation therapies (27.1%), surgical resection/transplantation (17.2%) and ablation (8.6%). There was no difference in AE incidence and severity between prior treatment subgroups. Median (95% confidence interval [CI]) survival following radioembolisation was similar between procedure-naive and prior treatment groups for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A: 22.1 months (15.1-45.9) versus 30.9 months (19.6-46.8); p = 0.243); stage B: 18.4 months (11.2-19.4) versus 22.8 months (10.9-34.2); p = 0.815; and stage C: 8.8 months (7.1-10.8) versus 10.8 months (7.7-12.6); p = 0.976.Conclusions:Radioembolisation is a valuable treatment option for patients who relapse following surgical, ablative or vascular procedures and remain suitable candidates for this treatment.
