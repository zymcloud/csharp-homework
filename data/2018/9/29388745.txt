In this study, intravital multiphoton microscopy was used to quantitatively investigate hepatobiliary metabolism in chronic pathologies of the liver. Specifically, through the use of the probe molecule 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, the effects of liver fibrosis, fatty liver, and hepatocellular carcinoma on the metabolic capabilities of mouse liver were investigated. After the acquisition of time-lapse images, a first order kinetic model was used to calculate rate constant resolved images of various pathologies. It was found that the ability of the liver to metabolically process the probe molecules varies among different pathologies, with liver fibrosis and fatty liver disease negatively impacted the uptake, processing, and excretion of molecules. The approach demonstrated in this work allows the study of the response of hepatic functions to different pathologies in real time and is useful for studying processes such as pharmacokinetics through direct optical imaging.
