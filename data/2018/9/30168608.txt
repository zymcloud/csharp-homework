Based on embryological commonalities between eye and heart development, a global, country-specific meta-analysis of normal, adult corneal endothelial cell density (ECD) was performed and correlated against mortality rates secondary to diseases affecting cardiac neural crest cell (CNCC)-derived cardiovascular structures. A country-specific survey of ECD was performed by searching PubMed for studies reporting ECD datasets from normal adults. All eligible datasets were assigned a country of origin. Country-specific weighted mean ECD were calculated based on dataset n. Country-specific disease mortality rates were obtained from the World Health Organization. The correlations between weighted mean ECD and mortality rates secondary to diseases affecting CNCC-derived cardiovascular structures were calculated. As controls, correlations between ECD and noncardiovascular disease mortality were examined. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) corresponding to P-value < 0.05 were considered significant. Three hundred ninety-two datasets (39,762 eyes) from 267 source-studies were assigned to 42 countries. Significant correlations were found between ECD and mortality due to coronary heart disease (r = -0.39, P = 0.011), hypertension (r = -0.33, P = 0.033), and all-cause cardiac disease (r = -0.36, P = 0.019). No significant correlations were found between ECD and mortality secondary to the control conditions: inflammatory heart disease (mesoderm-derived tissues) (r = -0.12, P = 0.45), diabetes (r = -0.13, P = 0.41), lung disease (r = -0.21, P = 0.18), liver disease (r = -0.13, P = 0.41), renal disease (r = -0.10, P = 0.53), lung cancer (r = 0.02, P = 0.90), pancreatic cancer (r = 0.24, P = 0.13), malnutrition (r = -0.07, P = 0.66), or all-cause mortality (r = 0.04, P = 0.81). Negative correlations exist between ECD and mortality due to coronary artery disease and hypertension. On a population-based level, adult ECD is correlated to mortality from certain cardiovascular diseases. Clin. Anat. 31:927-936, 2018. Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
