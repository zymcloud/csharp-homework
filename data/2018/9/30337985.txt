Background:AFP serum levels are considered as diagnostic and specific for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC).Aim:This study aimed to examine the diagnostic value of AFP in the distinguishing of patients with HCC from patients with LC, and to analyse the potential correlation between AFP levels and liver disease stages.Material and methods:Fifty patients with LC and fifty patients with HCC were included in this study. The majority of the patients were males, while the HBV aetiology was dominant.Results:Significant differences between LC and HCC patients were detected for AST, ALT, GGT, bilirubin, AFP and AP. Patients with HCC had higher AFP values compared to LC. There was no significant correlation between the size of the tumour lesion and serum AFP levels. A positive correlation between AFP concentration and GGT activity was determined, as was the negative correlation between AFP and age of the subjects. The AFP value of 23.34 ng/m showed high sensitivity (84%) and specificity (82%).Conclusion:The size of the surface below the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.877 (0.80-0.95), which makes AFP a good biomarker and this diagnostic test is sufficient to separate patients with HCC and LC.
