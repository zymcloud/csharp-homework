Recent hepatitis C virus (HCV) guidelines recommend disease monitoring and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening in patients with advanced fibrosis after a sustained virologic response (SVR) with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. However, data on practice patterns in this setting is lacking. We aimed to characterize disease monitoring and HCC screening practices post-SVR in an underserved HCV-infected cohort. Records of 192 patients who received DAA therapy at the San Francisco safety-net health care system between January 2014 and January 2016 with ≥12 months of follow-up post-SVR were reviewed. Patient characteristics were median age 58 years, 61.5% men, 39.1% White (23.4% Black, 16.7% Latino, 16.2% Asian), 78.1% English proficient, 48.9% intravenous drug use, 53.2% alcohol use, and 41% advanced (F3 and F4) fibrosis (26.6% with decompensation, 11.4% with HCC). Median post-SVR follow-up time was 22 months. A higher proportion of patients with advanced fibrosis attended liver clinic visits (mean, 1.94 ± 2.03 versus 1.12 ± 1.09 visits; P = 0.014) and had liver imaging (41.4% versus 9.73%; P < 0.001) post-SVR, but there was no difference in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) testing (72.2% versus 66.4%; P = 0.40) compared to those without advanced fibrosis. However, 20% with advanced fibrosis had no HCC screening while 35% with no advanced fibrosis had liver imaging. Three patients with cirrhosis developed new HCC. Conclusion: Although the majority of patients with advanced fibrosis in this underserved cohort received post-SVR monitoring, gaps in HCC screening were identified and new cases of HCC occurred during a short follow-up. This highlights the importance of incorporating recently enhanced guidelines to optimize post-SVR monitoring, especially in difficult to engage populations.
