Pleurotus ferulae is a kind of editable mushroom and has various biological functions such as antitumor, antioxidation and immunoregulation. Wild P. ferulae was successfully domesticated but the antitumor function and mechanisms of cultivated and wild P. ferulae need to be compared and explored. Here, we prepared cultivated and wild P. ferulae ethanol extracts (PFEE-C and PFEE-W) and compared their antitumor effect on hepatocellular carcinoma. Our data showed that PFEE-C and PFEE-W significantly inhibited the growth of H22 and HepG2 cells through induction of apoptosis. PFEE-W exhibited higher antitumor activity than PFEE-C. Both PFEE-C and PFEE-W induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress characterized by the up-regulated levels of phosphorylated JNK, cleaved caspase-12 and HSP70, and mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c, which promoted the cleavage of caspase-3, -7, -9 and PARP. Moreover, PFEE-C and PFEE-W significantly increased ROS generation in H22 cells and suppressed H22 cell migration through reducing the levels of matrix metalloproteinase -2 and -9. Further, PFEE-C inhibited H22 tumor growth in mouse model and improved the survival of tumor mice. These results indicated that PFEE-C and PFEE-W could inhibit hepatocellular carcinoma cell growth through ER stress- and mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathways.
