Background:In contrast to the feasibility of hepatectomy for resectable large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, >5 cm) in the younger patients, the concerns of benefits for the elderly patients remain in practice. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes and safety after hepatectomy in elderly patients with resectable large HCC compared with younger patients.Methods:Between 2003 and 2014, a total of 2211 HCC patients were reviewed using a prospective database and 257 patients with resectable large HCC undergoing hepatectomy were included: 79 elderly patients with age â‰¥70 years and 178 younger patients with age Results:The 1-, 3-, 5- and 7-year overall survival rates in the elderly and younger groups were 76%, 55%, 48%, and 42% and 79%, 57%, 51%, and 49%, respectively (P = 0.319). The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-year disease-free survival rates in the elderly and younger groups were 60%, 40%, 38%, and 27% and 54%, 36%, 32%, and 32%, respectively (P = 0.633). The analysis of post-operative outcomes of interest, including hospital stay and hospital death and hepatectomy-related complications in both groups revealed no significant difference. Serum albumin and AJCC TNM stage were independent risk factors for survival. Serum alpha-fetoprotein, tumour number and AJCC TNM stage predicted HCC recurrence.Conclusions:Our results suggested that hepatectomy can achieve comparable long-term outcomes in the selected younger and elderly patients with resectable large HCC.
