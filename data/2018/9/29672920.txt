Heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) overexpresses in various types of cancer, but its expression levels and functions in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still in dispute. We aim to clarify this issue and examine whether HSP60 could be a therapeutic target for HCC. We found drastically enhanced cell apoptosis and suppressed cell proliferation in two HCC cell lines with HSP60-silencing, and also indicated survivin was involved in this regulatory process in vitro and in vivo. However, HSP60-silencing in normal human hepatocytes only resulted in a minimal reduction of cell proliferation but without effects on cell apoptosis. We also showed HSP60 interacted with cytosolic but not mitochondrial survivin by immunoprecipitation assay. A rigorous method was used to standardize quantification from immunoblot assay to obtain more precise expression levels of HSP60 and survivin. The expression of HSP60 and survivin positively correlated in both cancerous and non-cancerous liver tissues (P
