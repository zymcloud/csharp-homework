Background and aims:Induction of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) plays a significant role in reduction of plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Therefore, strategies that enhance the protein level of LDLR provide an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. With this aim in mind, we concentrated our effort on studying the role of AKT kinase in regulation of LDLR levels and proceeded to examine the effect of MK-2206, an allosteric and highly selective AKT inhibitor, on LDLR expression.Methods:Cultured human hepatoma cells were used to examine the effect of MK-2206 on the proteolytic processing of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2), the expression of LDLR and cellular internalization of LDL. We also examined the effect of MK-2206 on LDLR levels in primary human hepatocytes.Results:MK-2206 induced the proteolytic processing of SREBP-2, upregulated LDLR expression and stimulated LDL uptake. In contrast to statins, induction of LDLR levels by MK-2206 did not rely on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) inhibition. As a result, cotreatment of cells with MK-2206 and mevastatin potentiated the impact of mevastatin on LDLR. Importantly, MK-2206 stimulated the expression of LDLR by primary human hepatocytes.Conclusions:MK-2206 is a novel LDLR-inducing agent that, either alone or in combination with statins, exerts a stimulating effect on cellular LDL uptake.
