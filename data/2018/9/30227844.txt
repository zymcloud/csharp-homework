Background:Accelerated malignant behaviors induced by insufficient thermal ablation have been increasingly reported, however, the exact mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we investigated the importance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in modulating the progression of residual hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after heat treatment.Methods:Heat-exposed residual HCC cells were cultured in different ECM gels. We used basement membrane gel (Matrigel) to simulate the normal microenvironment and collagen I to model the pathological stromal ECM. The alterations of morphology and parameters of proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness were analyzed in vitro and in vivo.Results:Increased collagen I deposition was observed at the periablational zone after incomplete RFA of HCC in a xenograft model. The markers of cell proliferation, EMT, motility and progenitor-like traits of heat-exposed residual HCC cells were significantly induced by collagen I as compared to Matrigel (p values all Conclusions:Our findings demonstrate that collagen I could enhance the aggressive progression of residual HCC cells after suboptimal heat treatment and sorafenib may be a treatment approach to thwart this process.
