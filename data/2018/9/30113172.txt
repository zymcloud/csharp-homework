Glycopolymers with large galactose units are attractive in biological processes because of their ability to selectively recognize lectin proteins. Recently, thermoresponsive double-hydrophilic block glycopolymers (TDHBGs) have been designed, which allow sugar residues to expose or hide via the lower critical solution temperature (LCST)-type phase transition. In this work, we first synthesize a new type of TDHBGs, composed of a thermoresponsive poly(di(ethylene glycol)methyl ether methacrylate) block and a galactose-functionalized, poly(6- O-vinyladipoyl-d-galactose) (POVNG) block. The LCST can be tuned by varying the size of the POVNG block. Then, we have systematically investigated their thermoresponsive self-assembly behavior, using static and dynamic light scattering techniques, combined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging. It is found that the TDHBGs possess both micellization and LCST-type transition, and there exist strong interactions between them, depending on the concentration and structure of the TDHBGs. It is particularly interesting that for the same type of TDHBGs under different conditions, such interactions result in rich morphologies of the formed micelles (or nanoparticles) such as spheres, hollow spheres, prolate ellipsoids, crystal-like, and so on, thus potentially enriching their biological applications by noting that they are hepatoma-targeting glycopolymers.
