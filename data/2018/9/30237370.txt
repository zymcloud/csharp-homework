We previously reported that the antitumor response of balloon-occluded transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(BTACE) is better than that of conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(C-TACE). Thus far, little attention has been paid on the efficacy of B-TACE using the same antitumor agents for hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)that is unresponsive to C-TACE, which is defined as C50% necrosis of the targeted nodules or the appearance of new lesions in the liver 1-3 months following one C-TACE procedure. Therefore, this study focused on the efficacy of B-TACE using the same antitumor agents for HCC that is unresponsive to C-TACE. Fourteen patients treated with B-TACE at our institution were retrospectively investigated between January 2011 and August 2015. The median age was 76(interquartile range[IQR]70-79)years, and 9 patients(64.3%)were men. A total of 9(64.3%)and 5(35.7%)patients had the Child-Pugh class A and B, respectively. The median maximum tumor diameter was 30(IQR 18-40)mm, and 4(28.6%), 3(21.4%), 0(0.0%), and 7(50.0%) patients had 1, 2, 3, andB4 tumors, respectively. The antitumor effects were CR, PR, SD, and PD in 6(42.9%), 1(7.1%), 3 (21.4%), and 7(28.6%)patients, respectively. The response and disease control rates were 50% and 71.4%, respectively. Our results suggest that B-TACE is an effective modality for the treatment of HCC that is unresponsive to C-TACE.
