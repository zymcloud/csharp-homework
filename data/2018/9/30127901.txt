Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary liver cancer with high incidence and mortality. miR-185, a microRNA with appriximately 22-28 nucleotides, was reported to be involved in many cancers. The potential mechanism of miR-185 on HCC through cell division cycle 42 (CDC42) was investigated. RT-qPCR was used to measure the RNA level of miR-185 and CDC42 in HCC tissues and cells. The dual luciferase reporter assay was used to verify whether CDC42 was a target gene for miR-185. Transwell assay was employed to detect the ability of migration and invasion to change miR-185. miR-185 expression was low in HCC and negatively correlated with CDC42. miR-185 inhibited HCC migration, invasion and miR-185 low expression predicted poor prognosis. CDC42 was predicted to be a target gene for miR-185, and regulated by miR-185. miR-185 suspressed the ability of cell migration and invasion through CDC42 in HCC. In conclusion, miR-185 suspressed migration and invasion of HCC cells by directly targeting CDC42. It is suggested that miR-185/CDC42 axis may present a novel target for HCC treatment.
