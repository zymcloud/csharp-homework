The survival rate of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and extrahepatic metastases is very poor. Sorafenib, a targeted chemotherapy agent, has been shown effective for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but it is associated with serious side effects. In addition, although surgery has been regarded as effective for lung metastases from HCC, its use in these patients is limited. Complementary and alternative medicine, including traditional Korean medicine (TKM), is increasingly used in cancer treatment, as it has been found to improve patient quality of life and maintain tumor size. This report describes a 62-year-old Korean woman with lung metastases from HCC. She first underwent surgery (stage IV) and six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. She was subsequently treated with sorafenib, but computed tomography showed progressive disease and she experienced the side effects of sorafenib. The patient started treatment with TKM, including pharmacopuncture and herbal medicine, in addition to sorafenib. After 8 weeks of TKM treatment, the size of the metastatic nodules decreased and the sorafenib-associated side effect symptoms improved. These findings suggest that treatment with a combination of TKM and sorafenib may be a promising method for patients with HCC and extrahepatic metastases.
