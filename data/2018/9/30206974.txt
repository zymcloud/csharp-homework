MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous conserved RNAs regulating genes expression through base pairing with the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of target messenger RNAs. MiR-214-5p is a newly identified miRNA with its biological role largely unknown. In this study, we explored miR-214-5p expression status in 78 paired tumor and nontumor tissues obtained from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by RT-qPCR. The effects of miR-214-5p expression on HCC cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and cell migration were measured by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, and wound-healing assay. A dual-luciferase activity assay was performed to identify whether KLF5 was a target of miR-214-5p. Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank test were used to investigate the effects of miR-214-5p and KLF5 on overall survival and disease-free survival of patients with HCC. We found miR-214-5p expression was sharply reduced in HCC tissues and cell lines compared with the normal tissues and cell lines. Functional assay revealed that miR-214-5p overexpression could downregulate cell proliferation, cell migration, and arrested cell cycle at G0/G1 phase. Further, we validated KrÃ¼ppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) as a direct target of miR-214-5p, and was upregulated in HCC and inversely correlated with the expression of miR-214-5p. Moreover, we found the low expression of miR-214-5p and high expression of KLF5 were correlated with tumor size, tumor stage, and poorer 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival of patients with HCC. In conclusion, our results suggested miR-214-5p functions as a tumor suppressor through targeting KLF5 in HCC. Also, miR-214-5p and KLF5 were identified as potential prognostic markers and might be therapeutic targets in HCC.
