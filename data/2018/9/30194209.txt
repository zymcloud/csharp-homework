Background/aim:This study aimed to investigate whether hypervascular intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (HICC) can be differentiated from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Among 100 patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 22 patients were diagnosed with HICC based on the computed tomography (CT) value in the late arterial phase as follows: the CT value of the tumor â‰¥ that of the liver parenchyma. The CT values of the HICC were compared to those of HCC cases (n=120).Results:The CT value of HICC was lower in the unenhanced phase (UP) (p=0.016) and higher in the equilibrium phase (EP) (p2.3 (OR=13.1, pConclusion:E/U ratio is useful for differentiating between HICC and HCC.
