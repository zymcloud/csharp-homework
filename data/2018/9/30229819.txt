Objective:Desmoglein-2 (Dsg2) plays a crucial role in the assembly and adhesion of desmosomes. The absent or aberrant expression of Dsg2 was reported to be associated with the progression of varies human cancers. However, the expression of Dsg2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its association with tumor prognosis is still unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression level of Dsg2 in HCC and of the correlation between Dsg2 expression and clinicopathological variables.Patients and methods:A total of 104 patients diagnosed with HCC were enrolled in this study. Real time-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blot were performed to determine the expression level of Dsg2 in HCC tumor tissues and matched noncancerous tissues. Cell proliferation and cell cycle were measured by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow-cytometry assay, respectively.Results:Our results revealed that Dsg2 expression was significantly higher in HCC tumor tissues than in matched noncancerous tissues (p Conclusions:Taken together, our results suggest that increased Dsg2 expression was associated with tumor progression in HCC and may function as a promising biomarker for unfavorable prognosis of HCC.
