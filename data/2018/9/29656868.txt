Background:The assessment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations is crucial for the management of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-based assessment offers advantages over tumor as a minimally invasive method able to capture tumor heterogeneity.Patients and methods:Consecutive patients diagnosed with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma in tumor biopsy were included in this study. Plasma samples were obtained at different time points during the course of the disease. EGFR mutations in plasma were quantified using BEAMing (beads, emulsions, amplification, and magnetics) or digital PCR and were correlated with mutations in tumor and with radiologic response and progression.Results:Two hundred twenty-one plasma samples from 33 patients were analyzed. EGFR mutations in plasma were detected in 83% of all patients and 100% of those with extrathoracic metastases. The dynamics of the EGFR mutation load predicted response in 93% and progression in 89% of cases well in advance of radiologic evaluation. Progression-free survival for patients in whom ctDNA was not detected in plasma during treatment was significantly longer than for those in whom ctDNA remained detectable (295 vs. 55 days; hazard ratio, 17.1; P < .001).Conclusion:The detection of EGFR mutations in ctDNA showed good correlation with that in tumor biopsy and predicted tumor response and progression in most patients. The liquid biopsy for ctDNA-based assessment of EGFR mutations is a reliable technique for diagnosis and follow-up in patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma in routine clinical practice.
