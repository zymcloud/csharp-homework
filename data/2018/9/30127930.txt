microRNAs (miRNA/miRs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs; they serve important biological roles in tumorigenesis through the regulation of oncogene expression, and they may be used for the diagnosis and treatment of human cancer. miR-375 was identified to exhibit abnormal expression levels in a number of types of tumor; however, the biological role of miR-375 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains incompletely characterized. The present study investigated the expression of miR-375 in human HCC tissues and human liver cancer cell lines; results from a reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that the expression of miR-375 was significantly decreased in tissues and live cancer cell lines, compared with normal tissues and PHH cells. Additional studies demonstrated that the upregulation of miR-375 inhibited human liver cancer cell growth via regulation of cell apoptosis. It was also revealed that the receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (ErbB2) gene was a direct target gene of miR-375, and that the regulation of ErbB2 was associated with the human liver cancer growth. Therefore, the present study demonstrated that miR-375 was expressed at low levels both in human HCC tissues and cell line, compared with normal tissues and PHH cells, and that the induction of miR-375 expression may regulate human liver cancer cell function through targeting the ErbB2 gene, which may potentially improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with HCC in the future.
