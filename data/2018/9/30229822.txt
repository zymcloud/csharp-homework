Objective:We analyzed the clinical observations of target arterial infusion of verapamil combined with chemotherapy as therapy for advanced gastric cancer.Patients and methods:From March 2012 to December 2015, a total of 63 patients with advanced gastric cancer were admitted to our department. The target artery in the control group was perfused with chemotherapy drugs only, and the target artery in the therapy group was injected with verapamil combined with chemotherapy drugs.Results:The therapeutic effect of the therapy group was significantly better than that of the control group in the primary foci of gastric cancer. Liver metastatic lesions: 11 patients in the control group had liver metastases and 25 patients in the therapy group had liver metastases. The effective rate (CR+PR) of the therapy group was significantly better than the control group. Clinical benefit evaluation: in the therapy group of 43 cases, 40 cases presented positive clinical benefit and 38 cases positive clinical weight in KFS scoring system; the clinical benefit of the therapy group was significantly better than control group. Survival analysis: the disease progression-free rate and survival rate of the therapy group were 12 months and 24 months, which were higher than those in the control group. The median PFS and median OS were also significantly longer than those in the control group (p<0.01). In the therapy group, adverse effects of chemotherapy in 43 patients were relieved in a short time.Conclusions:Target arterial infusion of verapamil combined with chemotherapy drugs for advanced gastric cancer can significantly improve the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs and prolong the survival of patients.
