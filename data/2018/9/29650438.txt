Introduction:In liver transplant (LT) patients, hepatitis E virus (HEV) can lead to acute liver failure, chronic hepatitis and graft cirrhosis. Few data on graft rejection associated with HEV are available and are subject to discussion.Case report:Here we report the case of a 58-year-old male patient who underwent LT in July 2015 for cirrhosis due to NASH and chronic alcohol intake complicated by hepatocellular carcinoma. LT was performed with a deceased donor isogroup and a mismatch CMV (donor+ and recipient-). HEV serology was negative before LT. In February 2016, we noted abnormal liver function, with increased transaminases and cholestasis parameters, without functional complaints. The patient was immunosuppressed by tacrolimus (4mg) and everolimus (2mg). Abdominal ultrasound was normal and liver biopsy showed signs of acute rejection (Banff score 6/9). We dispensed 500mg of methylprednisolone before obtaining positive serological results for HEV genotype 3 infection. Ribavirin (1,200mg per day) for 3 months was started, leading to rapid improvement in liver tests. Viral load became negative one month later. To date, the patient is under LP 5mg tacrolimus with normal liver tests.Conclusion:We describe a case of HEV genotype 3 infection mimicking acute cellular rejection, with a favorable outcome due to ribavirin treatment. As intensive immunosuppressive therapy administered for graft rejection may promote viral replication and worsen liver damage, potential HEV infection must be considered in cases of pathological signs of acute cellular rejection, in order to avoid chronic graft hepatitis, cirrhosis and liver decompensation.
