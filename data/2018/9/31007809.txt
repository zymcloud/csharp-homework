Young people under the age of 40 with colorectal cancer represent a distinct subgroup with a more aggressive disease behaviour compared to older patients. This study aim to provide an updated overview on clinicopathological features, treatment and outcome of colorectal cancer in young adults under the age of 40. In our retrospective study, we reviewed 32 cases of colorectal cancer in young adults aged less than 40 years that were diagnosed at the pathology department of Mongi Slim hospital over a fifteen-year period (April 2000 - November 2014). Our study group included 13 male and 19 female patients (sex-ratio M/F = 0,68) between 17 and 39 years of age (mean = 31,25 years). The presenting clinical symptoms were dominated by altered bowel habits (n=17), followed by bleeding per rectum (n=16). Histopathological examination of the surgical and biopsy specimens established the diagnosis of mucinous adenocarcinoma in nine cases, well-differentiated adenocarcinoma in 11 cases, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in six cases, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in four cases and signet ring cell carcinoma in two cases. The tumours were classified after surgery as stage I (n = 2) (6%), stage IIA (n = 7) (22%), stage IIB (n=4) (13%), stage IIC (n=1) (3%), stage IIIB (n=8) (25%), stage IIIC (n= 4) (12%), stage IVA (n=4) (13%) and stage IVB (n=2) (6%). During the follow-up period which ranged between one month and 9 years, local recurrence of the tumour occurred in six cases, seven patients had hepatic metastases and seven patients died after a mean follow-up period of seven months. Molecular genetic studies are increasing the understanding of the pathobiology of colorectal cancer and may ultimately allow at-risk patients to be identified at an earlier stage.
