Angiogenesis appears to be intrinsically associated with the progression of chronic liver diseases, which eventually leads to the development of cirrhosis and related complications, including hepatocellular carcinoma. Several studies have suggested that this association is relevant for chronic liver disease (CLD) progression, with angiogenesis. The fact that angiogenesis plays a pivotal role in CLDs gives rise to new opportunities for treating CLDs. Inhibitor of angiogenesis has proved effective for the treatment of patients suffering from CLD. However, it is limited in diagnosis. The last decade has witnessed a plethora of publications which elucidate the potential of angiogenesis inhibitors for the therapy of CLD. The close relationship between the progression of CLDs and angiogenesis emphasizes the need for anti-angiogenic therapy to block/slow down CLD progression. The present review summarizes all these discussions, the results of the related studies carried out to date and the future prospects in this field. We discuss liver angiogenesis in normal and pathophysiologic conditions with a focus on the role and future use of angiogenic factors as second-line treatment of CLD. This review compiles relevant findings and offers opinions that have emerged in last few years relating liver angiogenesis and its treatment using anti-angiogenic factors.
