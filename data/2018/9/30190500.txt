Emerging evidence has revealed that Nestin not only serves as a biomarker for multipotent stem cells, but also regulates cell proliferation and invasion in various tumors. However, the mechanistic contributions of Nestin to cancer pathogenesis are still unknown. In the present study, previously thought to reside exclusively in the cytoplasm, Nestin can also be found in the nucleus and participate in protecting tumor cells against cellular senescence. Specifically, we reveal that Nestin has a nuclear localization signal (aa318-aa347) at the downstream of rod domain. We then find nuclear Nestin could interact with lamin A/C. Mechanistic investigations demonstrate that Nestin depletion results in the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), which causes the phosphorylation of lamin A/C (mainly at S392 site) and its subsequent translocation to the cytoplasm for degradation. The findings establish a role for nuclear Nestin in tumor senescence, which involves its nucleus-localized form and interaction with lamin A/C.
