Purpose:To report current practices of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) by interventional radiologists (IR) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through a French national survey.Materials and methods:An electronic survey was sent by e-mail to 232 IRs performing TACE in 32 private or public centers. The survey included 66 items including indications for TACE, technical aspects of TACE, other locally available treatments for HCC, follow-up imaging and general aspects of interventional radiology practices.Results:A total of 64 IRs (64/232; 27%) answered the survey. Each IR performed a mean of 49±45 (SD) TACE procedures per year. Marked variations in indications for TACE in HCC were observed. Six percent of IRs (4/64) treated only patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B HCC. Antibioprophylaxis was not used by 43/64 of IRs (67%). The number of HCC nodules was considered to select conventional TACE versus drug-eluting beadsTACE (DEB-TACE) by 17/49 IRs (35%) followed by patient performance status and Child-Pugh score by 6/49 IRs (12%). Seventy-three percent of IRs (45/62) treated nodules selectively in patients with unilobar disease with cTACE. Thirty-three percent of IRs (21/64) planned systematically a second TACE session. Doxorubicin was the most frequently used drug (52/64; 81%) and 15/64 IRs (23%) used gelatine sponge as the only embolic agent. For DEB-TACE, 100-300μm beads were used by 26/49 IRs (53%) and no additional embolization was performed by 19/48 IRs (39%). Monopolar radiofrequency technique was widely available (59/63; 94%) compared to selective internal radiation therapy (37/64; 58%). Magnetic resonance imaging was used for follow-up by 13/63 IRs (20%).Conclusion:Current practices of TACE for HCC varied widely among IRs suggesting a need for more standardized practices.
