Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may lead to end-stage liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We have shown previously that microRNA-373 (miR-373) is upregulated in HCV-infected human liver biopsy specimens. To gain insight into the role of miR-373 in HCV-mediated pathogenesis, we investigated its interacting partner for hepatocyte growth regulation. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) data revealed that Wee1 is associated with miR-373 and is a direct target. Interestingly, higher expression of Wee1 was noted in HCV-infected hepatocytes than in uninfected hepatocytes, suggesting that other factors may block miR-373-mediated Wee1 inhibition. We subsequently found an association between the long noncoding RNA NORAD (LINC00657) and miR-373, and we demonstrated that NORAD binds to miR-373 and Wee1 independently. However, the high level of Wee1 expression in HCV-infected hepatocytes suggested that miR-373 forms a complex with NORAD. Depletion of miR-373 or the inhibitor Wee1 reduces the growth of Huh7.5 cells harboring the HCV genome as well as reducing Wee1 expression. Taken together, our data demonstrate a novel mechanism of hepatocyte growth promotion during HCV infection involving a miR-373-NORAD-Wee1 axis, which may be a target for future therapy against HCV-associated HCC.IMPORTANCE The mechanism of HCV-mediated liver pathogenesis is poorly understood. In this study, we observed that HCV infection upregulates miR-373 and Wee1, a pivotal player in the G2 checkpoint in the cell cycle, although Wee1 is a direct target for miR-373. Subsequent investigation demonstrated that miR-373 forms a complex with the long noncoding RNA NORAD, resulting in the release of their common target, Wee1, in HCV-infected cells, which, in turn, favors uncontrolled cell growth. Our study suggested a previously unknown mechanism for hepatocyte growth promotion following HCV infection, and this pathway can be targeted for future therapy against HCV-mediated liver pathogenesis.
