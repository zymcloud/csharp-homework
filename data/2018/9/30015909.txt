HES6 is a member of the hairy-enhancer of the split homolog family, which has been implicated in oncogenesis and cancer progression in a variety of human cancers, including prostate and breast cancer. However, its clinical significance and biological role in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. In the present study, the expression of HES6 was significantly upregulated in CRC cell lines and CRC tissues at both the mRNA and protein levels. The present study also reported high expression of HES6 in 138/213 (64.8%) paraffin-embedded archived CRC specimens. HES6 expression was significantly correlated with T classification (P<0.001), N classification (P=0.020), and distant metastasis (P<0.001). Patients with higher HES6 expression levels exhibited a reduced overall survival (P<0.001). In addition, a multivariate analysis revealed that the expression of HES6 may be a novel prognostic marker for the survival of patients with CRC. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that ectopic expression of HES6 enhanced the migration and invasive abilities of CRC cells. These abilities were significantly inhibited upon knockdown of endogenous HES6 expression by specific short hairpin RNAs. Additionally, the present study reported that the effects of HES6 on metastasis may be associated with the activation of the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway. Collectively, the findings of the present study revealed that overexpression of HES6 played a key role in the progression of CRC, leading to a poor prognosis and clinical outcome.
