Aim:As second-line therapy, regorafenib has been shown to provide a survival benefit for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who progress on sorafenib. In this retrospective study, we assessed the clinical outcomes of sorafenib treatment failure with regard to second-line chemotherapy.Methods:Patients (n = 160) with advanced HCC, Child-Pugh A liver function and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 0-1 treated with sorafenib between June 2009 and September 2016 were enrolled. Among 147 patients with progressive disease (PD), we defined those with Child-Pugh A liver function and ECOG PS 0-1 at progression as candidates for second-line chemotherapy and those who had tolerated sorafenib (≥400 mg/day for ≥20 of the last 28 days of treatment) as candidates eligible for regorafenib treatment.Results:Among all 160 patients, median overall survival was 10 months, and median progression-free survival was 3.5 months. Among the 147 patients with PD, 74 (50.3%) were candidates for second-line chemotherapy, and 45 (30.6%) were eligible for regorafenib treatment. The median post progression survival of the candidates for second-line chemotherapy (8.8 months) was statistically longer (P = 0.0002) than that of the non-candidates (3.6 months). Predictive factors for candidates were absence of macroscopic vascular invasion (MVI) (odds ratio [OR], 0.39; P = 0.009) and serum albumin >3.5 g/dL (OR, 3.3; P = 0.005) at sorafenib initiation.Conclusion:Among patients with PD on sorafenib, approximately 30% were eligible for regorafenib treatment, whereas few patients with MVI or hypoalbuminemia at sorafenib initiation were eligible for regorafenib treatment.
