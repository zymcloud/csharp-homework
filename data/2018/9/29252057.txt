Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) develops in 1-3% of liver transplant recipients and no consensus exists about therapeutic management. From 2006 to 2016, 1489 liver transplants were performed at our institution with 20 patients (incidence 1.3%) developing PTLD. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was the leading cause (n = 10) of liver transplant in PTLD patients. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was the most frequent histologic subtype (n = 17), and we report our experience in the management of these patients. Patients were treated with frontline immunochemotherapy without immunosuppression reduction. All evaluable patients achieved a complete remission. Statistically significant decreased survival was identified in HCV-positive patients. Six patients (60%) exhibited increases in HCV RNA levels during therapy. Four patients (40%) developed graft failure and three of them (30%) died from liver dysfunction. This is the first study providing evidence of decreased survival in HCV-positive PTLD patients after liver transplant receiving immunochemotherapy.
