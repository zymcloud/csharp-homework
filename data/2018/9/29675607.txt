Introduction:A small proportion of patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) suffer from recurrent porphyric attacks, with a severely diminished quality of life. In this retrospective case-control study, the burden of disease is quantified and compared among three AIP patient subgroups: cases with recurrent attacks, cases with one or occasional attacks and asymptomatic carriers.Methods:Data from patient records and questionnaires were collected in patients between 1960 and 2016 at the Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. We collected symptoms related to porphyria, porphyria related complications, attack frequency, hospitalisation frequency, hospitalisation days related to acute porphyric attacks, frequency of heme infusions and medical healthcare costs based on hospitalisations and heme therapy.Results:In total 11 recurrent AIP cases, 24 symptomatic AIP cases and 53 AIP carriers as controls were included. All recurrent patients reported porphyria related symptoms, such as pain, neurological and/or psychiatric disorders, and nearly all developed complications, such as hypertension and chronic kidney disease. In the recurrent cases group, the median lifelong number of hospitalisation days related to porphyric attacks was 82 days per patient (range 10-374), and they spent a median of 346 days (range 34-945) at a day-care facility for prophylactic heme therapy; total follow-up time was 243 person-years (PYRS). In the symptomatic non-recurrent group the median lifelong number of hospitalisation days related to porphyric attacks was 7 days per patient (range 1-78), total follow-up time was 528 PYRS. The calculated total medical healthcare cost for recurrent cases group was €5.8 million versus €0.3 million for the symptomatic cases group.
