Background/objective: HCC is a multistep process starting from chronic hepatitis that progress through cirrhosis to HCC. MicroRNA expression level was found to be deregulated in HCC. To find out whether the expression level of miR-34a and miR-183 was deregulated in HCC compared to controls without HCC. Methods: Real time quantitative PCR was done to find out the miRNA expression level in terms of Ct value followed by statistical analysis. Results: Over-expression of miR-183 and under-expression of miR-34a in HCC was detected. All changes in expression level of miR-34a and miR-183 were found to be due to HCC compared to controls without HCC. So both miR-34a and miR-183 were suitable to differentiate HCC from Cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis with an efficient diagnostic power of sensitivity, specificity and expression level. But they might not have any role in patientsâ€™ survival. Conclusion: miR- 34a and miR-183 might be considered as potential markers of HCC screening molecule in addition to other approved panel of marker. Our study warrants further expression level study.
