The impact of sustained virologic response (SVR) on mortality after direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment is not well documented in patients without advanced liver disease and affects access to treatment. This study evaluated the impact of SVR achieved with interferon-free DAA treatment on all-cause mortality in hepatitis C virus-infected patients without advanced liver disease. This observational cohort analysis was comprised of 103,346 genotype 1, 2, and 3, hepatitis C virus-monoinfected patients without advanced liver disease, defined by FIB-4 â‰¤3.25 and no diagnosis of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, or hepatocellular carcinoma or history of liver transplantation, identified from the Veterans Affairs Hepatitis C Clinical Case Registry. Among 40,664 patients treated with interferon-free DAA regimens, 39,374 (96.8%) achieved SVR and 1,290 (3.2%) patients were No SVR; 62,682 patients constituted the untreated cohort. The mortality rate for SVR patients of 1.18 deaths/100 patient-years was significantly lower than the rates for both No SVR patients (2.84 deaths/100 patient-years; P Conclusion:Successfully treating hepatitis C virus with DAAs in patients without clinically apparent advanced liver disease translates into a significant mortality benefit.
