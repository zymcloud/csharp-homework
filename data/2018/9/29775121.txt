Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the major malignancies associated with high mortality rates. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) alone, or in combination with conventional therapies (CT), has been widely used for patients with HCC in China. This study aims to explore how integrative therapy (IT) through the combination of CHM and CT affects the survival of patients with intermediate-advanced HCC.Methods:A retrospective cohort study was performed at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China. Data of consecutive patients diagnosed with intermediate-advanced HCC and a specific traditional Chinese medicine diagnostic pattern between January 2006 and December 2013 were retrieved from the electronic medical record system at the hospital. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on the therapies used, that is, IT, CHM alone, and CT alone, and the survival times of these patients was compared.Results:A total of 328 patients were included in this study. Median follow-up period was 26.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI] = 22.7-38.9). Median overall survival was 11.0 months for IT, 8.6 months for CHM, and 9.4 months for CT groups ( P Conclusions:It was indicated that the integrative approach with combination of CHM and CT might improve survival for patients with intermediate-advanced HCC, especially for patients with good PS and Child-Pugh class A. However, a randomized controlled trial is warranted for a conclusive statement.
