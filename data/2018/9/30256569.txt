Pre-and-post-tests were measured using predesigned questionnaires. The comparative analysis was analyzed by paired sample t-test and independent sample t-test at the 0.05 level of significance. The results revealed that the experimental group had significantly greater knowledge, self-efficacy, expectation, and practice for liver fluke prevention than those in the comparison group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, this was a successful health education program for liver fluke avoidance. Participants were gained the correct knowledge and had the higher self-efficacy, expectation, and practice regrading liver fluke prevention. Therefore, it may useful for further behavior modification in the other epidemic areas.
