Background and aims:The United States spends more money per person on health care than any other country in the world. Patients with cirrhosis are at an increased risk of health-care utilization. The aim of this study is to evaluate differences in health-care utilization based on the region of treatment during the inpatient management of patients with cirrhosis.Method:A retrospective database analysis using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample was performed, including adult patients with a primary diagnosis of cirrhosis determined by ICD-9 codes. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to analyze liver decompensation, mortality, length of stay, and total charges in different regions across the United States.Results:A total of 75 280 patients with cirrhosis who received treatment in nine different regions across the United States were included. Rates of liver decompensation were significantly decreased in the Pacific region compared to the New England region (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.51-0.94). Length of stay was significantly different between regions; however, the means only varied by half a day and were of minimal clinical significance. Inpatient mortality rates were not significantly different between regions. Total charges for inpatient management between regions were significantly different, with the Pacific region having the highest total hospital charges with a mean of $82 731.Conclusions:Health-care utilization during the inpatient management of cirrhosis varies based on the region. The charges for treatment were the highest in the West despite no impact on mortality, minimal improvement in length of stay, and fewer features of decompensation on admission.
