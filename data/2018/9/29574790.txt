Nowadays, epigenetics covers a crucial role in different fields of science. The enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), the catalytic subunit of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), is a big proponent of how epigenetic changes can affect the initiation and progression of several diseases. Through its catalytic activity, responsible for the tri-methylation of lysine 27 of the histone H3 (H3K27me3), EZH2 is a good target for both diagnosis and therapy of different pathologies. A large number of studies have demonstrated its crucial role in cancer initiation and progression. Nevertheless, only recently its function in virus diseases has been uncovered; therefore, EZH2 can be an important promoter of viral carcinogenesis. This review explores the role of EZH2 in viral epigenetics based on recent progress that demonstrated the role of this protein in virus environment. In particular, the review focuses on EZH2 behavior in Hepatitis B Virus, analyzing its role in the rise of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
