Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant tumor usually resistant to chemotherapy. MicroRNAs play important roles in modulation of carcinogenesis and chemoresistance, which miR-16 has been reported to mediate chemoresistance in many types of cancers. However, the role of miR-16 in HCC remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether miR-16 is participated in chemoresistance in HCC and shed light on the underlying molecular mechanisms. The findings of the current study discover that miR-16 is down-regulated in HCC tissue and cell lines. The results demonstrate that the inhibition of miR-16 renders resistance to paclitaxel in vitro and in vivo by targeting IKBKB via NF-κB signaling pathway, suggesting that miR-16 may be a meaningful therapeutic potential to overcome drug resistance in HCC.
