Purpose:To investigate whether perfusion-CT (p-CT) imaging could depict the inhibition of tumor neoangiogenesis induced by Sorafenib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and whether it could be useful in predicting survival during treatment.Materials and methods:Ninety-eight p-CT examinations were performed among 29 cirrhotic patients, with advanced HCC, before and every 2 months after Sorafenib administration, on a 256-slice MDCT scanner. Perfusion parameters were considered and statistically compared, at baseline and follow-up, between non-progressor (complete response, stable disease or partial response) and progressor (progressive disease) group. Kaplan-Meier analyses estimated the time-to-survival in overall population, after stratifying patients according to mRECIST.Results:The group that responded to Sorafenib showed a significant reduction of values in HCC target lesions after anti-angiogenic therapy (p Conclusion:Quantitative analysis of perfusion parameters, represents prognostic indicators useful in assessment of response to anti-angiogenic therapy, allowing for optimization of individualized treatment.
