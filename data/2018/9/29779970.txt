Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common malignancy in liver. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is recommended as an effective treatment in advanced HCC patients. Recent studies showed iodine-125 seed (a low-energy radionuclide) can provide long-term local control and increase survival for HCC patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcome of TACE plus iodine-125 seed in comparison with TACE alone for HCC.Methods:A comprehensive search of studies among PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was conducted with published date from the earliest to January 10th, 2018. No language restrictions were applied, while only prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or non-randomized controlled trials (non-RCTs) were eligible for a full-text review. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), response rate (the rate of partial atrophy or complete clearance of the tumor lesion) and adverse events (AEs). The odds ratios (ORs) were combined using either fixed-effects model or random-effects model. All statistical analyses were performed using the Stata 12.0 software.Results:9 studies were included, involving 894 patients. Among them, 473 patients received combined therapy of TACE plus iodine-125 implantation, compared with 421 patients with TACE alone. Patients receiving combined therapy of TACE plus iodine-125 showed significantly improvement in 1-year OS (OR = 4.47, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 2.97-6.73; P Conclusions:Based on these findings, TACE plus iodine-125 implantation achieves better clinical efficacy compared with TACE alone in the treatment of HCC.
