The gene leukocyte-specific protein-1 (LSP1), encodes an F-actin binding protein that directly interacts with the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. LSP1 has copy number variations in 52% of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). LSP1 suppresses proliferation and migration in hepatocytes. LSP1 binds to the rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF)/mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/ERK signaling cassette, the target for sorafenib, a crucial chemotherapeutic agent for HCC. This study addresses the role of LSP1 in liver regeneration and sensitivity to sorafenib in normal and neoplastic hepatocytes. Two mouse models, an Lsp1 global knockout (LSP1KO) and a hepatocyte-specific Lsp1 transgenic (LSP1TG) mouse, were used. After two-thirds hepatectomy (PHx), LSP1KO mice displayed increased proliferation and ERK activation, whereas LSP1TG mice displayed suppressed proliferation and decreased ERK activation. LSP1KO hepatocytes cultured without growth factors exhibited increased proliferation, whereas LSP1TG hepatocytes showed decreased proliferation. Rat and human hepatoma cells expressing Lsp1 shRNA displayed increased sensitivity to sorafenib, as evidenced by decreased cell numbers and phosphorylated ERK expression compared with control. LSP1 KO mice treated with sorafenib before PHx displayed decreased hepatocyte proliferation. Our data show that loss of LSP1 function, observed in HCC, leads to increased sensitivity to sorafenib treatment and enhanced hepatocellular proliferation after PHx in vivo and in cultured cells.
