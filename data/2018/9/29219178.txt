Accumulating evidence has supported the significance of lncRNAs in tumorigenesis. Recently, some studies indicate the oncogenic role of lncRNA Nuclear Enriched Abundant Transcript 1 (NEAT1) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In our present study, we focused on the biological mechanisms through which NEAT1 can regulate HCC development. We found that NEAT1 was greatly upregulated in human HCC cell lines including Huh7, Hep3B, HepG2, Bel-7404, and SK-Hep1 cells compared to the normal human liver cell line LO2. In addition, we observed that miR-485 was significantly downregulated in HCC cells. It was implied that miR-485 was increased by sh-NEAT1 and miR-485 can modulate NEAT1 expression negatively. Meanwhile, NEAT1inhibiton can repress HCC growth, migration, and invasion capacity in HepG2 and Hep3B cells. Through performing bioinformatic analysis, dual-luciferase reporter test, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation, and RNA pull-down assay, miR-485 was confirmed as a interacting target of NEAT1. Additionally, STAT3 was recognized as a direct target of miR-485 and miR-485 mimics can inhibit STAT3 expression. It was demonstrated that NEAT1 can increase STAT3 levels while miR-485 mimics can repress STAT3. Moreover, we found that sh-STAT3 was able to restrain HCC cell migration and invasion process. NEAT1 can act as a competing endogenous lncRNA (ceRNA) to regulated STAT3 by sponging miR-485 in HCC. Taken these together, NEAT1 can be used as an important biomarker in HCC diagnosis and treatment.
