Tumor self-seeding occurs when circulating malignant cells reinfiltrate the original tumor. The process may breed more aggressive tumor cells, which may contribute to cancer progression. In this study, we observed tumor self-seeding in mouse xenograft models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for the first time. We confirmed that circulating tumor cell uptake of tumor-derived exosomes, which are increasingly recognized as key instigators of cancer progression by facilitating cell-cell communication, promoted tumor self-seeding by enhancing the invasive and migration capability of recipient HCC cells. Horizontal transfer of exosomal microRNA-25-5p to anoikis-resistant HCC cells significantly enhanced their migratory and invasive abilities, whereas inhibiting microRNA-25-5p alleviated these effects. Our experiments delineate an exosome-based novel pathway employed by functional microRNA from the original tumor cells that can influence the biological fate of circulating tumor cells.
