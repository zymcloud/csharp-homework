Background:The aim of the present study was to modify the structural activity of zinc(II)phthalocyanine by combining it with thiophenyl groups then loaded in lipid nano-carriers and evaluate its parameters required for the structure-activity relationship (SAR) for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer.Methods:Tetra (4-Thiophenyl) sulfonated phthalocyaninatozinc(II) (PhS路SO3Na)4ZnPc 5 was synthesized and characterized by various spectroscopic methods as a test compound. Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells were treated with the synthesized (PhS路SO3Na)4ZnPc 5 derivative loaded in lipid nano carriers to understand the effect of combined compound on liver cancer cells. Furthermore, HepG2 cells were irradiated by visible red light at 60 mW/cm2 for 20 min. The phototoxicity of (PhS路SO3Na)4ZnPc 5 after being formulated in both (L) and transfersomes (T) was investigated.Results:Overall, the results indicate that combination of thiophenyl groups substitution, in particular in the structure of sulfonated zinc phthalocyanine is able to improve the photodynamic properties of ZnPc, and (PhS路SO3Na)4ZnPc 5 loaded in lipid nano-carriers can be a promising combined PDT treatment strategy for Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells.Conclusions:The new formulation ZnPc-lipid nano-carriers will be beneficial in the upcoming clinical trials and would enhance the inhibition of tumor growth.
