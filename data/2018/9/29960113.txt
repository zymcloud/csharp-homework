Oleuropein (OLE), a main constituent of olive, exhibits antioxidant and hypolipidemic effects, while it reduces the infarct size in chow- and cholesterol-fed rabbits. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) has essential roles in the control of lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. This study focused on the mechanisms underlying the hypolipidemic activity of OLE and, specifically, on the role of PPARα activation in the OLE-induced effect. Theoretical approach using Molecular Docking Simulations and luciferase reporter gene assay indicated that OLE is a ligand of PPARα. The effect of OLE (100 mg/kg, p.o., per day, ×6 weeks) on serum triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol levels was also assessed in adult male wild-type and Ppara-null mice. Molecular Docking Simulations, Luciferase reporter gene assay and gene expression analysis indicated that OLE is a PPARα agonist that up-regulates several PPARα target genes in the liver. This effect was associated with a significant reduction of serum TG and cholesterol levels. In contrast, OLE had no effect in Ppara-null mice, indicating a direct involvement of PPARα in the OLE-induced serum TG and cholesterol reduction. Activation of hormone-sensitive lipase in the white adipose tissue (WAT) and the liver of wild-type mice and up-regulation of several hepatic factors involved in TG uptake, transport, metabolism and clearance may also contribute in the OLE-induced TG reduction. In summary, OLE has a beneficial effect on TG homeostasis via PPARα activation. OLE also activates the hormone sensitive lipase in the WAT and liver and up-regulates several hepatic genes with essential roles in TG homeostasis.
