Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays an important role in embryonic development. It becomes reactivated in many types of acute and chronic liver injuries. Hh signaling is required for liver regeneration, regulates capillarisation, controls the fates of hepatic stellate cells, promotes liver fibrosis and liver cancers. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the role of canonical Hh signaling pathway in adult liver. This help to understand the pathogenesis of liver diseases and find out the new effective targeted therapeutic strategies for liver diseases treatments.
