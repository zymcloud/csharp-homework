Background:Growing evidence supports that prostate cancer (PCa) is a metabolic syndrome-related cancer, but the evidence is lacking regarding the association between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and PCa. We aimed to investigate whether PCa is related with NAFLD in Korean adults.Methods:Data from the National Health Insurance Corporation between 2009 and 2012 were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression method. NALFD was defined based on the fatty liver index (FLI) and hepatic steatosis index (HSI). Newly diagnosed PCa was identified using the claims data.Results:NAFLD based on FLI and HSI was identified in 2,002,375 (19%) and 2,629,858 (25%) of 10,516,985 subjects, respectively. Each FLI ≥ 60 and HSI ≥ 36 was independently associated with the development of PCa after adjusting for other confounders (hazard ratio (HR) 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06-1.12 and HR 1.19, 95% CI: 1.16-1.23). The association was more prominent among those who were older (FLI, ≥ 65 years old and HSI, ≥ 40 years old), were not currently smoking, were presently consuming alcohol (< 30g/day) and had null components of metabolic syndrome than each counterpart. Non-obese persons with NAFLD defined by HSI had a higher risk of developing PCa than those with body mass index > 25 Kg/m2.Conclusions:NAFLD defined by FLI or HSI may help identify high-risk individuals for developing PCa particular in the elderly, even in the absence of obesity or metabolic syndrome. Future studies on this topic should necessarily be repeated based on ultrasonographic findings.
