Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) and resection are effective treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, optimizing OLT and limiting HCC recurrence remains a vexing problem. New HCC Model for End-Stage Liver Disease and allocation algorithms provide greater observation of HCC patients, many while receiving local-regional treatments. Potential benefits of local-regional treatment for limiting HCC recurrence after OLT remain incompletely understood. Therefore, we aimed to define HCC-specific prognostic factors affecting recurrence in a contemporary, multicenter cohort of HCC patients undergoing OLT and specifically whether local-regional therapies limited recurrence. We identified 441 patients undergoing OLT for HCC at 3 major transplant centers from 2008 to 2013. Cox regression was used to analyze covariate-adjusted recurrence and mortality rates after OLT. "Bridging" or "downstaging" therapy was used in 238 (54%) patients with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) being used in 170 (71%) of treated patients. The survival rate after OLT was 88% and 78% at 1 and 3 years, respectively, with HCC recurrence (28% of deaths) significantly increasing the mortality rate (hazard ratio [HR], 19.87; P
