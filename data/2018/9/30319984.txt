Background:Although studies have reported on long-term (10-year) survival after hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), they did not focus on patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related HCC, and the contribution of antiviral therapy to long-term survival (especially ≥15 years) has not been adequately examined. We investigated the long-term outcome after hepatic resection for HCV-related HCC, including the effects of interferon (IFN) therapy, and the changes in prognostic factors according to postoperative duration.Methods:The data of 207 patients who underwent hepatic resection for HCV-related HCC between January 1992 and December 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. We investigated the disease-free and overall survival rates after surgery and analyzed the prognostic factors at 5, 10, and 15 years postoperatively.Results:The proportion of patients who survived at 5, 10, and 15 years after hepatic resection was 52% (n = 107), 18% (n = 38), and 9% (n = 19). The overall survival rate was significantly higher in patients who achieved sustained virological response (SVR) with IFN therapy than in those without SVR. Tumor-related factors such as multiple tumor, microscopic vascular invasion, and a high indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (ICGR15) were unfavorable prognostic factors for 5-year survival. Conversely, a low ICGR15 and SVR were favorable prognostic factors at 10 years, and SVR alone was a favorable prognostic factor at 15 years postoperatively; no tumor-related factors were prognostic factors at 10 and 15 years postoperatively.Conclusion:The prognostic factors varied according to the duration after hepatic resection for HCV-related HCC. Tumor-related factors were unfavorable prognostic factors in the early postoperative period, whereas SVR and good liver function were favorable prognostic factors at 10 and 15 years postoperatively. Achievement of SVR with IFN therapy is essential for long-term (≥15 years) survival after hepatic resection for HCV-related HCC.
