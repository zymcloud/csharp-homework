Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and HBV-related liver disease are estimated to affect about 240 million people worldwide. Now that a vaccine is available, the number of new HBV infection cases has plummeted. Yet, there are still regions with very high incidence of HBV. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth to six most common malignancy in men and the ninth most common malignancy in women worldwide. 54% of all HCC cases are HBV-associated, making it the most common cause of cancer worldwide. Hepatitis B therapy prevents progression of chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis and HCC development, but even with the best HBV treatment, such patients are still at risk of HCC. Also in patients after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), liver resection (hepatectomy) or liver transplant, suppression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) improves patient survival. In this paper we present current possibilities of HCC and HBV treatment, which lead to improved survival and quality of life.
