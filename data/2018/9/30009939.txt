Aims:To explore the association of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and alpha fetoprotein (AFP).Methods:750 patients with T2DM (T2DM group), 800 healthy people (control group) and 501 patients newly diagnosed with HCC were recruited from 2010 to 2016. The HCC patients were further divided into a HCC with T2DM (HCC+DM) group and a HCC without diabetes mellitus (HCC+NDM) group.Results:The T2DM group had a 12.61% lower geometric mean AFP level than the healthy control group (2.08 vs. 2.38 Î¼g/L, P Conclusions:T2DM was associated with lower AFP level, worse liver function and higher risk of high-grade HCC. We speculated that low AFP levels in diabetics might delay and interfere with HCC diagnosis, leading to higher degree of malignant HCC.
