Background:The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) of the stomach, and the efficacy of the modified docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (mDCF) chemotherapy regimen.Patients and methods:Sixty-five patients diagnosed with metastatic or recurrent SRCC and treated with at least one course of mDCF regimen as the first-line treatment at our hospital July 2007 and January 2015, were included in this study. The mDCF protocol comprised docetaxel at 60 mg/m2/day (day 1), cisplatin at 60 mg/m2/day (day 1), and 5-fluorouracil at 600 mg/m2/day (days 1-5) for every 3 weeks.Results:The median age was 53 years (range, 25-69 years). The most frequent sites of metastasis were the peritoneum (50.8%) and liver (21.5%). The median number of chemotherapy courses was six. In assessing 61 patients for response evaluation, one patient (1.6%) achieved a complete response, and 36 (59.0%) achieved a partial response. Fifteen patients (24.6%) had stable disease and nine (14.8%) had progressive disease. Grades 3-4 hematological toxicity revealed anemia in three (4.6%) patients, thrombocytopenia in two (3.1%), and neutropenia in five (7.7%). Grades 3-4 nonhematological side effects revealed nausea and vomiting in four (6.1%) patients and mucositis in one (1.5%). The overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 10.4 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 8.9-12.0) and 6.1 months (95% CI, 5.1-7.0), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 2 and a high pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen level were statistically significant.Conclusions:mDCF is an effective regimen in patients with SRCC of the stomach who have ECOG performance score of 0-1 when the PFS, OS, and tumor response rate are considered. Further prospective studies including more patients should be conducted on this subject.
