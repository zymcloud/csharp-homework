Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common and high incidence disease in China. It is presently thought that diabetes is one of the independent risk factor for HCC. Diabetes and liver cancer are closely related, but the relationship and mechanism of diabetes and liver cancer are quite complex and controversial. Insulin resistance, glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism disorders, and abnormal release of inflammatory mediators are the common bases of these two diseases. The molecular mechanisms of glycogen synthase kinase-3, toll like receptor 4, CCL5, CXCL14 and NCOA5, TCF7L2 genes affecting the correlation between liver cancer and diabetes mellitus are discussed and explained to provide the basis for the study and treatment of disease.
