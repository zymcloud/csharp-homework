Purpose:Recent advances in multidisciplinary treatments are improving the postoperative prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, the prognosis even after potentially curative resection remains poor. The aim of this study was to identify the clinical and pathological features of actual 5-year survivors under current circumstances.Methods:A total of 128 patients who underwent pancreatectomy for PDAC at our institution between January 2006 and December 2011 were retrospectively analyzed.Results:The actual 5-year overall survival rate for all patients was 30.9%, with a median survival time of 33.1 months. Of 128 patients, 25 (19.5%) survived for 5 years after surgery without disease recurrence. A univariate analysis showed that the pretreatment serum CA19-9 value, tumor depth, lymph node metastasis, and UICC stage at resection were significant predictive factors for the actual long-term survival. A multivariate analysis showed that a pretreatment serum CA19-9 value â‰¥ 110 U/mL was a significant unfavorable prognostic indicator. In addition, all subjects in the 5-year survival group completed adjuvant chemotherapy. The recurrence rate in the liver was significantly lower and that in the lung significantly higher in the long-term survival group than in the short-term survival group.Conclusions:The factors contributing to the long-term survival of PDAC were the pretreatment CA19-9 value and the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. To achieve the actual long-term survival and cure after pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer, further treatment strategies enhancing the completion rate of adjuvant chemotherapy are required.
