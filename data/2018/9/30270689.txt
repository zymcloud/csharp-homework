Objectives:The clinical relevance of spontaneous portosystemic shunts detected by ultrasound is insufficiently investigated. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the frequency and clinical relevance of spontaneous portosystemic shunts in patients with liver cirrhosis.Methods:We evaluated portosystemic shunts, liver cirrhosis and spleen size by ultrasound in 982 patients with liver cirrhosis and correlated these with laboratory results, clinical data and the incidence of clinical endpoint deaths, liver transplantation and the development of HCC during the follow-up period (mean 1.26 Â± 1.53 years [range 0-7.2 years]).Results:Portosystemic shunts were detected in 34% of the patients. These patients had a higher rate of alcohol-related cirrhosis (37% vs. 30%, p = .003), a higher MELD score (p Conclusions:Patients with portosystemic shunts that are detected by ultrasound should be monitored carefully as these patients are associated with advanced liver disease and multiple clinical risk factors.
