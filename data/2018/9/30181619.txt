Acitretin is widely used to treat psoriasis, but the efficacy varies significantly among individuals. To explore the association between polymorphisms and acitretin efficacy, we enrolled 46 and 105 Chinese Han psoriasis vulgaris patients for discovery and validation phases, respectively. The patients were treated with acitretin (30 mg/day) and calcipotriol ointment for at least 8 weeks, and their genotypes were detected. The wild-type genes and variants were transfected into HEK293 cells, which were then incubated with acitretin. The cellular acitretin concentration was measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found that the polymorphisms rs4149056 in the SLCO1B1 gene and rs2282143 in the SLC22A1 gene were associated with efficacy, both in the discovery (P = 0.013 and P = 0.002) and validation phases (P = 0.028 and P = 0.014), based on a 50% reduction from before to after treatment of the psoriasis area severity index (PASI50). When the PASI75 was used as an efficacy cutoff, a similar conclusion was drawn. The uptake of acitretin was lower with the rs4149056C (P = 0.002) and rs2282143T alleles (P = 0.038) than the wild-type alleles. Our results imply that the rs4149056C and rs2282143T variants decrease the acitretin uptake, and significantly associated with clinical effective responsiveness.
