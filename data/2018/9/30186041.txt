Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are classified as a kind of RNA, which are longer than 200 nucleotides in length and cannot be translated into proteins. Multiple studies have demonstrated that lncRNAs are involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, cell death, and metastasis. In addition, aberrant expression of lncRNAs has been discovered in human tumors, where they function as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Among numerous lncRNAs, we focus on ZNFX1 antisense RNA 1 (ZFAS1), a well-known lncRNA that is aberrant overexpression in various tumors, including melanoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer, and Hepatocellular carcinoma, in which it functions as oncogene. In contrast, ZFAS1 is downregulated in breast cancer, which may function as tumor suppressor gene. In this review, we provide an overview of current evidence concerning the role and potential clinical utilities of ZFAS1 in human cancers.
