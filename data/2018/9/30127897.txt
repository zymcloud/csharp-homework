MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been proven to have important effects on the proliferation and metastasis of multiple cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, our aim was to explore the biological function of miR-106b in HCC cell proliferation and metastasis. qPCR analysis showed that miR-106b was expressed at higher levels, while disabled homolog 2 (DAB2) was expressed at lower levels in HCC tissues and cells. Moreover, the aberrant miR-106b expression in HCC affected the cell proliferative and migratory ability by MTT and Transwell assay. DAB2 was identified as a specific target of miR-106b in HCC by luciferase reporter assay and regression analysis showed a negative correlation between DAB2 and miR-106b expression. In addition, DAB2 may attenuate the miR-106b promotion effect on HCC cell proliferation and migration. In short, miR-106b may promote HCC cell proliferation and migration by targeting DAB2.
