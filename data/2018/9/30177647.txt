A facile bottom-up "green" synthetic route of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) is described, using a leaf extract of the Malvaceae plant Corchorus olitorius as a reducing and stabilizing agent. The size and shape of the obtained nanoparticles were modulated by varying the amounts of the metal salt and the broth extract in the reaction medium. Only one hour was required for the complete conversion to Au NPs, suggesting that the reaction rate was higher or comparable to those of nanoparticles synthesized by chemical methods. The obtained nanoparticles were characterized by UV⁻visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). While infrared spectroscopy was employed to characterize the various functional groups in the organic layer that stabilized the particles, TEM images were used to optimize the conditions for NPs growth. A low concentration of the C. olitorius extract yielded mixed triangular and hexagonal shapes; in contrast, quasi-spherical shapes of Au NPs with an average size of 37⁻50 nm were obtained at a higher extract broth concentration. The Au NPs displayed Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) bands at 535 nm. An in vitro cytotoxic assay of the biocompatible Au NPs revealed a strong cytotoxic activity in three human cancer cell lines, namely, colon carcinoma HCT-116, hepatocellular carcinoma HepG-2, and breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7. In-silico bioactivity, drug-likeness, and ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) predictions were conducted in order to examine the pharmacokinetic behavior of the compounds present in the C. olitorius extract.
