Angiogenesis is required for the growth of hepatoblastoma (HB). In the present study, an ultrasonic contrast agent, microbubbles (MB), was combined with an endoglin antibody, and then injected into nude mice with HB. This was conducted to detect specific binding to microvessels via non-linear harmonic imaging for tumor angiogenesis assessment. In addition, endoglin expression in experimental animals was measured using western blotting, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. In vitro, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were co-cultured with conditioned media collected from HepG2 cells. Western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was performed to detect the changes of endoglin expression. In targeted ultrasound imaging, it was determined that the differential targeted enhancement of MBendoglin was significantly higher than that of MBisotype. Over expression of endoglin was identified in the tumor of experimental nude mice; however, it was not present in the liver of the mice. Endoglin expression in HUVECs was significantly increased by co-culture with the conditioned media of HepG2 cells; therefore, the results suggest that endoglin is upregulated in angiogenic vessels in the HepG2 cell xenografts in nude mice. Thus, endoglin-targeted ultrasound imaging is presented as a potential approach for the diagnosis of liver carcinoma.
