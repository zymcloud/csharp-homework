To explore the feasibility and efficacy of isolated caudate lobe resection for caudate lobe in huge hepatocellular carcinoma(10 cm or larger in diameter). Methods: Clinical data of 27 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma larger than 10 cm who underwent isolated caudate lobe resection from January 2001 to December 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: All the patients successfully completed the operation. There was no postoperative death. Median operative time was 288 min, and the estimated intraoperative blood loss was 2 260 mL. Postoperative morbidity rate was 44.4%. The patients were discharged successfully after active treatment. Overall survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 80.2%, 52.1%, and 27.1%, respectively. Conclusion: Isolated caudate lobe resection is safe and effective for caudate lobe huge hepatocellular carcinoma.
