There is not yet a consensus regarding a difference in prognosis for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with and without bile duct invasion (BDI). The present study aimed to clarify the prognostic importance of BDI on the short and long-term outcome of patients with HCC who underwent surgical resection. The present study evaluated HCC with BDI, including peripheral microscopic biliary invasion and revealed that the prognosis of patients with BDI was poorer compared with those without BDI. It should be noted that peripheral BDI also had a negative impact on the prognosis of patients with HCC. The clinical prognosis assessment revealed that BDI should be considered when assigning a disease stage. BDI, either macroscopic or microscopic, indicated a poor prognosis in patients with HCC who underwent curative resection, however it was not a surgical contraindication. Macroscopic BDI and hyperbilirubinemia were significantly associated with a dismal prognosis, which should alert surgeons.
