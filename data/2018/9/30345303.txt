Almost all the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at advanced stage experience pathological changes of chronic liver cirrhosis, which generally leads to moderate ascites. Recognition of novel biomarkers in malignant ascites could be favorable for establishing a diagnosis for the HCC patients with ascites, and even predicting prognosis, such as risk of distant metastasis. To distinguish the proteomic profiles of malignant ascites in HCC patients from those with nonmalignant liver cirrhosis, an iTRAQ pipeline was built up to analyze the differentially distributed proteins in the malignant ascites from HCC patients (n=10) and benign ascites from hepatic decompensation (HD) controls (n=9). In total, 112 differentially distributed proteins were identified, of which 69 proteins were upregulated and 43 proteins were downregulated (ratio 1.3, respectively) in the malignant ascites. Moreover, 19 upregulated proteins (including keratin 1 protein and rheumatoid factor RF-IP20, ratio>1.5) and 8 downregulated proteins (including carbonic anhydrase 1, ratio
