Our previous study (Oncotarget 2016; 7:46) demonstrated that the over-expression of sulfatase-1 in murine hepatocarcinoma Hca-F cell line (a murine HCC cell with lymph node metastatic [LNM] rate of >75%) downregulates mesothelin and leads to reduction in lymphatic metastasis, both in vitro and in vivo. In current work, we investigated the effects of Sulf-1 knockdown on mesothelin (Msln) and it's effects on the in vitro cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and in vivo tumor growth and LNM rate for Hca-P cells (a murine HCC cell with LNM rate of
