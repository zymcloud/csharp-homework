Aim of the study:Current criteria for hepatic resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) according to Barcellona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification is debated. Actually, patients with multinodular or large HCC>5cm are excluded from surgical treatment following the algorithm, but several studies from referral centers showed that such patients may benefit from surgical resection in the clinical practice. The aim of this study was to compare short- and long-term outcomes after liver resection for HCC in stage 0/A or B in a middle volume center.Patients and methods:Patients were grouped according to BCLC classification. Postoperative mortality, morbidity, overall and disease-free survival, univariate analysis of prognostic factors on survival was analyzed.Results:Among 66 surgical procedures in 64 patients included in the study, 41 were BCLC stage 0/A (62.1%) and 25 BCLC stage B (37.9%). The overall 30- and the 90-days mortality rates were 1.5% and 3%. Patients in BCLC stage B had higher transfusion rate (P=0.04) but similar morbidity and mortality compared to patients in BCLC stage 0/A. After a median follow-up of 35 months (range: 14-147), the overall survival at 1, 3 and 5 years resulted 95%, 61.1%, 46.2% for stage 0-A and 83.3%, 50%, 41.2% for stage B (P=0.73). Univariate analysis identified poorly differentiated tumors (P=0.02) and positive margin (P=0.02) as negative prognostic factors on survival.Conclusions:Surgical treatment of HCC in BCLC stage B offers similar results than the ones in BCLC stage 0/A and consequently should not be considered contraindicated for such patients.
