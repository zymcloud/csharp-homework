The objective of the present study was to investigate the tumor-associated vascular changes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following treatment with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with sorafenib. The data of 20 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Patients underwent treatment depending on their chosen regimens (orally administered sorafenib was recommended, however the cost prevented some study articipants from selecting this course). Based on this, the patients were divided into TACE combined with sorafenib (TS) (n=10) and TACE-only treatment groups (n=10). Digital subtraction angiography images of all patients were analyzed by 2 radiologists who were blind to the type of treatment administered. The diameters of the hepatic and proper hepatic arteries, and hepatic artery branches (tumor-associated arteries), the splenic, left gastric and gastroduodenal arteries or portal veins (non-tumor-associated arteries) and the number of microvascular vessels were compared prior to and following sorafenib treatment in the TS group, between the first and second sessions of TACE in the TACE-only group and between the TS and TACE-only groups. In the TS group, the diameters of the hepatic and proper hepatic arteries, their branches and the number of microvascular vessels were significantly decreased following sorafenib treatment (P0.05). In the TACE-only group, the diameters of the hepatic, proper hepatic, splenic, left gastric and gastroduodenal arteries were not significantly different between the first and second TACE sessions (P>0.05), while the diameters of the hepatic artery branches and the number of microvascular vessels were significantly altered (P0.05). Treatment with TACE combined with sorafenib may significantly affect the tumor-associated vasculature compared with treatment with TACE alone in HCC.
