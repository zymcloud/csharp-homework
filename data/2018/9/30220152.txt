Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and adverse reactions of licartin with repeated administration in treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after liver transplantation. Methods: Clinical data of 60 patients after liver transplantation with licartin in Tianjin First Central Hospital from December 2012 to December 2016 were collected and analyzed.The patients were divided into A group(received single therapy, n=45)and B group(received repeated therapy with equal or greater than twice, n=15). The results of blood routine examination, liver function and thyroid function between the two groups(1 week before treatment, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after treatment) were compared. Survival time and adverse reactions were statistically analyzed. Results: There was no significant statistical difference on age, gender and AFP between the two groups(all P>0.05). Compared to baseline level 1 week before treatment, platelet levels were reduced 2 weeks after treatment, and gradually recovered to baseline level at 8 weeks(F=50.42 and 61.71, all P<0.05); 4 weeks after treatment, the alanine aminotransferase and total bilirubin levels were increased to a certain extent and recovered to baseline at 8 weeks(F=5.42 and 3.39, 8.95 and 6.84, all P<0.05). Thyroid function injury ratio for the two groups were 8.9% and 8.6%. No serious adverse reactions occurred, and mild adverse reactions could be tolerated with spontaneous remission or symptomatic treatment. There was no significant statistical difference between the two groups(χ2=0.459-1.0, all P>0.05). The median survival time was 34.0 months for A group, the 6-, 12-, 18-, 24-, 36- and 48-month overall survival rates for the two groups were 93.3%, 86.6%, 73.3%, 62.2%, 48.9%, 33.3% and 100%, 93.3%, 86.7%, 80.0%, 66.7%, 66.7%, respectively (χ2=4.324, P=0.038). HCC in situ recurrence rate for the two groups were 15.6% and 13.3%(χ2=1.0, P=0.601). The incidence of hepatocellular metastasis for the two groups were 22.2% and 20.0%(χ2=1.0, P=0.585). Conclusion: Repeated licartin administration could prevent HCC recurrence and prolong survival with satisfactory safety.
