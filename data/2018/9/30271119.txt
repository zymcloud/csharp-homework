Aims:Concerns have increased about the risk of fatal adverse events (FAEs) associated with molecular targeted agents (MTAs) in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of this study is to investigate the overall incidence and risk of FAEs in advanced HCC with administration of MTAs by using a meta-analysis of available clinical trials.Materials and methods:Electronic databases were searched for relevant articles before March 2017. Eligible studies were selected according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Pooled incidence, Peto ORs and 95% CIs were calculated according to the heterogeneity of selected studies.Results:A total of 4,716 HCC participants from 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were finally considered for this meta-analysis. The pooled incidence of death due to MTAs was 2.1% (95% CI 1.6%-2.8%) with a Peto OR of 1.79 (95% CI 1.07-3.01; p=0.027) in comparison with controlled groups. Subgroup analysis according to biological agents showed that brivanib treatment in HCC patients significantly increased the risk of developing FAEs (Peto OR 3.97; 95% CI 1.17-13.51; p=0.028) but not for sorafenib (Peto OR 1.78; 95% CI 0.54-5.89; p=0.34) and other MTAs (Peto OR 1.43; 95% CI 0.75-2.76; p=0.28). Sensitive analysis showed that the pooled results were influenced by removing each single trial. The most common causes of FAEs were hepatic failure (22.2%) and hemorrhage (13.3%), respectively.Conclusion:Clinicians should be aware of the risks of FAEs during the administration of MTAs in advanced HCC patients, especially for patients with abnormal liver function. However, the use of sorafenib remains justified in its approved indications due to their potential survival benefits and limited toxicities.
