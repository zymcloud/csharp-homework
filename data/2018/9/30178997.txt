Both targeted and stimuli-sensitive drug-delivery systems (DDSs) have been developed to augment antitumor effects. However, lack of knowledge regarding tumor tissue targeting and different effects of the stimuli-sensitive DDSs in orthotropic and ectopic tumors have impeded further advances in their clinical applications. Herein, we first reported a pH-triggered micelle with sialic acid (SA)-driven targeting ability (SA-poly(ethylene glycol)-hydrazone linker-doxorubicin (DOX), SPD). The SPD micelles encapsulated with DOX (SPDD) showed sustained drug release over 48 h in response to the pH gradient in vivo, slow under physical conditions and accelerated in the acid tumor microenvironment. In addition, the SPD micelles showed 2.3-fold higher accumulation in tumors after 48 h compared to the micelles lacking the SA moiety. The overexpression of E-selectin on the inflammatory vascular endothelial cells surrounding the tumors increased the accumulation of SPD micelles in tumor tissues, whereas that on the tumor cells increased the internalization of micelles. Consequently, SPDD micelles exerted remarkable antitumor effects in both orthotopic and ectopic models. Application of SPDD micelles in the in situ model reduced the tumor volume (77.57 mm3 vs 62.13 mm3) and metastasis after treatment for 25 days. These results suggest that SA-driven targeted DDS with a pH-responsive switch has the potential to treat hepatocarcinoma effectively both ectopically and orthotopically.
