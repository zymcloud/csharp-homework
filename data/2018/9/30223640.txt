Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the main consequences of liver chronic disease. Hepatocellular carcinoma-related changes may be seen in patients with chronic hepatitis B. The aim of the current study was to quantitate liver tissue elements by stereological technique in patients with hepatitis B-related cancer and compare the results with control and only hepatitis B group. Needle liver biopsies from 40 patients with only chronic hepatitis B infection, from 41 patients with only early hepatocellular carcinoma, from 40 patients with early hepatitis B-related cancer and 30 healthy subjects (control group) were analyzed by stereological method using systematic uniform random sampling method. Haematoxylin and eosin stained sections were used. The numerical density of hepatocytes, hepatocyte volume, numerical density of Kupffer cells, volume density of the connective tissue in the portal space, and volume density of the connective tissue were assessed. Quantitative analysis of liver samples indicated that there were statistically significant differences in the numerical density of hepatocytes, hepatocyte volume, numerical density of Kupffer cells, volume density of the connective tissue in the portal space, and volume density of the connective tissue between control and hepatitis B-related cancer and hepatitis B groups. Quantitative, stereological technique is simple and reliable for evaluating HCC in chronic hepatitis B. It is useful for assessing the liver tissue parameters. Stereology is recommended for the diagnosis of people prone to cancer in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
