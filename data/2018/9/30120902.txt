Cancer after liver transplantation (LT) constitutes a threat also for young recipients, but cancer risk factors are usually absent in children and large studies on the cancer risk profile in young LT recipients are scarce. Data of patients younger than 30 years who underwent LT during the period 1982-2013 in the Nordic countries were linked with respective national cancer registries to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). A total of 37 cancer cases were observed in 923 patients with 7846 person-years of follow-up. The SIR for all cancer types, compared with the matched general population, was 9.8 (12.4 for males and 7.8 for females). Cumulative incidence of cancer adjusted for the competing risk of death was 2% at 10 years, 6% at 20 years, and 22% at 25 years after LT. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma was the most common cancer type (n = 14) followed by colorectal (n = 4) and hepatocellular cancer (n = 4). Age was a significant risk factor for cancer, and the absolute risk of most cancers (except for lymphoma) increased considerably in young adults older than 20 years. The cancer risk pattern is different in pediatric and young LT patients compared with adult recipients. The striking increase in cancer incidence in young adulthood after the second decade of life deserves further consideration in transition programs.
