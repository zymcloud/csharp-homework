Background:Liver function in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma is generally graded according to the Child-Pugh system; however, some variables in the Child-Pugh grade are subjective. We developed a novel, objective score called the prothrombin time-international normalized ratio to albumin ratio. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of this new score in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatic resection.Methods:The study comprised 199 patients who underwent elective hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma between January 2003 and December 2014. We investigated retrospectively the relation between prothrombin time-international normalized ratio to albumin ratio, disease-free survival, and overall survival and compared the value of liver functional reserve between prothrombin time-international normalized ratio to albumin ratio and Child-Pugh grade.Results:The optimal cut-off level of the prothrombin time-international normalized ratio to albumin ratio was 0.288. In multivariate analysis, the independent and significant predictors of cancer recurrence consisted of hepatitis C virus infection (P = .043), preoperative retention rate of indocyanine green at 15 minutes â‰¥15% (P = .039), the presence of multiple tumors (P = .001) or microvascular invasion (P Conclusion:The prothrombin time-international normalized ratio to albumin ratio may reflect liver function and may be a novel indicator of poor long-term outcome in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatic resection.
