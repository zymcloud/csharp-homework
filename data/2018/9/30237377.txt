A 65-year-old woman who had liver cirrhosis(Child-Pugh class B)due to hepatitis C infection was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma with hepatic vein invasion, portal vein tumor invasion, and lung metastasis. No recommended treatment was noted in the clinical practice guidelines for hepatocellular carcinoma with vascular invasion in patients with Child- Pugh class B liver cirrhosis. After initiating arterial injection chemotherapy, marked decreases in tumor size of lung metastasis, vascular invasion, and primary liver cancer were observed. Based on our experience and previous reports, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy was considered valuable for hepatocellular carcinoma with vascular invasion, even in patients with Child-Pugh class B liver cirrhosis.
