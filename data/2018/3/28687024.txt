Background:Brain metastases (BMs) are the most common intracranial neoplasms in adults, but they rarely arise from colorectal cancer (CRC). The objective of this study was to report an overview of the characteristics and current management of CRC BMs.Methods:A systematic review on CRC BMs was performed using Medline database from 1983 to 2015. The search was limited to studies published in English. Review articles, not relevant case report or studies or studies relating to animal and in vitro experiments were excluded.Results:BMs occurred in 0.06-4% of patients with CRC. Most BMs were metachronous and were associated with lung (27-92%) and liver (12-80%) metastases. Treatment options depended on the number of BMs, the general conditions of the patient and the presence of other metastases. Most frequent treatment was whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) alone (36%), with median overall survival comprised between 2 and 9 months. Median overall survival was better after surgery alone (from 3 to 16.2 months), or combined with WBRT (from 7.6 to 14 months). After stereotactic radiosurgery alone, overall survival could reach 9.5 months. Many favourable prognostic factors were identified, such as high Karnofsky performance status, low recursive partitioning analysis classes, lack of extracranial disease, low number of BMs and possibility to perform surgical treatment.Conclusion:BMs from CRC are rare. In the presence of favourable prognostic factors, an aggressive management including surgical resection with or without WBRT or stereotactic radiosurgery can improve the overall survival.
