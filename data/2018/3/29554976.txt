Background:Gallbladder cancer is unusually seen but can result in highly mortality rate. It makes challenge to diagnose for clinicians due to present asymptomatic or non-specific clinical presentation including abdominal pain, anorexia. It usually also accompanies with cholelithiasis (incidence is 1-2%) and incidentally detected by radiologic examination such as ultrasound, computed tomography or intra-operative intervention accidentally. Gallbladder cancer results in highly fatal malignancy because it is difficult to early detect. The ovarian metastases from gallbladder mimics primary neoplasm isn't seen before and mentioned in English literatures before.Case presentation:A 28-year-old woman suffered from intermittently lower abdominal tenderness and nausea after meals for 3 years. The abdominal ultrasound revealed a right ovarian mass with fluid accumulation and the contrast CT of abdomen revealed a gallbladder fundus mass and liver tumor lesion located at segment 4. We arranged surgical intervention with radical cholecystectomy and debulking operation with salpingo-oophorectomy. The pathologic report revealed adenocarcinoma of gallbladder with liver, peritoneum, and right ovarian invasion. After surgical intervention, she also received adjuvant chemotherapy with Gemcitabine, Cetuximab, Cisplatin and Cyberknife.Conclusion:The non-specific symptoms make the challenge to difference the primary malignant neoplasm. The rarely diagnosis must take in consider if the gastrointestinal tract tumours coexist with ovarian tumours.
