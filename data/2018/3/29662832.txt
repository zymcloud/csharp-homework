Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is highly prevalent in Hong Kong due to the high prevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection. Liver cancer is the fourth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer death. Due to the high case load, there is a high level of local expertise in treating HCC, and the full spectrum of treatment modalities is available. This document summarizes how these modalities should be used based on the latest evidence.Summary:In 2 meetings held in early 2017, a multidisciplinary group of Hong Kong clinicians, including liver surgeons, interventional radiologists, clinical oncologists, and medical oncologists, met to update local consensus statements for management of HCC. These statements are based on the latest evidence and give detailed guidance on how to deploy these modalities, in particular for cases of HCC which are not suited to surgical resection.Key messages:These statements give detailed information on how to decide if a patient is a candidate for resection, methods to improve candidacy for resection, and guidance for use of various nonsurgical interventions to manage patients ineligible for resection.
