A causal relationship between protracted exposure to low-dose rate radiation and health effects remains unclear despite extensive international studies of nuclear workers. One potential reason is that radiation epidemiological studies that adjust for tobacco smoking, which heavily influences mortality, have been limited. In the present study, we examined radiation-related cancer risk by directly assessing the possible confounding effect of smoking, using data from two questionnaire surveys performed among Japanese nuclear workers in 1997 and 2003. Mortality follow-up was carried out for 71 733 male respondents for an average of 8.2 years during the observation period of 1999-2010. The mean cumulative dose was 25.5 mSv at the end of the follow-up period. Estimates of excess relative risk per Sv (ERRs/Sv) were obtained by Poisson regression. By adjusting for smoking directly on the basis of a linear dose-response model, we quantified the confounding effects of smoking on radiation risks. Statistically significant ERRs/Sv were found for all causes, all diseases, all non-cancer diseases, and liver cancer: 0.97 (90% confidence interval: 0.23, 1.78), 1.32 (0.40, 2.34), 1.87 (0.47, 3.49), and 4.78 (0.09, 11.68), respectively, without adjustment for smoking. However, the ERRs/Sv were no longer statistically significant after adjustment for smoking: 0.45 (-0.22, 1.19), 0.77 (-0.08, 1.72), 1.28 (-0.03, 2.79), and 3.89 (-0.46, 10.34), respectively. The ERRs/Sv for all cancers excluding leukaemia and lung cancer were not significant before adjustment for smoking, but declined after adjustment for smoking. The present study demonstrates that in this cohort of workers, smoking heavily distorts radiation risk estimates of mortality. The possibility of confounding by smoking depends on how strongly smoking is correlated with radiation exposure. If a correlation between smoking and radiation dose is suggested, smoking is an important confounder when assessing the radiation and health risks.
