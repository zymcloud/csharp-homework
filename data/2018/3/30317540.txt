Emerging evidence have discovered that circular RNAs (circRNAs) may serve as diagnostic or tumor promising biomarkers. This study aimed to investigate how circular RNA ADAMTS14 (circADAMTS14) regulates microRNA-572/ regulator of calcineurin 1(miR-572/ RCAN1) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression profiles of circRNA/microRNA (mRNA) between HCC tissues and paired adjacent tissues were analyzed via microarray analysis. The expressions of circADAMTS14, miR-572, and RCAN1 were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The protein expression level of RCAN1 in HCC cells was detected by western blot. The viability and apoptosis levels of HCC cell lines were measured by the cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The invasiveness and migration of cells were detected based on the transwell and wound-healing assay, respectively. The dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to reveal circADAMTS14 and RCAN1 as a potential target of miR-572, which was predicted by TargetScan and miRBase. The effect of circADAMTS14 on HCC cells was demonstrated by tumor formation in nude mice in vivo. CircADAMTS14 and RCAN1 were lowly expressed in HCC clinical specimens and cell lines using microarrays and qRT-PCR, but miR-572 inversely. Our study further verified the direct interaction between circADAMTS14 and RCAN1 with miR-572 via the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Overexpressed circADAMTS14 and RCAN1 induced apoptosis of HCC cells and inhibited cell proliferation and invasion. But overexpressed miR-572 could decrease apoptosis of HCC cells and promote proliferation and invasion. In vivo, circADAMTS14 inhibited the tumor growth, correlated positively with the protein expression levels of RCAN1. Our results demonstrated that circADAMTS14 might suppress HCC progression through regulating miR-572/ RCAN1 as the competing endogenous RNA.
