This study aimed to analyze the influence of the cellular differentiation, the tumor size and the underlying hepatic condition on the enhancement pattern of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). 276 patients with single lesion ≤ 5 cm who underwent CEUS exam and were pathologically confirmed as HCC were retrospectively enrolled. Enhancement patterns, washout patterns, wash-in time and washout time were observed and recorded. During the arterial phase, more poorly differentiated HCCs (42.5%) and lesions > 3 cm (35.2%) performed inhomogeneous enhancement (p 3 cm (97.2 ± 51.3 s) washed out more rapidly than lesions ≤ 3 cm (113.9 ± 53.5 s) (p
