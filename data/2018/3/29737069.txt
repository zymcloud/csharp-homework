Objective:To predict histological grade of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Wistar rats using intravoxel incoherent motion imaging (IVIM) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Methods:Liver lesions of HCC rat models induced by oral diethylnitrosamine (DEN) were scanned by IVIM to obtain apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and IVIM parameters,including true diffusion coefficient (D),pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*) and perfusion fraction (f). These HCC lesions were confirmed by Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) stain and pathologically graded into low (grade Ⅰ+Ⅱ) and high (grade Ⅲ+Ⅳ) using the Edmondson-Steiner method. The ADC and IVIM parameters of the two grade groups were compared: their diagnostic performance were assessed using ROC curves.Results:HCC models were successfully established in 48 rats,containing 50 HCC lesions (28 low-grade and 22 high-grade). The high-grade lesions had lower ADC (P=0.009) and D (P=0.005) values and higher D* (P=0.032) and f (P=0.044) values compared with the low-grade lesions. The largest jonden index appeared in the ROC curves at 0.907 8×10-3 mm2/s of ADC,0.817 6×10-3 mm2/s of D,24.31×10-3 mm2/s of D*,and 14.4% of f,respectively. The area under curves (AUCs) of these parameters ranged from 0.5 to 0.9,showing no significant differences (P>0.05).Conclusion:ADC and IVIM parameters have equal and moderate diagnostic values in predicting histologic grade of HCCs, which can be used for estimating pathological grading of HCCs before surgery.
