A 70-year-old man was admitted for treatment of a single liver nodule that was detected by contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Twenty years earlier, the patient had been diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome-refractory anemia and secondary hemochromatosis but had not received erythrocyte transfusions. The current histological, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging findings revealed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-cirrhotic liver hemochromatosis. The liver tumor was treated using radiofrequency ablation therapy. Secondary hemochromatosis may be a risk factor for HCC, even if the liver is not cirrhotic. In such cases, additional surveillance may be required to detect the development of HCC.
