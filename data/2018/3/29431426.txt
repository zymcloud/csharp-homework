The combination of microbead array, isothermal amplification, and molecular signaling enables the continuous development of next-generation molecular diagnostic techniques. Herein we reported the implementation of nicking endonuclease-assisted strand displacement amplification reaction on quantum dots-encoded microbead (Qbead), and demonstrated its feasibility for multiplexed miRNA assay in real sample. The Qbead featured with well-defined core-shell superstructure with dual-colored quantum dots loaded in silica core and shell, respectively, exhibiting remarkably high optical encoding stability. Specially designed stem-loop-structured probes were immobilized onto the Qbead for specific target recognition and amplification. In the presence of low abundance of miRNA target, the target triggered exponential amplification, producing a large quantity of stem-G-quadruplexes, which could be selectively signaled by a fluorescent G-quadruplex intercalator. In one-step operation, the Qbead-based isothermal amplification and signaling generated emissive "core-shell-satellite" superstructure, changing the Qbead emission-color. The target abundance-dependent emission-color changes of the Qbead allowed direct, visual detection of specific miRNA target. This visualization method achieved limit of detection at the subfemtomolar level with a linear dynamic range of 4.5 logs, and point-mutation discrimination capability for precise miRNA analyses. The array of three encoded Qbeads could simultaneously quantify three miRNA biomarkers in âˆ¼500 human hepatoma carcinoma cells. With the advancements in ease of operation, multiplexing, and visualization capabilities, the isothermal amplification-on-Qbead assay could potentially enable the development of point-of-care diagnostics.
