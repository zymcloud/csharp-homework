Background:Minimal-invasive liver resection has gained considerable attention in recent years, assuming a weighty position in the field of HPB surgery. Even lesions in posterosuperior segments, the technically most challenging localization, have been resected while achieving comparable outcomes to laparotomy. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether the similar beneficial results can be conveyed through minimal-invasive techniques for patients with liver cirrhosis.Materials and methods:We retrospectively analyzed all consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic liver resection with at least one lesion in the posterosuperior liver segments (IVa, VII, VIII) at our center between January 2012 and July 2018. Patients were separated in two groups based on the presence (n = 43) or absence (n = 115) of liver cirrhosis.Results:Preoperative patient characteristics showed that patients with cirrhosis were older (p Conclusion:Patients with liver cirrhosis and a lesion in the posterosuperior liver segments are amenable to the minimal-invasive approaches as no significant differences can be observed with regard to safety and oncologic sufficiency. As these procedures are from a technical perspective challenging, they should be performed in specialized centers.
