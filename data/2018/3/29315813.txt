Objective:The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of published reports to compare long-term outcomes after liver transplantation (LT) and liver resection (LR), respectively, in patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) beyond the Milan criterion.Methods:A systematic search of the Embase, Medline, PubMed databases, and the Cochrane Library was performed using both medical subject headings (MeSH) and truncated word searches to identify all comparative studies published on this topic. The primary outcomes were postoperative overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). We calculated the pooled hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of OS and DFS.Results:Pooled analysis of six studies, with a total of 1697 patients with HCC beyond Milan criteria, did not reveal a statistically significant improvement in OS in patients undergoing LT vs LR (LT vs LR, HR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.68-1.01, P = .06), without significant heterogeneity (χ2 = 8.38, I2 = 40.3%, P = .137). Five studies with a total of 1511 patients were included in pooled analysis of DFS between LT and LR group. In the fixed-effects model, patients in the LT group gained significantly better DFS (LT vs LR, HR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.37-0.56, P < .001) than patients in the LR group, with no significant heterogeneity (χ2 = 6.80, I2 = 41.6%, P = .144). Four studies provided the data of adjusted HRs (LT vs LR). In the fixed-effects model, patients in the LT group had significantly better OS (HR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.44-0.77, P < .001, I2 = 0%) and DFS (HR: 0.14, 95% CI: 0.08-0.23, P < .001, I2 = 0%) than those of patients in the LR group. The sensitivity analyses revealed that the results were robust.Conclusion:Our meta-analysis demonstrated that HBV-related patients with HCC beyond Milan criterion who underwent LT gained better OS and DFS compared with patients who underwent LR after adjusting confounding factors.
