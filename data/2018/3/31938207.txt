Objective:To explore potential targets and clinical value of miR-490-5p in the oncogenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Clinical value of miR-490-5p was accessed through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and qRT-PCR analyses. Potential target mRNAs of miR-490-5p were predicted by bioinformatics methods and were annotated as Gene Ontology (GO) function analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathway analysis, and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network analysis.Results:miR-490 expression in HCC tissues was lower compared with normal control tissues based on TCGA and down regulation of miR-490-5p was verified by qRT-PCR (PConclusion:miR-490-5p is down-regulated in HCC and may be a prospectively diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. Moreover, miR-490-5p might directly target SRC, SRP9, PDGFRB, RPL28, or RPS23 and play an important role in HCC.
