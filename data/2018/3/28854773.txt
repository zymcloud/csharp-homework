Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-CC) with bile duct invasion (BDI) is rare. In unresectable cases, biliary stent placement and photodynamic therapy (PDT) are used for resolving obstructive jaundice. However, stent occlusion remains problematic, and PDT is expensive and time-consuming. Intraductal radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an emerging procedure for palliation in these patients. It has potential benefits including less expense, lower rates of severe complication, longer maintenance of ductal patency, and easier technique compared with PDT or stenting alone. We report a 67-year-old man who underwent repeated intraductal RFA for HCC-CC and HCC with BDI, for whom bile duct patency was maintained without additional biliary procedures.
