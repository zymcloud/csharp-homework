Hydatid disease is a fecal-oral transmission zoonosis which is endemically distributed among Mediterranean countries such as Morocco. It usually presents asymptomatically and a diagnosis is made due to cyst complications. It is most frequently located in the liver and lungs and forms large masses. The incidence of colon cancer has increased amongst population under 50 years of age during the last few decades. It has been proposed that young adult cases may have histological characteristics with a more aggressive clinical behavior. These patients are frequently diagnosed in advanced stages and a mucinous histology is frequently detected. Diagnosis is usually delayed due to a low clinical suspicion and the attribution of symptoms to other diseases such as irritable bowel and parasitosis, among others.
