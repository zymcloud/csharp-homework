Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection is one of the major causes of morbidity, mortality and healthcare expenditure in India. There are no Indian consensus guidelines on prevention, diagnosis and management of HBV infection. The Indian National Association for Study of the Liver (INASL) set up a taskforce on HBV in 2016, with a mandate to develop consensus guidelines for diagnosis and management of HBV infection, relevant to disease patterns and clinical practices in India. The taskforce first identified contentious issues on various aspects of HBV management, which were allotted to individual members of the taskforce who reviewed them in detail. A 2-day round table discussion was held on 11th and 12th February 2017 at Port Blair, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, to discuss, debate, and finalize the consensus statements. The members of the taskforce reviewed and discussed the existing literature threadbare at this meeting and formulated the 'INASL position statements' on each of the issues. The evidence and recommendations in these guidelines have been graded according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system with minor modifications. The strength of recommendations (strong: 1, weak: 2) thus reflects the quality (grade) of underlying evidence (A, B, C, D). We present here the INASL position statements on prevention, diagnosis and management of HBV in India.
