Autoimmune hepatitis occurs in genetically susceptible individuals as a result of loss of immunological tolerance to hepatic autoantigens that can be precipitated by environmental triggers. The clinical manifestation is usually insidious but can be also acute with liver failure. The diagnosis is made on the basis of antibody positivity, elevated immunoglobulin G levels and interface hepatitis on liver histology. Induction of remission is achieved with high-dose steroids in the majority of cases, and maintenance of remission with azathioprine. Treatment withdrawal is achievable only in a small proportion of patients. Patients with acute liver failure unresponsive to steroids or those with end-stage liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma may require liver transplantation. Variant forms of overlapping autoimmune hepatitis with either primary biliary cholangitis or sclerosing cholangitis are associated with worse outcomes. New insights into the pathophysiology of the disease may provide novel therapeutic targets and a more individualized approach to treatment of autoimmune hepatitis.
