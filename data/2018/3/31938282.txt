The routine biochemical parameters for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis are all protein markers. Serum concentrations of these markers can be affected by some benign diseases. Most of the occurrence of HCC has a background of cirrhosis, posing a great challenge to differential diagnosis of HCC from cirrhosis using traditional biochemical parameters. Values of serum small molecular metabolites for HCC diagnosis are not fully evaluated. In this study, a traditionalmass spectrometry-based screening strategy was employed to profile amino acids and acylcarnitines in blood samples collected from HCC and cirrhosis patients. Each whole blood specimen was sampled on filter paper and dried at room temperature. Metabolites in the dried blood spots were extracted using organic solvent and then concentrated for mass spectrometry analysis. It was found that 11 parameters, including amino acids, acylcarnitines and some of their relevant ratios, could be used to construct a satisfied differential diagnosis model. In this model, most of the relevant amino acids were essential amino acids. It was noticed that short-chain acylcarnitines tended to be risk factors for HCC. Long-chain acylcarnitines seemed to be risk factors for cirrhosis. This study demonstrates the value of mass spectrometry-based analysis for differential diagnosis of HCC and cirrhosis. Improved differential diagnosis ability may be achieved by combined use of traditional protein markers along with metabolite markers.
