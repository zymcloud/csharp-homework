Background:Sorafenib is the current standard of care for patients with advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently no universally agreed model exists correlating the Neutrophil Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and non-secretion of AFP with the survival of HCC patients treated with sorafenib.Patients and methods:We retrospectively analysed patient records with a confirmed diagnosis of HCC treated with sorafenib between April 2009 and March 2014. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression.Results:Patients separated into groups based on NLR (â‰¤3 or >3), or AFP secretion profile (3.0 it was 6.0 months (95% CI: 4.9-8.2 months) [HR 1.32 (95% CI: 0.96-1.80)]. The median overall survival post sorafenib was higher in the "non-secretor" AFP group. OS for AFP Conclusion:NLR and AFP non - secretion at diagnosis are potential significant prognosticators for overall survival from initiation of sorafenib.
