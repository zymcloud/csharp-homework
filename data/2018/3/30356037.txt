Background:In hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis the antiviral therapy reduces portal hypertension (PH) and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study assessed the prognostic role of LSPS Score (liver stiffness value X spleen diameter/platelet count) in predicting these goals in cirrhotic patients responsive to antiviral therapy.Methods:The correlation between LSPS, PH, esophageal varices (EVs) and HCC was evaluated in 121 cirrhotic patients treated with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs). Sixty-one patients (50.4%) had PH at baseline. All were HBV DNA negative on-treatment. They were evaluated after a median of 8 years of therapy (1-17) for LSPS, PH, hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), EVs and HCC.Results:LSPS ≤0.62 and ≤1.4 identified patients without PH measured by HVPG (0.62 after antiviral therapy (36% vs. 7%, PConclusions:LSPS is useful to identify patients with regression of PH and EVs, avoiding endoscopy. LSPS≤0.62 at baseline or due to antiviral therapy is associated with a lower risk of HCC. Early antiviral treatment is recommended in order to maintain or to induce LSPS≤0.62.
