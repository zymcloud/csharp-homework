Isolated cardiac involvement of recurrent metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is extremely rare. We report a patient with left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction due to isolated recurrent HCC involving the interventricular septum (IVS). A ventriculotomy with resection of the tumor and patch repair of the IVS was performed with successful relief of LVOT obstruction. The patient was discharged home 6 days later symptom-free.
