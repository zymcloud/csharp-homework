Background:The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score was initially developed for assessing liver dysfunction severity and was suggested to have prognostic value in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of ALBI grade in patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC) after radical gastrectomy.Methods:This study included 283 patients who underwent radical gastrectomy for pT2-4 GC without preoperative treatment. ALBI was calculated as follows: (log10 bilirubin (μmol/L) × 0.66) + (albumin (g/L) × -0.0852) and categorized into grades 1 (≤-2.60), 2 (-2.60<, ≤-1.39) and 3 (-1.39<).Results:The median ALBI score was -2.96, and a number of patients in ALBI grades 1, 2 and 3 were 228, 55 and 0, respectively. Patients with ALBI grade 2 had a lower administration rate of adjuvant chemotherapy than those with ALBI grade 1, whereas no significant differences were found in morbidity rate and disease stage. The ALBI grade 2 group was more likely to have shorter disease-specific and disease-free survival compared with the ALBI grade 1 group. Multivariable analysis identified ALBI grade 2 as an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (hazard ratio 1.97, 95% confidence interval 1.10-3.47, p = 0.0242). Survival differences between ALBI grade 1 and 2 groups were increased in the patient subset that received adjuvant chemotherapy. ALBI grade 2 was correlated with a shortened duration of administration of postoperative S-1 adjuvant.Conclusions:ALBI grade serves as a simple and promising predictive factor for disease-free and disease-specific survival in patients with pT2-4 GC after radical gastrectomy.
