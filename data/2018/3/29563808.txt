Background:In the recent past, there is increasing evidence demonstrating that HSP27 plays a key role in tumor progression. However, the relationship between HSP27 expression and the clinicopathological features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as its prognostic value in HCC patients remain controversial. Accordingly, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the correlation between HSP27 expression and HCC, and determine the prognostic value of HSP27 in HCC.Methods:The data included clinicopathological features and survival information extracted from the published literature in the databases PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, and Wan Fang. The pooled odds ratios and hazard ratios with 95% CIs were calculated using Forest plot analysis.Results:The meta-analysis results indicated that the positive HSP27 expression was significantly correlated with HCC incidence, tumor differentiation, and Î±-fetoprotein level in patients with HCC. However, the expression of HSP27 was not associated with metastasis, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, gender, tumor size, TNM stage, and vascular invasion. Additionally, HSP27 expression indicated a poor overall survival rate, but it was not related to disease-free survival rate.Conclusion:This meta-analysis revealed that HSP27 may play a key role in the development of HCC and could be a reliable biomarker for the prognosis of patients with HCC. However, additional high-quality research is needed to support the results.
