Protein kinase A (PKA) or cyclic-AMP (cAMP)-dependent kinase was among the first serine-threonine kinases to be molecularly and functionally characterized. For years, it was investigated as the enzyme that mediates cAMP functions in almost all cell systems and organisms studied to date. Despite PKA's critical role in signaling and the long history of investigations of cAMP in oncogenesis (dating back to the 1970s), it was not until relatively recently that PKA defects were found to be directly involved in tumor predisposition. First, PKA's main regulatory subunit, PRKAR1A, was found to be mutated in Carney complex, a genetic syndrome that predisposes to heart tumors (cardiac myxomas) and a variety of other lesions of the endocrine system, including the adrenal cortex, and several cancers, including liver carcinoma. Then, PKA's main catalytic subunit, PRKACA, was found to be mutated in sporadic adrenal tumors and fibrolamellar liver carcinoma. Not surprisingly, therefore, a new research study published in The Journal of Pathology showed PRKACA mutations in sporadic cardiac myxomas. The real question is what other pathologies will be found to be due to PRKACA (or other PKA subunit) defects. The possibilities abound and may show the way for a totally new class of medications that target cAMP signaling to be useful in fighting the corresponding tumors. Published 2017.
