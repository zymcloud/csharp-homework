Background:Helicobacter pylori Infection causes some clinical features of the human stomach such as gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and gastric cancer. It has been shown that Helicobacter pylori infection increases proinflammatory cytokine gene expressions in Gastric Epithelial Cells by activation of NF-kB signaling. Sirt1 and sirt2 as deacetylases play a certain role in the progress of inflammation in arthritis and lung infection by impacting the NF-kB.Aims:Sirt1 and sirt2 gene expressions in Gastric Epithelial cells of gastritis patients were surveyed with and without Helicobacter pylori infection and rate of prevalence of cagA and hopQ genes in Helicobacter pylori strains were investigated.Methods:25 biopsy samples of gastritis patients with Helicobacter pylori infection and 25 biopsy samples of gastritis patients without Helicobacter pylori infection were collected from Tohid Hospital in the city of Sanandaj throughout the year 2016. CDNA was made from total RNA extracted from biopsy samples (QiagenÂ® Kit). Sirt1 and sirt2 gene expressions were determined using the Corbett machine (Rotor-Gene 6000 Software). CagA and hopQ genes of Helicobacter pylori strains were determined by PCR using specific primers.Results:The sirt2 gene expression was increased in Gastric Epithelial Cells of gastritis patients with Helicobacter pylori infection. No significant relationship was found between sirt1 and sirt2 gene expressions as well as cagA and hopQ as Helicobacter pylori virulence genes.Conclusions:This study shows the Helicobacter pylori infection duo to sirt2 gene up-expression. There is not a statistically significance relationship between cagA and hopQ Helicobacter pylori genotypes and sirt2 gene up-expression in Gastric Epithelial Cells of gastritis patients.
