Purpose:We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) combined with trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) as initial therapy in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system stage B-C hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:Seventy-two patients received a single dose of TACE followed by SBRT 4 weeks later. All patients had tumor sizes ≥5 cm, at least 700 ml of disease-free liver, Child-Pugh (CP) score ≤ B7 and tumor nodules ≤5. SBRT dose, ranging from 6 × 5-8 Gy or 5-10 × 4 Gy, was individualized according to normal tissue constraints. No subsequent scheduled treatment was delivered unless disease progression was observed. Local control (LC), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), response rate (RR), and toxicity were evaluated.Results:The patients' characteristics were: median age 60 years (range 28-87 years); CP score A/B (n = 68/4); BCLC stage B/C (n = 51/21); solitary/multifocal (n = 37/35); portal vein invasion (n = 18). The median tumor size and GTV were 11.2 cm (range 5.0-23.6 cm) and 751 cm3 (range 41-4009 cm3), respectively. The median equivalent dose in 2 Gy per fraction (EQD2, α/β = 10) was 37.3 Gy2 (range, 28-72 Gy2). The median follow-up time was 16.8 months (range, 3-96 months). The objective RR was 68% and the 1‑year LC rate was 93.6% (95% CI, 87.6-100%). The median OS was 19.8 months (95% CI, 11.6-30.6 months). SBRT-related grade 3 or higher adverse gastrointestinal events and treatment-related death occurred in three (2.8%) and one patient (1.4%) respectively. No patient developed classical radiation-induced liver injury.Conclusion:Our experience suggests that combined TACE and SBRT can be a safe and effective initial therapy for BCLC stage B-C HCC with appropriate patient selection. Further prospective trials are warranted.
