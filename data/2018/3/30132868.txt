Dysregulation of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) plays important roles in carcinogenesis and tumor progression, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Small nucleolar RNA host gene 3 (SNHG3) has been considered as an lncRNA to be associated with a poor prognosis in patients with HCC. Here, we reported that SNHG3 expression was significantly higher in the highly metastatic HCC (HCCLM3) cells compared with the lowly metastatic HCC cells (Hep3B and PLC/PRF/5). Furthermore, forced expression of SNHG3 promoted cell invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and sorafenib resistance in HCC. Moreover, SNHG3 overexpression induced HCC cells EMT via miR-128/CD151 cascade activation. Clinically, our data revealed that increased SNHG3 expression is correlated with poor HCC survival outcomes and sorafenib response. These data suggest that SNHG3 may be a novel therapeutic target and a biomarker for predicting response to sorafenib treatment of HCC.
