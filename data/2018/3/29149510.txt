Patients with cirrhosis frequently present with high serum ferritin and low transferrin concentrations, reflecting impaired liver function and inflammation. Recent studies have shown that transferrin and its saturation with iron are Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-independent predictors of mortality in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic utility of serum iron parameters in relation to markers of liver function and immune activation. Clinical, demographic, and biochemical data were retrospectively analyzed from a cohort of 1255 consecutive patients with cirrhosis (age â‰¥ 18 years) who presented from August 1, 2004 until December 31, 2014 at the University Hospital of Innsbruck. Patients with malignancies at diagnosis including hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded. Survival analysis was carried out by Cox regression by using baseline laboratory parameters, and findings were validated in an independent patient cohort. During a median follow-up of 2.4 years, 193 deaths occurred and 254 patients underwent liver transplantation. In patients with transferrin
