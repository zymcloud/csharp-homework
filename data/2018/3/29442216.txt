Objectives:The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of mental disorders in patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) based on claims data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) in South Korea.Methods:We confirmed mental disorders in a nationwide cohort of 3758 patients receiving LT between January 2010 and December 2014. We categorized the prevalence of mental disorders based on patient age at the time of LT.Results:A total of 288 patients for LT were diagnosed with a mental disorder 1 year before their cancer diagnosis. Of those patients, depression was present in 90 (31.25%) and anxiety in 92 (31.9%) patients at the first diagnosis. The overall frequency of mental disorders peaked just before LT, and substance abuse was the most prevalent mental disorder before LT. The risk of mental disorders after LT was significantly lower in those with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than in those without HCC (hazard ratio = 1.70, p Conclusions:Mental disorders in patients receiving LT showed different patterns of prevalence depending on age at the time of surgery and the nature of underlying diseases. Personalized intervention based on patient characteristics could improve the quality of life.
