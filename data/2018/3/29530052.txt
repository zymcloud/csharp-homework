Background:Multidrug resistance is the main obstacle for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. miR-32-5p is involved in HCC progression but its function in multidrug resistance is still unclear. Here we aim to find out the function of miR-32-5p in inducing multidrug resistance and its underlying mechanisms of transforming sensitive cell to resistant cell.Methods:We detected the expression of miR-32-5p and PTEN in the multidrug-resistant cell line (Bel/5-FU) and the sensitive cell line (Bel7402), HCC and para-carcinoma liver tissues through real-time PCR. Dual-luciferase reporter assay verified PTEN is the target of miR-32-5p. Exosomes from sensitive and multidrug resistant cell line were obtained and confirmed through ultracentrifuge and Nano Analyzer. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments, rescue experiments, a PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor, an exosome biogenesis inhibitor, and nude mice xenograft models were used to determine the underlying mechanisms of miR-32-5p and PTEN, as well as exosomal miR-32-5p in inducing multidrug resistance in vitro and in vivo.Results:miR-32-5p was significantly elevated but PTEN was reduced in Bel/5-FU. An inverse correlation between miR-32-5p and PTEN was confirmed in HCC cell lines and patients; moreover, high expression of miR-32-5p and low expression of PTEN were positively associated with poor prognosis. Over-expression of miR-32-5p activated the PI3K/Akt pathway by suppressing PTEN and induced multidrug resistance via exosomes through promoting angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).Conclusions:Our study demonstrated that the multidrug-resistant cell, Bel/5-FU delivers miR-32-5p to sensitive cell, Bel7402 by exosomes and activates the PI3K/Akt pathway to further induce multidrug resistance by modulating angiogenesis and EMT.
