Purpose:Since HCV infection may lead to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and vitamin D (deficiency) is related to cancer, we investigated if SNPs in genes involved in vitamin D pathway could predict HCV-related HCC presence in patients treated with new anti-HCV drugs.Methods:Patients with chronic hepatitis C and treated with direct-acting antivirals were enrolled. SNPs in VDR, CYP27B1, CYP24A1 and GC genes were assessed through real-time PCR. 258 patients were analyzed.Results:HCC was present in six patients, all taking sofosbuvir, all males and five/six had cirrhosis. HCV-RNA log levels at baseline were statistically different between patients with and without HCC. VDR FokI T > C SNP resulted associated with HCC: all the CC patients were free from HCC. An association between HCC presence and undetectable HCV-RNA at 1 month of therapy was suggested; cirrhosis was related to HCC. HCC risk factors were age, ribavirin administration, IL28Brs12979860CC and previous treatments; VDR FokICC, sex and insulin resistance were protective factors.Conclusions:These data highlighted vitamin D pathway gene SNPs and HCC relationship in the Italian population; further studies are required.
