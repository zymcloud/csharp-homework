Background:The clinical feasibility and usability of intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) tracked by computed tomography (CT) images have been proposed; however, it requires technically demanding manual registration procedure.Study design:A prospective study using real-time virtual sonography (RVS) with novel automatic registration system was conducted in four high-volume centers of liver resection from 2015 to 2016. The requiring time for registration of IOUS and CT images and positional error of confluence of middle hepatic venous tributaries (V8-MHV, V5-MHV) were measured in patients undergoing laparotomy.Results:Automatic registration was successful in 43 of 52 enrolled patients (83%), with error ranges of 11.4 (3.1-69.4) mm for V8-MHV and 16.2 (4.3-66.8) mm for V5-MHV. Time required for total registration process was 36 (27-74) s.Conclusions:The RVS with novel automatic registration system can provide quick and easy registration and acceptable accuracy, which can promote the usage of IOUS.
