Background and aims:Accurate assessment of liver functional reserve pre-operatively is vital for safe hepatic resection. The ALBI score is a new model for assessing liver function. This study aimed to evaluate the value of combining ALBI score with sFLR in predicting post-operative morbidity and PHLF in HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy.Methods:Patients undergoing three-dimensional CT reconstruction prior to hepatectomy for HCC between January 2015 and January 2017 were enrolled. The values of the CP score, ALBI score and sFLR in predicting post-operative outcomes were evaluated.Results:A total of 229 HCC patients were enrolled; 24 (10.5%) experienced major complications and 21 (9.2%) developed PHLF. The incidence of major complications and PHLF increased with increasing ALBI grade. The ALBI grade classified patients with CP grade A into two subgroups with different incidences of PHLF (P=.029). sFLR and ALBI scores were identified as independent predictors of PHLF. The AUC values for the CP score, ALBI score, sFLR and sFLR×ALBI for predicting major complications were 0.600, 0.756, 0.660 and 0.790 respectively. The AUC values of the CP score, ALBI score, sFLR and sFLR×ALBI for predicting PHLF were 0.646, 0.738, 0.758 and 0.884 respectively.Conclusions:The ALBI score showed superior predictive value of post-operative outcomes over CP score, and the combination of sFLR and ALBI score was identified as a stronger predictor of post-operative outcomes than the sFLR or ALBI score alone.
