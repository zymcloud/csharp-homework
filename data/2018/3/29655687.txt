Background:Broussonetia papyrifera (L.) Ventenat, a traditional medicinal herb, has been applied as a folk medicine to treat various diseases. Broussochalcone A (BCA), a chalcone compound isolated from the cortex of Broussonetia papyrifera (L.) Ventenat, exhibits several biological activities including potent anti-oxidant, antiplatelet, and cytotoxic effects.Purpose:The purpose of this study is to elucidate the inhibitory effect of BCA against CYP2J2 enzyme which is predominantly expressed in human tumor tissues and carcinoma cell lines.Study design:The inhibitory effect of BCA on the activities of CYP2J2-mediated metabolism were investigated using human liver microsomes (HLMs), and its anti-cancer effect against human hepatoma HepG2 cells was also evaluated.Methods:Two representative CYP2J2-specific probe substrates, astemizole and ebastine, were incubated in HLMs with BCA. After incubation, the samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. To investigate the binding model between BCA and CYP2J2, we carried out structure-based docking simulations by using software and scripts written in-house.Results:BCA inhibited CYP2J2-mediated astemizole O-demethylation and ebastine hydroxylase activities in a concentration dependent manner with Ki values of 2.3 and 3.7 ÂµM, respectively. It also showed cytotoxic effects against human hepatoma HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner with activation of apoptosis related proteins.Conclusion:Overall, this was the first report of the inhibitory effects of BCA on CYP2J2 in HLMs. The present data suggest that BCA is a potential candidate for further evaluation for its CYP2J2 targeting anti-cancer activities.
