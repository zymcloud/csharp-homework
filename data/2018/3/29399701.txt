Sigma-1 receptor (σ1R), an important transmembrane structural protein, has been demonstrated to be overexpressed in various types of human cancer, and has been confirmed to be involved in many biological behaviors during tumorigenesis and tumor progression. The aim of the present study was to explore the essential role of σ1R in hepatic malignant tumors (HMTs), which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported to date. We assessed σ1R expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and found that σ1R was significantly decreased in HCC when compared with that in benign liver tissues (P
