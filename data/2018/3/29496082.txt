Purpose:To assess the performances of three-dimensional (3D)-T2-weighted sequences compared to standard T2-weighted turbo spin echo (T2-TSE), T2-half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo (T2-HASTE), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and 3D-T1-weighted VIBE sequences in the preoperative detection of malignant liver tumors.Methods:From 2012 to 2015, all patients of our institution undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination for suspected malignant liver tumors were prospectively included. Patients had contrast-enhanced 3D-T1-weighted, DWI, 3D-T2-SPACE, T2-HASTE and T2-TSE sequences. Imaging findings were compared with those obtained at follow-up, surgery and histopathological analysis. Sensitivities for the detection of malignant liver tumors were compared for each sequence using McNemar test. A subgroup analysis was conducted for HCCs. Image artifacts were analyzed and compared using Wilcoxon paired signed rank-test.Results:Thirty-three patients were included: 13 patients had 40 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and 20 had 54 liver metastases. 3D-T2-weighted sequences had a higher sensitivity than T2-weighted TSE sequences for the detection of malignant liver tumors (79.8% versus 68.1%; P Conclusion:3D-T2-weighted sequences show very promising performances for the detection of liver malignant tumors compared to T2-weighted TSE sequences.
