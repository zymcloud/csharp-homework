Background:Stage IV breast cancer was considered to be an incurable disease. Primary site surgery used to be reserved to control local complications. In the present study, we compared the survival of women who received therapeutic breast surgery for stage IV breast cancer at initial diagnosis to the survival of those who did not.Methods:Two French hospitals databases were retrospectively screened from 2005 to 2012. We identified all women with metastatic breast cancer at diagnosis. Patients' data were obtained by a review of their medical history. Data were analyzed according the four breast cancer subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, her 2 and triple negative).Results:One hundred thirty nine women were included, of whom 69 had primary site surgery. TNM stage and phenotypes of breast cancer were comparable in the two groups but operated women were younger than women who did not (p<0.0001). Average follow-up was 31Â±23.3 months [1-97]. Through logistic regression, we observed that tumor resection decreased death hazard ratio vs no surgery: HR 0.33, 95% CI [0.16-0.66] p=0.001. In the surgery group, there was no survival difference if women received chemotherapy (p=0.23). There were more patients with only one metastatic site in the surgery group (p=0.002) and they had been more treated with systemic therapy. When we compared tumor phenotypes individually, surgery increased survival on luminal A breast cancer patients (p<.0001).Conclusion:Women with luminal A breast cancer and synchronous metastasis seemed to benefit from surgery. The development of a national reporting system or registers for outcomes would facilitate the investigation of the disease across a multitude of aspects of stage IV breast cancer.
