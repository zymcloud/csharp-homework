Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key process involving acquisition of metastatic potential for cancer cells. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer where metastasis is linked to patient survival. JUB has been reported to be involved in several physiological processes, however, pathological roles of JUB in tumor metastasis have been poorly studied. Here, we report that JUB is highly upregulated in clinical specimens and HCC cell lines. Through gain- and loss-of-function studies, JUB was demonstrated to facilitate HCC cell EMT. We found that JUB expression was upregulated in the HCC tissues compared to borderline or benign tissues. Experimental EMT induced by JUB plasmid transfection proved that JUB protein overexpression could enhance transwell migration ability and significantly upregulate mesenchymal marker proteins, N-cadherin and concurrently downregulate the epithelial marker E-cadherin. Subsequently, through Western blot assay, we found that JUB could activate the Wnt-signaling component β-catenin in the nuclei. Our findings revealed that JUB might be a key molecule regulating EMT through modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
