Background:Gastro-intestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are very rare tumors of the gastro-intestinal tract, originating from the interstitial cells of Cajal or a common cell precursor which both express type III tyrosine kinase receptors. Regorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor used to treat gastro-intestinal stromal tumors. To our knowledge this is the first case in literature to show the response of regorafenib on PET.Case presentation:A 37-year-old male with lower abdominal pain and weight loss was referred to our hospital. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse peritoneal implants. Surgical specimen histology showed a GIST with c-KIT exon 11 deletion (c.1708_1728del) and treatment with imatinib 400 mg/day was initiated. Due to disease progression illustrated on baseline versus follow-up 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans therapy was switched to imatinib 800 mg/day and later to sunitinib 50 mg/day. Upon further disease progression 10 months later, third line treatment with regorafenib 160 mg/day was initiated. 18F-FDG-PET/CT showed the metabolic responses after 4 months regorafenib treatment ranging from complete response to the appearance of a new lesion in the liver. The new hypermetabolic lesion was only seen on the non-attenuation-corrected images because of breathing motion artifact.Conclusion:This case illustrates that metabolic response can occur in GIST lesions without morphological response after third line regorafinib treatment. Furthermore this is the first case in literature to show regorafinib response on PET.
