Roots of Sophora flavescens is an important herbal medicine for treatment of HBV and hepatic carcinoma in China. Alkaloids in the root were well known for exhibiting good hepato-protective and anti-HBV effects. However, polysaccharides as main components in the root remained unknown. In the studies, we investigated the chemical features and hepatoprotective effects of Sophora flavescens polysaccharides (SFP-100 and its active fractions) with ConA-induced hepatitis mice, human liver LO2 cells and HepG2.2.15 cells. The results showed that SFP-100 was composed of arabinose, glucose, galactose and galacturonic acid, SFP-100-A mainly contained glucose. SFP-100-B and SFP-100-C were acidic polysaccharides. SFP-100 significantly decreased hepatocytes apoptosis, inhibited the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into liver, and improved the production of IFN-Î³ and IL-6 of splenocytes in ConA-induced hepatitis mice. SFP-100 and its two sugar fractions increased LO2 cell proliferation and reduced cell apoptosis induced by ConA. SFP-100, SFP-100-A and SFP-100-C remarkedly inhibited the secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg by HepG2.2.15 cells.These results suggested Sophora flavescens polysaccharides exerts significant hepatoprotective and anti-HBV roles, and further is used for treatment of immune-mediated liver disease in the future.
