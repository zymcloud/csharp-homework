Objective:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a high-burden disease. Peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) is a member of the peroxiredoxin family of antioxidant enzymes. The aim of this study was to assess the value of PRDX1 for predicting HCC recurrence after curative resection and to explore the role of PRDX1 in HCC cell migration and invasion.Methods:Data of patients with HCC who had undergone complete resection between 2002 and 2006 were collected. Immunohistochemical detection of PRDX1 in HCC tissue and adjacent non-cancerous tissue was conducted. Kaplan-Meier survival estimate and log-rank test were used to assess the relationship between PRDX1 expression and prognostic significance. HCC cell migration and invasion together with the interaction between PRDX1 and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 37 (UCH37) were studied in vitro.Results:PRDX1 was expressed at lower levels in HCC tissues than in adjacent non-cancerous tissues, and PRDX1 was found to be an independent risk factor for disease-free survival and overall survival. PRDX1 restrained cell migration and invasion in vitro. PRDX1 was found to interact with UCH37 to affect HCC cell migration and invasion.Conclusion:PRDX1 restrains cell migration and invasion in HCC cell lines and that may be involved in a UCH37-relevant pathway, suggesting that PRDX1 may be a new marker for HCC recurrence after surgery.
