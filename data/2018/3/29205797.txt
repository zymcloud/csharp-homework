A variety of surgical and other local-regional approaches to the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are in clinical use. External beam radiation therapy is a relative newcomer to the portfolio of treatment options. Advances in planning and delivery of radiation therapy, developing in parallel with and inspiring changing paradigms of tumor management in the field of radiation oncology, have led to growing interest in radiation therapy as a viable treatment option for HCC as well as other liver tumors.
