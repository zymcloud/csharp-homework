Background:Surgery for metachronous adrenal metastases from solid primary carcinoma has increased with the development of technical skills. Here we analyzed the postoperative clinical outcomes of patients who underwent adrenalectomy for metachronous adrenal metastases from solid primary carcinomas.Methods:Patients who underwent adrenalectomy for metachronous adrenal metastases after initial treatment of primary carcinoma at Asan Medical Center from 2000 to 2010 were included. Clinicopathological parameters were analyzed to evaluate prognostic outcomes.Results:A total of 30 patients with 19 hepatocellular carcinomas and 11 lung carcinomas were included. The mean age was 54.3 years. The mean time until adrenalectomy was 23 months. The size of the metastatic adrenal tumor and the disease status of the primary carcinoma at the time of adrenalectomy were associated with second recurrence after adrenalectomy (P Conclusions:Surgical treatment should be recommended for metachronous adrenal metastases in patients with no evidence of primary carcinoma and/or in those having metastatic adrenal tumors â‰¤4.4 cm. This approach may increase the recurrence-free interval related to second recurrence. Further, laparoscopic adrenalectomy appears sufficient for the treatment of such patients.
