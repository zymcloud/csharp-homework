Aim:We evaluated two treatment sequences, transarterial radioembolization followed by transarterial chemoembolization and possibly sorafenib (=TTS) versus transarterial radioembolization followed by sorafenib alone (=TS), to identify the most cost-effective pathway to treat intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma from the Italian healthcare system perspective.Materials & methods:A Markov model was developed to project costs and health outcomes for TTS and TS over a lifetime horizon. Data available at three hospitals in Italy were collected. Healthcare resource utilization was derived from standard clinical protocols. Costs were obtained from official regional tariffs.Results & conclusion:Taking into consideration 16 patients for TTS and 22 patients for TS pathways, the TTS sequence provided a dominant strategy in comparison to TS. Further evidence is desirable to confirm these results.
