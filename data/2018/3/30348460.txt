Background:Although prophylactic glucocorticoids have been used before liver resection to minimize liver dysfunction, it is unknown whether treatment with glucocorticoids will accelerates recovery from hyperbilirubinemia after liver resection.Methods:In this open-label, randomized, controlled trial, patients with hyperbilirubinemia (>2.5 × and ≤5 × the upper limit of normal) within 7 days after hepatic resection were assigned randomly to the dexamethasone or control groups. For the dexamethasone group, 10 mg, 10 mg, and 5 mg dexamethasone were administered intravenously on days 0, 1, and 2, respectively, after randomization. For the control group, patients received standard treatment only. The primary outcome was time to recovery from hyperbilirubinemia defined as the period from the day of randomization to the day when serum bilirubin decreased to ≤1.5 times that of the upper limit of normal. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of postoperative complications, postoperative hospital stay, and hospital expense.Results:Between March 2016 and December 2017, 76 participants were enrolled (38 in each group). Median time to recovery from hyperbilirubinemia was less in the dexamethasone group than in the control group (2 vs 4 days, P < .001). Serum bilirubin levels were less in the dexamethasone group on days 1-3 after randomization (P < .05). The prevalence of infection, posthepatectomy liver failure, postoperative hospital stay, and hospital expense were not different between the groups.Conclusion:Dexamethasone accelerated recovery from hyperbilirubinemia and decreased serum bilirubin levels without causing more side effects in patients after hepatectomy.
