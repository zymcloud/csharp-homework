Troxerutin (TXER) a rutin derivative is known for its anticancer effect against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). As part of large study, recently we have shown TXER interact with genetic material and its anti-mutagenic property. In the present study we have explored its possible mode of action in HCC. Since TXER alone did not show significant anticancer effect on Huh-7 cells, in vitro biochemical assays were performed for determining anticancer efficacy of TXER + metal complex using transition metals such as Cu, Zn, and Fe. The anticancer efficacy of TXER + Cu on Huh-7 cells were evaluated using MTT assay, DCFDA, JC-1 staining, comet assay, cell cycle analysis, immunocytochemistry, and Western blotting. Non-toxic nature of TXER was analyzed on primary rat hepatocytes. The in vivo efficacy of TXER was tested in N-nitrosodiethylamine initiated and Î³-benzene hexachloride and partial hepatectomy promoted rat liver cancer. Liver markers, transition metal levels, histopathological examination, and expression levels of GST-P, 8-OHdG and Ki-67 were studied to assess the in vivo anticancer effect of TXER. We observed that TXER + Cu induced extensive cellular death on Huh-7 cells through generating free radicals and did not possess any toxic effect on normal hepatocytes. The in vivo studies revealed that TXER possess significant anti-cancer effect as assessed through improved liver markers and suppressed GST-P, 8-OHdG, and Ki-67 expression. TXER treatment reduced the hepatic Cu level in cancer bearing animals. Current study brings the putative mechanism involved in anti-cancer effect of TXER, further it will help to formulate phytoconstituents coupled anti-cancer drug for effective treatment of HCC.
