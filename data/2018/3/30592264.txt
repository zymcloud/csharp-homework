Progressive liver fibrosis is the primary cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and leads to considerable morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are associated with fibrotic processes in liver disorders, although the exact role of miR‑219 remains unclear and the relevant mechanisms remain to be completely understood. To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to demonstrate the functional implications of miR‑219 expression during liver fibrosis. The present study reported that miR‑219 exhibited significantly reduced expression in serum from patients and that its expression was negatively associated with clinical stage. It was also demonstrated that miR‑219 attenuated angiotensin II‑induced expression of pro‑fibrotic markers, including α‑smooth muscle actin, atlastin GTPase 1 and collagen. Additionally, a CCl4‑induced mouse liver injury model was used to demonstrate that miR‑219 strongly suppressed liver fibrosis in vivo. Furthermore, the present study identified tumor growth factor β receptor 2 (TGFBR2) as a direct target gene of miR‑219. In conclusion, the results of the present study revealed that miR‑219 may regulate pro‑fibrotic markers by directly targeting the TGFBR2 gene and the miR‑219/TGFBR2 signaling pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for liver fibrosis.
