Cabozantinib is an oral small-molecule multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that may confer an advantage over other TKIs that target a single receptor. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of both advanced renal cell carcinoma and progressive metastatic medullary thyroid cancer, and it is being investigated for a wide array of other malignancies. Rationale for use, clinical trial data, and current recommendations for cabozantinib in renal cell cancer, thyroid cancer, prostate cancer, hepatocellular cancer, and lung cancer are detailed in this article. Common adverse events are reviewed, and management strategies for select adverse events are discussed. Implications for contemporary practitioners are also provided because use of this novel agent is likely to increase as more studies are completed.
