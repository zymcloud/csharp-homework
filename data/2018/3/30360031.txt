Background/aims:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming a worldwide epidemic, and is frequently found in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). We investigated the impact of histologically proven hepatic steatosis on the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in CHB patients without excessive alcohol intake.Methods:Consecutive CHB patients who underwent liver biopsy from January 2007 to December 2015 were included. The association between hepatic steatosis (â‰¥ 5%) and subsequent HCC risk was analyzed. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) using the propensity score was applied to adjust for differences in patient characteristics, including metabolic factors.Results:Fatty liver was histologically proven in 70 patients (21.8%) among a total of 321 patients. During the median (interquartile range) follow-up of 5.3 (2.9-8.3) years, 17 of 321 patients (5.3%) developed HCC: 8 of 70 patients (11.4%) with fatty liver and 9 of 251 patients (3.6%) without fatty liver. The five-year cumulative incidences of HCC among patients without and with fatty liver were 1.9% and 8.2%, respectively (P=0.004). Coexisting fatty liver was associated with a higher risk for HCC (adjusted hazards ratio [HR], 3.005; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.122-8.051; P=0.03). After balancing with IPW, HCC incidences were not significantly different between the groups (P=0.19), and the association between fatty liver and HCC was not significant (adjusted HR, 1.709; 95% CI, 0.404-7.228; P=0.47).Conclusion:Superimposed NAFLD was associated with a higher HCC risk in CHB patients. However, the association between steatosis per se and HCC risk was not evident after adjustment for metabolic factors.
