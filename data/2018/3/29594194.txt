Introduction:This article summarize the available data on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) epidemiology in Poland. Data regarding the HCC incidence rate are divergent. Statistical data presented by NFZ appear more credible in that matter than data published by the Polish Oncology Center (POC).Material and methods:The analysis included data from the Polish Bibliography Database (GBL), the Polish National Health Fund Institution (NFZ), the scientific paper "Malignant neoplasms in Poland" issued by POC and the central liver transplant registry maintained by the Polish transplant coordinating center "Poltransplant" (2010-2015).Results:Data regarding the HCC incidence rate are divergent. Statistical data presented by NFZ appear more credible in that matter than data published by POC.Conclusions:The occurrence of HCC in Poland is at the average European level and is similarly rising. The incidence rate is underestimated. It is due to faulty epidemiology data collection techniques. The highest risk group comprises men over the age of 50 with concomitant liver cirrhosis. The most common HCC etiology is HCV infection.
