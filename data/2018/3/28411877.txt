Background/purpose:This study aimed to compare the outcomes of combined hepatic resection (HR) plus intraoperative radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and transarterial embolization (TAE) for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in case-controlled patient groups using the propensity score.Methods:A total of 179 patients with multifocal HCC treated with HR plus RFA (n = 26) or TAE (n = 153) were retrospectively studied. All patients were classified as BCLC stage B and Child-Pugh class A. Analyses were performed over all participants as well as for propensity score-matched (1:3) patients to adjust for baseline differences. Cumulative overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP) were compared between the two groups using the Kaplan-Meier method, and independent predictors were identified by multivariate Cox regression analysis.Results:Patients treated with HR plus RFA had better OS and longer TTP than those with TAE (p = 0.011 and p Conclusion:Combined HR plus RFA may provide survival advantage compared to TAE in patients with BCLC stage B HCC.
