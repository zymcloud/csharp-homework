Aim:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common and aggressive malignant tumor with an especially high prevalence in Asian populations. This study aimed to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs using expression microarray and to explore the association between differential expression of lncRNAs and prognosis of HCC.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed 63 patients with primary HCC that underwent a curative liver resection at the Department of General Surgery, Jingmen First People's Hospital. The expression level of lncRNAs DUXAP9 and DUXAP10 were detected by real-time PCR. Prognostic factors were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models.Results:By microarray profiling of lncRNAs, 256 were found to be differentially expressed, including 162 upregulated and 94 downregulated (P<0.05, fold change >2). Two candidate lncRNAs were determined as targets in this study, including DUXAP9 (upregulated by 6.35 fold) and DUXAP10 (upregulated by 4.53 fold). DUXAP9 and DUXAP10 were downregulated in the normal liver cell lines Chang liver, HL7702, THLE-2, THLE-3, FL62891, and AML12, which were significantly lower than HCC cell lines SMMC-7721, Hep3B, HuH7, MHCC-97H, HCC-LM, and SK-Hep-1 (P<0.05). Overexpression of lncRNAs DUXAP9 and DUXAP10 were associated with decreasing OS rates, respectively (P=0.0263 and P=0.0285). Meanwhile, Overexpression of DUXAP9 and DUXAP10 was associated with decreasing PFS rates, respectively (P=0.0174 and P=0.0041). After adjusting for competing risk factors, we identified microvascular invasion (P=0.014), tumor size (P=0.026), and lncRNAs DUXAP9 (P=0.001) and DUXAP10 (P=0.036) expression levels as independent prognostic factors associated with prognosis of patients with HCC.Conclusions:We found that lncRNAs DUXAP9 and DUXAP10 are expressed significantly higher in HCC tissues compared with non-tumorous tissues. Overexpression of DUXAP9 and DUXAP10 were independent risk factors associated with prognosis of patients with HCC.
