Trace elements are dietary elements which are needed in very minute quantities for the proper growth, development, and physiology of the organism, which play a crucial part in energy metabolism and material transformation. It's generally agreed that trace elements are essential components of parenteral nutrition. These societies for parenteral and enteral nutrition in Europe, the United States and Australia proposed that various trace elements should be provided daily from commencement for all patients receiving parenteral nutrition and published some guidelines on adult trace elements recommendations for parenteral nutrition. This consensus is commissioned by the Chinese Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, based on the principles of evidence-based medicine. This consensus summarizes the latest available evidence and refers to some recommendations in guidelines both at home and abroad. The detailed evidence-based recommendations include the recommended dose for trace elements supplement of parenteral nutrition by international societies, severe traumatic and perioperative patients, critically ill patients and major burns, cancer patients, liver disease patients, pediatric patients and other parts. The goal is to provide guidance and advice about the supplement of trace elements for patients receiving parenteral nutrition.
