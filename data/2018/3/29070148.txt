The acquisition of invasive functions by tumor cells is a first and crucial step toward the development of metastasis, which nowadays represents the main cause of cancer-related death. Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a primary liver cancer originating from the biliary epithelium, typically develops intrahepatic or lymph node metastases at early stages, thus preventing the majority of patients from undergoing curative treatments, consistent with their very poor prognosis. As in most carcinomas, CCA cells gradually adopt a motile, mesenchymal-like phenotype, enabling them to cross the basement membrane, detach from the primary tumor, and invade the surrounding stroma. Unfortunately, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that synergistically orchestrate this proinvasive phenotypic switch. Autocrine and paracrine signals (cyto/chemokines, growth factors, and morphogens) permeating the tumor microenvironment undoubtedly play a prominent role in this context. Moreover, a number of recently identified signaling systems are currently drawing attention as putative mechanistic determinants of CCA cell invasion. They encompass transcription factors, protein kinases and phosphatases, ubiquitin ligases, adaptor proteins, and miRNAs, whose aberrant expression may result from either stochastic mutations or the abnormal activation of upstream pro-oncogenic pathways. Herein we sought to summarize the most relevant molecules in this field and to discuss their mechanism of action and potential prognostic relevance in CCA. Hopefully, a deeper knowledge of the molecular determinants of CCA invasiveness will help to identify clinically useful biomarkers and novel druggable targets, with the ultimate goal to develop innovative approaches to the management of this devastating malignancy.
