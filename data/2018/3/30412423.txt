This article highlights the range of osseous findings that can be encountered as well as the imaging features of extramedullary haematopoiesis. As iron overload remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in these disorders, we also discuss the MRI evaluation of hepatic and cardiac hemosiderosis, to aid in the optimization of iron chelation therapy. Future imaging use will be dictated by evolving clinical needs, such as in screening for emerging morbidities, including hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
