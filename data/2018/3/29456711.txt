The aim of the present study was to investigate the value of the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score in the assessment of the disease conditions of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ACLF), HBV-related liver cirrhosis (HBV-LC) and HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-HCC). A total of 395 patients with HBV-ACLF, HBV-LC, or HBV-HCC were retrospectively studied. The ALBI, Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores of the patients were calculated, and the relationships between the ALBI score and the CTP and MELD scores were investigated. Furthermore, the ALBI grading was tested for the evaluation of the severity and stages of HBV-ACLF, HBV-LC, and HBV-HCC, especially when classifying the clinical stages of HBV-ACLF. The mean ALBI scores of the HBV-ACLF, HBV-LC, and HBV-HCC patients were -1.17±0.55, -1.76±0.66 and -2.59±0.62, respectively; the mean CTP scores were 10.70±1.81, 8.19±1.25 and 5.81±1.22, respectively; and the mean MELD scores were 19.93±7.44, 11.10±4.39 and 7.01±3.22, respectively. The ALBI scores were positively correlated with the CTP and MELD scores. The mean ALBI score and the frequency of grade 3 disease were higher in HBV-ACLF patients than in patients with HBV-LC or HBV-HCC. A later HBV-ACLF stage resulted in a higher frequency of ALBI grades of 3. In conclusion, ALBI scores exhibited parallel tendencies to the CTP and MELD scores in HBV-ACLF, HBV-LC, and HBV-HCC patients; thus, ALBI grading may be a simple but applicable method for the evaluation of the functional status of patients with HBV-related end-stage liver diseases.
