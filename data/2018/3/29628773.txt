Background:Although hepatitis B virus (HBV) is still one of the most common etiological factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the association between the HBV mutations and the clinical characteristics and prognosis of HBV-related HCC patients (HBV-HCC) after surgical resection remains largely unknown.Materials and methods:A cohort of 131 consecutive patients who received hepatectomy for HBV-HCC were retrospectively enrolled. The HBV genotype and 14 genomic mutations, which have been reported to relate to HCC in liver samples, were sequenced. The associations between the genomic mutations and clinical characteristics and outcomes were analyzed.Results:Both A1762T/G1764A mutation and Pre S deletion related to worse overall survival (OS, p=0.040 and p<0.001, respectively) and disease-free survival (DFS, p=0.040 and p<0.001, respectively), G1899A mutation related to worse OS (p=0.030), A1762T/G1764A mutation correlated with tumor size (r=0.204, p=0.019), G1899A mutation correlated with vascular invasion (r=0.332, p<0.001), and Pre S deletion correlated with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP; r=0.254, p=0.003) positively. Multivariate analysis with Cox proportional hazards model revealed that both A1762T/G1764A mutation and Pre S deletion were independent prognostic factors for OS (hazard ratio [HR]=3.701, 95% CI=1.390-9.855, p=0.009, and HR=4.816, 95% CI=2.311-10.032, p<0.001, respectively) and DFS (HR=3.245, 95% CI=1.400-7.521, p=0.006, and HR=2.437, 95% CI=1.311-4.530, p<0.001, respectively), and patients with dual mutations were found to have the worst OS and DFS (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). Patients with A1762T/G1764A mutation or Pre S deletion were more likely to have early recurrence (p=0.042 and p=0.019, respectively).Conclusion:HBV DNA genomic mutations in A1762T/G1764A and Pre S deletion were associated with worse prognoses and early recurrence for HBV-HCC patients after surgery.
