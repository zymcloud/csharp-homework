The treatment of chronic hepatitis C has gradually entered into the era of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) from the era of pegylated interferon-α combined with ribavirin, which has a high curative effect, good tolerability, and complete patient-friendly oral form of administration. Sustained virologic response (SVR) acquired by pegylated interferon-α plus ribavirin therapy has been widely recognized by scholars in reducing the recurrence of primary liver cancer and liver cancer, especially in cirrhotic patients. The clinical application time of DAAs is short and its report is inconsistent with the increase or decrease of primary liver cancer and liver cancer recurrence. Simultaneously, the effect of SVR in people with hepatocellular carcinoma on DAAs seems to be different from those in patients without hepatocellular carcinoma. This article reviews some of the existing reports in order to increase the understanding of DAAs and liver cancer and serve the long-term benefit of clinical treatment.
