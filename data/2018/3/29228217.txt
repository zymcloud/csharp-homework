Arf, a well-established tumor suppressor, is either mutated or downregulated in a wide array of cancers. However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression is controversial. Conflicting observations have been published regarding its expression in HCC. In this study, we provide clear genetic evidence demonstrating a protective role of p19Arf in hepatocarcinogenesis. Using Ras-induced mouse model, we show that p19Arf deficiency accelerates progression of aggressive HCC in vivo. To investigate the role of p14ARF in human liver cancers, we analyzed its expression in human HCC using immunohistochemistry (IHC). We observe lack of nucleolar p14ARF in 43.02% of human HCC samples and that low expression of p14ARF strongly correlates with the early onset of HCC. Importantly, cirrhotic livers that did not progress to HCC harbor higher expression of the p14ARF protein in hepatocytes compared with that in cirrhotic livers with HCC. These results are significant because they suggest that nucleolar p14ARF can be used as early prognostic marker in chronic liver disease to reliably identify patients with high risk for developing liver cancer. Currently, there is no effective systemic therapy for advanced liver cancer; hence, more efficient patient screening and early detection of HCC would significantly contribute to the eradication of this devastating disease.
