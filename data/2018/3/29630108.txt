Objective:Investigating the molecular signaling pathways using CD13 as a marker for Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) in human liver cancer.Patients and methods:In the present study, liver carcinoma biopsies were obtained from the liver cancer patients, as well as healthy controls. Immunohistochemistry and Immunoblotting experiments were performed accordingly to conclude the data.Results:Immunohistochemistry along with immunoblot data showed the expression of Oct-4, STAT3 and interestingly Embryonic Liver Fodrin (ELF) in the CD13 positive liver cancer stem cells. Though embryonic liver fodrin (ELF) is a pro-differentiation protein, it was expressed in the CD13 positive liver cancer stem cells along with stem cell markers such as Oct-4 and STAT3.Conclusions:Our finding concludes that an association of ELF expression was noted in liver cancer patients. Hence, ELF may have value as prognostic indicators and may facilitate the development of novel therapeutics for liver cancer.
