Objective:To evaluate the safety of PleurX in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites.Methods:We prospectively registered patients who received a PleurX catheter cirrhosis-associated refractory ascites at our department from July 2015 to November 2016. Our control group consisted of matched cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites treated with large volume paracentesis (LVP) and patients with malignant ascites treated with PleurX during the same period.Results:We included 25 patients with cirrhosis-related ascites (7 in PleurX group) and 17 with malignant ascites (14 in PleurX group). Of these, six patients had hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis (5 in PleurX group). None were eligible for insertion of a TIPS or liver transplantation. The maximum duration of follow-up was (480 days) in the PleurX group and 366 days in the LVP group (median 84 and 173 days, respectively). There was no difference in mortality when comparing PleurX with LVP treatment (hazard ratios: 3.0 and 1.0, p = .23 and .96, respectively). Mortality was higher in patients with malignant ascites (p= .01). We found no significant differences in adverse events (incl. spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) or in P-albumin, P-creatinine and P-sodium between the groups.Conclusion:PleurX insertion for the treatment of refractory ascites in cirrhotic patients appears to be safe. Prospective randomized trials are necessary in order to confirm these findings.
Permanent tunneled peritoneal catheter; large volume paracentesis; refractory ascites.
