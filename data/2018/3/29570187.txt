Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary malignancy of the liver, with increasing incidence worldwide. Chronic liver diseases, especially liver cirrhosis, are the primary risk factors in the pathogenesis. Curative therapy is usually possible only in early disease, however, most cases are diagnosed at advanced stage. Until recently sorafenib was the only viable option for systemic treatment, however, over the past years many new targeted and immunotherapy drugs proved to be efficient in first and second line as well.
