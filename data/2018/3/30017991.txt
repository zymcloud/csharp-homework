Iron is an essential for organisms and the liver plays a major role in its storage. In pathologic conditions, where iron absorption from the intestine or iron uptake into the hepatocytes is increased, excess iron accumulates in the hepatocytes, leading to hepatocyte injury through the production of free radicals. Iron exerts its toxicity by catalyzing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS causes cell injury by inducing damage to the lysosomal, cytoplasmic, nuclear and mitochondrial membranes, apoptosis through activation of the caspase cascade, and hyperoxidation of fatty chains. In this manuscript, we reviewed the articles regarding role of iron in hepatic inflammation and hepatocellular carcinoma.
