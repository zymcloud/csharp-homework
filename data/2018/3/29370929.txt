Background:Studies comparing orthotopic liver transplantation to margin negative resection for patients with small unifocal hepatocellular carcinoma have not controlled for degree of cirrhosis.Methods:The National Cancer Database was used to identify patients with preserved liver function (Model for End-stage Liver Disease score ≤12) who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation or margin negative resection for American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I hepatocellular carcinoma lesions Results:In the study, 241 (53%) patients underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. In addition, 219 (47%) underwent margin negative resection. On multivariable regression, patients having a Charlson comorbidity score ≥2 were more likely to undergo orthotopic liver transplantation, (odds ratio 1.94, P=.03). African American patients (odds ratio 0.44, P=.02), and patients of advanced age (odds ratio 0.92, PConclusion:Orthotopic liver transplantation offers a survival advantage relative to margin negative resection for patients with small unifocal hepatocellular carcinoma and preserved liver function.
