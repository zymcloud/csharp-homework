The chronic infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) inflicts 250 million people worldwide representing a major public health threat. A significant subpopulation of patients eventually develop cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Unfortunately, none of the current standard therapies for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) result in a satisfactory clinical cure rate. Driven by a highly unmet medical need, multiple pharmaceutical companies and research institutions have been engaged in drug discovery and development to improve the CHB functional cure rate, defined by sustainable viral suppression and HBsAg clearance after a finite treatment. This Review summarizes the recent advances in the discovery and development of novel anti-HBV small molecules. It is believed that an improved CHB functional cure rate may be accomplished via the combination of molecules with distinct MoAs. Thus, certain molecules may evolve into key components of a suitable combination therapy leading to superior outcome of clinical efficacy in the future.
