Cancer cells have metabolic features that allow them to preferentially metabolize glucose through aerobic glycolysis, providing them with a progression advantage. However, microRNA (miRNA) regulation of aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells has not been extensively investigated. We addressed this in the present study by examining the regulation of miR-139-5p on aerobic glycolysis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using clinical specimens, HCC cells, and a mouse xenograft model. We found that overexpressing miR-139-5p restrained aerobic glycolysis, suppressing proliferation, migration, and invasion in HCC cells. miR-139-5p regulated hexokinase 1 (HK1) and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) expression by directly targeting the transcription factor ETS1, which bound to the promoters of the HK1 and PFKFB3 genes. miR-139-5p-induced aerobic glycolysis, proliferation, migration, and invasion were reversed by ETS1 overexpression, while ETS1 silencing induced the expression of miR-139-5p via a post-transcriptional regulation mode involving Drosha. miR-139-5p expression was reduced in HCC compared to para-carcinoma tissue, which was confirmed in The Cancer Genome Atlas and GSE54751 HCC cohorts. Notably, the lower expression of mir-139 was correlated with worse prognosis. These outcomes indicate that reciprocal regulatory interactions between miR-139-5p and ETS1 modulate aerobic glycolysis, proliferation, and metastasis in HCC cells, suggesting new targets for HCC treatment.
