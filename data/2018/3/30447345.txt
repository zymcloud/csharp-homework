Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer in adults and is a leading cause of worldwide cancer mortality. Intrahepatic dissemination and extrahepatic metastasis are key factors in malignant growth of HCC. Reducing HCC-associated metastasis is critically dependent on uncovering molecular signaling pathways that promote HCC metastasis. In this study, we explored the effect of TGF-β1 and RELN on cell migration, and the relationship between TGF-β1 and RELN in HCC cells. The data presented that TGF-β1 and RELN showed an opposite expression pattern, and either increased expression of TGF-β1 or decreased expression of RELN increased HCC cell migration ability. We also found TGF-β1 enhanced cell migration ability was through repressing RELN expression, as overexpression of RELN impaired TGF-β1 enhanced cell migration. Our work revealed the relationship between TGF-β1 and RELN and uncovered the important role of RELN in suppressing cell migration in HCC cells.
