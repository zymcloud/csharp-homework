Background:Current imaging guidelines do not specify the preferred hepatobiliary contrast agent when differentiating hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) from focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) on MRI.Purpose:To analyze intrapatient differences in the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) after use of both gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA) and gadoxetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced MRI to differentiate HCA from FNH.Study type:Retrospective.Population:Patients who underwent both Gd-BOPTA and Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI, including 33 patients with 82 lesions (67 HCA; 15 FNH), with a step-down reference standard of pathology, 20% regression, identical appearance to earlier biopsied lesions, and stringent imaging findings.Field strength/sequence:1.5T and 3T HBP of Gd-BOPTA and Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI, precontrast fat-suppressed T1 -weighted sequence.Assessment:Signal intensities relative to the surrounding liver in the HBP were assessed by two observers.Statistical tests:Sensitivity and specificity of HCA diagnosis were calculated for both contrast agents. Interobserver agreement was evaluated using Cohen's kappa; differences in degree of certainty for scoring a lesion were calculated by means of the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Differences in signal intensity between Gd-BOPTA and Gd-EOB-DTPA were calculated using McNemar's test.Results:Almost perfect agreement was found between observers for scored signal intensities with both contrast agents. In 30 of the 82 lesions (37%) a difference was observed between contrast agents in the HBP, with Gd-EOB-DTPA proving correct in all but one of the discordant lesions. When distinguishing HCA from FNH, Gd-BOPTA showed a sensitivity of 46% (31/67) and a specificity of 87% (13/15), while the sensitivity and specificity of Gd-EOB-DTPA was 85% (57/67) and 100% (15/15), respectively. A risk of misclassifying HCA as FNH typically occurs for Gd-BOPTA when lesions are intrinsically hyperintense (P < 0.005).Data conclusion:The HBP of Gd-EOB-DTPA shows superior accuracy in ruling out HCA in comparison with Gd-BOPTA, especially when the lesion is intrinsically hyperintense on T1 -weighted imaging.Level of evidence:3 Technical Efficacy: Stage 3 J.
