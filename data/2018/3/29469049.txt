Introduction:Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an effective and minimally invasive technique for the management of hepatic hemangiomas (HHs). This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic RFA for HHs.Material and methods:Forty-four patients with 50 hepatic hemangiomas (5-10 cm in diameter) undergoing laparoscopic RFA from January 2012 to May 2015 at three tertiary hospitals in China were retrospectively analyzed.Results:Thirty-three patients with subcapsular hemangiomas were treated with a laparoscopic approach, and 11 patients with lesions in the liver parenchyma were treated with a combined laparoscopy and an ultrasound-guided percutaneous approach. No conversion to open surgery or two-step surgery occurred during the study period. Patients with small hemangiomas (< 7 cm) required a significantly shorter operating time (71.1 ± 20.18 min vs. 106 ± 23.55 min, p = 0.000) and fewer punctures compared with patients with large hemangiomas (> 7 cm) (4.61 ± 1.09 vs. 6.73 ±1.01, P < 0.05). According to the Dindo-Clavien classification, 15 patients experienced 34 Grade 1 complications, and two had complications of Grade 3a. All complications were resolved by conservative treatment. Forty-three (86.0%) HHs in 38 patients were completely ablated after RFA, and 7 (14.0%) HHs in 6 patients were incompletely ablated. All patients were followed up for 6-24 months (mean 15 ± 6 months).Conclusion:The data showed that laparoscopic RFA is an effective treatment for small (< 10 cm) HHs. While the incidence of postoperative complications remains high, the majority of complications are minor. Patients undergoing laparoscopic RFA for HHs, even for the small ones, should be carefully selected.
