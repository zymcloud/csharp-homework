Purpose To determine the preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings potentially most useful for predicting cytokeratin 19 (CK19)-positive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to evaluate the prognosis after curative resection in patients with a single HCC lesion positive for CK19 compared with patients with HCC who are negative for CK19. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this study and waived the requirement for informed consent. Two hundred four patients with CK19-negative HCC and 38 with CK19-positive HCC who underwent curative resection after gadoxetic acid-enhanced and diffusion-weighted MR imaging were retrospectively evaluated in a single institution. Two radiologists evaluated preoperative findings at MR imaging. Significant findings for differentiating the two groups were identified at univariate and multivariate analyses. By using receiver operating characteristic analysis, the optimal cut-off values for quantitative variables were determined. Recurrence-free survival rates after surgery were also compared between groups. Results At multivariate analysis, irregular tumor margin (P = .024), arterial rim enhancement (P Â© RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.
