Background:Hepatitis is the most important cause of hepatocellular carcinoma in Korea. This study evaluated the socioeconomic differences in self- and family awareness of hepatitis status among hepatitis B and C carriers and their cohabitants in rural Korea.Methods:In total, 5,017 randomly selected rural residents participated in a seroepidemiologic and questionnaire survey. We found 326 hepatitis B surface antigen carriers or hepatitis C antibody carriers and 310 family members cohabiting with members of this group.Results:Among the hepatitis B carriers and their family members, 48.1% were aware of their own status and 36.7% were aware of their cohabitant's hepatitis status, respectively. Only 28.1% of the hepatitis C carriers were aware of their own status, and only 23.3% of their cohabiting family members knew about their family member's hepatitis C status. A multivariate analysis including health-related factors, such as alcohol consumption, family history of liver disease, and recent acupuncture history, found that self-awareness was significantly lower in the older group and significantly higher in the more educated and higher-income groups. Family awareness was also increased in those working in salaried jobs.Conclusions:Socioeconomic disparities in awareness of hepatitis status were found among hepatitis carriers and their families.
