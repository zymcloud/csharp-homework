Purpose:To evaluate the utility of emergent transcatheter arterial embolization for spontaneously ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with Child-Pugh class C (CPC) liver cirrhosis presenting hemorrhagic shock.Materials and methods:A study of all 94 patients was retrospectively conducted from January 2006 to January 2016. Sixty patients underwent conservative treatment (control group) and 34 underwent embolization.Results:Embolization provided better stabilization of hemodynamic status than conservative treatment (91.2% vs 61.7%), with greater overall survival (OS) rates at 30, 60, and 120 days (73.5%, 52.9%, and 29.4% vs 33.3%, 13.3%, and 0%, respectively). Mean follow-up duration was 51.07 days (range, 3-237 d). Median survival time was longer for the embolization group than the control group, specifically for patients with a shock index (SI) of ≥ 0.6 to Conclusions:Emergent transcatheter arterial embolization is an effective intervention for ruptured HCC in patients with CPC liver function in hemorrhagic shock, particularly those with a SI ≥ 1, Child-Pugh scores of 10/11, and first- or lower-order PVTT.
