Cure of hepatitis C virus has become feasible in almost all patients. However, vigilance is needed in 3 scenarios: previous exposure to hepatitis B virus (HBV), history of organ transplantation, and history of cured hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The current data suggest that HBV reactivation occurs in about 10% of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients and approximately 1% of hepatitis B core antibody-positive but HBsAg-negative patients. The risk of organ rejection is also around 1%, but can be fatal if not acted on immediately. Finally, the risk of early HCC recurrence may be increased but should not delay initiation of antiviral therapy in the setting of cured HCC; however, increased surveillance may be warranted.
