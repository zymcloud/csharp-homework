Multimodality therapies are used to manage patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although advanced HCC is incurable. Oncolytic virus therapy is probably the next major breakthrough in cancer treatment. The third-generation oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) T-01 kills tumor cells without damaging the surrounding normal tissues. Here we investigated the antitumor effects of T-01 on HCC and the host's immune response to HCC cells. The cytopathic activities of T-01 were tested in 14 human and 1 murine hepatoma cell line in vitro. In various mouse xenograft models, HuH-7, KYN-2, PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2 human cells and Hepa1-6 murine cells were used to investigate the in vivo efficacy of T-01. T-01 was cytotoxic to 13 cell lines (in vitro). In mouse xenograft models of subcutaneous, orthotopic and peritoneal tumor metastasis in athymic mice (BALB/c nu/nu), the growth of tumors formed by the human HCC cell lines and hepatoblastoma cell line was inhibited by T-01 compared with that of mock-inoculated tumors. In a bilateral Hepa1-6 subcutaneous tumor model in C57BL/6 mice, the growth of tumors inoculated with T-01 was inhibited, as was the case for contralateral tumors. T-01 also significantly reduced tumor growth. T-01 infection significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy via T cell-mediated immune responses. Results demonstrate that a third-generation oncolytic HSV-1 may serve as a novel treatment for patients with HCC.
