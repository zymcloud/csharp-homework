Objective:MiR-155 has been shown to be up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) interacting mediator of cell death (BIM) regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis, as its down-regulation is involved in HCC onset. Transcriptional factor FoxO3a mediates BIM expression and is related to HCC pathogenesis. Bioinformatics analysis showed targeted regulation of FoxO3a by miR-155. This study aims to investigate whether miR-155 plays a role in mediating FoxO3a/BIM signal pathway and HCC occurrence.Patients and methods:HCC patients were collected for tumor and adjacent tissues, in which microRNA-155 (miR-155) and FoxO3a expressions were examined. In vitro cultured HCCLM3, HepG2 and L-02 cells were tested for basal apoptotic rate by flow cytometry and were compared for miR-155 and FoxO3a expression. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated the targeted relationship between miR-155 and FoxO3a. HCCLM3 cells were treated with miR-155 inhibitor and/or FoxO3a-pMD18-T. Cell apoptosis and proliferation were examined by using flow cytometry and MTT assays, respectively. Western blot and spectrometry assay were employed to quantify the FoxO3a, BIM expressions, and caspase activity.Results:Compared to adjacent tissues, HCC tissues had significantly higher miR-155 and significantly lower FoxO3a expression (pConclusions:HCC tissues elevated the miR-155 and suppressed the FoxO3a expressions. MiR-155 targeted and inhibited FoxO3a expression to suppress the BIM, depress caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities, therefore inhibiting the HCC cell apoptosis and facilitating proliferation.
