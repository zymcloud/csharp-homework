Background:Baseline albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score has been shown to be a reliable prognostic predictor among patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The current study aims at evaluating its prognostic impact among patients with colorectal liver metastases treated with first-line systemic therapy.Materials and methods:Through the Project Data Sphere portal, de-identified clinical trial datasets of 2 clinical trials (NCT00115765; PACCE [Panitumumab Advanced Colorectal Cancer Evaluation Study] trial) and (NCT00364013; PRIME [Panitumumab Randomized Trial In Combination With Chemotherapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer to Determine Efficacy] trial) were downloaded. Baseline ALBI score was calculated for each included patient in this study. Kaplan-Meier curve/log-rank testing was used to evaluate overall and progression-free survival according to ALBI grades. Additional Cox regression models were run in order to evaluate factors affecting overall and progression-free survival. Factors with P-value Results:A total of 1434 patients with colorectal liver metastases were included in this study. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted to assess the impact of ALBI grade on overall and progression-free survival in the study cohort. For both endpoints, higher ALBI grade was associated with worse overall and progression-free survival (P Conclusions:Higher baseline ALBI score is associated with worse overall and progression-free survival among patients with colorectal liver metastases treated with first-line systemic therapy.
