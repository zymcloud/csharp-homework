We hypothesized that quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) would be associated with 30-day mortality in bacteremia caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria and might be a selection criterion for the use of carbapenem as initial empirical therapy. A multicenter retrospective study was conducted in six hospitals. All patients who had bacteremia due to ESBL-producing bacteria were included in the study. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze 30-day mortality as the main outcome. A total of 203 adult patients were identified with bacteremia caused by ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Proteus mirabilis. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, bacteremia caused by ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae or P. mirabilis (odds ratio [OR] 5.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.64-15.56), underlying liver disease (OR 3.38, 95% CI 1.09-10.00), and underlying solid cancer (OR 3.45, 95% CI 1.27-9.69) were associated with 30-day mortality. In a subgroup analysis, empirical non-carbapenem therapy was associated with 30-day mortality in bacteremia caused by ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae or P. mirabilis. Our results suggest that the qSOFA score is not a selection criterion for the use of carbapenem in initial empirical therapy.
