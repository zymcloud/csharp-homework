High concentrations of plasma lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] have been inferred to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, such as coronary artery diseases, restenosis, and stroke. Apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] is one of the most important components of Lp(a) and contributes greatly to the increased concentration of plasma Lp(a). As a critical positive transacting factor of apo(a) gene, Ets1 has been proven as a target gene of several miRNAs, such as miR-193b, miR-125b-5p, miR-200b, miR-1, and miR-499. In this study, a series of experiments on miRNAs and relative miRNAs inhibitor delivered HepG2 cells were conducted, and two miRNAs that downregulate the apo(a) by targeting the 3'-UTR of Ets1 were identified. Results showed that apo(a) and Ets1 were differentially expressed in SMMC7721 and HepG2 cell lines. Meanwhile, apo(a) and Ets1 were inversely correlated with several hepatic endogenous miRNAs, such as miR-125b-5p, miR-23b-3p, miR-26a-5p, and miR-423-5p, which were predicted to bind to Ets1. Results show that miR-125b-5p and miR-23b-3p mimics could inhibit the synthesis of apo(a) by directly targeting Ets1 in HepG2, thereby reducing the plasma Lp (a) concentration.
