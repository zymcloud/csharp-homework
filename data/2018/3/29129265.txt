Aim:To assess if intra-tumoural fat on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) affects the ultrasonographic (US) visibility of small (≤3 cm) hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) during radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Materials and methods:Institutional review board approval was obtained. A retrospective review of all patients who underwent image-guided ablation between 1 January 2010 and 31 April 2015 was performed. Patients with HCC who underwent US RFA were included. Inclusion criteria included small tumours (≤3 cm), treatment-naive cases or new focus of HCC in a different and untreated segment, and pre-procedural MRI. The presence of intra-tumoural fat was determined retrospectively via in-and-out-of-phase MRI. Other factors that potentially affect ultrasonographic visibility, such as background fatty liver, presence of cirrhosis, tumour size, and distance from diaphragm, were recorded.Results:Ninety procedures performed on 74 patients (62 men and 12 women; mean age: 67.3 years; range: 39-88 years). Seventy-two tumours were visible on US (hypoechoic n=35, hyperechoic n=28, heterogeneous n=9). Intra-tumoural fat was seen in 23 tumours (25.6%, hyperechoic n=17, hypoechoic n=6). The presence of intra-tumoural fat (p=0.005) and distance from diaphragm (p=0.007) were found to be statistically significant factors affecting tumour visibility on planning US. The presence of background fatty liver (p=0.485), cirrhosis (p=0.48), and tumour size (p=0.15) were not found to be significant.Conclusion:The present study shows that the presence of intra-tumoural fat in small HCCs on pre-procedural MRI can accurately predict their visibility on planning US during percutaneous tumour ablation.
