Background/aim:We evaluated the influence of previous treatments on the parametric discrepancies between dose-volume histograms (DVHs) and dose-function histograms (DFHs) generated based on 99mTc-GSA SPECT images of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).Patients and methods:Twelve patients underwent SBRT at 30-40 Gy. Registration between planning CT and SPECT/CT images was performed, and DFH parameters were calculated as follows: Fx=(sum of the counts within the liver volume receiving a dose of more than x Gy/sum of the counts within the whole liver volume) ×100. The discrepancy between Fx and Vx (Dx) was also calculated.Results:The number of previous treatments for lesions other than SBRT-treated lesions (≥2 vs. 10, D15, and D20 (p<0.05).Conclusion:Previous treatment significantly influences the parametric discrepancy between DFH and DVH.
