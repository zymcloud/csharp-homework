Background:Despite the breadth of understanding the noncoding RNAs' function in molecular biology, their functional roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of hepatitis C virus (HCV) core upon the expression of noncoding RNAs.Methods:The lncRNAs, mRNAs, and circRNAs were employed for identification of HCV core protein gene expression in human Huh7 hepatoma (Huh7) cell line. In data analysis, we applied a threshold that eliminated all genes that were not increased or decreased by at least a 2-fold change in a comparison between transfected and control cells. Hierarchical Clustering and the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genome pathway analyses were performed to show the distinguishable lncRNA, mRNAs, and circRNAs expression pattern among samples.Results:The array data showed that 4,851 lncRNAs, 4,785 mRNAs, and 823 circRNAs were 2-fold up-regulated but 3,569 lncRNAs, 3,192 mRNAs, and 419 circRNAs were 2-fold down-regulated in Huh 7-core cells. The genes in the enriched set were associated with macromolecule and nucleic acid metabolic processes, DNA damage response and regulation of voltage-gated calcium channel. We identified 10 genes from the selected 14 genes that were higher or lower expression in Huh7-core cells than that of Huh7-vector cells by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Interestingly, overexpression of miR122 and miR204 partly abrogated the expression of TGFBRAP1 and HOTTIP, and increased the HPCAL1 expression in the predicted carcinogenic pathways.Conclusion:Our data suggests that the pathways of miR204-HPCAL1-lncRNAHOTTIP and miR122-TGFBRAP1 were likely involved in the carcinogenic progress due to the presence of HCV core, and that overexpression of miR122 and miR204 might inhibit the HCC progress by down-regulation of TGFBRAP1 and HOTTIP expression.
