Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can cause chronic hepatitis B, which may lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Type I interferon (IFN) is an approved drug for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. However, the fundamental mechanisms of antiviral action by type I IFN and the downstream signaling pathway are unclear. TRIM25 is an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) that has an important role in RIG-I ubiquitination and activation. Whether TRIM25 is induced in liver cells by type I IFN to mediate anti-HBV function remains unclear. Here we report that interleukin-27 (IL-27) has a critical role in IFN-induced TRIM25 upregulation. TRIM25 induction requires both STAT1 and STAT3. In TRIM25 knockout HepG2 cells, type I IFN production was consistently attenuated and HBV replication was increased, whereas overexpression of TRIM25 in HepG2 cells resulted in elevated IFN production and reduced HBV replication. More interestingly, we found that TRIM25 expression was downregulated in HBV patients and the addition of serum samples from HBV patients could inhibit TRIM25 expression in HepG2 cells, suggesting that HBV might have involved a mechanism to inhibit antiviral ISG expression and induce IFN resistance. Collectively, our results demonstrate that type I IFN -induced TRIM25 is an important factor in inhibiting HBV replication, and the IFN-IL-27-TRIM25 axis may represent a new target for treating HBV infection.
