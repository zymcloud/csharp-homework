To develop tissue-engineered arteries (TEAs) with collateral arteries(CAs) in ischemic hind limb goat models(IHLMs). The IHLMs created by removing femoral arteries were divided into non-treated control group(NG); non-catheter group (NCG) in which TEA was anastomosed to external iliac artery(EIA), and surrounded with collagen sponge containing autologous MSCs and VEGF-gelatin microspheres, the distal end of TEA was ligated; catheter group(CG) which received the same procedure as NCG, also received heparin infusion through catheter in EIA. TEA patency was assessed weekly by Ultrasound. The TEA and CAs were assessed by angiography, gross examination, histology and electron microscopy. In CG, TEAs remained patent for 1 month, but became partly occluded 1 week after catheter withdrawn. In NCG, TEAs were occluded 1 week after implantation. Angiography demonstrated that communication between CAs arising from the TEAs and the native vessels was established in both groups. NCG had fewer CAs than CG (P
