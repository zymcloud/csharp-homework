Paragonimiasis is a parasitic lung infection caused by lung flukes of the genus Paragonimus. Ectopic infection may occur but rarely involves the liver. Here, we report a case of hepatic paragonimiasis in a Chinese man who was initially suspected to have hepatocellular carcinoma. He had been previously diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B. No specific symptoms or abnormal blood test results were observed, except for a significant rise in serum alfa-fetoprotein. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 12-cm mass with inhomogeneous signal intensity at the left lobe of the liver. Laparoscopic left hemihepatectomy was performed. He was finally diagnosed as hepatic paragonimiasis upon pathological examination and antibody serology. The postoperative course was uneventful. He received a standard course of praziquantel and recovered well. Our case is unique in its tumor-like characteristic and protrudes the difficulty of differential diagnosis with both benignant and malignant hepatic diseases by imaging studies or non-specific symptoms. Hepatic paragonimiasis is unusual; however, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of liver malignancy by clinicians.
