Purpose:Recent genetic studies have suggested that tumor suppressor genes are often silenced during carcinogenesis via epigenetic modification caused by methylation of promoter CpG islands. Here, we characterized genes inactivated by DNA methylation in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to identify the genes and pathways involved in DNA methylation in hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Eight HCC-derived cell lines were treated with a DNA demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Additionally, 100 pairs of primary HCC and adjacent non-cancerous tissues as well as 15 normal liver tissues were analyzed by comprehensive gene expression analysis using microarrays. Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis identified the major molecular pathways associated with DNA methylation. Validation of gene expression and DNA methylation status was performed by real-time PCR after bisulfite modification.Results:We showed that CXCL2, an immune-related chemokine, expression was significantly downregulated in tumor tissues and also significantly upregulated by DAC treatment in cell lines. Furthermore, we observed a statistically significant difference in methylation status between normal liver tissues and tumor tissues (P Conclusions:We identified CXCL2, an immune-related chemokine, decreased in hepatocellular carcinoma and the regulation mechanism may be controlled by methylation. Further studies should be warranted to examine if and to what extent the gene is actually suppressed by methylation and if there is a possibility that the CXCL2 axis plays a role for diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
