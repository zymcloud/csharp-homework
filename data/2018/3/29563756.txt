Aim:To clarify the role of proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) in hepatocellular carcinoma, especially in the process of metastasis.Methods:PAR2 expression levels were assessed by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in patient tissues and in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines SMMC-7721 and HepG2. Cell proliferation and metastasis were assessed both in vitro and in vitro. Immunoblotting was carried out to monitor the levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers.Results:The prognosis was significantly poorer in patients with high PAR2 levels than in those with low PAR2 levels. Patients with high PAR2 levels had advanced tumor stage (P = 0.001, chi-square test), larger tumor size (P = 0.032, chi-square test), and high microvascular invasion rate (P = 0.037, chi-square test). The proliferation and metastasis ability of SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells was increased after PAR2 overexpression, while knockdown of PAR2 decreased the proliferation and metastasis ability of SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells. Knockdown of PAR2 also inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma tumor cell growth and liver metastasis in nude mice. Mechanistically, PAR2 increased the proliferation ability of SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells via ERK activation. Activated ERK further promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of these cells, which endowed them with enhanced migration and invasion ability.Conclusion:These data suggest that PAR2 plays an important role in the proliferation and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, targeting PAR2 may present a favorable target for treatment of this malignancy.
