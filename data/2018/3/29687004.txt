Aim:To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for patients with recurrent or residual hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:Between June 2008 and July 2015, thirty-three patients with HCC were treated by SBRT. There were 63 lesions in 33 patients. A total dose of 39-45 Gy/3-5 fractions was delivered to the 70-80% isodose line.Results:Objective response rate (CR + PR) was 84.8% at 6 months. The overall survival rate was 87.9%, 75.8%, 57.6%, and 45.5% at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively. Median overall survival was 19 months. At 3 months, AFP decreased by more than 75% in 51.5% of patients (17/33). Overall survival was significantly different (P < 0.001) between the group of patients for whom AFP decreased more than 75% and the group for whom AFP decreased by less than 75%. The AFP-negative rate was 48.5% (16/33) after 6 months. Eight patients (24.2%) had grade 1-2 transient fatigue, and 11 patients (33.3%) had grade 1-2 gastrointestinal reactions within 1 month.Conclusion:SBRT is a promising noninvasive and palliative treatment with acceptable toxicity for recurrent or residual HCC after TACE.
