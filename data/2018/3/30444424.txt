Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is indicated in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and allows the delivery of embolics inside tumor vascularization to reduce blood supply and release gradually the drug. This lowers the systemic exposure to chemotherapeutics, while increasing their local concentration and tissue necrosis that is higher than conventional TACE. The technology of TACE has seen the introduction of several types of embolics that are made of different materials. Available embolics for TACE include: drug-eluting beads (DC beads), acrylic copolymer, tris-acrylic microspheres and polyethylene glycol (PEG) microspheres. Few studies are available on PEG embolics and their use for TACE. This review focuses on the efficacy and safety of TACE performed with PEG microspheres for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and discusses future therapeutic advantages.
