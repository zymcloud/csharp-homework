Purpose:To report the toxicities and outcomes for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and accelerated hypofractionated radiation therapy (AHRT) in patients with Child-Pugh (CP) class A, B, or C and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score 1, 2, or 3 hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods and materials:We retrospectively reviewed the data from 146 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who had undergone SBRT (50 Gy in 5 fractions) or AHRT (45 Gy in 18 fractions). The primary endpoint was liver toxicity, defined as an increase in the CP score of ≥2 within 6 months of radiation therapy. The secondary endpoints of ALBI change, overall survival, and local control were also calculated.Results:The median follow-up was 23 months (range 1-59). Most received SBRT (72%), and 28% received AHRT. Of all 146 patients, 45 (31%) had a CP score elevation of ≥2 within 6 months of radiation therapy (RT) (27 patients [28%] with baseline CP-A/B7 and 18 [35%] with baseline CP-B8/B9/C cirrhosis; P = .45). On multivariate analysis, neither baseline CP nor ALBI score was predictive of toxicity. No patient with a decline in liver functionality of CP ≥2 within 6 months of RT returned to baseline at later time points. Eleven grade 4 toxicities were observed. The mean change in the raw ALBI score at ∼6 months was similar for all baseline ALBI groups. Twenty-two patients underwent orthotopic liver transplantation after RT, 13 of whom had baseline CP-B8/B9/C liver functionality. For all patients, the 1- and 2-year treated-lesion local control was greater for SBRT than for AHRT (2-year 94% vs 65%, P Conclusions:The tolerability of SBRT or AHRT as measured by a CP score decline of ≥2 within 6 months of RT was similar across baseline liver functionality groups. Compared with AHRT, SBRT was associated with superior local control. Because the true tolerability of limited-volume RT for patients with CP-B or CP-C cirrhosis is unknown, prospective trials validating its safety and efficacy are warranted.
