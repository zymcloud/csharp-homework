Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) plays pivotal roles in cell cycle regulation and is often aberrantly expressed in various cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but little is known about its role in liver regeneration and liver cancer cells proliferation. Using an inducible hepatocyte-selective HDAC3 knockout mouse, we find that lack of HDAC3 dramatically impaired liver regeneration and blocked hepatocyte proliferation in the G1 phase entry. HDAC3 inactivation robustly disrupted the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) cascade. HDAC3 silencing impaired the ac-STAT3-to-p-STAT3 transition in the cytoplasm, leading to the subsequent breakdown of STAT3 signaling. Furthermore, overexpressed HDAC3 was further associated with increased tumor growth and a poor prognosis in HCC patients. Inhibition of HDAC3 expression reduced liver cancer cells growth and inhibited xenograft tumor growth. Our results suggest that HDAC3 is an important regulator of STAT3-dependent cell proliferation in liver regeneration and cancer. These findings provide novel insights into the HDAC3-STAT3 pathway in liver pathophysiological processes.
