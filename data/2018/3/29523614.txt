Unresectableintrahepaticcholangiocarcinoma has a very poor prognosis despite various treatment options. The case presented describes the diagnostic challenges of a young pregnant woman with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. The current treatment options for cholangiocarcinoma have limited evidence and high recurrence rate. Given the young age of this patient, selective internal radiotherapy was trialled with traditional chemotherapy with a clinically significant result. This case highlights the delays when diagnosing cholangiocarcinoma in younger patients and the possibility of selective internal radiation therapy in combination with chemotherapy as a potential first-line treatment for a complete response in unresectable disease.
