Knowledge of activation and interplay between the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the hosts' innate immunity is essential to understanding the establishment of chronic HCV infection. Human hepatoma cell lines, widely used as HCV cell culture system, display numerous metabolic alterations and a defective innate immunity, hindering the detailed study of virus-host interactions. Here, we analysed the suitability of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived hepatocyte-like cells (iHLCs) as a physiologically relevant model to study HCV replication in vitro. Density gradients and triglyceride analysis revealed that iHLCs secreted very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-like lipoproteins, providing a putative platform for bona fide lipoviroparticles. iHLCs supported the full HCV life cycle, but in contrast to Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells, replication and viral RNA levels decreased continuously. Following HCV infection, interferon-stimulated gene (ISG)-expression significantly increased in iHLCs, whereas induction was almost absent in Huh7/7.5 cells. However, IFNÎ±-stimulation equally induced ISGs in iHLCs and hepatoma cells. JAK-STAT pathway inhibition increased HCV replication in mature iHLCs, but not in Huh7 cells. Additionally, HCV replication levels where higher in STAT2-, but not STAT1-knockdown iHLCs. Our findings support iHLCs as a suitable model for HCV-host interaction regarding a functional innate immunity and lipoprotein synthesis.
