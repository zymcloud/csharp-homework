Background and aims:Down-regulation of the growth arrest specific transcript 5 (GAS5) (long non-coding RNA) is associated with cell proliferation of gastric cancer (GC) and a poor prognosis. We aimed to investigate whether the variant rs145204276 of GAS5 is associated with the prognosis of GC in the Chinese population, and to unveil the regulatory mechanism underlying the GAS5 expression in GC tissues.Method:1,253 GC patients and 1,354 healthy controls were included. The frequency of the genotype del/del and the allele del of rs145204276 were compared between the patients and the controls and between different subgroups of patients classified by clinicopathological variables. The overall survival rate was analyzed according to the Kaplan-Meier method using the log-rank test.Results:The frequency of genotype del/del was significantly lower in patients than in the controls (7.0% vs. 9.1%, p = 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that genotype del/del was significantly associated with a higher survival rate (p = 0.01). Patients with late tumor stage were found to have a significantly lower rate of genotype del/del than those with an early tumor stage (4.9% vs. 8.8%, p = 0.01). Patients with UICC III and IV were found to have a significantly lower rate of genotype del/del than those with UICC I and II (5.3% vs. 8.1%, p = 0.02).Conclusion:The variant rs145204276 of GAS5 is associated with the development and prognosis of GC. The allele del of rs145204276 is associated with a remarkably lower incidence of cancer progression and metastasis.
