Aim of the study:This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate serum IL-10 levels in HCC patients.Material and methods:The three databases PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were checked on July 2017 for assessment of IL-10 levels in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients compared with healthy controls in publications with an English abstract. A random-effect meta-analysis was performed using mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Also, publication bias was evaluated through funnel plot analysis with the Begg's and Egger's tests.Results:Out of 171 studies searched in the databases, nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis with continuous data concluded that IL-10 level in the patients was significantly higher than the controls (MD = 6.96; 95% CI = 4.91-9.01; p < 0.00001), in the HCC patients was significantly higher than the cirrhotic patients (MD = 2.92; 95% CI = 0.72-5.12; p = 0.009), and was similar in the HCC patients compared with the patients with hepatitis (MD = 3.91; 95% CI = -4.25-12.07; p = 0.35).Conclusion:The increased IL-10 levels in the HCC patients compared with the cirrhotic patients and the healthy controls may show a significant role of this cytokine in the elevated risk of HCC, but the lack of significant difference in the levels between HCC and hepatitis makes it an unreliable tumor marker in the latter.
