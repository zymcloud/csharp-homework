Introduction:Donation after circulatory death (DCD) has increased in the last decade, although a slight increase in surgical complications has been reported in liver transplantation (LT). Therefore, DCD is not overall recommended because it entails an added risk. However, DCD in selected patients shows acceptable results.Objective:The objective was to analyze the characteristics, early outcomes, and survival at 1 year post-LT from a single institute (January 2015 to May 2017).Materials and methods:We included 18 DCD-LTs and compared them with a control group of 18 donation after brain death (DBD) LTs. We analyzed pre- and posttransplant variables related to donors, recipients, and intraoperative early outcomes within patients transplanted due to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A descriptive analysis, Mann-Whitney U test, Ï‡2, or Fisher test was performed when appropriate, as well as multivariate analysis in case of statistical significance. A variable is considered as statistically significant when it reaches a value of P < .05.Results:In DBD, we found a lower length of stay in the intensive care unit before retrieval and a higher rate of alcoholism and diabetes mellitus, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, and Child B and C score (P Conclusion:HCC recipients who are transplanted with good quality DCD livers do no worse than those transplanted with livers from DBD donors, although a good selection of them is crucial.
