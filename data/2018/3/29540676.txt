Objectives:Data on liver and non-liver co-morbidities in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients are limited. This study analyzes the prevalence of co-morbidities in a multicenter CHB cohort evaluated over 15 years.Methods:This study included 2734 consecutive adult American CHB patients from a university medical center and several community primary care clinics. Data were analyzed by time periods (patients in each time period were unique without overlapping): 2000-2005 (n = 885), 2006-2010 (n = 888), and 2011-2015 (n = 961). Patients were identified via electronic query using diagnosis code with data confirmed and extracted via individual chart review. Most patients were male (57.9%) and Asian (89.6%).Results:Mean age increased significantly from 43.3 ± 13.4 years during 2000-2005 to 49.1 ± 14.4 during 2011-2015 (p Conclusions:The CHB patient population is aging and now presents with significantly more co-morbidities. Early diagnosis and linkage to care is needed to prevent and mitigate liver as well as non-liver co-morbidities.
