Upper abdominal involvement in recurrent cervical cancer usually occurs as part of systemic disease and is most often amenable to palliative chemotherapy. However, in certain cases in which oligometastatic disease is proven, surgery might be considered. We present a case series of six patients submitted to surgery for upper abdominal oligometastases with cervical origin. The main surgical procedures performed included atypical hepatectomy (in five cases) and splenectomy (in one case). In all cases, the cervical origin of the lesions was revealed by histopathological studies. After a median follow-up period of 1 year, there was no evidence of recurrent disease in five cases, while the sixth case was diagnosed with disseminated lesions and is under palliative chemotherapy. In conclusion, upper abdominal resection for oligometastatic disease from cervical cancer can improve the long-term survival in selected cases.
