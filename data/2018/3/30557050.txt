Objective:The objective of our study was to assess the diagnostic performance of texture analysis (TA) on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR images for differentiation of hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) from focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH).Materials and methods:This study included 40 patients (39 women and one man) with 51 HCAs and 28 patients (27 women and one man) with 32 FNH lesions. All lesions were histologically proven with preoperative MRI performed with gadoxetic acid. Two readers reviewed all the imaging sequences to assess the qualitative MRI characteristics. The T2-weighted fast spin-echo, hepatic arterial phase (HAP), and hepatobiliary phase (HBP) sequences were used for TA. Textural features were extracted using commercially available software (TexRAD). The differences in distributions of TA parameters of FNHs and HCAs were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Area under the ROC curve (AUROC) values were calculated for statistically significant features. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore the added value of TA. A p value Results:Multiple TA parameters showed a statistically different distribution in HCA and FNH including skewness on T2-weighted imaging, skewness on HAP imaging, skewness on HBP imaging, and entropy on HBP imaging (p Conclusion:TA may be of added value for the diagnosis of atypical HCA presenting without hypointensity on HBP imaging.
