A new ether derivative of phenylpropanoid compound, γ-(γ'-isohydroxychavicol)-chavicol octanyl ether (K1) along with one known phenylpropanoid named allyl-pyrocatechol or hydroxychavicol (2) were isolated from Piper betle var. kali collected from Tumluk district, West Bengal India. We first report the presence of compound K1 in the genus Piper. Their structures were established on the basis of various spectroscopic analyses. Compounds K1 and 2 showed excellent antioxidant DPPH free radical scavenging activity with IC50 values of 4.61 and 4.12 µg/mL compared to ascorbic acid as a standard antioxidant drug with IC50 value of 3.42 µg/mL, respectively. Evaluation of in vitro cytotoxic activities of compounds K1 and 2 showed significant effects against human oral cancer cell lines (AW13516 and AW8507), human hepatoma cell lines (HEPG2 and PLC-PRF-5) and a human pancreatic cell line (MIA-PA-CA-2), compared to Doxorubicin® as a standard cytotoxic drug with GI50 values of <10 and 18.18 µg/mL.
