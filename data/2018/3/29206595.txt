Purpose To assess response to transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) based on immune markers and tumor biology in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who were bridged to liver transplantation, and to produce an optimized pretransplantation model for posttransplantation recurrence risk. Materials and Methods In this institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant retrospective analysis, 93 consecutive patients (73 male, 20 female; mean age, 59.6 years; age range, 23-72 years) underwent TACE with doxorubicin-eluting microspheres (DEB) (hereafter, DEB-TACE) and subsequently underwent transplantation over a 5-year period from July 7, 2011, to May 16, 2016. DEB-TACE response was based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Imaging responses and posttransplantation recurrence were compared with demographics, liver function, basic immune markers, treatment dose, and tumor morphology. Treatment response and recurrence were analyzed with uni- and multivariate statistics, as well as internal validation and propensity score matching of factors known to affect recurrence to assess independent effects of DEB-TACE response on recurrence. Results Low-grade tumors (grade 0, 1, or 2) demonstrated a favorable long-term treatment response in 87% of patients (complete response, 49%; partial response, 38%; stable disease [SD] or local disease progression [DP], 13%) versus 33% of high-grade tumors (grade 3 or 4) (complete response, 0%; partial response, 33%; SD or DP, 67%) (P Â© RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.
