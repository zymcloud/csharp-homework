Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent subtypes of liver cancer worldwide. LncRNAs have been demonstrated to be associated with the progression of HCC, but a systematic identification and characterization of their clinical roles and molecular mechanisms in HCC has not been conducted. In this study, the aberrantly expressed lncRNAs in HCC tissues were analyzed based on TCGA RNA-seq data. 1162 lncRNAs were found to be aberrantly expressed in HCC tissues, including 232 down-regulated lncRNAs and 930 up-regulated lncRNAs. The top 5 lncRNAs with the highest diagnostic accuracy were further analyzed to evaluate their clinical value and potential mechanism in HCC. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that higher expressions of DDX11-AS1 and AC092171.4 were in correlation with poorer survival in HCC patients. Significant difference was also observed when comparing the expression levels of DDX11-AS1 and SFTA1P in different clinical parameters (p
