Fontan-associated liver disease refers to the disturbance in the liver secondary to hemodynamic changes and systemic venous congestion following Fontan surgery. Although the natural history of this disease has not yet been established, patients with more advanced liver injury develop the complications of portal hypertension, such as ascites, variceal haemorrhage, or encephalopathy. Moreover, patients with Fontan surgery may have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Periodic liver monitoring is essential to prevent this disease and provide early treatment of liver complications.
