Purpose:To test the hypothesis that, given the current resection eligibility criteria for colorectal liver metastasis (CLM), prior hepatectomy would be associated with improved local tumor control and survival after percutaneous ablation of CLMs.Materials and methods:This single-institution retrospective study included 82 consecutive patients with 97 CLMs treated with ablation (radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, or cryoablation) from January 2005 to December 2014. Local tumor progression-free survival (LTPFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS) at any organ, and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method from the time of ablation and compared between patients with (n = 49) and without (n = 33) prior hepatectomy. Cox regression models were used to identify LTPFS predictors.Results:Median overall follow-up period was 28 months (range, 4.5-132 months). Three-year actuarial LTPFS (patient level: 73% vs 34%, P < .001) was significantly higher in patients with than without prior hepatectomy, respectively. Similarly, 3-year RFS (23% vs 9.1%, P = .026) and OS (78% vs 48%, P = .003) were improved in patients with prior hepatectomy. At multivariate analysis, predictors of worse LTPFS were: no prior hepatectomy (hazard ratio [HR] 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-5.45; P = .045), minimal ablation margin < 5 mm (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.18-4.87; P = .016), and RAS-mutant tumor (HR 2.65, 95% CI 1.18-5.94; P = .019).Conclusions:Prior hepatectomy for CLMs is associated with improved local tumor control after percutaneous ablation of post-resection-developed CLMs.
