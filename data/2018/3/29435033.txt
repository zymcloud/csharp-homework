The clinical significance of the sodium-potassium ATPase regulator FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 3 (FXYD3) has been demonstrated in a number of types of cancer. However, the role of this protein in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be elucidated. In the present study, 217 HCC tissue samples were analyzed to evaluate the expression and prognostic significance of FXYD3 in HCC. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the mRNA expression of FXYD3 in 80 primary HCC specimens and paired non-cancerous liver tissue samples, while western blotting was used to analyze the protein expression level of FXYD3 in another 24 pairs. These analyses demonstrated that the expression level of FXYD3 was significantly increasedb at the mRNA and protein levels in HCC tumor tissues compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis of 137 paraffin-embedded HCC tissue samples indicated that the expression of FXYD3 was associated with HCC clinicopathological characteristics. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with high FXYD3 protein expression (n=60) experienced significantly poorer overall survival time compared with patients with low FXYD3 protein expression (n=77) (P
