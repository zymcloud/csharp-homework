Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common and dangerous malignancy in many parts of the world, and especially in Egypt. Early diagnosis is the most important step in successful HCC management. However most cases are detected at late stage making effective intervention impossible. Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of Glypican-3 (GPC-3) to aid in diagnosis of HCC, especially in patients with low serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Subjects and methods: Serum GPC-3 was assessed by flow-cytometry and serum AFP by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 40 HCC patients with AFP 400ug\l. (GII) and 20 healthy controls (GIII). Results: GPC-3 was found to be significantly elevated in HCC as compared to healthy subjects (GI 38.2±22. 5, GII 50.2±22.6, and GIII 2.24±1.19), with sensitivities of 85% for GI and 84% for GII and specificities of 95% for GI and 92% for GII. AFP showed respective sensitivities of 50% and 79%, and specificities of 80% and 90%, for HCC diagnosis. The combination of GPC-3 with AFP achieved the highest sensitivity (98.5%) and specificity (97.8%). Conclusion: Serum GPC-3 has a better sensitivity than AFP for the diagnosis of HCC. Combination of two markers appears warranted for greatest accuracy.
