Samsum ant venom (SAV) is a rich repertoire of natural compounds with tremendous pharmacological properties. The present work explores its antineoplastic activity in different cell lines followed by its confirmation in vivo. The cell lines, HepG2, MCF-7, and LoVo showed the differential dose-dependent antineoplastic effect with an increased level of significant cytokines, including Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 and transcription factor, Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). However, the venom was more effective on HepG2 and MCF-7 cells than LoVo cells. Furthermore, the extract was administered to four groups (n = 8) of rats. Group I was taken as a control without any treatment, whereas group II received CCl4 (1 mL/kg) for induction of mild hepatoma. Group III was given 100 μg/kg of SAV twice a week for 1 month. Group IV was pretreated with the CCl4 (like group II) followed by dosing with SAV (100 μg/kg) for 2 months as per the authors' prestandardized dosing schedule. Intriguingly, the rats of group IV demonstrated significant decrease in key cytokines, IL-1β and IL-6, as well as the transcription factors, including Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), NF-κB, and Inhibitor-kappa B (I-κB) as compared with group II. Furthermore, increase in IL-10 and First apoptosis signal (FAS) in the same group confirmed that SAV induces apoptosis at the given dose through immunomodulation leading to enhanced tumor killing in vivo. Hence, SAV has an excellent antineoplastic activity that can be directly used to treat certain types of cancer. Moreover, study of its ingredients can pave ways to design novel anticancer drugs. However, further in-depth investigation is required before its clinical trials.
