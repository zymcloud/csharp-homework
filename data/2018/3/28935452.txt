Background:Neoadjuvant treatment of colorectal liver metastases has become increasingly common, and while effective, often renders small metastases difficult to visualize on intraoperative US. The objective of this study was to determine the utility of a 3D image-guidance system in patients with intraoperative sonographically-occult CRLM.Methods:50 patients with at least one CRLM â‰¤ 1.5 cm were enrolled in this prospective trial of an FDA-approved Explorer image-guidance system. If the tumor(s) seen on preoperative imaging were not identified with intraoperative US, Explorer was used to target the US examination to the involved area for a more focused assessment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of cases with sonographically-occult metastases identified using Explorer.Results:Forty-eight patients with preoperative scans within eight weeks of surgery were included for analysis. Forty-six patients were treated with preoperative chemotherapy (median 4 months, range 2-24 months). Overall, 22 sonographically-occult tumors in 14 patients were interrogated by Explorer, of which 15 tumors in 10 patients were located with image-guidance assistance. The only difference between patients with tumors not identified on US and those who did was the number of tumors (median 3 vs. 2, p = 0.018).Conclusion:3D image-guidance can assist in identifying small CRLM, particularly after treatment with chemotherapy.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02806037, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02806037.
