Oncolytic virotherapy is a promising strategy for the treatment of cancer. Influenza A virus has shown potential as an oncolytic agent. In this study, a recombinant PR8 influenza viral vector, called delNS1-GM-CSF, was generated with a partial deletion in NS and the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) coding sequence inserted into the influenza nonstructural protein 1 gene. The morphological characteristics of delNS1-GM-CSF were examined. The delNS1-GM-CSF virus replicated well in various cell lines, including MDCK, A549, SMCC7721, and HepG2 cells. Moreover, selective cytotoxicity of the virus was observed in various hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, while no effect was demonstrated in the normal liver cell line LO2, as indicated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and crystal violet assays. Importantly, using a model based on the growth of HepG2 cells as a xenograft in nude mice, it was found that a reassortant delNS1-GM-CSF virus inhibited tumor growth significantly following intratumoral injection in a dose-dependent manner. Ex vivo results showed that the tumor inhibition efficacy of delNS1-GM-CSF was observed in HCC clinical samples. Taken together, these results are the first to demonstrate that influenza A viruses may have potential as oncolytic virotherapeutic agents against HCC.
