Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes acute and chronic liver disease and may lead to cirrhosis, liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma. The behavior of illicit drug users (DUs) typically exposes them to risks of viral infection. In the Brazilian Amazon region, a number of studies have identified high rates of drug use among adolescents, and a high prevalence of HBV infection in DUs, disseminated by sexual and parenteral activities. However, the epidemiological scenario of HCV infection in the region is still poorly understood. This study determined the prevalence, genotypes, and risk factors for HCV infection among DUs of the Marajó Archipelago. This cross-sectional study collected samples and epidemiological information from DUs in 11 municipalities. The diagnosis was established by EIA and real-time PCR, and the samples were genotyped by multiplex real time PCR. The data were analyzed by simple and multiple logistical regression. In 466 DUs, 28.3% had anti-HCV antibodies, and 25.5% had HCV-RNA. In 92 injecting drug users, 88.0% had anti-HCV antibodies, and 80.4% had HCV-RNA. Genotypes 1 and 3 were detected, with three cases of mixed infections. The multivariate analysis indicated associations of HCV infection with age (≥ 35 years), tattoos, intravenous drug use, shared use of injection equipment, and the daily and long-term (> 3 years) use of illicit drugs. These findings will contribute to the development of effective measures for the prevention of HCV infection among Brazilian DUs, as well as its general population.
