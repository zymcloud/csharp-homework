Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a metabolically active organ, associated with higher risk of malignancies. We evaluated whether VAT is associated with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients presenting with cirrhosis as well as HCC recurrence after liver transplantation (LT). Patients with cirrhosis (n = 678; 457 male) who were assessed for LT (289 with HCC) were evaluated for body composition analysis. Patients who underwent LT (n = 247, 168 male) were subsequently evaluated for body composition, and 96 of these patients (78 male) had HCC. VAT, subcutaneous adipose tissues, and total adipose tissues were quantified by computed tomography at the level of the third lumbar vertebra and reported as indexes (cross-sectional area normalized for height [square centimeters per square meter]). At the time of LT assessment, the VAT index (VATI) was higher in male patients with HCC compared to non-HCC patients (75 ± 3 versus 60 ± 3 cm2 /m2 , P = 0.001). The VATI, subcutaneous adipose tissue index, and total adipose tissue index were higher in male patients with HCC compared to non-HCC patients. By multivariate analysis, male patients with VATI ≥65 cm2 /m2 had a higher risk of HCC (hazard ratio, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-2.76; P = 0.001). In male patients with HCC who underwent LT, a VATI ≥65 cm2 /m2 adjusted for Milan criteria was independently associated with higher risk of HCC recurrence (hazard ratio, 5.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-23.97; P = 0.03).Conclusion:High VATI is an independent risk factor for HCC in male patients with cirrhosis and for recurrence of HCC after LT.
