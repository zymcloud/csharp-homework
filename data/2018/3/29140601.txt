A subset of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) beyond Milan criteria might obtain acceptable survival outcomes after liver transplantation. Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has emerged as a feasible alternative to overcome the paucity of donors. In 2001, we started a protocol for LDLT in Child A-B patients with HCC fulfilling a set of criteria-the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) expanded criteria-that expanded the conventional indications of transplantation: 1 tumor ≤ 7 cm, 5 tumors ≤ 3 cm, and 3 tumors ≤ 5 cm without macrovascular invasion or downstaging to Milan after locoregional therapies. We present a prospective cohort of 22 patients with BCLC extended indications based on size/number (n = 17) or downstaging (n = 5) treated with LDLT between 2001 and 2014. Characteristics of the patients were as follows: median age, 57 years old; males/female, n = 20/2; Child-Pugh A/B, n = 16/6; and alpha fetoprotein
