Background:Around 2.4% of the world's population is infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), and it is the most common cause of liver transplantation (LT) in the world. Latin America (LA), with nearly 9% of the world population, has had a continuous increase in the number of LTs per year. Yet, due to the lack of mandatory data collection and a well-developed health-care system, access to transplantation is limited in most LA countries. We report the first LA experience of HCV-infected LT patients.Methods:We performed a retrospective cohort study by reviewing the medical histories of all HCV-infected LT patients between 1996 and 2016 who acquired HCV before their LT, at the Fundación Valle del Lilí, Cali, Colombia.Results:Between January 1996 and December 2015, a total of 770 LTs were performed, of which 75 had a cirrhotic liver due to HCV infection. With a median follow-up time of 24.4 months (interquartile range [IQR] 4.7-61.2 months), patient survival was 44.9% and 66.9% for the time periods 1996-2006 and 2007-2015, respectively. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was present in 30.6% of the patients, and overall postoperative complications had an incidence of 80%.Conclusions:This is the first report of LT in HCV-infected patients in Colombia and in LA. Our results are comparable to those of other transplant centers worldwide with regard to postoperative complications and patient survival. Patients with LT in the 1996-2006 time frame had higher morbidity and mortality. Studies including larger numbers of patients are needed to determine the reason for this finding.
