Selective internal radio therapy (SIRT) with Y-glass microspheres was performed in a cirrhotic patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C) after arterial coil embolization for treatment of intratumoral hemorrhage and planned preoperative right portal vein embolization. Three technetium Tc macro-albumin-aggregate injections were needed to optimize intralesional uptake without extrahepatic deposition. The consecutive SIRT treatment was uncomplicated with a remarkable result.
