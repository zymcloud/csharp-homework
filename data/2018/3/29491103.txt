Background/aim:Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma receptor A (EphA) is associated with angiogenesis and invasive tumor progression. In this study, we evaluated the EphA1-4 expression levels in advanced gastric cancer.Patients and methods:Tumor tissues obtained from 114 patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent gastrectomy were analyzed. In addition, the impact of EPHA 1-4 mRNA expression on survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier plotter database on the website.Results:High EphA 1, 2, and 4 expression levels were significantly related to recurrence (pConclusion:EphA 1, 2, and 4 may play key roles in recurrence and survival in patients with advanced gastric cancer.
