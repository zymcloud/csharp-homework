Objectives:Liver transplant and simultaneous liver-kidney transplant are major surgeries performed on high-risk individuals with end-stage liver disease and end-stage renal disease. We sought to examine the relationship between pretransplant echocardiographic parameters and outcomes in our simultaneous liver-kidney transplant and liver transplant-alone populations.Materials and methods:In our retrospective analysis, we included adult patients who underwent index transplant from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2015 at Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Transplant Center.Results:Our study included 312 patients, 266 who underwent liver transplant alone and 46 who underwent simultaneous liver-kidney transplant. Baseline population demographics were similar in both groups of patients. Primary diagnosis at transplant was similar in both groups except that patients undergoing liver transplant were more likely to have a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, whereas those undergoing simultaneous liver-kidney transplant were more likely to have polycystic kidney disease. Within the liver transplant-alone group, the strongest demographic predictor of poor outcome was age at transplant. The strongest echocar diographic predictors were related to elevated left ventricular ejection fraction and right ventricular systolic pressure.Conclusions:In our investigation regarding whether the pretransplant cardiovascular evaluation predicted outcomes for patients undergoing liver transplant alone and patients undergoing simultaneous liver-kidney transplant, we found that elevations in right ventricular systolic pressure and left ventricular ejection fraction may be associated with poor outcomes in the posttransplant period.
