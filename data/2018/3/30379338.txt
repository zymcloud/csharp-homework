Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for majority of cancer related deaths. Two major risk factors in induction of HCC are chemical and virus, however, the possible mechanisms of their differences remain indefinable. The current study focused on protective role of Fucoxanthin (Fx) in liver affected by diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC. In this study, levels of liver enzymes, oxidative stressors, antioxidant status, and lipoproteins were compared both in tissue and blood. Tissues were also analyzed extensively by histological studies using H and E staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Rats were clustered into four groups of six experimental animals. Group I: Control rats were administered isotonic saline intraperitoneal Group II: Animals received 0.01% DEN through drinking water to induce hepatocellular carcinoma. Group III: Animals received 0.01% DEN simultaneously oral supplementation of Fx (50 mg/kg b.w). Group IV: Rats were given Fx alone (50 mg/kg b.w) orally and the treatment is for 15 weeks. Results showed the decrease in body weight, serum albumin, antioxidant enzymes, and increased all the liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, and stress markers in DEN induced rats, where as the simultaneous supplementation of Fx reverted them to normal levels. Administration of only Fx did not show any change. Therefore, Fx may serve as a chemotherapeutic agent against liver cancer.
