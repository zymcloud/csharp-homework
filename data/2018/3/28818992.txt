The rationale for this study was to evaluate the feasibility of within-suite 89Zr-labeled radiotracer PET/CT-guided biopsy performed without reinjection. Methods: From 2013 to 2016, 12 patients (7 men, 5 women; mean age, 61 y; range, 40-75 y) with metastatic prostate or breast carcinoma suspected either on imaging or because of biochemical progression underwent 14 percutaneous biopsies after diagnostic PET/CT using 89Zr-labeled radiotracers (mean dose, 180 MBq; range, 126-189 MBq) targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (n = 7) or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (n = 5). Biopsy was performed within a PET/CT suite without radiotracer reinjection. Results: There were no complications in any biopsies, which were performed a mean of 6.2 d (range, 0-13 d) after injection of the radiotracer. The biopsy sites were bone (n = 7), pleura (n = 3), lymph nodes (n = 2), and liver (n = 2). On pathologic examination of the biopsy samples, all were positive for malignancy. The initial diagnostic imaging findings were concordant with the biopsy results. The additional radiation (mean dose-length product) due to the CT procedures was 1,581 mGy/cm (range, 379-2,686 mGy/cm). Conclusion: PET/CT-guided biopsy using 89Zr-labeled radiotracers is safe and effective without tracer reinjection.
