Purpose:To develop and evaluate a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) program for liver lesions on magnetic resonance (MR) images for classification of the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following the liver imaging reporting and data system (LI-RADS).Materials and methods:Liver MR images from 41 patients with hyperenhancing liver lesions categorized as LR 3, 4, and 5 were evaluated by two radiologists. The major LI-RADS features of each index liver lesion were recorded, including size (maximum transverse diameter), presence of hyperenhancement, washout appearance, and capsule appearance. A CAD program was implemented to register MR images at different contrast-enhancement phases, segment liver lesions, extract lesion features, and classify lesions according to LI-RADS. The LI-RADS features quantified by CAD were compared with those assessed by radiologists using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and receiver operator curve (ROC) analyses. The LI-RADS categorization between CAD and radiologists was evaluated using the weighted Cohen's kappa coefficient.Results:The mean and standard deviation of the lesion diameters were 21 ± 11 mm (range, 7-70 mm) by radiologists and 22 ± 11 mm (range, 8-72 mm) by CAD (ICC, 0.96-0.97). The area under the curve (AUC) for the washout assessment by CAD was 0.79-0.93 with sensitivity 0.69-0.82 and specificity 0.79-1. The AUC for the capsule assessment by CAD was 0.79-0.9 with sensitivity 0.75-0.9 and specificity 0.82-0.96. The classifications by the radiologists and CAD coincided in 76-83% lesions (k = 0.57-0.71), while the agreements between radiologists were in 78% lesions (k = 0.59).Conclusion:We developed a CAD program for liver lesions on MR images and showed a substantial agreement in the LI-RADS-based classification of the risk of HCCs between the CAD and radiologists.Level of evidence:1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 1 J.
