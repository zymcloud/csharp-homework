Background & aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance is associated with improved outcomes and long-term survival. Our goal is to evaluate adherence rates to HCC surveillance.Methods:We performed a systematic search of the PubMed and Scopus databases and abstract search of relevant studies from recent major liver meetings. All searches and data extraction were performed independently by two authors. Analysis was via random-effects models and multivariate meta-regression.Results:A total of 22 studies (n = 19 511) met inclusion criteria (original non-interventional studies with defined cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C with advanced fibrosis populations, and surveillance tests and intervals). Overall adherence rate was 52% (95% CI 38%-66%). Adherence was significantly higher in cirrhotic patients compared to chronic hepatitis B and other high-risk patients, in European compared to North American studies, in less than 12-month compared to yearly surveillance intervals, and in prospective compared to retrospective studies (71%, 95% CI 64%-78% vs 39%, 95% CI 26%-51%, P Conclusions:Overall adherence rate to HCC surveillance was suboptimal at 52% with no significant differences by liver disease aetiology or study location in multivariate meta-regression analysis. Further research and educational efforts are needed to improve the current rate of HCC surveillance.
