Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is known for its high mortality rate worldwide. Based on intensive studies, microRNA (miRNA) expression functions in tumor suppression. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the contribution of miR-146a-5p to radiosensitivity in HCC through the activation of the DNA damage repair pathway by binding to replication protein A3 (RPA3). First, the limma package of R was performed to differentially analyze HCC expression chip, and regulative miRNA of RPA3 was predicted. Expression of miR-146a-5p, RPA3, and DNA damage repair pathway-related factors in tissues and cells was determined. The effects of radiotherapy on the expression of miR-146a-5p and RPA3 as well as on cell radiosensitivity, proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis were also assessed. The results showed that there exists a close correlation between miR-146a and the radiotherapy effect on HCC progression through regulation of RPA3 and the DNA repair pathway. The positive rate of ATM, pCHK2, and Rad51 in HCC tissues was higher when compared with that of the paracancerous tissues. SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cell proliferation were significantly inhibited following 8 Gy 6Mv dose. MiR-146a-5p restrained the expression of RPA3 and promoted the expression of relative genes associated with the DNA repair pathway. In addition, miR-146a-5p overexpression suppresses cell proliferation and enhances radiosensitivity and cell apoptosis in HCC cells. In conclusion, the present study revealed that miR-146a-5p could lead to the restriction of proliferation and the promotion of radiosensitivity and apoptosis in HCC cells through activation of DNA repair pathway and inhibition of RPA3.
