High grade bladder malignancies have tendency to local and distant invasion. The most commonly involved sites are lymph nodes, lungs, bone and liver. Muscle metastases are generally rare and have been described in few cases of Genito-Urinary cancer. In this work we describe a rare case of high grade transitional cell carcinoma from bladder metastatising to the left gluteal muscle together with the review of the pertinent literature.
High grade Tcc; Muscle metastasis.
