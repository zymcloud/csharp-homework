Background/aim:Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) is a common complication in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and it was considered a relative contraindication for transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) by many centers. This study aimed to assess the outcomes after TACE in patients with branch PVT regarding Child classification, radiological response, and 1-year survival.Methods:Thirty HCC patients (24 male, 6 females) Child A cirrhotics with branch PVT underwent TACE. Follow up was done at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after first TACE. All patients underwent laboratory investigations including liver function tests to assess deterioration in liver functions and triphasic spiral computed tomography to assess radiological response according to modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST) criteria, and survival analysis was recorded.Results:TACE succeeded to achieve disease control in 93.3%, 86.3%, 57.7%, and 44.4% of patients after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Post-TACE liver decompensation occurred in the form of ascites in 30%, jaundice in 10%, and hepatic encephalopathy in 3.3% within 1 month of TACE. One month survival after TACE was 100%, 3 months was 96.6%, 6 months was 86.6%, and 1-year survival was 60%. Mean overall survival of the included patients was 17 months (SE = 1.59).Conclusion:TACE seems an alternative option for patients with unrespectable HCC with portal vein thrombosis in patients with good liver function tests.
