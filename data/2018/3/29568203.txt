Aim:To assess the levels of different immune modulators in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in relation to other hepatic diseases.Methods:Eighty-eight patients were included in the current study and represented patients with HCC (20), liver cirrhosis (28) and chronic hepatitis (CH; 25), and normal controls (NC; 15). Peripheral blood was isolated for immunophenotyping of active myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs; CD1c and CD40), mature inactive myeloid cells (CD1c and HLA), active plasmacytoid cells (pDCs; CD303 and CD40), mature inactive pDCs (CD30 and HLA), active natural killer (NK) cells (CD56 and CD161), active NK cells (CD56 and CD314) and inactive NK cells (CD56 and CD158) was done by flow cytometry. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, IL-12, IL-1β, interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-αR2 were assessed by ELISA.Results:Active mDCs (CD1C+/CD40+) and inactive mDCs (CD1c+/HLA+) were significantly decreased in HCC patients in relation to NC (P < 0.001). CD40+ expression on active pDCs was decreased in HCC patients (P < 0.001), and its level was not significantly changed among other groups. Inactive pDCs (CD303+/HLA+), inactive NKs (CD56+/CD158+) and active NKs (CD56+/CD161+) were not statistically changed among the four groups studied; however, the latter was increased in CH (P < 0.05). NKG2D was statistically decreased in HCC, CH and cirrhosis (P < 0.001), and it was not expressed in 63% (12/20) of HCC patients. There was significant decrease of IL-2, IFN-α and IFN-γ (P < 0.001), and a significant increase in IL-10, IL-1β, and TNF-αR2 (P <0.01, P < 0.001 and P < 0.001; respectively) in HCC patients. There was inverted correlation between IL-12 and IL-1β in HCC (r = -0.565, P < 0.01), with a strong correlation between pDCs (CD303+/CD40+) and NKs (CD56+/CD161+; r = 0.512, P < 0.05) as well as inactive mDCs (CD1c+/HLA+) and inactive NK cells (CD56+/CD158+; r = 0.945, P < 0.001).Conclusion:NKG2D, CD40, IL-2 and IL-10 are important modulators in the development and progression of HCC.
