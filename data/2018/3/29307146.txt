Background:Prophylaxis of hepatitis B after liver transplantation with antiviral(s) and immunoglobulins efficiently protect the majority of recipients; however recent experiences suggest a decline of HBsAg-positive candidates and the use of hepatitis B Immunoglobulin-free schedules.Methods:This national survey evaluated the epidemiology and clinical results of hepatitis B prophylaxis among 10,365 liver transplants performed in 25 years in 13 Italian centers.Results:With a percentage of 22, 2260 procedures were performed in HBsAg-positive recipients and 714 out of 1080 anti-HBc-positive grafts were used in HBsAg-negative recipients; a total of 2974 patients (29%) were considered at risk of hepatitis B after liver transplantation. Similar rates (18% of HBsAg-positive candidates and 15% of anti-HBc-positive grafts) were registered in the last collected year. Combined prophylaxis with Hepatitis B Immunoglobulins remained prevalent among centers and was effective in 96% of HBsAg-positive recipients and in 94% of HBsAg-negative recipients of anti-HBc-positive grafts.Conclusions:Data from this survey confirm: the excellent results of combined prophylaxis; the past and persistent use of Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin-on and only rare -off prophylactic regimens, in contrast with the newest reports; the increasing use of anti-HBc-positive grafts; the past and present high prevalence of HBsAg-positive recipients, due to an increase in candidates with either hepatocellular carcinoma and Hepatitis Delta Virus coinfection in the last years.
