Aim:To investigate 30-year treatment outcomes associated with Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) at a tertiary hospital in China.Methods:A total of 256 patients diagnosed with primary BCS at our tertiary hospital between November 1983 and September 2013 were followed and retrospectively studied. Cumulative survival rates and cumulative mortality rates of major causes were calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the independent predictors of survival were identified using a Cox regression model.Results:Thirty-four patients were untreated; however, 222 patients were treated by medicine, surgery, or interventional radiology. Forty-four patients were lost to follow-up; however, 212 patients were followed, 67 of whom died. The symptom remission rates of treated and untreated patients were 81.1% (107/132) and 46.2% (6/13), respectively (P = 0.009). The cumulative 1-, 5-, 10-, 20-, and 30-year survival rates of the treated patients were 93.5%, 81.6%, 75.2%, 64.7%, and 58.2%, respectively; however, the 1-, 5-, 10-, 20-, and 30-year survival rates of the untreated patients were 70.8%, 70.8%, 53.1%, 0%, and unavailable, respectively (P = 0.007). Independent predictors of survival for treated patients were gastroesophageal variceal bleeding (HR = 3.043, 95%CI: 1.363-6.791, P = 0.007) and restenosis (HR = 4.610, 95%CI: 1.916-11.091, P = 0.001). The cumulative 1-, 5-, 10-, 20-, and 30-year mortality rates for hepatocellular carcinoma were 0%, 2.6%, 3.5%, 8%, and 17.4%, respectively.Conclusion:Long-term survival is satisfactory for treated Chinese patients with BCS. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a chronic complication and should be monitored with long-term follow-up.
