Gadoxetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) is a hepatocyte-specific magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent, which has been increasingly used in recent years. However, it has been reported that Gd-EOB-DTPA related transient severe motion (TSM) is sometimes observed during the hepatic arterial phase of MR imaging, which may influence image quality. Since the hepatic arterial phase of contrast enhancement is used for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, it is crucial to obtain a decent arterial phase imaging. The present study analyzed motion in patients receiving Gd-EOB-DTPA, comparing a single arterial phase acquisition to a five arterial phase acquisition to determine whether the multiphase acquisition was able to alleviate the TSM-related hepatic arterial MR imaging artifact. It was demonstrated that the single-phase acquisition failed to provide adequate diagnostic image quality in patients with TSM, whereas the multiphase arterial acquisition provided acceptable image quality in 20/22 (90.9%) patients with TSM. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that multiphase arterial acquisition is superior to single-phase arterial acquisition, mitigating arterial MR imaging artifacts caused by TSM after the administration of Gd-EOB-DTPA.
