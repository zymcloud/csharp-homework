Objective:The impact of anxiety and depression symptoms (ADS) is often estimated in terms of clinical endpoints such as the risk of complications and probabilities of readmission and survival. The purpose of this study was to provide a benchmark for capturing the negative effects of ADS on quality of life after hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surgery and to provide an evidence base for future research and clinical interventions aimed at understanding and remediating these effects.Methods:This prospective study analyzed 410 HCC patients at three tertiary academic hospitals. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Hepatobiliary (FACT-H) were administered before HCC surgery and at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after HCC surgery. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate differences-in-differences models for examining the effects of ADS.Results:At baseline, 9.0% of the participants had anxiety symptom (BAI > 10), 17.1% had depression symptom (BDI > 13), and 7.1% had ADS. Throughout the study period, anxiety and depression (differences-in-differences value) had significant (P Conclusions:For healthcare providers, this study highlights the need for continued monitoring for ADS in patients who have undergone hepatic resection and the need for timely and appropriate psychological care for these patients.
