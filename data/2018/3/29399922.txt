In view of the interrelations between NO, Fe, and LDL in the cardiovascular system it appears interesting to find out, if the lipoprotein particles undergo the process of iron-nitrosylation, commonly observed for other proteins and what is the biological fate of iron-nitrosylated LDL particles. Iron-nitrosylated LDL preparation containing Fe(NO)2 motif (DNICLDL) was obtained and characterized for the first time. In order to test its interactions with potential target cells, DNICLDL was administered to the hepatoma HepG2 cells. The effects were referred to those induced by native LDL (nLDL) and oxidized LDL (oxLDL) particles. DNICLDL administration considerably increased total iron content in the studied cell line, but did not influence the level of calcein-chelatable ions. DNICLDL was found to be low toxic to cells. The study suggests that DNICLDL might be a potential transducer of iron. Â© 2017 BioFactors, 44(2):192-201, 2018.
