Background:There is a striking sex difference in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, with a strong predominance for men; however, the impact of sex on the incidence of recurrence after curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma remains controversial. This study aimed to assess sex differences in the risks of recurrence and mortality for patients treated with curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed data from 1,435 hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with curative resection (1,228 men and 207 women) between 2004 and 2014 at 5 institutions in China. Patients' baseline characteristics, operative variables, and rates of early recurrence (≤2 years after resection), late recurrence (>2 years after resection), and cancer-specific mortality were evaluated and compared. To clarify the true oncologic impact of sex, multivariable competing-risks regression analyses were performed to identify predictors associated with early and late recurrence, as well as cancer-specific mortality.Results:The early recurrence rates between men and women were similar (43.3% vs 42.0%, P = .728), but the late recurrence and rates of cancer-specific mortality in men were greater compared with women (17.2% vs 11.2%, P = .044; and 42.8% vs 34.3%, P = .022, respectively). Multivariable competing-risks regression analyses revealed no sex difference in early recurrence; however, men had greater late recurrence rate (hazard ratio, 1.752; 95% confidence interval, 1.145-2.682; P = .010) and rate of cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio, 1.307; 95% confidence interval, 1.015-1.683; P = .038).Conclusion:There was no difference in early recurrence rate (≤2 years after resection between men and women, but men had significantly greater late recurrence (>2 years) and rates of cancer-specific mortality after hepatocellular carcinoma resection than women.
