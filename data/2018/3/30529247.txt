Background:Several investigators have reported that complement receptor 1 (CR1) likely play a role in the pathogenesis of tumors, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, the association of genetic polymorphisms of CR1 with risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver disease remains unexplored.Methods:In a case-control study of 399 HBV-related liver disease patients and 227 healthy controls, we genotyped two SNPs in CR1 (rs3811381 and rs2274567) and assessed their associations with risk of HBV-related liver disease.Results:No significant differences were observed in the frequency distribution of genotypes or alleles between CR1 rs3811381 and rs2274567 polymorphisms in patients and controls. However, stratification analysis indicated that these two CR1 polymorphisms may contribute to the risk of HBV- hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in subgroups of males, alcohol drinkers and nonsmokers. Further, our results showed that the rs3811381 polymorphism may contribute to HBV-HCC risk in subgroups of older and younger subjects, while the G allele, AG and the combined AG + GG genotypes of rs2274567 may be risk factors for HBV-HCC in younger subjects. In addition, our results indicated that subjects who carried the rs3811381 G allele and the rs2274567 AG genotype were at decreased risk of HBV- liver cirrhosis (LC) in subgroups of females.Conclusions:Our results support the hypothesis that the CR1 gene rs3811381 and rs2274567 polymorphisms may contribute to HBV-HCC and HBV-CHB risk, particularly in subgroups of males, alcohol drinkers, nonsmokers, while these two CR1 polymorphisms were found to associate with decreased risk of HBV-LC, particularly in females. Further validation of these results is warranted.
