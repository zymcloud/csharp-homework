Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading lethal malignancy worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying liver carcinogenesis remain poorly understood. Over the past two decades, overwhelming evidence has demonstrated the regulatory roles of different classes of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in liver carcinogenesis related to a number of aetiologies, including HBV, HCV and NAFLD. Among the ncRNAs, microRNAs, which belong to a distinct class of small ncRNAs, have been proven to play a crucial role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Deregulation of microRNAs has been broadly implicated in the inactivation of tumour-suppressor genes and activation of oncogenes in HCC. Modern high-throughput sequencing analyses have unprecedentedly identified a very large number of non-coding transcripts. Divergent groups of long ncRNAs have been implicated in liver carcinogenesis through interactions with DNA, RNA or proteins. Overall, ncRNAs represent a burgeoning field of cancer research, and we are only beginning to understand the importance and complicity of the ncRNAs in liver carcinogenesis. In this Review, we summarize the common deregulation of small and long ncRNAs in human HCC. We also comprehensively review the pathological roles of ncRNAs in liver carcinogenesis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and HCC metastasis and discuss the potential applications of ncRNAs as diagnostic tools and therapeutic targets in human HCC.
