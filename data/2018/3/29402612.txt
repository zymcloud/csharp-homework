Purpose:To evaluate the performance of automated feeder detection (AFD) software (EmboGuide; Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors during transarterial chemoembolization.Materials and methods:Forty-four first-time transarterial chemoembolization patients (37 men; mean age, 62 ± 11 years) were enrolled between May 2012 and July 2013. A total of 86 HCC lesions were treated (2.0 ± 1.4 lesions per patient; 27.6 ± 15.9 mm maximum diameter). One hundred forty-seven feeding arteries were found with digital subtraction angiography (DSA), cone-beam computed tomography (CT), and AFD software with the option of manual adjustment (MA). Three independent interventional radiologists analyzed the cone-beam CT images retrospectively with and without AFD and MA. Compared with the number of treated vessels, the number of true positives, false positives, false negatives, sensitivity, and interreader agreement were determined using clustered binary data analysis.Results:Cone-beam CT enabled detection of 100 ± 3.5 feeding arteries (70% sensitivity) with 68.6% agreement among readers. AFD software significantly improved detection to 127±0.6 feeding arteries (86% sensitivity, P = .008) with 99.7% reader agreement and reduced the number of false negatives from an average of 47 ± 3.5 to 20 ± 0.6 (P = .008). MA of the AFD results produced similar feeding artery detection rates (127 ± 5.1, 86% sensitivity, P = .8), with lower interreader agreement (91.6%) and slightly fewer false positives (16 ± 0.0 to 14 ± 2.5, P = .4).Conclusions:AFD software significantly improved feeding artery detection rates during transarterial chemoembolization of HCC lesions with better user reproducibility compared with cone-beam CT alone. In conjunction with DSA, AFD enables maximum feeding artery detection in this setting.
