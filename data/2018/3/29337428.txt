Polymorphisms of the lysosomal-associated protein transmembrane-4 beta (LAPTM4B) gene are related to various forms of tumour susceptibility, which led us to hypothesize that some unique transcription factors targeting this polymorphism region may affect the biological function of LAPTM4B in tumour progression. In this study, we found that the transcription factor AP4 directly binds to the polymorphism region of the LAPTM4B gene promoter and induces its transcription. In addition, we demonstrated that AP4 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell proliferation and metastasis and depresses chemotherapy sensitivity via LAPTM4B by activating the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway and caspase-dependent pathway. Interestingly, we found that AP4 could not only regulate LAPTM4B by directly binding to the promoter, but also be regulated via a positive feedback mechanism involving LAPTM4B acting on c-myc. Finally, we showed that AP4 and LAPTM4B are highly coexpressed in HCC tissues, and their coexpression may be a marker of poor prognosis. These findings provide evidence of the expression and functional coupling between AP4 and LAPTM4B and shed light on the regulation of LAPTM4B and its function in liver cancer.
