Background:Ascites increases perioperative complications and risk of death, but is not an absolute contraindication for colectomy in patients with colon cancer. It remains unclear whether postoperative risks can be minimized using a laparoscopic versus open approach.Methods:Data were retrospectively analyzed from 2152 patients with ascites who underwent laparoscopic or open partial colectomy with diagnosis of colon cancer from 2005 to 2013 using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Postoperative outcomes were analyzed using two-sample tests of proportions and two-sample T tests. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) or β coefficients for postoperative complications, hospital length of stay, and 30-day mortality were calculated using multivariable logistic or linear regression. P values <0.05 two-tailed were considered statistically significant.Results:205 patients (9.53%) with ascites underwent laparoscopic colectomy (LC). There was no significant difference in operative time between laparoscopic versus open surgery (145 vs. 146 min, P = 0.69). LC was associated with decreased likelihood of overall complications (adjusted OR 0.7 95% CI 0.4-1.0, P = 0.046) and shorter hospital length of stay (9 days vs. 15 days, adjusted β = -4.2, 95% CI -7.7 to -0.7, P = 0.018). There was no difference in 30-day mortality (adjusted OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.50-1.35, P = 0.429).Conclusions:Laparoscopic colectomy decreases postoperative complications and hospital length of stay in patients with colon cancer and ascites. Laparoscopic approach should be considered for patients in this high-risk population.
