Background and aim:The effects of achieving sustained virological response (SVR) on recurrence and survival after curative treatment in patients with hepatitis virus C (HCV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear. This study examined the influence of SVR achievement by interferon therapy before HCC occurrence on recurrence and survival.Methods:This retrospective study included 518 patients who underwent surgical microwave ablation for initial HCV-related HCC between January 2001 and December 2015. Thirty-four patients had achieved SVR (SVR group) and 484 patients had not (control group). Clinical characteristics and long-term outcomes were compared between the two groups.Results:Overall survival rates at 5 and 10 years after curative ablation were 95.8 and 80.4% in the SVR group, and 50.7 and 23.4% in the control, respectively (p Conclusions:Achieving SVR before HCC occurrence allowed a favorable clinical outcome after curative ablation in HCV-related HCC patients. Patients with HCC that occurred more than 5 years after achieving SVR had longer recurrence-free survival.
