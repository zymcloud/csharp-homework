The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of oxyresveratrol (Oxyres) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vitro and in vivo. The MTT and Transwell assays were performed to investigate the effects of Oxyres on cell proliferation and migration of two HCC cell lines, QGY-7701 and SMMC-7721 cells. H22 cells were subcutaneously injected into hind foot pads of 70 male mice to establish a lymph node metastasis model. These mice were randomly divided into seven groups as follows, control group, HCC group, Oxyres 20 mg/kg group, Oxyres 40 mg/kg group, Oxyres 60 mg/kg group, Resveratrol (Res) group, and Adriamycin (ADM) group. Oxyres, Res, and ADM were intraperitoneally injected daily for consecutive 21 days. Tumors and popliteal lymph node were isolated and embedded for histology analysis. Expressions of CD31 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR3) in tumors were detected by immunohistocehmistry. Expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) were measured by Western blot. Oxyres significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of QGY-7701 and SMMC-7721 cells. Oxyres significantly inhibited tumor growth (p
