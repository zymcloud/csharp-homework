We report a case of resected esophagealcancer that responded wellto first-line combination therapy comprising irinotecan and cisplatin. The patient was a 71-year-old woman being treated for liver cirrhosis. She was admitted to our hospital in April 2015 because of dysphasia. Endoscopic examination revealed a tumor in the mid-thoracic esophagus, which was diagnosed as an endocrine cell carcinoma following pathological examination. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography and positron emission tomography did not show lymph node or distant metastases. She was treated with irinotecan and cisplatin combination therapy. After 6 courses of treatment, the tumor size had remarkably reduced. Subsequently, we performed subtotal esophagectomy and gastric tube reconstruction through the retroposterior mediastinalroute and the histologicaleffect was reported as a partial response. No viable tumor cells were observed in the extracted lymph nodes. However, bone metastasis and lymph node swelling occurred after 4 months. She received other therapeutic regimens, such as etoposide and carboplatin combination therapy. However, the tumor gradually progressed, and she died 18 months after the first treatment. Irinotecan and cisplatin combination therapy is a possible option for the management of esophageal endocrine cell carcinoma as a first-line treatment.
