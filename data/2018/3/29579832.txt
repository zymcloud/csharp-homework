Introduction:There is a lack of information regarding outcomes after liver transplant in Latin America.Objectives:This study sought to describe outcomes after liver transplant in adult patients from Argentina.Methods:We performed an ambispective cohort study of adult patients transplanted between June 2010 and October 2012 in 6 centers from Argentina. Only patients who survived after the first 48 hours postransplantation were included. Pretransplantation and posttransplantation data were collected.Results:A total of 200 patients were included in the study. Median age at time of transplant was 50 (interquartile range [IQR] 26 to 54) years. In total, 173 (86%) patients had cirrhosis, and the most frequent etiology in these patients was hepatitis C (32%). A total of 35 (17%) patients were transplanted with hepatocellular carcinoma. In patients with cirrhosis, the median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score at time of liver transplant was 25 (IQR 19 to 30). Median time on the waiting list for elective patients was 101 (IQR 27 to 295) days, and 3 (IQR 2 to 4) days for urgent patients. Almost 40% of the patients were readmitted during the first 6 months after liver transplant. Acute rejection occurred in 27% of the patients. Biliary and vascular complications were reported in 39 (19%) and 19 (9%) patients, respectively. Renal failure, diabetes, and dyslipidemia were present in 40 (26%), 87 (57%), and 77 (50%) at 2 years, respectively.Conclusions:We believe the information contained in this article might be of value for reviewing current practices and developing local policies.
