Airborne persistent toxic substances are associated with health impacts resulting from air pollution, for example, dioxins, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls, and certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which activate aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhR) and thereby produce adverse outcomes. Thus, a bioassay for evaluating AhR activation is required for risk assessment of ambient-air samples, and for this purpose, we developed a new and sensitive recombinant mouse hepatoma cell line, CBG2.8D, in which a novel luciferase-reporter plasmid containing two copies of a newly designed dioxin-responsive domain and a minimal promoter derived from a native gene were integrated. The minimal detection limit for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p-dioxin with this assay system was 0.1 pM. We used CBG2.8D to determine dioxin levels in 45 ambient-air samples collected in Beijing. The measured bioanalytical equivalent (BEQ) values were closely correlated with the toxic equivalent values obtained from chemical analysis. In haze ambient-air samples, the total activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptors (TAA) was considerably higher than the BEQ of dioxin-rich fractions, according to the results of the cell-based bioassay. Notably, the haze samples contained abundant amounts of PAHs, whose relative toxicity equivalent was correlated with the TAA; this finding suggests that PAHs critically contribute to the AhR-related biological impacts of haze ambient-air samples.
