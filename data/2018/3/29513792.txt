Polydatin, a small molecule from Polygonum cuspidatum, has many biological functions, particularly anti-cancer effects. However, the anti-cancer effects of polydatin in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been examined yet. In the present study, MTT assay, BrdU assay, transwell invasion assay, and wound healing assay were performed to determine cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Flow cytometry and TUNEL assay were used to measure cell apoptosis. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting assays were used to determine mRNA and protein expression levels. Xenograft experiment was performed to determine the in vivo anti-tumor effect of polydatin. Immunostaining was performed to analyze the expression of caspase-3 and Ki-67. Our results showed that polydatin inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner in the HCC cell lines. Polydatin also induced cell apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner possibly via increasing the caspase-3 activity, and up-regulating the protein expression of caspase-3, caspase-9, Bax, and down-regulating the protein expression of Bcl-2. In addition, polydatin treatment had an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, invasion and migration in HCC cell lines. Polydatin treatment also suppressed the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activities in HCC cells. Polydatin treatment significantly reduced tumor growth in nude mice inoculated with HepG2 cells, suppressed the expression of Ki-67, and increased caspase-3 expression and TUNEL activity. Our data indicated the important role of polydatin for the suppression of HCC progression.
