The present study was aimed to investigate anticancer activity of crocin against cervical carcinoma and bio-assessment and toxicological evaluation in male albino rats. Effect of crocin on cell viability (anticancer activity) was determined against cervical carcinoma cells. Chronic effect of crocin on body weight changes, serum enzymes, serum biochemical markers, lipid peroxidation, hematological markers and DNA damage in male albino rats were determined. Cell survival rate was reduced 98.4, 95.7, 87.2, 81.1 and 73.1% at 25, 50, 75, 100 and 125 mg/l of crocin respectively. Cell viability was reduced 97.1, 96.4, 85.5, 78.4 and 70.2% at 25, 50, 75, 100 and 125 mg/l of crocin respectively. Crocin reduced body weight significantly at 30 and 60th day. Alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, bilirubin, albumin and total protein were decreased, while glucose, cholesterol, TG, and GSH were increased. Hemoglobin (Hb), white blood cells (WBC), lymphocytes, neutrophil and packed cell volume (PCV) were altered following crocin treatment. Necrosis, fibrosis, mononuclear infiltration, angiogenesis and DNA fragmentation were also noted. Taking all these data together, it is suggested that the crocin could be a potential antitumor agent against cervical carcinoma. However, the altered histological, biochemical and hematological markers may lead to an adverse effect on the cellular metabolism and physiological activity.
