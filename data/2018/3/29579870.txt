Introduction:Orthotopic liver transplantation (LT) is considered to be one of the few curative treatments available for early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) is the most-used biomarker for HCC despite low sensitivity and specificity. Matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) has been considered to be involved in the process of vascular invasion of the malignant cells. The objective of this study was to assess the use of MMP-1 for the management of HCC patients for LT.Methods:Levels in serum of MMP-1 (ng/mL) and AFP (ng/mL) were assessed in 20 HCC patients (Milan criteria) before and 1, 6, and 12 months after LT.Results:There was a strong significant correlation between levels of MMP-1 and levels of AFP (ρ = .954; P ≤ .05). There were statistical differences in the levels of MMP-1 and APF between the pre-transplantation and post-transplantation groups (1 and 12 months). Increments of both markers 6 months after LT compared with the levels 1 month after LT were detected in 4 of the 20 HCC patients. The detection of recurrence by means of imaging was coincident with the increment of both markers 6 months after LT in 3 of those 4 patients.Conclusions:After 12 months of follow-up, levels of MMP-1 were comparable to AFP levels after LT. Levels of both markers increase 6 months after LT in patients showing recurrence, indicating discriminatory power to predict relapse and thus serving as valuable markers for HCC monitoring. MMP-1 could be useful in the management of HCC after LT.
