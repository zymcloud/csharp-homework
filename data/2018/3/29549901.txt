Background:To compare the surgical outcomes of major laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) and open liver resection (OLR) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 177 patients who underwent major liver resection for HCC between January 2004 and June 2015. We divided the 177 patients into two groups according to the type of procedure: major LLR (LLR group; n = 67) and major OLR (OLR group; n = 110).Results:Procedures in the LLR group were right hepatectomy (30 patients), right posterior sectionectomy (28), left hepatectomy (11), right anterior sectionectomy (6), extended right hepatectomy (6), and central bisectionectomy (2). Tumor size was greater in the OLR group than in the LLR group (6.3 ± 3.8 vs 4.1 ± 2.4 cm; P = 0.016). The mean indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (P = 0.698) and serum α-fetoprotein (P = 0.186) were similar in both groups. The mean operation time was longer in the LLR group (416.6 ± 166.9 vs 332.5 ± 105.4 min; P = 0.002). Blood loss (P = 0.319), transfusion rate (P = 0.260), and R0 rate (P = 0.255) were similar in both groups. Hospital stay was shorter (11.3 ± 8.3 vs. 18 ± 21.4 days; P = 0.007) and the complication rate was lower (20.5% vs. 38.7%; P = 0.005) in the LLR group. The 5-year overall survival (77.3% vs 60.2%; P = 0.087) and disease-free survival (50.8% vs 40.1%; P = 0.139) rates were comparable in both groups.Conclusion:Major LLR of HCC is feasible and oncologically safe when performed by experienced surgeons. Further refinements of the surgical technique are needed to reduce operation time.
