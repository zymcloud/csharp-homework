Background:Microvascular invasion (MVI) is well established as a negative prognostic factor for hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC). However, its prognostic value in different subgroups of Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages remains to be elucidated.Methods:Four hundred fifty-eight MVI-negative and 204 MVI-positive patients who underwent hepatectomy were retrospectively analyzed. After propensity score matching (PSM) analysis, 187 pairs of matched patients were generated. Long-term survival was compared by the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:Patients with MVI commonly had more advanced tumors. All the patients with MVI had significantly worse survival rate compared to the patients without MVI before and after PSM(p Conclusions:Its prognostic value in different subgroups of BCLC stages differed. MVI is an independent predictor of prognosis in patients with BCLC stage A. For BCLC stage B HCCs, MVI-positive group had poor prognosis through more advanced HCCs.
