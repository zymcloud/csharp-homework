We describe multi-institutional experience using free-breathing, 3D Spiral GRAPPA-based quantitative perfusion MRI in characterizing neoplastic liver masses. 45 patients (age: 48-72 years) were prospectively recruited at University Hospitals, Cleveland, USA on a 3 Tesla (T) MRI, and at Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai, China on a 1.5 T MRI. Contrast-enhanced volumetric T1-weighted images were acquired and a dual-input single-compartment model used to derive arterial fraction (AF), distribution volume (DV) and mean transit time (MTT) for the lesions and normal parenchyma. The measurements were compared using two-tailed Student's t-test, with Bonferroni correction applied for multiple-comparison testing. 28 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 17 metastatic lesions were evaluated. No significant difference was noted in perfusion parameters of normal liver parenchyma and neoplastic masses at two centers (p = 0.62 for AF, 0.015 for DV, 0.42 for MTT for HCC, p = 0.13 for AF, 0.97 for DV, 0.78 for MTT for metastases). There was statistically significant difference in AF, DV, and MTT of metastases and AF and DV of HCC compared to normal liver parenchyma (p
