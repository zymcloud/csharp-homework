Fast-track programmes are aimed at improving perioperative care. The purpose of this study was to identify and explore patient participation among patients who had surgery for liver, bile duct or pancreatic cancer and followed a fast-track programme. A total of 116 questionnaires to investigate patient participation were analysed. Information was important for the patients, as was having the opportunity to ask questions and express personal views. The results showed differences by sex; men responded to a greater extent that they did not want to make decisions as a patient (p = 0.044) and that they had been motivated to take more responsibility for their future health (p = 0.011). Patients with pancreatic cancer discussed treatment goals with doctors to a greater extent than did patients with liver cancer (p = 0.041). Half of the patients perceived that they had not been involved in their care planning after discharge but had a desired to be involved. This seems to be an important point to improve in future care, and also that professionals should be aware of patients' needs for information and participation, especially at discharge.
