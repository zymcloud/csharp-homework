Background:GPR110 is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor family, which has been identified as an oncogene in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, prostatic cancer and glioma. Whereas the expression and the clinical relevance of GPR110 in gastric cancer has not been investigated. The research purpose of this study was to explore the expression pattern of GPR110 and evaluate its clinical-pathological and prognostic value in gastric cancer.Methods:In this study, the expression of GPR110 was detected in 117 paired gastric cancer tissues and adjacent non-tumorous tissues by using qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical assays. Univariate Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox analysis were used to determine the prognostic value of GPR110 in GC.Results:We demonstrated that the mRNA and protein levels of GPR110 in GC tissues were overexpressed than the adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Furthermore, elevated GPR110 protein expression was correlated with decreased overall and recurrence-free survival (P = 0.001 and P = 0.000, respectively). Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that GPR110 protein level may serve as an independent prognostic indicator for determining prognosis of GC patients.Conclusions:Our study revealed that high expression of GPR110 predicts the poor prognosis of GC patients, and GPTR110 may function as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of GC.
