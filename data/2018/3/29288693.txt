Mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC) is a rare pathologic entity defined as a tumor exhibiting both adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma components. Though uncommon, these tumors show aggressive behavior and generally portend a poor prognosis. This study seeks to further define clinicopathological characteristics of MANEC to aid in accurate diagnosis and properly direct clinical management. Thirty-four confirmed MANECs were identified in our 25-year retrospective review of cases arising in the gastrointestinal tract. Various gross and microscopic variables were compared to overall survival. Tumors diagnosed at advanced stage (pT4), had a prominent mucinous component and lacked goblet cell clusters, which were all significantly associated with worse overall survival. This study supports previous findings and further elucidates clinicopathologic characteristics of MANEC.
