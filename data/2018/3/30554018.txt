The development of advanced gene delivery carriers with stimuli-responsive release manner for tumor therapeutics is desirable, since they can exclusively release the therapeutic gene via their structural changes in response to the specific stimuli of the target site. Moreover, interactions between macrophages and drug delivery systems (DDSs) seriously impair the treatment efficiency of DDSs, thus macrophages uptake inhibition would to some extent improve the intracellular uptake of DDSs in tumor cells. Herein, a PEGylated redox-responsive gene delivery system was developed for effective cancer therapy. PEG modified glycolipid-like polymer (P-CSSO) was electrostatic interacted with p53 to form P-CSSO/p53 complexes, which exhibited an enhanced redox sensitivity in that the disulfide bond was degraded and the rate the plasmid released from P-CSSO was 2.29-fold that of nonresponsive platform (P-CSO-SA) in 10 mM levels of glutathione (GSH). PEGylation could significantly weaken macrophages uptake, while enhance the accumulation of P-CSSO in tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. Compared with nonresponsive complexes (P-CSO-SA/p53) (59.2%) and Lipofectamineâ„¢ 2000/p53 complexes (52.0%), the tumor inhibition rate of P-CSSO/p53 complexes (77.1%) significantly increased, which was higher than CSSO/p53 complexes (69.9%). The present study indicates that tumor microenvironment sensitive and macrophages uptake suppressive P-CSSO/p53 is a powerful in vivo gene delivery system for enhanced anticancer therapy.
