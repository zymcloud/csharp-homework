Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most prevalent cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. In the present study, we have demonstrated that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00472 was low expressed in human HCC tissues and cell lines compared with adjacent non-tumor liver tissues and normal liver cell lines respectively. LINC00472 was also low expressed in HCC tissues from patients with metastasis compared with tissues from patients without metastasis. Expression level of LINC00472 was positively correlated with patient overall survival (OS) rate. Forced expression of LINC00472 suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion and promoted cell apoptosis in HCC cells Huh-7 and SMMC-7721. MiR-93-5p was a direct target of LINC00472, and miR-93-5p directly targeted PDCD4. The miR-93-5p/PDCD4 pathway mediated the suppressing role of LINC00472 in HCC cells. Therefore, LINC00472 was an important tumor suppressor in human HCC, which could be used as a bio-marker for HCC therapy.
