Introduction and aim:Wound healing is an orderly complex process involving inflammation, clotting, re-epithelialization, neovascularization and wound closure. In diabetic patients, such process is impaired and delayed, posing negative economic as well as social consequences. Diabetex, (patency# EP 0877617 A1) composed of L-alanine, d-ribose, nicotinic acid and calcium ascorbate, which was initially introduced to treat cancer is thought to have anti- diabetic effects. The present study was designed to investigate the therapeutic merit of diabetex as well as the cellular mechanisms involved in such effects and its safety profile compared to metformin in wounded diabetic rats.Main methods:Sixty adult male Sprague-Dawley albino rats were randomly divided into two major groups after induction of full thickness wound; control and treated groups. Liver and kidney function test, as well as cytokines (VEGF, TGF-β, PDGF and MMP2), fasting blood sugar were measured in animal sera. Histopathological studies including hematoxyline and eosin, Masson's trichrome stains were performed on wounded tissue.Key findings:Diabetex significantly improved wound healing, collagen formation, induced re-epithelialization and neovascularization. Moreover, cytokines involved in wound healing process were increased by the antidiabetic medication. Noteworthy, the drug exhibited a safe profile on liver and kidney function tests and significantly reduced fasting blood sugar.Significance:The present study offers a novel approach for treating diabetic resistant wounds with a possible more economic, safe strategy.
