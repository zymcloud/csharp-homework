Simultaneous resection of synchronous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is extremely rare. Case 1 is a 64-year-old woman, who had undergone anterior resection for rectal cancer 3 years earlier was pointed out to have a cystic tumor in the pancreatic tail and a solitary tumor in the liver. CT revealed a hypovascular tumor in the pancreatic tail and a liver tumor with early enhancement. With a diagnosis of simultaneous HCC and PDAC, she underwent laparotomy, in which intraoperative frozen section examination of the liver was compatible with HCC. Therefore, she underwent hepatic resection as well as distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 and remains well with no evidence of tumor recurrence as of 28 months after resection. Case 2 is a 73-year-old man with sustained viral response to antiviral treatment for hepatitis C virus, who was pointed out to have a tumor in the pancreatic head and a solitary tumor in the liver. Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI exhibited enhancement compatible with HCC. With a diagnosis of concomitant HCC and PDAC, surgery was performed. Intraoperative frozen section examination was compatible with HCC, for which a pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 and remains well with no evidence of tumor recurrence as of 16 months after resection. In conclusion, we describe 2 cases of hepato-pancreatectomy for synchronous double primary cancers of the pancreas and the liver, where exclusion of the liver tumor as a metastatic lesion from the pancreatic cancer is important.
