Background:Sarcopenia has been associated with poor outcomes in patients with cirrhosis and solid tumours.Objective:Analyse the influence of sarcopenia on survival and treatment duration in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with sorafenib.Methods:We conducted a multicentre, retrospective study on 96 patients with advanced HCC treated with sorafenib, all with available abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan within 30 days from treatment start. Anthropometric, laboratory, treatment and follow-up data were collected. Sarcopenia was defined by reduced skeletal muscle index calculated from an L3 section CT image.Results:Sarcopenia was present in 49% of patients. Patients were divided into two groups according to sarcopenia: age was significantly higher in the sarcopenic group (SG) (66 years (31-87) versus 72 years (30-84), p = 0.04], with no difference in other baseline characteristics. The SG showed shorter overall survival (OS) (39 (95% confidence interval (CI) 26-50) versus 61 (95% CI 47-77) weeks (p = 0,01)) and shorter time on treatment (12.3 (95% CI 8-19) versus 25.9 (95% CI 15-33) weeks (p = 0.0044)). At multivariate analysis, sarcopenia was independently associated to reduced OS (p = 0.03) and reduced time on treatment (p = 0.001).Conclusion:Sarcopenia is present in almost half of patients with advanced HCC, and is associated with reduced survival and reduced duration of oral chemotherapy.
