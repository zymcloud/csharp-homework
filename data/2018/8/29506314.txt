Obesity is associated with both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and chronic metabolic inflammation. ER stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) and has been implicated in a variety of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is unclear whether individual UPR pathways are mechanistically linked to HCC development, however. Here we report a dual role for inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), the ER-localized UPR signal transducer, in obesity-promoted HCC development. We found that genetic ablation of IRE1α in hepatocytes not only markedly reduced the occurrence of diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC in liver-specific IRE1α knockout (LKO) mice when fed a normal chow (NC) diet, but also protected against the acceleration of HCC progression during high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Irrespective of their adiposity states, LKO mice showed decreased hepatocyte proliferation and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation, even in the face of increased hepatic apoptosis. Furthermore, IRE1α abrogation blunted obesity-associated activation of hepatic inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit beta (IKKβ)-nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, leading to reduced production of the tumor-promoting inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Importantly, higher IRE1α expression along with elevated STAT3 phosphorylation was also observed in the tumor tissues from human HCC patients, correlating with their poorer survival rate.Conclusion:IRE1α acts in a feed-forward loop during obesity-induced metabolic inflammation to promote HCC development through STAT3-mediated hepatocyte proliferation.
