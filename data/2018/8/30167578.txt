The evaluation of patients with early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) referred for liver resection is still a matter of debate. Aims: 1) to compare liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) in the prediction of decompensation after liver resection in patients with cirrhosis and early HCC; 2) to identify which definition for posthepatectomy liver failure is better associated with survival.Material and methods:Fifty-one patients (MELD score of 10±3) were included. In this group, 34 patients underwent HVPG measurement, of which 13 (38%) had clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) and 35 patients underwent LSM (21.8±17.9 kPa). The study's end-points were: posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) defined according to International Study Group of Liver Surgery criteria and 3-month decompensation defined as de novo ascites, variceal bleeding, jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy and acute kidney injury. The performance of LSM compared to HVPG in predicting the end-points were assessed by AUROC curves and accuracy.Results:Twenty (39%) patients developed PHLF and 15 (29%) developed decompensationat 3 months. Three-month decompensation tended to be better correlated with survival. LSM performed well in predicting decompensation at 3 months (AUROC=0.78, 95%CI: 0.63-0.94; p=0.01), comparable with HVPG (AUROC=0.89, 95%CI: 0.79-1.00; pConclusion:LSM has a similar performance to HVPG in predicting decompensation at 3 months in patients with early HCC submitted to liver resection. Three-month decompensation is better associated with survival.
