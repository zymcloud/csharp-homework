Background:Chemotherapy dosing has traditionally been based on a body surface area (BSA) calculation despite BSA dosing being problematic in a number of conditions, such as renal failure, liver failure, obesity, and sarcopenia. This case highlights another condition in which BSA dosing is problematic.Case:A 57-year-old man with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy presents with stage IIA inoperable squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. He is treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy with curative intent but develops significant chemotherapy related toxicity affecting chemotherapy scheduling and dosing. Later, his cancer progresses, and he is commenced on palliative chemotherapy resulting in further significant chemotherapy toxicity.Conclusion:Sarcopenia is known to increase risk of chemotherapy toxicity. This case postulates that changes in muscle mass seen in muscular dystrophy increases risk of chemotherapy toxicity, similar to sarcopenia.
