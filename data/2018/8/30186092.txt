Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (HEHE) is a rare tumor. Preoperative diagnosis of HEHE is difficult because it does not manifest specific symptoms or tumor markers. We report a resected case of small and solitary HEHE. The patient, a 74-year-old man, had undergone surgical resection for left renal cell carcinoma 20 years ago. During follow-up, a tumor approximately 1.3 cm in diameter was detected by computed tomography (CT) at liver segment VIII. It showed isodensity in the arterial phase, low density in the portal venous phase, and homogeneous enhancement in the late phase on CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We performed hepatic resection of the right hepatic vein drainage area. A pathological diagnosis of HEHE was made. Although small and solitary HEHE is rare, an enhancement pattern in each phase on CT and MRI, using contrast media, can yield clues for the diagnosis of HEHE.
