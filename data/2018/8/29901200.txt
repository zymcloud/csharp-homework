Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer‑associated mortality in the 21st century. microRNA (miR)‑23b has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of many cancers, including breast and prostate cancer. However, the role of miR‑23b in HCC remains unclear. The present study revealed a negative correlation between miR‑23b expression in HCC tissues and progression of carcinomas. Compared to normal tissues, miR‑23b expression was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues, whereas the expression of interleukin (IL)‑11 and IL‑11 receptor α (IL‑11Rα) was significantly upregulated, indicating that miR‑23b expression is negatively correlated with IL‑11 and IL‑11Rα expression. In addition, miR‑23b inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of SMMC‑7721 cells. This effect was mediated by IL‑11, which was found to be the direct target of miR‑23b in this study. These results indicated that miR‑23b regulates IL‑11 and IL‑11Rα expression, and might act as an anti‑oncogenic agent in the progression of HCC by directly downregulating IL‑11 expression.
