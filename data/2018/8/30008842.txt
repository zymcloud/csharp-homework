Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a type of malignant tumor with a high mortality rate. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve important roles in cellular processes and gene regulation. Identifying novel prognostic biomarkers is important for the monitoring and treatment of HCC. However, only a limited number of biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity have been determined and are used in clinical practice. The aim of the present study was to investigate the use of serum lncRNA uc007biz.1 (LRB1) expression levels as a novel non-invasive biomarker for the monitoring and diagnosis of HCC. The expression levels of LRB1 were detected in 326 patients with HCC and 73 healthy volunteers by using lncRNA expression microarrays and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, and the associations between LRB1 expression and clinical parameters were analyzed. The results indicated that the serum LRB1 levels in patients with HCC were significantly increased compared with healthy volunteers. The serum LRB1 levels were positively associated with α-fetoprotein (AFP) expression, large tumor sizes, tumor stage (tumor-node metastasis or Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage) and venous invasion, and were negatively associated with overall survival. Additionally, the use of a combination of LRB1, AFP and des-γ-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) markers for the diagnosis of HCC, the diagnostic accuracy was increased compared with using LRB1 alone. LRB1 may act as an important regulator in the progression of HCC, and LRB1 may be considered as a novel biomarker for diagnosis and prediction of prognosis of HCC, additionally complementing the accuracy of AFP and DCP.
