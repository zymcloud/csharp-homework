The role of platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with different Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages remains controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the efficacy of PLR on HCC prognosis. Five electronic databases were searched for clinical trials focusing on the role of PLR in the prognosis of HCC. A total of 297 potential studies were initially identified, and 9 studies comprising 2449 patients were finally enrolled to evaluate the association between the pretreatment PLR and clinical outcomes of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and event occurrence in patients with HCC in different BCLC stages. An elevated pretreatment PLR indicated unfavorable worse OS (HR = 1.73; 95% CI: (1.46, 2.04); P < 0.00001) and DFS (HR = 1.30; 95% CI: (1.06, 1.60); P = 0.01). Subgroup analysis indicated that high PLR indicated poor OS among BCLC-B/C patients without heterogeneity, while PLR in BCLC-A patients indicated high statistical heterogeneity with I2 value of 78%. As for the correlation between PLR and event occurrence, high PLR was related to poor clinical event occurrence only among BCLC-C patients, though obvious heterogeneity was observed in all different BCLC stages. In conclusion, PLR may be a significant biomarker in the prognosis of HCC in different BCLC stages.
