The liver and pancreas are closely associated organs that share a common embryological origin. They display amphicrine properties and have similar exocrine organization with parenchymal cells, namely, hepatocytes and acinar cells, secreting bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum via a converging network of bile ducts and pancreatic ducts. Here we compare and highlight the similarities of molecular mechanisms leading to liver and pancreatic cancer development. We suggest that unraveling tumor development in an organ may provide insight into our understanding of carcinogenesis in the other organ.
