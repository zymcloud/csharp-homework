Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been widely reported in various cancers due to their special molecular mechanisms. LncRNA SOX21-AS1 has been discovered to be a tumor facilitator in several types of human cancers. However, the expression pattern, clinical value and biological effects in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still unknown. In this study, we detected the high expression level of SOX21-AS1 in tumor tissues and cell lines through performing qRT-PCR analysis. The prognostic value of SOX21-AS1 was identified. Moreover, the biological effects of SOX21-AS1 on HCC cell activities were evaluated by functional assays, such as MTT, colony formation assay and transwell assay. As a result, silenced SOX21-AS1 suppressed cell proliferation and metastasis, resulted in cell cycle arrest, and induced apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma. Mechanically, RIP was conducted to prove that SOX21-AS1 could bind with EZH2. ChIp assay was carried out and manifested that SOX21-AS1 epigenetically silenced p21 via recruiting EZH2 to the promoter of p21. Finally, rescue assays were designed and carefully conducted to investigate whether SOX21-AS1 can interact with p21 to affect hepatocellular carcinoma progression. Generally, our results suggested that SOX21-AS1 could be a potential prognostic biomarker or a therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma.
