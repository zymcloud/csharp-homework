Oral exposure is a major route of human bisphenol A (BPA) exposure. However, influence of gastrointestinal tract on BPA metabolism is unavailable. In this study, in vitro simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (SHIME) was applied to investigate the changes in bioaccessibility and metabolism of BPA in different parts of gastrointestinal tract (stomach, small intestine and colon). Then the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was employed to compare toxic effects of BPA itself and effluents of SHIME system on hepatic gene expression profiles. Results showed that level of bioaccessible BPA decreased with the process of gastrointestinal digestion. But the gastrointestinal digestion could not completely degrade BPA. Then, BPA exposure significantly changed microbial community in colons and increased the percentage of microbes shared in ascending, transverse and descending colons. Abundances of BPA-degradable bacteria, such as Microbacterium and Alcaligenes, were up-regulated. Further, SHIME effluents significantly up-regulated expressions of genes related to estrogenic effect and oxidative stress compared to BPA itself, but reduced or had little change on the risk of cell apoptosis and fatty deposits. This study sheds new lights on influence of gastrointestinal digestion on bioaccessibility and toxic effects of BPA.
