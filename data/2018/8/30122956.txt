Background:PPARG, PPARGC1A, and PPARGC1B polymorphisms may be implicated in the development of cancer.Participants and methods:In this study, we selected PPARG rs1801282 C>G and rs3856806 C>T, PPARGC1A rs2970847 C>T, and PPARGC1B rs7732671 G>C and rs17572019 G>A single-nucleotide polymorphisms to explore the relationship between these polymorphisms and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk. A total of 584 HCC patients and 923 controls were enrolled.Results:We found that PPARG rs1801282 C>G polymorphism was correlated with a decreased susceptibility of HCC (CG vs CC, adjusted OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27-0.82, P=0.007; CG/GG vs CC, adjusted OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31-0.88, P=0.015). However, PPARG rs3856806 C>T polymorphism was a risk factor for HCC (TT vs CC, adjusted OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.25-4.36, P=0.008; TT vs CT/CC, adjusted OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.22-4.17, P=0.010). In a subgroup analysis by chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infection status, age, sex, alcohol use, and smoking status, a significant association between PPARG rs1801282 C>G polymorphism and a decreased risk of HCC in male, â‰¥53 years, never-smoking, never-drinking, and nonchronic HBV-infection-status subgroups was found. However, we found PPARG rs3856806 C>T polymorphism increased the risk of HCC in never-smoking, never-drinking, and nonchronic HBV-infection-status subgroups. Haplotype-comparison analysis indicated that Crs1801282Trs3856806Crs2970847Grs7732671Grs17572019, Crs1801282Trs3856806Trs2970847Grs7732671Grs17572019, and Crs1801282Crs3856806Crs2970847Crs7732671Ars17572019 haplotypes increased the risk of HCC. PPARG Crs1801282Trs3856806 and Grs1801282Crs3856806 haplotypes also influenced the risk of HCC.Conclusion:In conclusion, our findings suggest PPARG polymorphisms may influence the susceptibility of HCC. The PPARG, PPARGC1A, and PPARGC1B haplotypes might be associated with HCC risk.
