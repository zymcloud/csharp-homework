Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to liver damage characterized by steatosis, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis that can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The focus of the new 2018 EASL recommendations is on screening for high-risk drinking, the importance of early diagnosis of liver fibrosis, and the modulation of factors that can influence evolution. The drug treatment of steatohepatitis is limited to corticosteroid therapy dictated by the Lille score. Abstinence remains the cornerstone of management and should, at the cirrhosis stage, be associated with the prevention of complications. Abstinence and correction of cofactors may be associated with partial regression of fibrosis during follow-up and thus constitute an additional objective.
