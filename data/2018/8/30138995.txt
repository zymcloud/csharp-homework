Objective: To investigate the diagnostic performance of whole-tumor volume analysis of mono-exponential and intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM)parameters in the preoperative grading of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: A total of 106 patients who undewent parital hepatectomy were prospectively enrolled and underwent with routine MR and IVIM examination.112 HCCs were confirmed by the surgical pathology.The original images of IVIM were imported into the GE AW 4.6 workstation.Two independent radiologist who were blinded to the histopathological results analyzed the data.Freehand ROI was used to cover the whole tumor volume, ADC, ADC(slow), ADC(fast) and f was calculated.Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to evaluate the inter-observer agreement, One-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis sign rank test were used to evaluate the difference of these parameters in grading HCC, Spearman correlation analysis was used to determine the correlation between these parameters and histologic grade, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance. Results: ICC value of ADC, ADC(slow), ADC(fast) and f were 0.948, 0.966, 0.901 and 0.940, respectively.Statistical significances were obtained from the ADC(slow)(R1: χ(2)=74.403, P<0.001; R2: F=44.973, P<0.001) and ADC (R1: χ(2)=52.987, P<0.001; R2: F=30.851, P<0.001) in grading HCC.Between the multiple-comparison in grading HCC, the ADC(slow) and ADC (except for E-S 3 and 4, R1: P=0.134; R2: P=0.069) also demonstrated a statistical significant difference (all P<0.05). Area under curve (AUC) value of two radiologists for ADC(slow) were 0.905 and 0.917, for ADC were 0.831 and 0.829, a negative correlation was obtained from the ADC and ADC(slow) (all P<0.05). Conclusion: Mono-exponential and intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) model can be used to evaluate the pathological differentiated grade of HCC, ADC and ADC(slow) value entailed the highest diagnostic performance.
