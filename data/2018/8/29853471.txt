Glutathione transferase zeta1 (GSTZ1) catalyzes glutathione (GSH)-dependent dechlorination of dichloroacetate (DCA), an investigational drug with therapeutic potential in metabolic disorders and cancer. GSTZ1 is expressed in both hepatic cytosol and mitochondria. Here, we examined the ontogeny and characterized the properties of human mitochondrial GSTZ1. GSTZ1 expression and activity with DCA were determined in 103 human hepatic mitochondrial samples prepared from livers of donors aged 1 day to 84 years. DNA from each sample was genotyped for three common GSTZ1 functional single nucleotide polymorphisms. Expression of mitochondrial GSTZ1 protein increased in an age-dependent manner to a plateau after age 21 years. Activity with DCA correlated with expression, after taking into account the somewhat higher activity of samples that were homo- or heterozygous for GSTZ1A. In samples from livers with the GSTZ1C variant, apparent enzyme kinetic constants for DCA and GSH were similar for mitochondria and cytosol after correcting for the loss of GSH observed in mitochondrial incubations. In the presence of 38 mM chloride, mitochondrial GSTZ1 exhibited shorter half-lives of inactivation compared with the cytosolic enzyme (P = 0.017). GSTZ1 protein isolated from mitochondria was shown by mass spectrometry to be identical to cytosolic GSTZ1 protein in the covered primary protein sequence. In summary, we report age-related development in the expression and activity of human hepatic mitochondrial GSTZ1 does not have the same pattern as that reported for cytosolic GSTZ1. Some properties of cytosolic and mitochondrial GSTZ1 differed, but these were not related to differences in amino acid sequence or post-translationally modified residues.
