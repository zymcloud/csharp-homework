The patient was a 64-year-old man who presented with a hoarse voice, pharyngalgia, and high fever.Despite receiving therapy, he presented with dysphagia, and endoscopy revealed a tumor in the thoracic esophagus.A biopsy indicated squamous cell carcinoma.Despite no evidence of infection, laboratory findings revealed leukocytosis and high serum levels of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor(G-CSF).An immunohistochemical study showed positive staining for G-CSF in the tumor cells.Chemoradiation therapy(CRT)with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin was administered, but his response to treatment was evaluated as progressive disease.Bone, brain, and liver metastases were detected consecutively, and he died 7 months after diagnosis.There are few reports of G-CSF-producing esophageal tumors, and the prognosis is very poor.
