Purpose:To assess feasibility and efficacy of CKD-516, a vascular disrupting agent, in transarterial chemoembolization in a liver tumor model.Materials and methods:A VX2 carcinoma strain was implanted in rabbit liver (n = 40) and incubated for 2 weeks. After confirmation of tumor growth using computed tomography, transarterial chemoembolization was performed. CKD-516 was dissolved in ethiodized oil, and animals were allocated to 4 treatment groups (n = 10 in each): group A, ethiodized oil; group B, ethiodized oil/CKD-516; group C, ethiodized oil + doxorubicin; group D, ethiodized oil/CKD-516 + doxorubicin. To assess hepatic damage, serum aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels were measured on day 1, 3, and 7 after delivery. To assess tumor necrosis, animals were euthanized on day 7, and explanted tumors were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling assay. Percentage areas of viable tumors were calculated using digitalized histopathologic specimen images.Results:Tumor viability rates were 47.1% ± 11.4%, 27.5% ± 13.6%, 14.4% ± 12.5%, and 0.7% ± 1.0% in groups A, B, C, and D (P < .001). Liver enzyme levels were elevated after drug delivery but recovered during follow-up. Significant between-group differences were observed on days 1, 3, and 7 (aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase: P = .0135 and P = .0134, P = .0390 and P = .0084, and P = .8260 and P = .0440).Conclusions:Treatment with a combination of CKD-516 and conventional transarterial chemoembolization showed therapeutic benefit in a liver tumor model.
