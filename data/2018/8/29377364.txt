Aim:No effective therapies for extrahepatic metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have yet been identified. Previous studies suggested a potentially promising antitumor effect of combination therapy of S-1, a novel oral dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase inhibitor, and interferon (IFN)-α. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical efficacy of single agent S-1 and S-1/IFN-α for HCC patients with extrahepatic metastases in a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial.Methods:A total of 103 patients with HCC with extrahepatic metastases were randomly assigned to the S-1/IFN-α group, receiving the combination of S-1 and IFN-α, or the S-1 group, receiving the single agent of S-1. Clinical efficacy and adverse events were compared between the two groups.Results:A total of 49 patients in the S-1/IFN-α group and 51 patients in the S-1 group were included in the efficacy analysis. The response rate was 22.4% (11/49) in the S-1/IFN-α group and 13.7% (7/51) in the S-1 group; there was no significant difference. Overall and progression-free survival in the two groups were also not significantly different (1-year overall survival 50.8% vs. 72.4%, median progression-free survival 127 days vs. 157 days). The incidence of grade ≥3 adverse events in the S-1/IFN-α group was 62.7% (32/51), which tended to be higher than in the S-1 group (43.1% [22/51]).Conclusions:Oncological outcomes in both treatment groups were favorable compared with previous reports, though there was no significant beneficial effect of adding IFN-α to S-1 for the treatment of HCC patients with extrahepatic metastases.
