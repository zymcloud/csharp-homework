Mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma rarely occurs in the gallbladder. Most cases of cholecystic mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma have been reported from Asia, North American, and Europe; however, there is scarce literature available on this tumor in other populations. Here, we report a case of mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma in a Melanoderm woman who was initially suspected to have gallbladder cancer. No specific symptoms or abnormal blood test results were observed preoperatively. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 7-cm hypointense mass in the gallbladder fossa, which invaded the surrounding liver segments. Radical cholecystectomy, partial liver resection, and regional lymphadenectomy were performed. Finally, she was diagnosed as mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma of the gallbladder upon postoperative pathological examination and immunohistochemical staining. She received six cycles of systemic chemotherapy and somatostatin treatment and survived 21 months after surgery. Our case highlights the fact that mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma of the gallbladder can occur in African populations as well. Surgical approach combined with adjuvant chemotherapy and somatostatin treatment may contribute a relatively good survival outcome.
