In hepatobiliary surgery, fluorescence imaging enables identification of subcapsular liver tumors through accumulation of indocyanine green after preoperative intravenous injection in cancerous tissues of hepatocellular carcinoma and in noncancerous hepatic parenchyma around intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and liver metastases. Indocyanine green-fluorescence imaging can also be used for visualizing extrahepatic bile duct anatomy and hepatic segmental boundaries, enhancing the accuracy of open and laparoscopic hepatectomy.
