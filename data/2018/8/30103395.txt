Hepatic fibrosis is the wound-healing process of chronic hepatic disease that leads to the end-stage of hepatocellular carcinoma and demolition of hepatic structures. Epithelial⁻mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been identified to phenotypic conversion of the epithelium to mesenchymal phenotype that occurred during fibrosis. Smad decoy oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) is a synthetic DNA fragment containing a complementary sequence of Smad transcription factor. Thus, this study evaluated the antifibrotic effects of Smad decoy ODN on carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄)-induced hepatic fibrosis in mice. As shown in histological results, CCl₄ treatment triggered hepatic fibrosis and increased Smad expression. On the contrary, Smad decoy ODN administration suppressed fibrogenesis and EMT process. The expression of Smad signaling and EMT-associated protein was markedly decreased in Smad decoy ODN-treated mice compared with CCl₄-injured mice. In conclusion, these data indicate the practicability of Smad decoy ODN administration for preventing hepatic fibrosis and EMT processes.
