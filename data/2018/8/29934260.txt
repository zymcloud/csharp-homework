Purpose:To evaluate safety and efficacy of combining sorafenib with transarterial chemoembolization in patients with advanced stage hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).Materials and methods:Systemic chemotherapy-na√Øve patients with a Child-Pugh class A liver profile and advanced stage HCCs were enrolled. Sorafenib therapy (daily dose 800 mg) was initiated within 4 weeks after initial conventional transarterial chemoembolization with an allowance of subsequent on-demand conventional chemoembolization. The primary endpoint was rate of protocol treatment completion, which was defined as sorafenib administration for at least 2 months. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate, disease control rate, overall survival, progression-free survival, and incidence of adverse events. Thirty-one patients (24 men, 7 women; median age, 75 years; vascular invasion, n = 19; extrahepatic metastases, n = 18; both, n = 6) who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled.Results:Protocol treatment was completed in 28 patients (90.3%, 28/31) with median protocol treatment duration of 7.0 months (range, 0.5-30 months) and median of 2 (range, 1-4) transarterial chemoembolization sessions. Objective response rate was 77.4% with median overall and progression-free survival of 17.3 months (95% confidence interval, 11.9-22.6 months) and 5.4 months (95% confidence interval, 4.6-6.2 months), respectively. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were self-limiting elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (54.8%, 17/31) and alanine aminotransferase (45.2%, 14/31).Conclusions:This combination therapy is feasible and promising in patients with advanced stage HCCs.
