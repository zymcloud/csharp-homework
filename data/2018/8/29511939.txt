Background:The prognosis of metastatic recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is poor, and chemotherapy improves survival by only a few months. The concept of oligo-recurrence, defined as a small number of new lesions at a distant site theoretically curable by local therapy, has recently been proposed for several cancers. To evaluate the possible benefits of surgical resection for oligo-recurrence, we report the outcomes of seven patients who underwent hepatic resection for oligo-recurrence of NSCLC in the liver.Methods:Among the 2038 patients who underwent resection for NSCLC between January 1997 and December 2015 at the Department of Chest Surgery, Chiba Cancer Center, 7 (0.34%) with oligo-recurrence in the liver underwent hepatectomy. Perioperative data were retrospectively reviewed, including recurrence-free and overall survival.Results:Primary tumor histopathological types included five cases of squamous cell carcinoma, one case of adenocarcinoma, and one case of large-cell carcinoma. All patients underwent complete tumor resection without complication. The median survival duration following hepatectomy was 24.0 (range 15.2-30.2) months. Four patients were alive at the end of follow-up (23.4-30.2 months), whereas three died between 15.2 and 24.5 months. There was no evidence of second recurrence in two patients.Conclusions:Hepatectomy may be equally effective as multidisciplinary therapy for oligo-recurrence of NSCLC in the liver.
