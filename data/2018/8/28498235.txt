Objective:The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of receiving care at high minimally invasive surgery (MIS)-utilizing hospitals BACKGROUND:: MIS techniques are used across surgical specialties. The extent of MIS utilization for gastrointestinal (GI) cancer resection and impact of receiving care at high utilizing hospitals is unclear.Methods:This is a retrospective cohort study of 137,581 surgically resected esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, hepatobiliary, colon, and rectal cancer patients within the National Cancer Data Base (2010-2013). Disease-specific, hospital-level, reliability-adjusted MIS utilization rates were calculated to evaluate perioperative outcomes. Among patients for whom adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) was indicated, the association between days to AC and hospital MIS utilization was examined using generalized estimating equations. Association with risk of death was evaluated using multivariable Cox regression.Results:Disease-specific MIS use increased significantly [42.0%-68.3% increase; trend test, P Conclusions:Most hospitals treating GI malignancies are low MIS utilizers. Our findings may reflect real-world MIS effectiveness for oncologic resection and could be useful for identifying hospitals with infrastructure and/or processes beneficial for multimodality cancer care.
