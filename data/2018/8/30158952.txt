Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the cancer of the intrahepatic bile ducts, and together with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), constitute the majority of primary liver cancers. ICC is a rare disorder as its overall incidence is TP53, KRAS, BAP1, ARID1A, IDH1, IDH2, and novel FGFR2 fusion genes. Yet, there are no major driver genes with immediate clinical solutions characterized. Interestingly, recent studies utilized multi-omics data to classify ICC into two main subgroups, one with immune response genes as the main driving factor, while another is enriched with driver mutations in the genes associated with epigenetic regulations, such as IDH1 and IDH2. The two subgroups also show different hypermethylation patterns in the promoter regions. Additionally, the immune response induced by host-pathogen interactions, i.e., liver fluke infection, may further stimulate tumor growth through alterations of the tumor microenvironment. For in-depth functional studies, although many ICC cell lines have been globally established, these homogeneous cell lines may not fully explain the highly heterogeneous genetic contents of this disorder. Therefore, the advent of patient-derived xenograft and 3D patient-derived organoids as new disease models together with the understanding of evolution and genetic alterations of tumor cells at the single-cell resolution will likely become the main focus to fill the current translational research gaps of ICC in the future.
