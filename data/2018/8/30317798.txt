Hepatitis B remains a worldwide health problem with a high mortality rate associated with end-stage liver diseases. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease and Child-Pugh score is still widely used as the prognostic model for liver cirrhosis and inflammatory reaction, B-type natriuretic peptide and portal vein thrombosis are independent risk factors. Many new models have been proposed for liver failure, including a new model HINAT ACLF. HINAT ACLF is better than its preceding models and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is a single factor to promote thyroid hormone, cholinesterase, and antiviral treatment response in this model. HBV DNA is frequently involved in the predictive model of liver cancer, but with widespread use of antiviral drugs, the value of its long-term prognostication has gradually reduced. Therefore, liver stiffness value instead of HBV DNA shows apparent advantages in mREACH-B. ALBI has good median survival prediction value for hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Alpha-fetoprotein and staging method, which is based on tumor number and size, are still independent risk factors for liver cancer.
