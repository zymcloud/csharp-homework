The work reports the facile synthesis of novel α-aminophosphonate derivatives coupled with indole-2,3-dione moieties, namely the diethyl(substituted phenyl/heteroaryl)(2-(2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)hydrazinyl)methylphosphonates derivatives 4(a⁻n). One-pot three component Kabachnik-Fields reactions were used to synthesize these derivatives. The reaction was carried out at room temperature by stirring in presence of ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) as a green catalyst. The structures of the synthesized compounds were established by spectral studies. The synthesized derivatives 4(a⁻n) were evaluated for their in vitro anticancer activity against six human cancer cell lines by the SRB assay method. The cancer cell lines used in this research work are SK-MEL-2 (melanoma), MCF-7 (breast cancer), IMR-32 (neuroblastoma) MG-63 (human osteosarcoma), HT-29 (human colon cancer) and Hep-G2 (human hepatoma). All the synthesized derivatives inhibited the cell proliferation. Importantly, all the target compounds showed no cytotoxicity towards normal tissue cells (GI50 > 250 µM). A docking study was performed to predict the mode of action. Docking results indicate that the compounds have good binding with the enzyme tyrosine kinase as well as with microtubules, which makes them dual inhibitors. The result of in-silico bioavailability studies suggests that the compounds from the present series have good oral drug-like properties and are non-toxic in nature. In vivo acute oral toxicity study results indicate that the compounds can be considered safe, and therefore could be developed in the future as good anticancer agents or as leads for the design and synthesis of novel anticancer agents.
