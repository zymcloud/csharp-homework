Objective:This study aimed to assess whether a single dose of ertapenem prophylaxis was more effective than other antibiotics to prevent surgical site infection (SSI) after selective hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The data from HCC patients with open hepatectomy between January 2012 and June 2017 in Shengjing Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. These patients were divided into two groups: ertapenem (ER) group, where a single dose of ER was administered; non-ertapenem (NER) group, where NER antibiotics were administered. The SSI rates were compared between two groups before and after matching the propensity scores.Results:The enrolled patients consisted of 78 in the ER group and 197 in the NER group. After matching the propensity scores, each group was down-selected to 65 patients. The SSI rate among the matched 130 patients was 14.6%, 7.7% occurred in the ER group and 21.5% in the NER group (P<0.05). The SSI rates in organ/space of the ER and NER groups were 3.1% and 13.8%, respectively (P<0.05).Conclusions:A single dose of ER before surgery was more effective in mitigating SSI after selective hepatectomy compared with other antibiotics use. The results imply that the selection of both antibiotics and administration timing is important for the efficacy in preventing SSI.
