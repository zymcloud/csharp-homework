Fluorescent carbon nanoparticles (FCNPs) have been deeply researched and widely applied in recent years due to their good optics performance, chemical stability and biocompatibility. Herein, a green and rapid microwave-assisted solid-phase synthesis (solvent-free) approach was proposed for the fabrication of highly FCNPs in a very short period of time, 4 min. The as-prepared FCNPs can emit a blue emission with quantum yield of up to 63.2% in water solution and show yellow fluorescence in the solid state. The FCNPs also exhibit special solvent effect that the fluorescence emission can be adjusted by controlling the solvent ratio of ethanol and water. Most importantly, the FCNPs possess a narrow-range pH response. The probe responds linearly and rapidly to minor pH fluctuations within the range of 3.47-5.10 and the correlation coefficient is above 0.99. The proposed FCNPs also exhibit high photostability and reusability. As expected, the cell imaging and intracellular pH monitoring was achieved successfully in living SMMC 7721 hepatoma cells by this probe. The FCNPs is promising as a convenient and general fluorescent pH sensor for bioimaging applications.
