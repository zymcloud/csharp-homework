Here we summarize new European recommendations for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the main form of cancer affecting the liver, usually occurring in the context of underlying liver disease. Screening for HCC by bi-annual ultrasound is indicated in most cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients. The detection of a new hepatic lesion should raise the suspicion of HCC, especially in cirrhotic subjects. The diagnostic and therapeutic management of HCC is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach.
