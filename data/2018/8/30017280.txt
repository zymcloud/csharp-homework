Purpose:To investigate the value of third-generation dual-source dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) iodine quantification to distinguish hepatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in non-cirrhotic liver parenchyma.Material and methods:Forty-six patients (mean age, 64.9 Â± 10.1 years; 28 male and 18 female) with either hepatic NET metastasis or HCC, who had undergone liver DECT, were included in this retrospective study. For each lesion, arterial-phase attenuation values and DECT quantitative parameters, including iodine uptake, fat fraction, normalized iodine uptake (NIU), and lesion-to-liver-parenchyma ratio (LPR) were evaluated. Available cumulative data from histopathology, MRI, PET/CT, or interval imaging follow-up served as the reference standard for all liver lesions. In addition, the diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced and material decomposition analysis for the differentiation of hepatic NET metastasis and HCC was assessed using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis.Results:Hepatic NET metastasis and HCC showed significant differences in arterial attenuation (P = 0.003), iodine uptake (P Conclusion:Third-generation DECT with assessment of iodine uptake improves the differentiation of hepatic NET metastasis and HCC in non-cirrhotic liver, with NIU showing the strongest diagnostic performance.
