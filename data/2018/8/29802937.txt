Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the major causes of cancer related death globally. Apigenin, a dietary flavonoid, possesses anti-tumor activity against HCC cells in-vitro. Development, physicochemical characterization of apigenin loaded nanoparticles (ApNp), biodistribution pattern and pharmacokinetic parameters of apigenin upon intravenous administration of ApNp, and effect of ApNp treatment in rats with HCC were investigated. Apigenin loaded nanoparticles had a sustained drug release pattern and successfully reached the hepatic cancer cells in-vitro as well as in liver of carcinogenic animals. ApNp predominantly delayed the progress of HCC in chemical induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rats. Quantification of apigenin by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) showed that apigenin availability significantly increased in blood and liver upon ApNp treatment. Apigenin loaded nanoparticle delivery substantially controlled the severity of hepatocellular carcinoma and could be a future hope for lingering the survival in hepatic cancer patients.
