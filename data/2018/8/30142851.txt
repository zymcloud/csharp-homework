Background:The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes between patients with preoperative cholangitis and noncholangitis patients to determine whether the preoperative cholangitis would be able to serve as an independent predictive factor on hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCC) outcomes.Methods:A systematic literature search for reported preoperative cholangitis in patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma was performed in 4 databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, published from 1979 to 2017.Results:In total, the initial search identified 1228 articles. Of these studies only 9 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this analysis. Differences between preoperative cholangitis existing and noncholangitis patients were observed in terms of mortality (RR = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.48-3.52; P = .0002), overall morbidity (RR = 1.15;95% CI = 1.00-1.32; P = .04), Liver failure (RR = 1.15;95% CI = 1.00-1.32; P = .04), Infection (RR = 1.52;95% CI = 1.16-2.00; P = .003), sepsis (RR = 2.40;95% CI = 1.25-4.5; P = .008).Conclusions:The results lend support to the notion that in hilar cholangiocarcinoma patients, the existence of preoperative cholangitis is statistically associated with the higher postoperative mortality and morbidity. Also that it increases the risk of liver failure and infection. therefore, it is very important to properly control the preoperative cholangitis before surgery.
