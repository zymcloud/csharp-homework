Chronic viral hepatitis types B and C may eventually lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Although hepatitis B is readily preventable by vaccination, there is growing evidence that antiviral therapy directed against hepatitis B may reduce the risk of liver cancer among those already infected. There is no vaccine against hepatitis C, but the evidence is now strong that antiviral therapy with sustained virological response (viral cure) reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.
