Background:The liver hanging maneuver during right hepatectomy is a useful technique for parenchymal transection. The laparoscopic caudal approach is totally different from the laparoscopic ventral approach because of the direction of parenchymal transection. There are differences in the application and effectiveness of liver hanging maneuver between two approaches. This study evaluated the surgical techniques and outcomes of the ventral approach comparison with the caudal approach in laparoscopic right hemihepatectomy using liver hanging maneuver.Methods:From February 2013 to February 2018, 16 patients underwent laparoscopic right hepatectomy using liver hanging maneuver. The caudal approach was used in 10 patients and the ventral approach in six. We adopted a different avascular plane located between the right adrenal gland and the vena cava for the hanging tape placement. In the caudal approach, the liver parenchyma were transected from the caudal to cranial side, pulling the hanging tape caudally. In the ventral approach, the parenchyma were transected from the ventral to the dorsal side, pulling the hanging tape superiorly.Results:The clinical data and patient characteristics of both groups were similar. The median operation time was comparable between the two groups (275 vs. 278 min, p = 0.958). The median blood loss was significantly lower using the ventral approach group than the caudal approach group (375 vs. 190 ml, p = 0.016). The difference in median postoperative hospital stay was not statistically significant (9 vs. 8 days, p = 0.713).Conclusion:This ventral approach with liver hanging maneuver is a feasible and useful technique for laparoscopic right hemihepatectomy.
