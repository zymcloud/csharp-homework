Background:Clinical implication of disappearing liver metastases (DLMs) from colorectal cancer after chemotherapy needs to be reviewed in the era of modern imaging studies.Methods:Between 2010 and 2015, 184 patients underwent curative hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases following preoperative chemotherapy. The sites of metastases detected on pre-chemotherapy CE-CT were examined post-chemotherapy using CE-CT, gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI), and contrast-enhanced intraoperative ultrasonography (CE-IOUS). DLMs were defined as tumors that disappeared on CE-CT post chemotherapy. The detection rate of DLMs with EOB-MRI and CE-IOUS were assessed, and the outcome of DLMs resected and those left in place were reviewed.Results:A total of 275 DLMs were noted in 59 patients. On EOB-MRI, 71 lesions (26%) were visible and were resected, 92% (65/71) of which contained viable disease. Using CE-IOUS, an additional 94 lesions were identified. A total of 165 DLMs (60%) were identified and resected by sequential use of EOB-MRI and CE-IOUS, 77% (127/165) of which contained viable disease. Of 110 DLMs not identified, 68 were resected, 4% (3/68) of which contained viable disease. Among 42 lesions left in place, 6 (14%) recurred during the median follow-up period of 27 (9-72) months.Discussion:EOB-MRI and CE-IOUS exploration identified clinically relevant DLMs containing viable disease with a high level of accuracy.
