Aims:To determine if Metadherin (MTDH) expression levels are positively correlated with the clinical stage of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) based on MTDH being highly expressed in other type of tumors including melanoma, malignant glioma, breast cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, we investigated the pathologic significance of MTDH and its potential in predicting DLBCL outcomes.Materials and methods:Tissue samples from 50 patients with DLBCL and 22 patients with lymph node reactive hyperplasia were collected and evaluated using immunohistochemical staining, microscopy, and western blotting. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model were used for survival analysis of patients.Results:Our results show that the overexpression of the MTDH protein in tissues was observed in 66% of patients with DLBCL, whereas it was not overexpressed in the patients with reactive hyperplastic lymph nodes. While there was no correlation between MTDH overexpression with age, sex, presence of B symptoms, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in patients with DLBCL, this parameter was positively correlated with clinical stages. Moreover, MTDH-negative patients had significantly better prognoses compared with the MTDH-positive patients.Conclusion:Our preliminary study indicates that MTDH may play an important role in the development of DLBCL, and that MTDH overexpression is potentially associated with the clinical progression of DLBCL. In addition, high expression levels of MTDH in tissues was correlated with a poorer prognosis for patients with DLBCL. As such, MTDH may be a potential therapeutic target for specific therapy. However, research on a larger group of patients is needed to verify these preliminary results.
