Naphthalene has been used worldwide as a commercial insecticide for decades, which when detected in the environment can have various negative effects on non-target organism, such as hepatotoxicity. However, the molecular mechanisms of how naphthalene acts to affect the liver in zebrafish (Danio rerio) remains unknown. In this study, we evaluated the potential toxic effects of naphthalene on livers in female adult zebrafish over a 21-day subacute exposure. Global hepatic gene expression was examined by microarrays and the results indicated the regulated genes were associated significantly with vital hepatic injury pathways and GO categories upon naphthalene exposure, such as disruptions in lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, and the carcinogenic processes. According to our observations of liver histology, nuclear enlargement as a potential indicator of cancers and hepatic lipometabolic disorder precisely were supported. The 96 h acute naphthalene tests on Tg(lysC:DsRed) and LiPan lines larvae revealed recruitment of neutrophils by the liver, as well as decreased liver size, which further confirmed hepatic inflammation response to naphthalene exposure. Thus, these findings advance the field of ecotoxicology by unveiling a new role of naphthalene as a leading cause of liver damage and provide potential biomarker-genes for environmental naphthalene monitoring.
