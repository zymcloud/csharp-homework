The standard of care for early hepatobiliary cancers (HBC) includes surgical resection. Liver transplantations or locoregional therapies are beneficial in early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) under certain circumstances. Systemic treatments have some benefit in advanced HBC, though long-term prognosis remains poor. We evaluated the role of oncolytic viruses in the treatment of HBCs through a systematic literature review. The recombinant vaccinia virus JX-594 improved median survival in patients with local/metastatic HCC more strongly at high dose than at low dose (14.1 vs 6.7 months; p = 0.08) in a Phase II study. A Phase III study with JX-594 and sorafenib in advanced HCC is ongoing. No survival benefit in HCC was seen with two other recombinant adenoviruses (Ad-TK and DL1520). Several preclinical trials using oncolytic viruses in HBC showed promising results, warranting clinical studies.
