Background:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is strongly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma due to the main pathogenic X protein of HBV (HBx). Whether HBV infection and the HBx protein could result in macular degeneration (MD) is not known. The aim of this study is to assess the association and underlying mechanisms between HBV infection and MD.Methods:The National Health Research Institutes in Taiwan built a large database, the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), which includes the claims data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) program. The Taiwan NHI is a single-payer, compulsory health insurance program for Taiwan citizens. The data for the present study were derived from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database, which contains the claims data of 1 million insured people within the NHIRD, including beneficiary registration, inpatient and outpatient files, drug use, and other medical services. In this study, we first investigated the association of HBV infection and the risk of MD by a population-based cohorts study enrolling 39,796 HBV-infected patients and 159,184 non-HBV-infected patients.Results:After adjustment of age, sex, and comorbidities, the risk of MD was significantly higher in the HBV-infected cohort than in the non-HBV-infected cohort (adjusted HR = 1.31; 95% CI = 1.17-1.46). In vitro, we provided evidence to demonstrate that overexpression of HBx in the human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell line, ARPE19, significantly reduced cell viability and clonogenic survival upon UV and blue light irradiation. By gene microarray analysis, we further showed that almost all genes in DNA repair pathways including base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, and homologous recombination were significantly down-regulated in the UV-induced cell death of HBx-transfected ARPE19 cells.Conclusions:The HBx protein may sensitize RPE cells to UV and blue light irradiation and increase the risk of HBV-infection-associated MD through down-regulation of multiple DNA repair pathways.
