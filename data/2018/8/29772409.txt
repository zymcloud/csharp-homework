The liver is the largest lymph producing organ. A significant increase in the number of hepatic lymphatic vessels, or lymphangiogenesis, has been reported in various liver diseases, including, but not limited to, cirrhosis, viral hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite its apparent relevance in healthy and diseased livers as these and other observations indicate, the hepatic lymphatic system has been poorly studied. With knowledge of the lymphatic system in other organs and tissues incorporated, this review article addresses the current knowledge of the hepatic lymphatic system and the potential role of lymphatic endothelial cells in the health and the disease of the liver and concludes with a brief description on future directions of the study of the hepatic lymphatic system.
