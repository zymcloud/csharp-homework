MicroRNA (miR)‑30a‑5p has been reported to suppress the progression of hepatocellular cancer, renal cell carcinoma, oral cancer and gastric cancer. However, whether miR‑30a‑5p is involved in the regulation of melanoma remains unclear. The present study revealed that miR‑30a‑5p was downregulated in melanoma tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR‑30a‑5p significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of melanoma cells in vitro. In addition, ectopic expression of miR‑30a‑5p delayed tumor growth in vivo. In terms of mechanism, miR‑30a‑5p targeted sex determining region Y‑box 4 (SOX4) and impeded the expression of SOX4 in melanoma cells. In addition, SOX4 was upregulated in melanoma tissues and cell lines when compared with normal tissues or cells. Furthermore, overexpression of SOX4 significantly rescued the proliferation, migration and invasion of melanoma cells transfected with miR‑30a‑5p mimics. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrated that miR‑30a‑5p suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of melanoma cells in SOX4‑dependent manner.
