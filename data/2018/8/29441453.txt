The inflammatory environment and existence of cancer stem cells are critical for progression and intrahepatic recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative resections. Here, we investigated the prognostic significance of combining high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expression and hepatic progenitor marker OV6 in hepatocellular carcinoma. Expression of HMGB1 and OV6 was evaluated using immunohistochemistry profiling in tissue microarrays containing samples from 208 HCC patients. Invasive clinical or pathological factors were found in patients with high expression of HMGB1 or OV6. Higher HMGB1 was associated with poorer clinical outcomes, and independently related to elevated 5-year recurrence incidence (85.5% vs. 62.4%, P2=0.032, P<0.001) and reversely related to HCC outcomes. Abnormal expression of HMGB1 in combination with positive staining of OV6 displayed poorer prognostic performance than single biomarker alone (area under curve (AUC) survival=0.696). Therefore, HMGB1 and OV6 positive staining are promising prognostic parameters for HCC, and we propose that HMGB1 and OV6 may cooperate with each other and predict poor prognosis of HCC.
