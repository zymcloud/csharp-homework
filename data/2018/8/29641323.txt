Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a hereditary liver disease caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 serine protease inhibitor gene. Most severe patients are homozygous for PiZ alleles (PiZZ; amino acid E324K), which lead to protein aggregates in hepatocytes and reduced circulating levels of AAT. The liver aggregates typically lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and the reduced circulating AAT levels can lead to emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. In this study, two CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing approaches were used to decrease liver aggregates and increase systemic AAT-M levels in the PiZ transgenic mouse. In the first approach, AAT expression in hepatocytes was reduced more than 98% following the systemic delivery of AAV8-CRISPR targeting exon 2 of hSERPINA1, leading to reduced aggregates in hepatocytes. In the second approach, a second adeno-associated virus, which provided the donor template to correct the Z mutation, was also administered. These treated mice had reduced AAT expression (> 98%) and a low level (5%) of wildtype AAT-M mRNA. Taken together, this study shows that CRISPR gene editing can efficiently reduce liver expression of AAT-Z and restore modest levels of wildtype AAT-M in a mouse model of AATD, raising the possibility of CRISPR gene editing therapeutic for AATD.
