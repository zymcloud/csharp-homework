A variety of vascular liver disorders can induce hepatocellular tumors. They may be related to portal venous deprivation, venous outflow obstruction, or arterial diseases. Their common feature is an imbalance between hepatic arterial and portal venous blood flow leading to an increased hepatic arterial inflow. Consequently, hepatocellular tumors may arise, most commonly focal nodular hyperplasia-like lesions but hepatocellular adenomas and hepatocellular carcinoma may be seen as well. This article will review the most common vascular liver diseases associated with hepatocellular nodules (Budd-Chiari syndrome, congenital portosystemic shunt, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and portal cavernoma). For each condition, imaging findings will be described as well as the differential diagnosis and the diagnostic clues.
