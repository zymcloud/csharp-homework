Objectives:Regional therapy for metastatic melanoma to the liver represents an alternative to systemic therapy. Hepatic progression-free survival (HPFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated.Materials and methods:A retrospective review of patients with liver metastases from cutaneous or uveal melanoma treated with yttrium-90 (Y90), chemoembolization (CE), or percutaneous hepatic perfusion (PHP) was conducted.Results:Thirty patients (6 Y90, 10 PHP, 12 CE, 1 PHP then Y90, 1 CE then PHP) were included. Multivariate analysis showed improved HPFS for PHP versus Y90 (P=0.004), PHP versus CE (P=0.02) but not for CE versus Y90. PFS was also significantly different: Y90 (54 d), CE (52 d), PHP (245 d), P=0.03. PHP treatment and lower tumor burden were significant predictors of prolonged PFS on multivariate analysis. Median OS from time of treatment was longest, but not significant, for PHP at 608 days versus Y90 (295 d) and CE (265 d), P=0.24. Only PHP treatment versus Y90 and lower tumor burden had improved OS on multivariate analysis (P=0.03, 0.03, respectively).Conclusions:HPFS and PFS were significantly prolonged in patients treated with PHP versus CE or Y90. Median OS in PHP patients was over double that seen in Y90 or CE patients but was significant only between PHP and Y90.
