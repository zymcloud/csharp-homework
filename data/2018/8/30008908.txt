The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7), gremlin, and p-Smad/1/5/8 in carcinomatous and para-carcinoma tissue specimens from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The association of serum BMP-7 levels with clinicopathological parameters was examined to assess its relevance as a clinical biomarker for HCC. A total of 27 patients with HCC and 7 healthy subjects were included. Gene expression levels of BMP-7 and p-Smad1/5/8 were examined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemical and western blot analysis were performed to determine the protein expression of target genes. The serum levels of BMP-7 were assessed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA and protein expression of BMP-7 and gremlin were significantly down- and upregulated in HCC tumor tissues, respectively, compared with para-carcinoma tissues (P
