Over the past 30 years, the incidence in of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the United States has tripled, largely due to untreated chronic Hepatitis C virus, alcoholic hepatitis, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Additionally, the incidence of HCC among South Texas Hispanics is higher than elsewhere in the United States. The median age of HCC is 62 years in United States and 67 years in South Texas, with over 30% being 70 years of age or older. However, there is limited data on how to treat older adults with advanced HCC. In this review, we will discuss treatment options for older adults with advanced HCC, further emphasizing the need for prospective studies in this population.
