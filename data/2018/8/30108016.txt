Background:Accumulating evidence demonstrates that microRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in tumorigenesis and cancer progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Average targets of a miRNA were more than 100. And one miRNA may act in tumor via regulating several targets. The present study aimed to explore more potential targets of miR-449a by proteomics technology and further uncover the role of miR-449a in HCC tumorigenesis.Methods:Technologies such as iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic were used to investigate the effect of miR-449a on HCC. The expression of c-Met and miR-449a was detected by qRT-PCR in HCC samples. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed to identify the function and potential target of miR-449a in HCC cells.Results:In HCC, miR-449a was significantly downregulated, while c-Met was upregulated concurrently. Quantitative proteomics and luciferase reporter assay identified c-Met as a direct target of miR-449a. Moreover, miR-449a inhibited HCC growth not only by targeting CDK6 but also by suppressing c-Met/Ras/Raf/ERK signaling pathway. Furthermore, the inhibition of c-Met expression with a specific siRNA significantly inhibited cells growth and deregulated the ERK pathway in HCC.Conclusion:The tumor suppressor miR-449a suppresses HCC tumorigenesis by repressing the c-Met/ERK pathway.
