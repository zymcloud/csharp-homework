Background:The aim of this study was to analyze long-term clinical and oncologic outcomes in patients with early-stage adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG) managed with either endoscopic resection (ER) or surgery.Methods:The inclusion criteria were AEG, meeting classic or expanded indications for ER of early gastric cancer, and complete resection. A total of 66 patients with Siewert type II AEG were included (ER group, n = 38; vs. surgery group, n = 28).Results:The mean age of the ER group was greater than that of the surgery group (mean ± SD, 66.9 ± 9.7 vs. 58.5 ± 10.4 years, respectively; p = 0.001). Compared to the ER group, macroscopically flat or depressed-type lesions were more common (47.4 vs. 89.3%; p = 0.001), and mean lesion size was larger in the surgery group (13.3 ± 8.4 vs. 18.6 ± 11.0 mm; p = 0.039). One intensive care unit admission and subsequent surgery-related death occurred in the surgery group (1/28 vs. 0/38 in the ER group; p = 0.424). During follow-up, recurrence was detected in both groups (4/38 vs. 1/28; p = 0.385). Overall survival and 5-year disease-free survival did not differ between the groups (93.3 vs. 92.9%; p = 0.282 and 88.0 vs. 100.0%; p = 0.066).Conclusions:Once complete resection is achieved in patients with AEG who met the expanded criteria for endoscopic submucosal dissection of gastric cancer, there was no significant difference in clinical outcomes between ER and surgery.
