The formation of paraspeckle, a stress-induced nuclear body, increases in response to viral infection or proinflammatory stimuli. Paraspeckle consists of lncRNA (nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1, NEAT1) and protein components including NONO, SFPQ, PSPC1, etc., which are shown to be involved in viral infection and cancer. Both NEAT1 and NONO expression increase in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples according to TCGA data. However, the role of paraspeckle in HCC progression needs further identification. IL-6 signaling is well known to contribute to HCC progression. Here we reported that IL-6 signaling increased paraspeckle formation in HCC cells. Destruction of paraspeckle formation by silencing the paraspeckle essential components NEAT1_2 or NONO could suppress IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in HCC cells, and consequently repressed IL-6-promoted in vitro HCC cell invasion, cell cycle progression and survival. Mechanistically, paraspeckle promotes IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation by binding and trapping peroxiredoxin-5 (PRDX5) mRNA in nucleus, decreasing protein level of PRDX5 which can directly interact with STAT3 and inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation. Besides, glutathione S-transferase P (GSTP1) protein, which inhibits DNA damage and apoptosis through its detoxification and anti-oxidation function, was also trapped within paraspeckles under IL-6 stimulation. Paraspeckle-trapping of both PRDX5 mRNA and GSTP1 protein contributes to IL-6-increased DNA damage in HCC cells. Our results demonstrate that paraspeckle can nuclear entrap the inhibitors of IL-6/STAT3 signaling as well as DNA damage, and then strengthen the promoting effect on HCC progression by IL-6. Therefore, paraspeckle contributes to the inflammation-related HCC progression and might be a potential therapeutic target for HCC.
