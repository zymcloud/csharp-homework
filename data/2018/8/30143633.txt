There exists an urgent medical demand at present to develop therapeutic strategies which can improve the treatment outcome of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we explore the biological functions and clinical significance of PBOV1 in HCC in order to push forward the diagnosis and treatment of HCC. Using theranostical nanomedicines, PBOV1 is verified to be a key oncogene which greatly promotes HCC proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and stemness by activating the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway. Therefore, single-chain antibody for epidermal growth factor receptor (scAb-EGFR)-targeted nanomedicine effectively silencing the PBOV1 gene exhibits potent anticancer effects. In vivo HCC-targeting siRNA delivery mediated by the theranostical nanomedicine remarkably inhibits the tumor growth and metastasis. In addition, the superparamagnetic iron oxide nanocrystals (SPION)-encapsulated nanomedicines possess high MRI detection sensitivity, which endows them with the potential for MRI diagnosis of HCC. This study shows that PBOV1 represents a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.
