Objective:The purpose of this study is to identify points useful in the imaging differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) showing hyperintensity on the hepatobiliary phase of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI and focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and FNH-like nodules.Materials and methods:We enrolled consecutive 51 pathologically diagnosed HCCs that were hyperintense on hepatobiliary phase imaging (47 patients, including 44 with cirrhosis) and 10 FNHs and eight FNH-like nodules (16 patients, including five with cirrhosis). Imaging findings of dynamic CT and gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI were assessed by two radiologists and compared between HCC and FNH.Results:The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was lower in hyperintense HCC than in FNH (p = 0.004). The enhancement patterns of hyperintense HCC and FNH at dynamic CT were significantly different (p Conclusion:For the diagnosis of hyperintense HCC differentiated from FNH and FNH-like nodule, arterial phase enhancement and washout pattern at dynamic CT and decrease of ADC ratio would be important findings.
