Background:5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) has been widely applied to treat various types of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, primary or acquired 5-FU resistance prevents the clinical application of this drug in cancer therapy. Herein, our study is the first to demonstrate that lower expression of KRAL, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), mediates 5-FU resistance in HCC via the miR-141/Keap1 axis.Methods:Cell proliferation assays, western blot analysis, qRT-PCR, the dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation were performed to investigate the mechanisms by which KRAL mediates 5-fluorouracil resistance in HCC cell lines.Results:The quantitative analysis indicated that KRAL and Keap1 were significantly decreased and that Nrf2 was increased in HepG2/5-FU and SMMC-7721/5-FU cells compared with the corresponding expression levels in the respective parental cells. Overexpression of KRAL increased Keap1 expression, and inactivating the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant pathway could reverse the resistance of HepG2/5-FU and SMMC-7721/5-FU cells to 5-FU. Moreover, KRAL functioned as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by effectively binding to the common miR-141 and then restoring Keap1 expression. These findings demonstrated that KRAL is an important regulator of Keap1; furthermore, the ceRNA network involving KRAL may serve as a treatment strategy against 5-FU resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.Conclusions:KRAL/miR-141/Keap1 axis mediates 5-fluorouracil resistance in HCC cell lines.
