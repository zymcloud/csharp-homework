Although biopsy is one of the most important methods for diagnosis in diseases, there is ambiguity based on the information obtained from the visual inspection of tissue slices. Here, we studied the effect of external extension on tissue slices from mouse liver with different stages of disease: Healthy normal state, Simple steatosis, Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and Hepatocellular carcinoma. We found that the cracking pattern of a tissue slice caused by extension can provide useful information for distinguishing among the disease states. Interestingly, slices with Hepatocellular carcinoma showed a fine roughening on the cracking pattern with a characteristic length of the size of cells, which is much different than the cracking pattern for slices with non-cancerous steatosis, for which the cracks were relatively straight. The significant difference in the cracking pattern depending on the disease state is attributable to a difference in the strength of cell-cell adhesion, which would be very weak under carcinosis. As it is well known that the manner of cell-cell adhesion neatly concerns with the symptoms in many diseases, it may be promising to apply the proposed methodology to the diagnosis of other diseases.
