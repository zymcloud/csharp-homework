In this study, an intelligent and label-free sensor is utilized for the first time to one-spot simultaneous detection hepatocellular carcinoma markers AFP and miRNA-122 by a resonance light scattering (RLS) sensor. cDNA1 hybridizes with cDNA2 to form double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The construction of dsDNA and methyl violet is used to form the RLS sensor via the electronic interaction. When AFP or miRNA-122 is present, the cDNA (cDNA1 or cDNA2) can bindings of target, thereby RLS intensity changed proportionally with the concentration of AFP or that of miRNA-122. The detection limits of AFP and miRNA-122 are 0.94 μg/L and 98 pM respectively, and their good linear which ranges from 5 to 100 μg/L and 200 pM to 10 nM are achieved using the assay. In the presence of miRNA-122 and AFP mixtures, AFP bound to the AFP aptamer to increase the RLS signal, and miRNA-122 bound to the miRNA-122 complementary strand to decrease the RLS signal. The RLS signal changed in response to changing AFP and miRNA-122 concentrations, so that one-spot simultaneous detection of alpha fetal protein and miRNA-122 is achieved. This method has potential practical applications in the research of hepatocellular carcinoma.
