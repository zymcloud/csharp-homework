In this study, the anthocyanin from Lonicera caerulea 'Beilei' fruit (ABL) was extracted and purified. The purified component (ABL-2) was then evaluated for its anti-tumor properties on human hepatoma cells (SMMC-7721) in vitro and the murine hepatoma cells (H22) in vivo. In vitro, ABL-2 not only significantly inhibited the growth of SMMC-7721 cells, but also remarkably blocked the cells' cycle in G2/M phase, inducing DNA damage and eventually leading to apoptosis. In vivo, ABL also killed tumor cells, inhibited tumor growth, and improved the survival status of H22 tumor-bearing mice. These effects were associated with an increase in the activities of antioxidase and a decrease in the level of lipid peroxidation, as evidenced by changes in SOD, GSH-Px, GSH, and MDA levels. In addition, ABL-2 also regulated the levels of immune cytokines including IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α. These results revealed that ABL-2 exerts an effective anti-tumor effect by dynamically adjusting the REDOX balance and improving the immunoregulatory activity of H22 tumor-bearing mice. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed that cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside (8.16 mg/g), cyanidin-3-glucoside (387.60 mg/g), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (23.62 mg/g), and peonidin-3-glucoside (22.20 mg/g) were the main components in ABL-2, which may contribute to its anti-tumor activity.
