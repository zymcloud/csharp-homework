The interplay between hepatitis B (HBV) and delta (HDV) viruses is complex and not always characterized during chronic HDV infection. We assessed the clinical usefulness of new quantitative assays for HBV and HDV serum markers in a retrospective cross-sectional study. Sera obtained from 122 HDV genotype 1 and HBV genotype D coinfected, anti-HIV-negative patients (71 males; median age 49.8 [21.7-66.9] years), recruited consecutively in two geographical areas (Italy 69 patients, Romania 53 patients) with different HBV and HDV epidemiology, were tested for HBsAg, HBV-DNA, HBcrAg, total anti-HBc, HDV-RNA, IgM and total anti-HDV using quantitative assays. Cirrhosis, which showed comparable prevalence in the two cohorts, was diagnosed in 97 of 122 (79.5%) patients. At multivariate analysis, cirrhosis was associated with lower total anti-HBc/IgM anti-HDV ratio (OR 0.990, 95% CI 0.981-0.999, P = .038), whereas disease activity was associated with higher total anti-HDV (OR 10.105, 95% CI 1.671-61.107, P = .012) and HDV-RNA levels (OR 2.366, 95% CI 1.456-3.844, P = .001). HDV-RNA serum levels showed a positive correlation with HBV-DNA (ρ = 0.276, P = .005), HBsAg (ρ = 0.404, P < .001) and HBcrAg (ρ = 0.332, P < .001). The combined quantitative profiling of HBV and HDV serum markers identifies specific patterns associated with activity and stage of chronic hepatitis D (CHD). HDV pathogenicity depends on the underlying active HBV infection in spite of the inhibition of its replication. HDV-RNA, IgM anti-HDV, total anti-HDV, total anti-HBc, HBsAg and HBcrAg serum levels qualify for prospective studies to predict progressive CHD and identify candidates to antiviral therapy.
