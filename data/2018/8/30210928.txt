Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase type II (IMPDH2) has been found to play critical roles in the development and progression of several human cancers. However, the expression of IMPDH2 and its clinical significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is little known. The expression of IMPDH2 in HCC cell lines and tissues were evaluated by Western blotting (WB), quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). We found that the expression of IMPDH2 was significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues than in adjacent non-tumorous tissues, and this was correlated with several clinicopathological features, including tumor multiplicity (P=0.001), TNM stage (Pin vitro, by promoting cell growth rate, colony formation. Together, our results demonstrated that the over-expression of IMPDH2 was closely associated with poor survival outcome in patients with HCC and may present a novel prognostic and therapeutic target for this disease.
