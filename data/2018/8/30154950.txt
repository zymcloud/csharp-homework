Some iron chelators display significant anticancer activity that may involve ferritin degradation either in proteasomes or in lysosomes, and the latter might involve ferritinophagy with a period. However, the correlation of ferritinophagy with anticancer activity of iron chelator was not fully determined. Revealing the underlying link therefore is required. Di-2-pyridylketone dithiocarbamate (DpdtC), a novel iron chelator, could mobilize iron from ferritin and displayed excellent antitumor against hepatoma carcinoma cell lines (IC50s = 0.4 ± 0.2 for HepG2 and 3.5 ± 0.3 μM for Bel-7402, resp.); we speculated that the antiproliferative action of DpdtC might involve ferritinophagy. To this end, the alterations of ferritin, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3-II), and nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) were investigated after exposure of DpdtC to the cells. The results revealed that DpdtC could cause increases of autophagic vacuoles and LC3-II. The data from cellular immunofluorescence and Western blotting showed a reciprocal relation between abundances of ferritin and LC3-II, but the trends of NCOA4 and LC3-II in abundance were in a similar manner, indicating that a ferritinophagy occurred. Further studies revealed that the ferritinophagy evoked an iron-driven intralysosomal oxidative reaction, resulting in LMP change and lipid peroxidation. Thus, a ferritinophagy-mediated lysosomal ROS generation playing a role in the antiproliferative action of DpdtC could be proposed, which will enrich our knowledge of iron chelator in cancer therapy.
