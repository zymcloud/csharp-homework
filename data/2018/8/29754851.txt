Purpose:To evaluate the safety and efficacy of iodine-125 (125I) seed strand implantation in combination with transarterial chemoembolization for the treatment of hepatitis B-related unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein invasion.Materials and methods:From January 2013 to June 2016, 76 HCC patients with type II tumor thrombus were included in this single-center retrospective study. Twenty patients underwent 125I seed strand implantation combined with transarterial chemoembolization (group A; n = 20), while 56 patients underwent transarterial chemoembolization alone (group B; n = 56). The procedure-related and radiation complications were assessed. Overall survivals were compared by propensity-score analysis.Results:The technique was successfully performed in all patients. The mean intended dose (r = 10 mm; z = 0; 240 days) was 62.6 ± 1.8 Gy. No grade 3 or 4 adverse events related to the procedure occurred in either group. After propensity-score-matching analysis, 19 patients were selected into each group, respectively. In the propensity-matching cohort, the median overall survival time was significantly longer in group A than in the group B (19 pairs; 28.0 ± 2.4 vs 8.7 ± 0.4 mo; P = .001). Treatment strategy, arterioportal shunt, and number of transarterial chemoembolization sessions were significant predictors of favorable overall survival time.Conclusions:125I seed strand implantation combined with transarterial chemoembolization is a safe and effective treatment for HCC patients with portal vein invasion.
