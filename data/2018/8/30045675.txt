Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide; however, the mutational properties of HCC-associated carcinogens remain largely uncharacterized. We hypothesized that mechanisms underlying chemical-induced HCC can be characterized by evaluating the mutational spectra of these tumors. To test this hypothesis, we performed exome sequencing of B6C3F1/N HCCs that arose either spontaneously in vehicle controls ( n = 3) or due to chronic exposure to gingko biloba extract (GBE; n = 4) or methyleugenol (MEG; n = 3). Most archived tumor samples are available as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks, rather than fresh-frozen (FF) samples; hence, exome sequencing from paired FF and FFPE samples was compared. FF and FFPE samples showed 63% to 70% mutation concordance. Multiple known (e.g., Ctnnb1T41A, BrafV637E) and novel (e.g., Erbb4C559S, Card10A700V, and Klf11P358L) mutations in cancer-related genes were identified. The overall mutational burden was greater for MEG than for GBE or spontaneous HCC samples. To characterize the mutagenic mechanisms, we analyzed the mutational spectra in the HCCs according to their trinucleotide motifs. The MEG tumors clustered closest to Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer signatures 4 and 24, which are, respectively, associated with benzo(a)pyrene- and aflatoxin-induced HCCs in humans. These results establish a novel approach for classifying liver carcinogens and understanding the mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinogenesis.
