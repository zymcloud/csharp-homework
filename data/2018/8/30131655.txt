Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global public health concern. HBV causes chronic infection in patients and can lead to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and other severe liver diseases. Thus, understanding HBV-related pathogenesis is of particular importance for prevention and clinical intervention. HBV surface antigens are indispensable for HBV virion formation and are useful viral markers for diagnosis and clinical assessment. During chronic HBV infection, HBV genomes may acquire and accumulate mutations and deletions, leading to the expression of defective HBV surface antigens. These defective HBV surface antigens have been found to play important roles in the progression of HBV-associated liver diseases. In this review, we focus our discussion on the nature of defective HBV surface antigen mutations and their contribution to the pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis B. The relationship between defective surface antigens and occult HBV infection are also discussed.
