An increasing number of studies have demonstrated the function of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the initiation and development of various types of cancer. Among them, miR-425-5p is proven to serve an important function in several types of cancer, including gastric, cervical cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the function of miR-425-5p in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains unclear. In the present study, it was demonstrated that the expression level of miR-425-5p was upregulated in RCC tissues and cell lines compared with normal tissues and cell lines (P
