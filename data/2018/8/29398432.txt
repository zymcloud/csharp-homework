Rationale and objectives:The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of a dual-phase cone-beam computed tomography (DP-CBCT)-based navigation imaging during transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a perspective randomized study.Materials and methods:Forty-two patients with HCC (39 men, 57 ± 9 years, 13 first-time TACE) underwent TACE using three-dimensional image guidance with automatic detection of tumor-feeding vessels computed from DP-CBCT (early and delayed arterial phases). Forty-nine other patients with HCC (44 men, 55 ± 12 years, 14 first-time TACE) were treated conventionally using digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Tumor detectability in DP-CBCT was compared to DSA and preoperative CT or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Tumor-feeding vessel visibility was rated (good, fair, and poor) intraoperatively by the operators. The superselective embolization success rate, the number of DSA acquisitions, fluoroscopy time, and patient radiation dose were collected and compared using paired t test and the Mann-Whitney U test.Results:Tumor detection of DP-CBCT was superior to DSA (100% vs 83%, P = .001) and comparable to CT-MR (96%, P = .456). Tumor and feeder visibilities were significantly enhanced by DP-CBCT (P 2, P = .048).Conclusions:DP-CBCT and navigation imaging improve tumor detectability and superselective embolization in TACE.
