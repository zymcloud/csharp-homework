Objectives:To evaluate the value of CT attenuation to assess the response to sorafenib in infiltrative/endovascular non-measurable advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:From 2007 to 2014, patients with infiltrative HCC ± tumor-in-vein (TIV) were retrospectively included. Attenuation of tumors and TIV were measured at baseline and follow-up on arterial and portal venous phase CT by two independent radiologists. Attenuation changes (overall and as per Choi criteria) and Child-Pugh score were correlated to overall survival.Results:Forty patients were included (38 men, 95%). Attenuation of both the tumors and TIV was significantly lower in follow-up CT than on baseline CT (p = 0.002 (arterial), and p = 0.001 (portal) for tumor, and p = 0.004 (arterial) and p 15% CT HU decrease in the tumor and/or TIV during follow-up.
