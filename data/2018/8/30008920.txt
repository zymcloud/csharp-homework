MicroRNAs (miRs) are an emerging class of non-coding, endogenous and small RNA molecules that serve important functions in tumorigenesis and development. The present study investigated the expression, functions and molecular mechanism underlying miR-205 in hepatocellular carcinoma. miR-205 was downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and cell lines. Ectopic miR-205 expression suppressed hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. In addition, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) was identified as a functional downstream target of miR-205 in hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, knockdown of VEGFA revealed the same functions with miR-205 overexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. These results provided evidence that miR-205 served important functions in the inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma cells growth and metastasis via directly targeting VEGFA, which indicated that miR-205 may have therapeutic value for hepatocellular carcinoma.
