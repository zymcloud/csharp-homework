Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) arising from the neoplastic transformation of cholangiocytes with increasing incidence in the worldwide. Unfortunately, a large amount of CCA patients lost their chance for surgery because it is hard to diagnose in the early stages. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is closely associated with development and progression of various malignant tumors. Hox transcript antisense intergenic (HOTAIR), a negative prognostic factor for patients with gastric, liver and pancreatic carcinoma. Its transcription levels and functional roles in CCA is still unknown. Therefore, we aimed to explore the effect of HOTAIR in CCA including cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The results showed that HOTAIR was highly expressed both in CCA tissue samples and cell lines compared with corresponding normal bile duct tissues and Human intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells (HIBEC). Its overexpression was closely correlated with Tumor size, TNM stage and postoperative recurrence in CCA patients. Moreover, up-regulation of HOTAIR has correlation with prognosis in CCA patients. Knockdown of HOTAIR by siRNAs significantly decreased the migration and invasion but increased apoptosis of CCA cells in vitro. Overall, our study revealed that HOTAIR may play as a new potential therapeutic target and forecast poor prognosis for this fatal disease.
