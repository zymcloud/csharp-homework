Recent evidence has demonstrated that microRNA-19b (miR-19b) is elevated and functions as a prognosis predictor in hepatocellular carcinoma and melanoma. However, its expression and clinical significance in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. The study aimed to identify the correlation between miR-19b expression and the clinicopathological features and prognosis of patients with CRC. In this study, we found that the levels of miR-19b were significantly up-regulated in CRC tissues and cell lines compared with matched adjacent non-cancerous tissues and human colon mucosal epithelial cell lines, and its expression was also increased in patients with lymph node metastasis compared with those patients with no lymph node metastasis. Meanwhile, the patients with distal metastasis have a higher miR-19b expression than those patients with no distal metastasis. The high expression of miR-19b in patients with CRC was associated with lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis. miR-19b expression was an independent prognostic indicator for overall survival of CRC patients. Moreover, patients with a high miR-19b expression have shorter overall survival times than those patients with a low miR-19b expression. In addition, an in vitro functional assay showed that miR-19b knockdown restrained the migration and invasion of HCT116 and SW480 cells. In summary, the study provides the first convincing statistical and experimental evidence that the up-regulation of miR-19b is associated with metastasis and predicts unfavorable prognosis in patients with CRC, suggesting that miR-19b may serve as a novel and promising prognostic biomarker in CRC.
