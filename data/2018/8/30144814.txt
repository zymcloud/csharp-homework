Background:Scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) is a classic high-density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor, which mediates selective lipid uptake from HDL cholesterol esters (HDL-C). Apolipoprotein M (ApoM), as a component of HDL particles, could influence preÎ²-HDL formation and cholesterol efflux. The aim of this study was to determine whether SR-BI deficiency influenced the expression of ApoM.Methods:Blood samples and liver tissues were collected from SR-BI gene knockout mice, and serum lipid parameters, including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C and LDL-C) and ApoM were measured. Hepatic ApoM and ApoAI mRNA levels were also determined. In addition, BLT-1, an inhibitor of SR-BI, was added to HepG2 cells cultured with cholesterol and HDL, under serum or serum-free conditions. The mRNA and protein expression levels of ApoM were detected by RT-PCR and western blot.Results:We found that increased serum ApoM protein levels corresponded with high hepatic ApoM mRNA levels in both male and female SR-BI-/- mice. Besides, serum TC and HDL-C were also significantly increased. Treatment of HepG2 hepatoma cells with SR-BI specific inhibitor, BLT-1, could up-regulate ApoM expression in serum-containing medium but not in serum-free medium, even in the presence of HDL-C and cholesterol.Conclusions:Results suggested that SR-BI deficiency promoted ApoM expression, but the increased ApoM might be independent from HDL-mediated cholesterol uptake in hepatocytes.
