Locoregional treatments (LRT) represent a broad strategy used for reducing the risk of drop-off and contextually improving the survivals in patients with hepatocellular cancer receiving a liver transplantation (LT). However, it is not sufficiently clear if LRT are only a surrogate of tumor aggressiveness or if they consent a real benefit in terms of tumor stabilization. A recent study by Pommergaard et al reported the results from the European Liver Transplant Registry. Patients receiving LRT before LT had better 5-year survival rates respect to no-LRT cases (69.7% vs 65.8%; P < 0.001). When the number of LRT was tested, one-to-two treatments were connected with improved survivals respect to no treatment [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.85 and 0.71, respectively]. The efficacy of LRT was also reported in the presence of larger tumors (HR = 0.78) and micro-macrovascular invasion (HR = 0.71). The results observed in the present study are partially in discordance with other analyses showing a detrimental effect of LRT. The main problem in the interpretation of these results is connected with the possible initial selection biases present in the studies. The most recent guidelines suggest to perform LRT before the transplant, but the level of evidence is typically low due to the absence of prospectively designed studies.
