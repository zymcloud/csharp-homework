MicroRNAs play vital regulatory roles in various type of tumorigenesis. We aimed to explore the functional microRNAs that might play as therapeutic targets in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, our results revealed that microRNA-106b was significantly increased in HCC tumor tissues. However, miR-106b knockdown remarkably suppressed the growth and increased the apoptosis of Hub-7 HCC cells. Biological analysis indicated that miR-106b directly targeted toZinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 7A (Zbtb7a) to regulate the apoptosis of Hub-7 cells. Extensively, Zbtb7a overexpression reversed Huh-7 cell apoptosis and growth in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo studies confirmed that miR-106b inhibition or Zbtb7a overexpression retarded the growth of Hub-7 xenograft tumor in nude mice. In conclusion, we provide the evidence for the regulatory role of miR-106b in HCC, which is causally linked to targeting of Zbtb7a. This study may provide miR-106b as a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC.
