Background:ICGR15 is widely used in Asia to evaluate the liver reserve before hepatectomy, but not in Western countries where patients are selected using the MELD score and/or platelet count. Postoperative liver failure is rare nowadays, but hepatic decompensation (HD), defined by 3-month postoperative ascites, impairs quality of life and survival. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relevance of indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (ICGR15) before liver resection in Western countries, in order to predict HD.Methods:This prospectively designed study included consecutive adult patients undergoing hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) in three French HPB centres.Results:Between 2012 and 2014, 147 patients were included (80% of HCC and 20% of ICC). The Child-Pugh status was grade A for all patients. In the overall population and in F3/F4 patients (n = 83), ICGR15 (P = 0.02) and platelet counts (P = 0.02) were predictive of HD under multivariate analysis. Among F3/F4 patients undergoing minor hepatectomy with preoperative ICGR15 > 15%, the rate of HD was 36%. In the overall population, ICGR15 was predictive of HD (P = 0.02) and postoperative ascites (P = 0.03). The ROC curve identified a cut-off point of 15% as being associated with increased HD, with good accuracy for ICGR15 in the study population (AUROC 0.73), mainly before minor hepatectomy (AUROC 0.79).Conclusions:In patients with HCC and ICC selected using the MELD score and platelet rate, an ICGR15 > 15% is a relevant, non-invasive and clearly accurate method to predict HD specially before minor hepatectomy.
