Backgrounds and aims:There is no consensus on screening for high-risk esophageal varices (HRV) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of HRV in patients with HCC and to assess the combination of albumin-bilirubin grade and platelet count (ALBI-PLT score) for predicting compensated patients who do not need unnecessary endoscopic screening for HRV.Methods:The ALBI-PLT score was calculated by adding the ALBI grade and points for platelet count (1 point if platelet count >150,000/mm3 and 2 points if â‰¤150,000/mm3). The predictive value of the ALBI-PLT score for HRV was analyzed in 887 compensated patients enrolled from October 2007 to April 2014 (study cohort). This was validated in 215 compensated patients from May 2014 to December 2015 (validation cohort).Results:In the study cohort, the rates of HRV were 2.9% and 21.1% in compensated HCC patients with an ALBI-PLT score of 2 and >2, respectively. The negative predictive values of the ALBI-PLT score for predicting HRV were 97.1% and 98.1% in the study and validation cohorts, respectively. For compensated patients who did not receive endoscopic screening at the time of HCC diagnosis, the 5-year cumulative variceal hemorrhage rate was lower in patients with an ALBI-PLT score of 2 than in those with an ALBI-PLT score >2 (1.7% vs 9.1%, P = .007).Conclusion:In patients with HCC with compensated liver function, an ALBI-PLT score of 2 predicted a very low risk of HRV and variceal hemorrhage; therefore, endoscopic screening for esophageal varices is not recommended for these patients.
