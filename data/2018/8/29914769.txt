Coumarins are ubiquitous in higher plants and exhibit various biological actions. The aim of this study was to investigate the structure-activity relationships of coumarin derivatives on tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)-induced oxidative damage in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. A series of coumarin derivatives were prepared and assessed for their cytoprotective effects. Among these, a caffeoyl acid-conjugated dihydropyranocoumarin derivative, caffeoyllomatin, efficiently protected against cell damage elicited by t-BHP. Our findings suggest that caffeoyllomatin appears to be a potent cytoprotective agent.
