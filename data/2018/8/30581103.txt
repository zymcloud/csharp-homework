Background:Secondary prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) who achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) with interferon-based therapy has been proved effective. However, tertiary prevention with PegIFN/RBV therapy of HCC recurrence seems limited effect in CHC-HCC patients post curative therapies. This study aims to investigate the timing and impact of PegIFN/RBV treatment on prevention of HCC recurrence in patients after RFA treatment.Methods:From 2013 to 2016, a total of 137 CHC-HCC patients from a 508 patient based cohort receiving complete RFA treatment in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Medical Center were retrospectively recruited. Pre-RFA patient demographics were analyzed by cox regression analysis for prediction on tumor recurrence. Statistics analysis was performed with SPSS V.20 (IBM, USA).Results:The mean age of the 137 patients were 69.6 year-old and 71.5% of patients were cirrhotic. After propensity score matching, one hundred and two patients were enrolled into the analysis. Fifty-one patients (50%) received PegIFN/RBV therapy and twenty-seven patients (52.9%) achieved SVR. Patients who could achieve SVR had lower tumor recurrence rate than non-SVR and untreated groups (29.6% vs. 66.7% vs. 49.0%, P = 0.030). The effect is more prominent in those achieve SVR prior to compared with after RFA despite not reach statistically significant (26.1% vs. 50.0%, P = 0.334).Conclusion:Timely treatment with SVR achievement has the lowest tumor recurrence rate in CHC-HCC patients. Secondary prevention might be even more important than tertiary prevention in CHC patients, especially regarding prevention of post RFA HCC recurrence.
