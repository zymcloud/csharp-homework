Background:Recent studies have revealed that liver metastasis is associated with poor outcomes after treatment using immune checkpoint inhibitors, although the cause remains unclear.Patients and methods:We retrospectively identified 201 patients at three Japanese Centers who received nivolumab for advanced non-small cell lung cancer between December 2015 and July 2016. The patients' baseline clinical characteristics and subsequent outcomes were compared according to liver metastasis status.Results:Liver metastasis was associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS) and a lower response rate. Additionally, liver metastasis was significantly associated with younger age, poorer Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), and more metastatic sites. Multivariate analyses revealed that poor PFS was independently associated with poor baseline ECOG PS (p=0.039) and high number of metastatic sites (p=0.007), although liver metastasis (p=0.2) was not.Conclusion:Baseline clinical characteristics were a strong predictor of outcome in nivolumab-treated patients with liver metastasis.
