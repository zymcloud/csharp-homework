Background:Prognosis is very poor for advanced HCC patients partially due to lack of effective systemic treatment. Sorafenib was the only approved agent for advanced HCC since 2007 until recent breakthroughs. In this article, we will review the newer approved and promising agents in the treatment of advanced HCC in the first line setting and beyond progression.Main body:The Food and Drug Administration approved sorafenib as it demonstrated 3 months overall survival benefit compared to placebo in the first line setting over 10 years ago. Multiple single agent and combination therapies have been studied but failed to show benefit. Chemotherapy has limited role in patients with advanced HCC given poor hepatic reserve due to underlying cirrhosis. A new era of treatment for advanced HCC arrived recently with exciting data presented for lenvatinib, regorafenib, cabozantinib, nivolumab, ramucirumab and several other promising clinical trials.Conclusion:Advanced HCC patients are difficult to treat with poor outcomes. After initial approval of sorafenib in 2007, we recently have multiple new agents that showed benefit and promising activity, and are set to change the landscape of HCC treatment.
