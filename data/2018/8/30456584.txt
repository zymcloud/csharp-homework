Purpose:To determine the effects of different reconstruction algorithms on histogram and texture features in different targets.Materials and methods:Among 3620 patients, 480 had normal liver parenchyma, 494 had focal solid liver lesions (metastases = 259; hepatocellular carcinoma = 99; hemangioma = 78; abscess = 32; and cholangiocarcinoma = 26), and 488 had renal cysts. CT images were reconstructed with filtered back-projection (FBP), hybrid iterative reconstruction (HIR), and iterative model reconstruction (IMR) algorithms. Computerized histogram and texture analyses were performed by extracting 11 features.Results:Different reconstruction algorithms had distinct, significant effects. IMR had a greater effect than HIR. For instance, IMR had a significant effect on five features of liver parenchyma, nine features of focal liver lesions, and four features of renal cysts on portal-phase scans and four, eight, and four features, respectively, on precontrast scans (p .05). Most parameters showed good or excellent intra- and interobserver agreement, with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.634 to 0.972.Conclusions:Different reconstruction algorithms affect histogram and texture features. Reconstruction algorithms showed stronger effects in focal liver lesions than in liver parenchyma or renal cysts.Key points:• Imaging heterogeneities influenced the quantification of image features. • Different reconstruction algorithms had a significant effect on histogram and texture features. • Solid liver lesions were more affected than liver parenchyma or cysts.
