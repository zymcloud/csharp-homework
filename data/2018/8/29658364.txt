Background:Several studies have been conducted to evaluate the prognostic value of prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA-II) overexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with curative ablation. However, the results remain controversial. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to explore the correlation between PIVKA-II expression and survival outcomes in these patients.Methods:We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science to identify the relevant articles investigating the prognostic value of PIVKA-II in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Combined hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for overall survival and recurrence-free survival were calculated as the analysis endpoints.Results:A total of 15 cohorts encompassing 5647 patients were included. The results indicated that elevated PIVKA-II was significantly associated with poorer overall survival (HR 1.59; 95% CI 1.40, 1.82; P Conclusions:This meta-analysis suggests that elevated PIVKA-II is a predictor of unfavorable overall survival and recurrence-free survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients receiving curative ablation. More rigorous studies are warranted to confirm the clinical utility of PIVKA-II in determining hepatocellular carcinoma prognosis.
