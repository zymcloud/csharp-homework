Aim:To evaluate the potential value of texture analysis (TA) based on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting an early response of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who were treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) combined with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).Materials and methods:Patients with HCC (n=89) who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI at 1.5 T 1 week before and 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after TACE/HIFU were included in this retrospective study. Early responses were evaluated by two radiologists according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Cancer of the Liver (RECICL). An independent Student's t-test and the Mann-Whitney U-test were used to compare the TA parameters between the complete response (CR) group and the non-complete response (NCR) group. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to assess the predictive value of the NCR lesions.Results:Among the 89 patients, 58 showed CR and 31 showed NCR. Before TACE/HIFU, the CR group showed higher uniformity and energy but lower entropy than the NCR group (pConclusion:TA parameters based on contrast-enhanced MRI images 1 week before and after TACE/HIFU may act as imaging biomarkers to predict an early response of patients with HCC.
