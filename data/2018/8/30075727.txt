Background:Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (PACC), a rare variant of pancreatic malignancy, is generally managed the same way as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Surgical resection is the gateway to curing it; however, once it metastasizes (usually to the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, or peritoneal cavity), systemic chemotherapy has been the only option, but with unfavorable results.Case presentation:A 67-year-old man with symptoms of loss of appetite and weight underwent surgery for malignancy of the pancreatic tail extending into the entire pancreas. The pathological diagnosis was PACC following total pancreatectomy. Twenty-four months after the pancreatectomy, a solitary liver metastasis was treated by partial hepatectomy, and, subsequently, 4 months later, he presented with melena. Further examination revealed a type-2 rectal tumor. Histological examination following biopsy revealed it to be rectal metastasis of PACC, and it was treated by abdominoperineal resection. Subsequently, the patient did not have tumor recurrence as of 40 months after pancreatectomy.Conclusions:This is a rare case of PACC presenting with metachronal metastases in the liver and rectum, and we successfully treated them by surgical resections. Since the malignant behavior of PACC is usually less than that of PDAC, surgical resection could be an option even for metastatic lesions when the number and extent of metastases are limited.
