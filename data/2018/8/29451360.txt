Salvage liver transplantation (sLT) and repeated resection (RR) are effective treatments for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and comparisons of the oncological outcomes between these 2 modalities were scarce. Consecutive patients admitted for either sLT or RR for recurrent HCC were recruited. All patients in the present series received either prior hepatectomy, ablative therapy, or both before RR or sLT. Patient demographic, perioperative, and outcome data were analyzed. A survival analysis was performed after propensity score matching. There were 277 eligible patients recruited, and 67 and 210 of them underwent sLT and RR, respectively. Significant differences in preoperative hemoglobin, albumin, Model of End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, and tumor number were found between the sLT and RR groups. After 1:3 propensity score matching, there were 36 sLT and 108 RR patients for comparison. The median age, MELD, alpha fetoprotein, and tumor size and number of the matched population were 57 years, 7.5, 16 ng/mL, 2.5 cm, and 1, respectively. There was no difference in the hospital mortality and complication rate (Clavien IIIa or above) between the groups. The recurrence rate after RR was significantly higher than for the patients who received sLT (72.2% versus 27.8%; P
