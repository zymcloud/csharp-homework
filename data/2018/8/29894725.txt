Increasing evidences suggested that insufficient radiofrequency ablation (RFA) can paradoxically promote tumor invasion and metastatic processes, while the effects of moderate hyperthermia on cancer progression are not well illustrated. Our present study confirmed moderate hyperthermia treatment can promote the proliferation, migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, which was evidenced by the results that moderate hyperthermia induced up regulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). Cellular studies indicated that moderate hyperthermia treatment can increase the mRNA and protein expression of IL-6 and IL-10, while not IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-22, VEGF, TGF-β, or TNF-α, in HCC cells. Silencing of IL-6, while not IL-10, attenuated moderate hyperthermia treatment induced proliferation and cell invasion. Furthermore, our data revealed the inhibition of NF-κB, while not ERK1/2 or PI3K/Akt, abolished moderate hyperthermia treatment induced production of IL-6. Collectively, our data showed that activation of NF-κB/IL-6 is involved in moderate hyperthermia treatment induced progression of HCC cells.
