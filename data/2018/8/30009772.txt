Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide. Among others, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) are the two major risk factors as both of them may develop cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) if left untreated. However, patients with NASH progress to HCC at a rate around 0.5% annually, while 3-10% ASH patients may progress to HCC annually. The present study is to demonstrate the molecular differences in oncogenesis pathway between NASH and ASH. By using immunofluorescence study and quantitating the fluorescence intensity morphometrically in liver biopsied specimens from NASH and ASH patients, the protein expression of candidate molecules within hepatocytes cytoplasm are studied, including two HCC-related molecules FAT10 and FOXO1, and one GPCR pathway related molecule ADRA2A. Compared with the control group patients, the expression levels of all the molecules were upregulated in the ASH group of patients (p
