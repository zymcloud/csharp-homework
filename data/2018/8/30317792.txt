Objective: To study the effect and mechanism of angiotensin (Ang II) on the proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. Methods: The effects of different concentrations of Ang II's (10(-8)-10(-4) mol/L) on proliferated hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells were detected by CCK-8 assay. The expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) protein and activation of ERK1/2 protein in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells after processing with Ang II were assayed by Western blot. The cells were pretreated with candesartan (AT1 receptor antagonist), sorafenib (Raf kinase inhibitor) and PD98059 (ERK1/2 inhibitor) for 1.5 h and then Ang II (10(-6) mol/L) was added. CCK-8 assay was used to determine whether it could reverse the proliferation of Ang II, and ERK phosphorylation levels were detected by Western blot. The changes in Bcl-2 and c-myc gene expression before and after Ang II processing were detected by Rt-PCR. According to different data, t-test, one-way analysis of variance or SNK method were used for statistical analysis. Results: HepG2 cells treated with different concentrations of Ang II promoted cell proliferation after 24h and 48h. After 24 h, cell vitality was strongest with Ang II concentration 10(-5) mol/L and the absorbance value was 0.990 8±0.097 8; and again after 48 h, the cell viability was strongest with Ang II concentration 10(-6) mol/L and the absorbance value was 1.302 7 ± 0.030 9. Moreover, the pro-proliferation effect of Ang II on HepG2 cells blocked candesartan, sorafenib and ERK1/2 isolated inhibitors. After treatment with 10(-6) mol/L Ang II, Western blot showed that Ang II significantly promoted AT1 receptor expression and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 protein confirmed that Ang II activated the AT1/RAF/ERK1/2 signaling pathway. In addition, Rt-PCR detection showed that the downstream of Bcl-2 and c-myc genes expressions rose significantly when the concentration of Ang II ranged from 10(-8) to 10(-6) mol/L. Conclusion: Ang II can promote the proliferation of HepG2 cells by activating AT1/Raf /ERK1/2 signaling pathway and enhance the downstream of Bcl-2 and c-myc gene expression.
