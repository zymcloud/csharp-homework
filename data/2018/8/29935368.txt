Background:The current study aimed to examine the long-term survival after partial hepatectomy for patients with BCLC intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stratified by the Bolondi's sub-staging model.Materials and methods:This cohort consisted of 360 patients with BCLC intermediate stage HCC who underwent partial hepatectomy between January 2008 and February 2010. Patients were stratified into 3 subgroups (B1-B3) based on the Bolondi's sub-staging model. The last follow-up was conducted at February 2014.Results:Of these patients, 166, 171 and 23 patients had B1, B2, and B3 sub-stage HCC, respectively. The postoperative 5-year Overall survival (OS) rate for patients with these three sub-stages was 49.5%, 33.7% and 12.9%, respectively (P Conclusions:The patients with intermediate stage HCC clarified as sub-stages B1 and B2 according to Bolondi's model had an optimal long-term survival following partial hepatectomy than TACE. Their postoperative prognosis could be accurately predicted by our proposed nomogram.
