Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (α1AT) Deficiency is a genetic disease in which accumulation of α1AT mutant Z (α1ATZ) protein in the ER of hepatocytes causes chronic liver injury, liver fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. No effective medical therapy is currently available for the disease. We previously found that norUDCA improves the α1AT deficiency associated liver disease by promoting autophagic degradation of α1ATZ protein in liver in a mouse model of the disease. The current study unravels the novel underlying cellular mechanism by which norUDCA modulates autophagy. HTOZ cells, modified from HeLa Tet-Off cells by transfection with the resulting pTRE1-ATZ plasmid and expressing mutant Z proteins, were studied in these experiments. The role of norUDCA in inducing autophagy, autophagy-mediated degradation of α1ATZ and the role of AMPK in norUDCA-induced autophagy were examined in the current report. NorUDCA promoted disposal of α1ATZ via autophagy-mediated degradation of α1ATZ in HTOZ cells. Activation of AMPK was required for norUDCA-induced autophagy and α1ATZ degradation. Moreover, mTOR/ULK1 was involved in norUDCA-induced AMPK activation and autophagy in HTOZ cells. Our results provide novel mechanistic insights into the therapeutic action of norUDCA in promoting the clearance of α1ATZ in vitro and suggest a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of α1ATZ deficiency disease and its associated liver diseases.
