Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1 or CD31) is a well-known marker of endothelial cells and a key factor for adhesion and accumulation of platelets. CD31 plays roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and cellular immunity. CD31 is also expressed on tumor cells, such as breast cancer cells and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and contributes to tumor cell invasion. Here, our experiments show that CD31 promotes metastasis by inducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma by up-regulating integrin β1 via the FAK/Akt signaling pathway.
