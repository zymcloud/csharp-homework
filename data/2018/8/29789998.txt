Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of most important risk factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Several long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to be involved in the etiology of HBV-related HCC. AX800134 is one recently identified lncRNA associated with HCC. In this study, we validated the upregulated expression of AX800134 in HBV-positive HCC compared with HBV-negative HCC. Furthermore, we found that HBV X protein (HBx) directly triggered AX800134 expression in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFÎ± also induced AX800134 upregulation in HBx-expressing HepG2 cells, which could be reversed by reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). Additionally, silencing AX800134 with siRNA interference remarkably inhibited the growth and invasion of HBx-expressing HepG2 cells. AX800134 antagonism also enhanced spontaneous apoptosis of HepG2 cells under serum deprivation condition. Therefore, our results indicate that highly expressed AX800134 acts as an oncogenic factor in HCC, and its upregulation is related with the viral product HBx and chronic inflammation.
