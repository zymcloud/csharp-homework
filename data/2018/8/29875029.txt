Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Metabolic pathways within the liver and liver cancers are highly regulated by the central circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Daily light and dark cycles regulate the SCN-driven pineal production of the circadian anticancer hormone melatonin and temporally coordinate circadian rhythms of metabolism and physiology in mammals. In previous studies, we demonstrated that melatonin suppresses linoleic acid metabolism and the Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis)in human breast cancer xenografts and that blue-enriched light (465-485 nm) from light-emitting diode lighting at daytime (bLAD) amplifies nighttime circadian melatonin levels in rats by 7-fold over cool white fluorescent (CWF) lighting. Here we tested the hypothesis that daytime exposure of tissue-isolated Morris hepatoma 7288CTC-bearing male rats to bLAD amplifies the nighttime melatonin signal to enhance the inhibition of tumor growth. Compared with rats housed under a 12:12-h light:dark cycle in CWF light, rats in bLAD light evinced a 7-fold higher peak plasma melatonin level at the mid-dark phase; in addition, high melatonin levels were prolonged until 4 h into the light phase. After implantation of tissue-isolated hepatoma 7288CTC xenografts, tumor growth rates were markedly delayed, and tumor cAMP levels, LA metabolism, the Warburg effect, and growth signaling activities were decreased in rats in bLAD compared with CWF daytime lighting. These data show that the increased nighttime circadian melatonin levels due to bLAD exposure decreases hepatoma metabolic, signaling, and proliferative activities beyond what occurs after normal melatonin signaling under CWF light.
