Ursolic acid (UA), is a kind of triterpene acid that exhibits wide biological properties. In this article, the effects of UA on apoptosis and the proliferation of human hepatoma Huh-7 cells were reported. The MTT results showed that cell viability of Huh-7 was reduced in a concentration and time-dependent effect. In addition, DAPI staining was used to detected condensation of chromatin in nucleus. Apoptotic cell population was examined using Annexin V/PI staining. The results showed that exposure to UA affected extrinsic and intrinsic pathways through, reduced expression of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and TCTP; increased levels of the apoptotic proteins TNF-Î±, Fas, FADD, and Bax; and activation of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP. UA also inhibited the p-Akt and p38 MAPK signaling transduction pathways, and increased activity in the p-ERK signaling pathway. Taken together, UA inhibited the cell growth of Huh-7 cells and affected apoptosis, via regulated cellular signaling transduction.
