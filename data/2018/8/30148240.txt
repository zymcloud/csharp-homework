A 54-year-old woman with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma received a living donor liver transplant. Thrombosis of the segmental hepatic vein occurred on postoperative day 7. We undertook percutaneous catheter thrombosuction under local anesthesia to extract the thrombus successfully without re-exploration. Thrombosuction has been used for thrombosis of the cardiovascular system, limbs, and brain. We first used it in hepatic venous thrombus after liver transplantation. This procedure is simple, less invasive, feasible, safe, repeatable, and effective.
