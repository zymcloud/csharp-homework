A 57-year-old female patient received elective liver transplant due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis complicated by hepatocellular carcinoma. Her preoperative Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score was 11. The total transplant ischemic time was 10 hours and 35 minutes, and the warm ischemic time was 35 minutes. Even with aggressive fluid overload and use of high concentrations of vasoactive amines, the patient developed possible primary graft dysfunction with poor response to fluids and vasopressor support, suggesting vasoplegic syndrome. On the basis of the hypothesis of vasoplegic syndrome, the patient received methylene blue intravenously (100 mg bolus for 12 h/1.5 mg/kg). The catastrophic situation was controlled. The patient's urine output markedly improved, she was subsequently weaned from vasoactive support, and mechanical ventilation was discontinued 2 days later. The patient was discharged on the 20th postoperative day.
