Objective:To evaluate the efficacy of both surgical resection and stereotactic body radiotherapy for small hepatocellular carcinoma.Background:Although the number of stereotactic body radiotherapies being performed for hepatocellular carcinoma has gradually increased, data comparing surgical resection and stereotactic body radiotherapy are limited.Methods:Between 2008 and 2015, a total of 281 patients with 1 to 3 small hepatocellular carcinoma tumors (â‰¤3 cm in diameter), treated initially with curative intent (surgical resection, 254; stereotactic body radiotherapy, 27), were retrospectively analyzed. Overall survival and disease-free survival were compared in a propensity score matching analysis.Results:Patients in the surgical resection group tended to be younger, had more tumors, and had better hepatic function than those in the stereotactic body radiotherapy group (P Conclusion:Surgical resection provided better long-term overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma tumors. However, stereotactic body radiotherapy may be an effective alternative treatment for inoperable patients with early hepatocellular carcinoma.
