A marine natural product, pulmonarin B (1), and a series of related tacrine hybrid analogues were synthesized and evaluated as cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors. The in vitro ChE assay results revealed that 1 showed moderate dual acetylcholinesterase (AChE)/ butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory activity, while the hybrid 12j proved to be the most potent dual inhibitor among the designed derivatives, being almost as active as tacrine. Molecular modeling studies together with kinetic analysis suggested that 12j interacted with both the catalytic active site and peripheral anionic site of AChE. Compounds 1 and 12j could also inhibit self-induced and AChE-induced Aβ aggregation. In addition, the cell-based assay against the human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) revealed that 1 and 12j did not show significant hepatotoxicity compared with tacrine and donepezil. Taken together, the present study confirmed that compound 1 was a potential anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) hit, and 12j could be highlighted as a multifunctional lead compound for anti-AD drug development.
