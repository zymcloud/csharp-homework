Background:The incidence of synchronous double primary hepatic cancers is extremely low. Cholangiolocellular carcinoma is also a rare disease.Case presentation:A 58-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital for the treatment of multiple liver tumors revealed on computed tomography scans. He was hepatitis B and C positive and had undergone hemodialysis for 9 years due to chronic renal failure. Computed tomography scans revealed two hepatic tumors (each â‰¤ 1.0 cm in diameter) in segments 3 and 7. The preoperative diagnosis was multiple hepatocellular carcinomas. He underwent partial resections of his liver. The resected specimens revealed that the tumors in segments 3 and 7 were well-defined lesions of 8.0 mm and 14.0 mm, respectively. Pathological and immunohistochemical examinations confirmed the tumor in segment 3 to be a cholangiolocellular carcinoma and the tumor in segment 7 to be a hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic inflammation could contribute to the different types of primary hepatic cancers. It may also give rise to various combinations of synchronous double primary hepatic cancer in patients with chronic liver disease.Conclusions:We describe the sixth case of synchronous double primary hepatic cancers consisting of hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiolocellular carcinoma in chronic damaged liver and review the literature. In patients with chronic liver disease, careful surveillance with imaging studies should be mandatory as various types of primary hepatic cancers could develop.
