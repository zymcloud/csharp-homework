Purpose:To investigate added value of MRI to preoperative staging MDCT for evaluation of focal liver lesions (FLLs) in potentially resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs).Materials and methods:In patients with potentially resectable PDACs after staging MDCT (n=167), characteristics of FLLs were scored as benign, indeterminate or metastases on an MDCT set and combined MDCT and MRI set by two readers, independently. Size of hepatic lesions was measured and detection rate of hepatic metastasis unsuspected by MDCT and diagnostic yield of MRI for FLLs were assessed.Results:Reader-averaged figure-of-merit (FOM) of the combined set was significantly higher than that of MDCT alone (0.94 vs. 0.86, p=.028). In the negative-on-CT group, the diagnostic yield of MRI was 1.5-2.3% (2/133 and 3/133 for readers 1 and 2, respectively). In the indeterminate-on-CT group, MRI yield was 10.5-13.6% (2/19 and 3/22) and in patients with suspicious-metastasis-on-CT, 8.3-26.7% (1/12 and 4/15). All lesions with false-positive and false-negative CT findings were ≤1 cm.Conclusion:In potentially resectable PDACs, addition of MRI with DWI can provide significantly better diagnostic performance in characterization of focal liver lesions, especially for small-sized (≤ 1 cm) MDCT-indeterminate or suspicious metastasis lesions, aiding in determination of appropriate operation candidates.Key points:• Addition of MRI provides better diagnostic performance in characterization of liver lesions. • Combined interpretation of MRI and MDCT provided less frequent indeterminate liver lesions. • Diagnostic yield of MRI was high in CT-indeterminate or suspicious metastatic lesions. • Operation candidates can be determined with greater confidence in potentially resectable PDACs.
