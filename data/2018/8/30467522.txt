Background : Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is vital medical issue in Egypt. It accounts for 70.48% of all liver tumors among Egyptians. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic role of plasma levels of mRNA of lamin B1 by RT-qPCR as an early marker of HCC. Methods: This study was conducted at the Clinical Pathology Department in collaboration with the Department of Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases at Ain Shams University Hospitals. It included 30 patients with primary HCC and viral cirrhosis (all were hepatitis C virus-positive) (Group I), in addition to 10 patients with chronic liver diseases (Group II) and 10 healthy age- and sex-matched subjects (Group III). Group I was further classified according to the Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer Staging System. Serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) chemiluminescent-immunoassays and RT-qPCR analysis of plasma lamin B1 mRNA levels were performed for all participants. Results: AFP and lamin B1 significantly elevated in patients with HCC compared to those in the other studied groups. AFP and lamin B1 status could discriminate group I from group II and III. A significant increase was found among the three Barcelona stages with regards to AFP and lamin B1 levels. A significant decrease was found between group II and stage 0, A and B with regards to AFP and lamin B1. Lamin B1 and AFP could both differentiate HCC patients with one tumor nodule (T1) from those with two or more tumor nodules (T2&Tm), as well as between those with tumor sizes >3 cm and ≤3 cm. Conclusion: Measurement of lamin B1 mRNA is recommended in patients with chronic liver disease with normal serum AFP, especially in known cirrhotic patients that deteriorate rapidly without any apparent etiology.
