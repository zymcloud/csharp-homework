BACKGROUND The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (SNHG1) is expressed in solid malignant tumors. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine whether expression of the lncRNA SNHG1 was associated with prognosis in patients with malignancy. MATERIAL AND METHODS A literature review from Jan 1970 to July 2018 identified publications in the English language. Databases searched included: PubMed, OVID, Web of Science, the Cochrane Database, Embase, EBSCO, Google Scholar. Systematic review and meta-analysis were performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) assessment tool for risk of bias was used. RESULTS Eight publications (570 patients) and eight solid tumors were identified, including osteosarcoma, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal cancer, ovarian cancer, glioma, and gastric cancer. Meta-analysis showed that expression of the lncRNA SNHG1 was significantly correlated with reduced overall survival (OS) (HR=1.917; 95% CI, 1.58-2.31) (P
