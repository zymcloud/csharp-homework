We investigated clinical significance of peritoneal thickening from metastatic renal pelvis based on pretherapy computed tomography (CT) scan findings. The criteria for inclusion were as follows: (1) pathology and CT scan confirmed metastatic renal pelvis carcinoma and (2) peritoneal thickening based on pre-therapy CT scan findings. We investigated the route of spread, gastrointestinal (GI) complications, and response to chemotherapy. A total of 68 cases were enrolled in this study, including seven patients with liver metastases and three with abdominal wall invasion. GI complications included obstruction in ten patients and bleeding in three. Response to chemotherapy demonstrated by reduced peritoneal thickening was noted in 24 patients.In conclusion:peritoneal thickening with clinical suspicion of peritoneal involvement can get indirect evidence from route of spread (liver or abdominal wall), GI complications (obstruction or bleeding) or response to chemotherapy (obvious decrease peritoneal thickening) from metastatic renal pelvis carcinoma patients. Pretherapy CT scan with peritoneal thickening should be alert that tumor has spread to the peritoneum.
