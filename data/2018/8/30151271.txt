Background:Even though the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system is widely accepted, controversies on the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) still exist. We evaluated the efficacy of an approach with repeated hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) given at eight-week intervals for the treatment of advanced HCC.Methods:Of the 66 compensated cirrhotic patients with advanced HCC refractory to transcatheter arterial chemo-embolization (TACE) enrolled in our study, 21 were treated by bi-monthly hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (B-HAIC) and the rest by sorafenib. The overall survival periods, curative responses, and adverse events in each group were retrospectively analyzed.Results:The efficacy rate was significantly higher in the B-HAIC group (38%, 11%, PConclusions:Given the hepatic function reserve preservation afforded by the B-HAIC treatment in our experience, we suggest that B-HAIC should be considered an alternative strategy for advanced HCC patients who do not respond to TACE.
