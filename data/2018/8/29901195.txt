Despite advances in surgery and chemotherapy, the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poor. In the present study, the role of S100A1 in the progression of HCC was investigated. Immunohistochemical staining was used to measure the expression of S100A1 in HCC tissues. S100A1 was knocked down by siRNA. A battery of experiments was used to evaluate the biology functions of S100A1. It was found that S100A1 was upregulated in HCC tissues, and its upregulation was associated with a large tumor size, low differentiation and shorter survival time. The biological experiments demonstrated that S100A1 functions as an oncogene in HCC. It was also found that S100A1 knockdown enhanced the inhibitory effects of cisplatin on HCC cells. The results showed that the downregulation of S100A1 induced the phosphorylation of yes‑associated protein (YAP), and treatment with CHX demonstrated that the downregulation of S100A1 accelerated YAP protein degradation. The downregulation of S100A1 did not alter the expression of mammalian sterile 20‑like kinase (MST)1/2 or phosphorylated MST1/2, but upregulated the phosphorylation of large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1). It was further confirmed that S100A1 interacted with LATS1. LATS1 depletion significantly reduced the effects of S100A1 on cell growth rate and apoptosis, and there was a positive correlation between phosphorylated LATS1 and S100A1 in clinical samples, indicating that LATS1 was responsible for the S100A1-induced changes in cancer cell growth and Hippo signaling. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that S100A1 functions as an oncogene and may be a biomarker for the prognosis of patients with HCC. S100A1 exerted its oncogenic function by interacting with LATS1 and activating YAP. S100A1 may serve as a target for novel therapies in HCC.
