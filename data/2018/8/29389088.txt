Background and aim:The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) is a strong predictor of survival for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and is used with liver function and tumour burden in the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system. This work assesses whether the health-related quality of life (HRQL), measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep) questionnaire, discriminates HCC patients in terms of survival and adds prognostic information to ECOG PS.Methods:A total of 242 patients participating in the prospective Bern HCC Cohort at the University Hospital Bern were analysed. The relationship between FACT-Hep and sociodemographic and clinical factors, including survival, were assessed. An analysis on treatment subgroups was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Long-Rank test. Additionally, the ability to predict overall survival was compared between the ECOG PS and FACT-Hep total and subscales using Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 .Results:FACT-Hep subscales were significantly worse in females and in patients with limited liver function. FACT-Hep total and all subscales, except the social/family well-being subscale showed significant differences between ECOG PS groups and were significant predictors of survival. ECOG PS groups, followed by the functional well-being subscale, were the best at predicting survival. In the resection subgroup, significant differences in OS regarding to HRQL were found. When adding the functional well-being subscale to ECOG PS, the accuracy of the survival prediction was significantly increased.Conclusion:HRQL assessed by the FACT-Hep questionnaire is a reliable prognostic predictor of survival for patients with HCC and it adds prognostic information to the ECOG PS.
