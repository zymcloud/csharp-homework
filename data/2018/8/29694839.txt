This study was to investigate the physicochemical properties and anticancer effects of polysaccharides from Lentinus edodes extracted under high pressure cooking treatment (HPLPS) in vitro and in vivo. The extraction efficiency was improved. The main molecular weight of HPLPS was about 540 and about 227 kDa. And the inhibitory effects on HepG2 and HeLa cells of HPLPS were significantly increased (p
