Background:The clinical significance of diminutive or small adenomas remains ill defined.Aims:We evaluated the clinical impact of diminutive or small adenomas at baseline on the risk of developing metachronous advanced colorectal neoplasia (CRN).Methods:This multicenter, retrospective cohort study included 2252 patients with 1 or more colorectal adenomas at baseline and subsequent follow-up colonoscopy. Baseline colonoscopy findings were classified into 5 groups: 1 or 2 tubular adenomas (TAs) (<10 mm); 3-10 diminutive TAs (â‰¤5 mm); 3-10 TAs, including 1 or 2 small adenomas (6-10 mm); 3-10 TAs, including 3 or more small adenomas; and advanced adenoma.Results:In multivariate analysis, after adjusting for possible confounding variables (age at baseline, sex, body mass index, smoking habits, family history of colorectal cancer, regular use of aspirin or NSAIDs, and adenoma location), 3-10 TAs including 3 or more small adenomas (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.36, p = 0.034) and advanced adenoma (HR = 2.14, p < 0.001) were independent predictors for the risk of developing metachronous advanced CRN. However, 3-10 diminutive TAs or 3-10 TAs, including 1 or 2 small adenomas, were not associated with this outcome.Conclusions:Multiplicity of diminutive TAs, without advanced lesions, showed no clinical significance for risk of developing metachronous advanced CRN.
