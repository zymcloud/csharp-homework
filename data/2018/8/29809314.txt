Au nanoparticles (3.8 ± 0.6 nm) are assembled to sub-micrometer Au particles (186.3 ± 20.4 nm) and covered with adhesive polydopamine (PDA) as embolism beads (198.8 ± 23.2 nm). Radioactive iodine-125 is labeled to Au@PDA to introduce the function of intra-irradiation. For the therapeutic effects of Au@PDA-125 I, Au particles sensitize the radiation to MHCC97H hepatoma cells and tumor-bearing mice. At the cellular level, after being treated with a relatively low-dose (5 Gy) γ-ray, Au-sensitized radiotherapy (RT) leads to an immediate increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species, accompanying with an increase of cell apoptosis. Due to the intra-irradiation, self-healing of RT-leaded DNA double-strand breakage is suppressed, inducing a further increase of cell apoptosis after RT treatment. Likewise, 3 cycles of sensitized RT leads to a valid control of tumor volume growth, but Au@PDA-125 I has no harm or radioactive residual on or in the radiosensitive organs, including the thyroid, heart, lungs, liver, and spleen. Additionally, photons emitted from 125 I and high X-ray absorption of the Au element makes the beads suitable for single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging. Therefore, as theranostic embolism beads, Au@PDA-125 I can both enhance the therapeutic effects of external RT, and provide a real-time SPECT/CT monitoring of therapeutic time window.
