Deletion in the 3p21 region, the chromosomal location of BAP1, has been reported in a subset of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), biliary and pancreatic cancers. This suggests that BAP1 could play a role in the pathogenesis of these tumors. We assessed the frequency of BAP1 loss by immunohistochemistry in 103 hepatic, biliary and pancreatic cancers. We also assessed chromosomal alterations in the BAP1 region in the same tumors by genotyping. We identified high frequency 4/8 (50%) of BAP1 loss in intrahepatic cholangicarcinoma (ICC). However the frequency was lower in HCC 9/51 (17.6%), pancreatic 1/42(2.4%) and extrahepatic biliary cancers (0/2). Loss of heterozygosity of at least one marker from the 3p21 region was observed in 75% of ICC, 52.9% of HCC and 45.2% of pancreatic cancers. Expression of hepatocytic (HepPar1) and bile duct (cytokeratin 7) markers were common (7/9, 77.8%) in the HCC tumors with loss or decrease of BAP1 compared with those with preserved BAP1 (18/42, 42.9%), (Fisher exact p = 0.0751). Our results confirm the high frequency of BAP1 alterations in ICC and low frequency in pancreatic cancers. It also suggests that BAP1 is commonly altered in a subtype of HCC with both hepatocytic and biliary differentiation. Further studies of the therapeutic implications of our findings are warranted.
