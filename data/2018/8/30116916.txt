Approximately 50% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is attributable to chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is an important diagnostic marker of HBV infection, whereas intrahepatic HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is a surrogate marker of HBV persistence. This study aimed to investigate relationships between serum HBsAg, intrahepatic HBsAg, and intrahepatic cccDNA in HBV-associated HCC. Intrahepatic HBsAg was determined by immunohistochemistry in matched non-cancerous and HCC tissues from 88 patients; 56 patients (63.64%) were serum HBsAg positive. In serum HBsAg-positive group, intrahepatic HBsAg was positive staining in 73.2% of non-cancerous tissues, but only in 10.7% of HCC tissues. Significant correlation between serum HBsAg and intrahepatic HBsAg was observed in non-cancerous tissues (p
