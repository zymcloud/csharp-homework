Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Immune checkpoint blockade with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies has shown promising results in the treatment of patients with advanced HCC. The anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumab, is now approved for patients who have had progressive disease on the current standard of care. However, a subset of patients with advanced HCC treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors failed to respond to therapy. Here, we provide evidence of adaptive resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors through upregulation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in HCC. Anti-CTLA-4 treatment promoted an induction of IDO1 in resistant HCC tumors but not in tumors sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade. Using both subcutaneous and hepatic orthotopic models, we found that the addition of an IDO inhibitor increases the efficacy of treatment in HCC resistant tumors with high IDO induction. Furthermore, in vivo neutralizing studies demonstrated that the IDO induction by immune checkpoint blockade was dependent on IFN-Î³. Similar findings were observed with anti-PD-1 therapy. These results provide evidence that IDO may play a role in adaptive resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with HCC. Therefore, inhibiting IDO in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors may add therapeutic benefit in tumors which overexpress IDO and should be considered for clinical evaluation in HCC.
