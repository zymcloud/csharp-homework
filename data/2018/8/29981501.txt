Interactions between cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor microenvironment (TME) play an important role in promoting the profibrotic microenvironment and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), resulting in tumor progression and drug resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we developed a mixed-cell spheroid model using Huh-7 HCC cells and LX-2 stellate cells to simulate the in vivo tumor environment with respect to tumor-CAF interactions. Spheroids were cultured from cancer cells alone (monospheroids) or as a mixture (mixed-cell spheroids) in ultra-low-attachment plates. Compact, well-mixed, and stroma-rich mixed-cell spheroids were successfully established with heterotypic cell-cell contacts shown by the presence of gap junctions and desmosomes. Mixed-cell spheroids showed enhanced expression of collagen type-I (Col-I) and pro-fibrotic factors such as, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-β1), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) compared to the levels expressed in mono-spheroids. The EMT phenotype was evident in mixed-cell spheroids as shown by the altered expression of E-cadherin and vimentin. Differential drug sensitivity was observed in mixed-cell spheroids, and only sorafenib and oxaliplatin showed dose-dependent antiproliferative effects. Simultaneous treatment with TGF-β inhibitors further improved sorafenib efficacy in the mixed-cell spheroids, indicating the involvement of TGF-β in the mechanism of sorafenib resistance. In 3D matrix invasion assay, mixed-cell spheroids exhibited fibroblast-led collective cell movement. Overall, our results provide evidence that mixed-cell spheroids formed with Huh-7 and LX-2 cells well represent HCC tumors and their TME in vivo and hence are useful in studying tumor-stroma interactions as mechanisms associated with drug resistance and increased cell motility.
