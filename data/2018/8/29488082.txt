Purpose:To retrospectively evaluate the prognostic role of liver stiffness (LS) measurement using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) in patients with compensated chronic liver disease (cCLD).Methods:We enrolled 217 patients with cCLD who underwent MRE. After mean follow-up of 45.0 ± 17.6 months, cumulative incidence (CI) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence, development of decompensation and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazard regression model.Results:During the follow-up period, HCC occurred in 33 patients, and 1-, 3- and 5-year CIs of HCC occurrence were 3.8%, 14.8% and 18.9%, respectively. The LS value was a significant predictive factor for HCC occurrence [p Conclusions:LS obtained from MRE was a significant predictive factor for the development of decompensation, HCC occurrence and OS in cCLD patients.Key points:• Liver stiffness (LS) values obtained from MRE can provide prognostic information. • The LS value was a significant predictive factor for occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma. • The LS value was significantly associated with development of hepatic decompensation. • Survival of compensated chronic liver disease patients was affected by the LS value.
