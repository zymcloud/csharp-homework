Background:The function of hornerin (HRNR), a member of the S100 protein family, is poorly clarified in the development of human tumors. The role of HRNR in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression is investigated in the study.Methods:The expression levels of HRNR were assessed in tumor samples from a cohort of 271 HCC patients. The effect of HRNR on proliferation, colony formation and invasion of tumor cells was examined. We further determined the role of HRNR in tumor growth in vivo by using xenograft HCC tumor models. The possible mechanism of the HRNR promotion of HCC progression was explored.Results:We found that HRNR was overexpressed in HCC tissues. The high expression of HRNR in HCCs was significantly associated with vascular invasion, poor tumor differentiation, and advanced TNM stage. The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of HCC patients with high HRNR expression were poorer than those in the low HRNR expression group. HRNR expression was an independent risk factor linked to both poor DFS (HR = 2.209, 95% CI = 1.627-2.998,P Conclusions:HRNR promotes tumor progression and is correlated with a poor HCC prognosis. HRNR may contribute to HCC progression via the regulation of the AKT pathway.
