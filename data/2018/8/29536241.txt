Objectives:To compare retrospectively the efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus radiofrequency ablation (RFA) (TACE-RFA) with that of repeat hepatectomy in the treatment of initial recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatectomy by propensity score matching (PSM).Methods:From September 2006 to June 2015, 186 patients who underwent TACE-RFA (n=107) or repeat hepatectomy (n=79) for recurrent HCC ≤ 5.0 cm were included. The overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared. PSM was used to correct potential confounding factors between these two groups.Results:1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates after TACE-RFA and repeat hepatectomy were 84.6%, 66.9%, 49.1%, and 84.8%, 60.2%, 51.9%, respectively (p=.871). The corresponding DFS rates were 58.2%, 35.2%, 29.6% and 64.8%, 41.6%, 38.3% (p=.258). TACE-RFA has lower major complication rates (p=.009) and shorter hospital stay (pConclusions:TACE-RFA provides comparable OS and DFS to repeat hepatectomy, fewer major complications and shorter hospital stay.Key points:• TACE-RFA achieved similar OS and DFS with repeat hepatectomy for recurrent HCC • Major complication rate was lower in the TACE-RFA group • The hospital stay was shorter in the TACE-RFA group • AFP was a predictor for OS, MVI was a predictor for DFS • The treatment strategies were not significant prognostic factor for OS or DFS.
