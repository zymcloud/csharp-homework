Valjatrate E is an iridoid compound extracted from Valeriana jatamansi Jones herb and is the active ingredient in antitumor activity. Here, we reported its action on tumor invasion and metastasis in the human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2, aiming at a better understanding of the potential mechanism of action of Valjatrate E. HepG2 cells were treated with Valjatrate E at different concentrations. Wound healing assay and transwell chamber assay were used to determine the effects of Valjatrate E on the migration and invasiveness of HepG2 cells, respectively. Moreover, homogeneity and heterotypic adhesion experiments evaluated the adhesion property of HepG2 cells. The molecular mechanisms by which Valjatrate E inhibited the invasion and migration of HepG2 cells were investigated by gelatin zymography experiment and western blot. Treatment with Valjatrate E inhibited the migration and invasion of HepG2 cells. It achieved this by reducing the expression of matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9), by inhibition of heterogeneous adhesion ability, by blocking mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling via inhibiting the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (p-ERK). Taken together, these findings provide new evidence that mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling pathway plays an important role in promoting invasion and metastasis in HepG2 cells through p-ERK, and MAPK/ERK signaling pathway may be a therapeutic target for tumor.
