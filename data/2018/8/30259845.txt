Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is considered a model autoimmune disease, characterized by circulating anti-mitochondrial antibodies and a selective autoimmune destruction of intrahepatic cholangiocytes. PBC is heterogeneous in its presentation, symptomatology, disease progression, and response to therapy. The pathogenesis is still largely unknown and epidemiologic studies have facilitated the identification of risk factors and the understanding of disease prevalence, geographic variations, heterogeneity, and differences in sex ratio. Recent studies from large international cohorts have better identified prognostic factors suggesting a change in patient management based on risk-stratification tools to identify subgroups at greatest potential benefit from second-line therapies.
