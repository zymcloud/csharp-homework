Objectives:The prevalence of upper gastrointestinal disease is expected to change following advances in socioeconomic status and improved hygiene in Korea. The aim of this study was to investigate the recent trends in upper gastrointestinal diseases based on endoscopic findings and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) seroprevalence in subjects undergoing health check-up at tertiary centers in Korea.Methods:A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted at nine healthcare centers between September 2016 and June 2017. The subjects were evaluated using questionnaires, upper endoscopy and H. pylori serology tests. The results were compared with previous data in our study group obtained from eight tertiary healthcare centers in 2011 (n = 4023).Results:In total, we prospectively enrolled 2504 subjects undergoing health check-up. The prevalence of reflux esophagitis (RE) was 9.7%, which showed an increasing but insignificant trend since 2011 (8.8%). The prevalence of active and healing-stage benign gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer (DU) was 1.6% and 1.2%, respectively, which confirmed a significant decrease since 2011 (4.1%; p < .001 and 2.2%; p = .005, respectively). The prevalence of gastric cancer was 0.5%, representing an increasing trend since 2011 (0.12%; p = .003). H. pylori seroprevalence was 51.3%, which significantly decreased from 2011 (59.8%; p < .001). In multivariate analysis, H. pylori seropositivity was a significant risk factor for DU (p < .001), whereas a significant protective factor against RE (p < .001).Conclusions:The significant decrease of H. pylori seroprevalence in the past five years altered the incidence of upper gastrointestinal disease.
