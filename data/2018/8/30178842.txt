Objective:Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most important malignant liver cancers in clinic. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) positive expression is an important examination index. However, there are some hepatocellular carcinoma patients show negative AFP expressions. Therefore, how to screen AFP- hepatocellular carcinoma patients is important and difficult.Patients and methods:Total of 80 cases of AFP- hepatocellular carcinoma patients with or without focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) confirmed by surgery was enrolled. Clinical information was collected for correlation analysis. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot were applied for gene expression analysis, and the target gene includes CD34, proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cell keratin 19 (CK19). Their relationship was analyzed.Results:CD34 positive rate in the 80 cases was 48%, of which patients with FNH showed higher expression level than those of patients without FNH. The PCNA positive rate was 38%, and there was no statistical difference between patients with and without FNH. The CK19 positive rate was 56%, while the patients with FNH presented a higher level than the patients without FNH. CD34, PCNA, and CK19 showed no evident difference on different gender, age, or tumor size. CD34 was negatively correlated with PCNA and positively correlated with CK19.Conclusions:AFP- hepatocellular carcinoma patients with FNH showed high CD34 and CK19, and low PCNA level.
