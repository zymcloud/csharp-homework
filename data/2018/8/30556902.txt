Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most prevalent and fatal cancers. Studying the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma may lead to new therapeutic strategies. We checked whether there were correlations between The Cancer Genome Atlas expression profiles of the differentially expressed lncRNAs and their DNA methylation status or the copy number variations for hepatocellular carcinoma. We obtained 41 lncRNAs that were differentially expressed between tumor and normal samples, and their DNA methylation status was negatively correlated with the expression levels. We identified five lncRNAs that were recurrently amplified or deleted in tumor samples, but none of them were associated with the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels. To obtain the biological function of these lncRNAs, the coexpressed mRNAs in the hepatocellular carcinoma were figured out. A total of 10 lncRNAs were highly correlated with at least one gene. Six out of the ten lncRNAs were already known to be related with cancer previously. LINC01615 had 72 coexpressed genes, and we carried out the gene ontology (GO) term enrichment for these protein-coding genes. The results suggested that these lncRNAs were associated with extracellular matrix organization. To summarize, we identified 41 potentially cancer-related lncRNAs. In particular, we proposed that LINC01615 potentially affected the extracellular matrix and had further impacts on the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma.
