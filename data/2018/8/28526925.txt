Purpose:Phenolic compounds (PC) of virgin olive oil exert several biochemical and pharmacological beneficial effects. Some dietary PC seem to prevent/improve obesity and metabolic-related disorders such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We investigated the possible effects of PC extracted from olive pomace (PEOP) and of the main single molecules present in the extract (tyrosol, apigenin, oleuropein, p-coumaric and caffeic acid) in protecting hepatocytes and endothelial cells against triglyceride accumulation and oxidative stress.Methods:Rat hepatoma and human endothelial cells were exposed to a mixture of oleate/palmitate to mimic the condition of NAFLD and atherosclerosis, respectively. Then, cells were incubated for 24 h in the absence or in the presence of PC or PEOP. Different parameters were evaluated, such as lipid accumulation and oxidative stress-related markers.Results:In hepatic cells, expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1) were assessed as index of lipid metabolism. In endothelial cells, expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB), release of nitric oxide (NO), and wound-healing rate were assessed as index of inflammation.Conclusion:PEOP extract ameliorated hepatic lipid accumulation and lipid-dependent oxidative imbalance thus showing potential applications as therapeutic agent tuning down hepatosteatosis and atherosclerosis.
