The aim of this study was to examine whether using subcuticular sutures during initial hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with shorter postoperative length of hospital stay (PLOS) than using staples for patients treated in the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) approach. A total of 376 patients were randomized to receive either subcuticular sutures or staples (188 per group), and the two groups were compared in terms of the incidence of wound complications and PLOS. Independent risk factors for PLOS were identified by multivariate analysis. Sutures were associated with significantly lower incidence of wound infection (4.3% vs. 13.3%, P = 0.020) and significantly shorter PLOS (7.97 vs. 8.45 days, P = 0.048). Independent risk factors for wound infection after hepatectomy were advanced age, increased preoperative body mass index, decreased preoperative serum albumin, and skin closure using staples. These results suggest that subcuticular sutures may be more effective than staples for conducting hepatectomy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who receive ERAS care.
