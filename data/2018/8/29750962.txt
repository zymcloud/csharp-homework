Background and aims:Increasing evidence has shown the critical role of long non-coding RNA cytoskeleton regulator (CYTOR) in cancers. The expression of CYTOR is reported to be up-regulated in many kinds of cancers, such as gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, colon cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. Here, we summarized related studies and performed a meta-analysis to investigate the prognostic value of CYTOR in multiple cancers.Methods:Eligible studies were retrieved from PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases, and the role of CYTOR in cancers was evaluated by pooled odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The results were further validated using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset.Results:Our results showed that elevated CYTOR expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients (overall survival, HR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.73-2.38, P Conclusion:Overall, this study indicates that CYTOR may serve as a prognostic biomarker for cancer patients during the follow-up.
