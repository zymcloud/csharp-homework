Combinatorial drug delivery is a way of advanced cancer treatment that at present represents a challenge for researchers. Here, we report the efficient entrapment of two clinically used single-agent drugs, doxorubicin and sorafenib, against hepatocellular carcinoma. Biocompatible and biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles provide a promising approach for controlled drug release. In this study, doxorubicin and sorafenib with completely different chemical characteristics were simultaneously entrapped by the same polymeric carrier, namely poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and polyethylene glycol-poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PEG-PLGA), respectively, using the double emulsion solvent evaporation method. The typical mean diameters of the nanopharmaceuticals were 142 and 177 nm, respectively. The PLGA and PEG-PLGA polymers encapsulated doxorubicin with efficiencies of 52% and 69%, respectively, while these values for sorafenib were 55% and 88%, respectively. Sustained drug delivery under biorelevant conditions was found for doxorubicin, while sorafenib was released quickly from the PLGA-doxorubicin-sorafenib and PEG-PLGA-doxorubicin-sorafenib nanotherapeutics.
