Introduction and aim:We sought to identify independent risk factors for cirrhosis in HFE p.C282Y homozygotes in a cross-sectional study.Material and methods:We evaluated 368 p.C282Y homozygotes who underwent liver biopsy and compared characteristics of those with and without cirrhosis. We performed multivariable logistic regression on cirrhosis with: age; sex; race/ethnicity; diabetes; blood pints/units donated voluntarily; erythrocyte pints/units received; iron supplement use; alcohol intake, g/d; body mass index, kg/m2; swollen/tender 2nd/3rd metacarpophalangeal joints; elevated alanine aminotransferase; elevated aspartate aminotransferase; steatosis/fatty liver; iron removed by phlebotomy, g; and GNPAT p.D519G positivity.Results:Mean age of 368 participants (73.6% men) was 47 Â± 13 (standard deviation) y. Cirrhosis was diagnosed in 86 participants (23.4%). Participants with cirrhosis had significantly greater mean age, proportion of men, diabetes prevalence, mean daily alcohol intake, prevalence of swollen/ tender 2nd/3rd metacarpophalangeal joints, mean serum ferritin, elevated alanine aminotransferase, elevated aspartate aminotransferase, and mean iron removed; and significantly fewer mean blood pints/units donated. GNPAT p.D519G positivity was detected in 82 of 188 participants (43.6%). In a multivariable model for cirrhosis, there were four significant positive associations: age (10-y intervals) (odds ratio 2.2 [95% confidence interval 1.5, 3.3]); diabetes (3.3; [1.1, 9.7]); alcohol intake (14 g alcohol drinks/d) (1.5 [1.2, 1.8]); and iron removed, g (1.3 [1.2, 1.4]). There was no statistical evidence of two-way interactions between these variables.Conclusion:In conclusion, cirrhosis in HFE p.C282Y homozygotes is significantly associated with age, diabetes, daily alcohol intake, and iron removed by phlebotomy, taking into account the effect of other variables.
