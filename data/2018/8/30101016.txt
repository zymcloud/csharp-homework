In Japan, bevacizumab has not been proven either effective or safe for the treatment of recurrent cervical cancer. The present study reported two cases in which bevacizumab combination chemotherapy was safely administered for recurrent cervical cancer following pelvic radiotherapy. Case 1 was a 62-year-old woman with stage IIIB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix who had received whole pelvic external beam radiotherapy (WPEBRT) at a dose of 50.4 Gy and high dose rate intra-cavitary brachytherapy at a dose of 24 Gy to the pelvis one year earlier. For recurrent cervical cancer, chemotherapy with paclitaxel, carboplatin and bevacizumab was administered for six cycles. Case 2 was a 52-year-old woman with stage IIB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix who had received WPEBRT at a dose of 50.4 Gy to the pelvis 11 years earlier. For lymph node and liver metastases, chemotherapy with paclitaxel, cisplatin, and bevacizumab was administered for six cycles. Although grade 2 proteinuria was observed in one of these patients, there were no intestinal perforation, fistula, hypertension, proteinuria or thrombosis events, which are the characteristic adverse reactions associated with bevacizumab. Hematotoxicity was also manageable. Regarding the antitumor effect, case 1 demonstrated a complete response, whereas case 2 resulted in stable disease.
