Percutaneous microwave ablation therapy (PMCT) has been recommended for elderly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who cannot tolerate surgery due to their age or presence of comorbidities. Few studies have investigated efficacy and treatment outcomes for PMCT treatment in these patients, especially in China, where patients are more often diagnosed and treated early in life. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ultrasound-guided PMCT in treatment-naive elderly HCC patients, and analyzed risk factors associated with poor treatment outcomes.The 65 HCC patients in this retrospective study were divided into 2 groups: 5 to ≤ 10 cm were at a significantly higher risk for disease progression than patients with tumor sizes >1 to ≤ 3 cm. Complete ablation significantly lowered the risk of disease progression.PMCT is safe and effective for patients ≥65 years of age, achieving total ablation in more than 90% of patients. Age and comorbidities did not affect clinical outcome.
