Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as the fifth most diagnosed cancer in the world and the third leading cause of death, is a global health concern. Research stimulated by the dismal prognosis of HCC has led to significant advances in the understanding of its aetio-pathogenesis. Dysregulation of genetic, epigenetic and signalling pathways as well as tumour immunological escape mechanisms are implicated in the development of HCC. This review summarises the current knowledge of these mechanisms and argues that it is only through further understanding of their role in hepatocarcinogenesis, that new effective therapies can be developed.
