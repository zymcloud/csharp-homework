Background and aim:In patients with HCV-related cirrhosis, a sustained virological response may lead to cirrhosis regression. Whether histological changes translate into prevention of long-term complications, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma is still unknown. This was investigated in a cohort of histological cirrhotics who had been prospectively followed-up for 10 years after the achievement of a sustained virological response to IFN.Methods:In all, 38 sustained virological response cirrhotics who underwent a liver biopsy 5 years post-SVR were prospectively followed to assess the impact of cirrhosis regression on clinical endpoints.Results:During a follow-up of 86 (30-96) months from liver biopsy, no patients developed clinical decompensation, whilst 5 (13%) developed hepatocellular carcinoma after 79 (7-88) months. The 8-year cumulative probability of hepatocellular carcinoma was 17%, without differences between patients with or without cirrhosis regression (19% [95% CI 6%-50%] vs 14% [95% CI 4%-44%], P = .88). Patients who developed or did not an hepatocellular carcinoma had similar rates of residual cirrhosis (P = 1.0), collagen content (P = .48), METAVIR activity (P = .34), portal inflammation (P = .06) and steatosis (P = .17). At baseline, patients who developed an hepatocellular carcinoma had higher Î³GT (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.06; P = .014) and glucose (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00-1.02; P = .012) values; moreover, they had increased Forns Score (HR 12.8, 95% CI 1.14-143.9; P = .039), Lok Index (HR 6.24, 95% CI 1.03-37.6; P = .046) and PLF (HR 19.3, 95% CI 1.72-217.6; P = .016) values. One regressor died of lung cancer. The 8-year cumulative survival probability was 97%, independently on cirrhosis regression (96% vs 100%, P = 1.0) or hepatocellular carcinoma (100% vs 97%, P = 1.0).Conclusions:Post-SVR cirrhosis regression does not prevent hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence.
