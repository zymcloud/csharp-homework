Previous evidences reveal that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) down syndrome critical region 8 (DSCR8) involves in the progression of multiple cancers. However, the exact expression, function, and mechanism of DSCR8 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain uncovered. In this study, real-time PCR in HCC tissues and cell lines indicated that DSCR8 expression was upregulated, while miR-485-5p was downregulated. MTT assay, plate clone formation, Edu assay, flow cytometry, and in vivo experiments indicated that DSCR8 promoted HCC cell proliferation and cycle, whereas accelerated cell apoptosis. Luciferase reporter gene assay, RIP assay, and rescue experiments demonstrated that DSCR8 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by sponging miR-485-5p in HCC cells. Furthermore, gain- and loss-of-function studies showed that miR-485-5p activated Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway by targeting Frizzled-7 (FZD7). Moreover, DSCR8 activated Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway to promote HCC progression by DSCR8/miR-485-5p/FZD7 axis. Statistical analysis revealed that DSCR8 and miR-485-5p were closely related to some malignant clinicopathological features and 5-year survival rates of HCC patients. Taken together, the present study reports for the first time that DSCR8 activates Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway to promote HCC progression by DSCR8/miR-485-5p/FZD7 axis. The findings provide promising and valuable strategies for targeted therapy of HCC.
