Recently, it is reported that taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) participates in the tumor progression by acting as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) of miRNAs. Nonetheless, whether TUG1 could serve as a ceRNA of miR-144 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression remains undefined. Here, our results indicated that there was a marked rise in TUG1 expression in HCC tissues and cells, and downregulation of TUG1 hindered proliferation and migration of HCC cells. Additionally, TUG1 was validated to act as a molecular sponge of miR-144. Furthermore, we found that TUG1 interacting with miR-144 contributed to proliferation and migration of HCC cells via activating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in vitro. Moreover, TUG1 knockdown inhibited HCC tumor growth in vivo through upregulating miR-144 via inactivation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. In conclusion, TUG1 interacting with miR-144 contributed to proliferation, migration and tumorigenesis through activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in HCC.
