A series of novel 1,3,4-trisubstituted pyrazole derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against three different cancer cell lines namely HCT116, UO-31 and HepG2. Compounds 3b, 3d, 7b and 9 showed excellent anticancer activity against all the tested cancer cell lines and had better cytotoxic activities than the reference drug, Sorafenib. Therefore, these compounds were chosen to be further evaluated in a panel of HCC cell lines. Among them, 3b and 7b were the most active compounds against HCC cells used here. Further studies on the mechanism demonstrated that 3b and 7b induced apoptosis in addition to induction of cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in HepG2 and Huh7 cells. Consistent with these results, caspase-3 assay was done and the results revealed that the pro-apoptotic activity of the target compounds could be due to the stimulation of caspases-3. In addition, CDK1 inhibition assay was done and it was found that compounds 3b and 7b inhibited CDK1 activities with IC50 values of 2.38 and 1.52 ÂµM, respectively. Finally, pyrazole derivatives 3b and 7b showed potent bioactivities, indicating that these compounds could be potent anticancer drugs in the future.
