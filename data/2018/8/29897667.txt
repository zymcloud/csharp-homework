A 63-year-old man with cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and coagulopathy was diagnosed with a sinus venosus atrial septal defect (ASD) and partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR) of the right upper pulmonary vein (RUPV). Transcatheter repair by positioning a stent graft in the superior vena cava was planned. Based on three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of gated cardiac CTA, a 28 mm × 7 cm Endurant II® aortic extension stent graft (Medtronic, MN) was chosen. A 3D model printed from the CTA was used to simulate device deployment, demonstrating successful exclusion of the sinus venosus ASD with return of the RUPV to the left atrium (LA). Post simulation, the 3D model was used for informed consent. The patient was then taken to the hybrid operating room. On-table cone beam CT was performed and registered with the CTA images. This enabled overlay of 3D regions of interest to live 2D fluoroscopy. The stent graft was then deployed using 3D regions of interest for guidance. Hemodynamics and angiography demonstrated successful exclusion of the sinus venosus ASD and unobstructed return of RUPV to the LA. This is the first report of comprehensive use of contemporary imaging for planning, simulation, patient consent, and procedural guidance for patient-centered complex structural intervention in repair of sinus venosus ASD with PAPVR. We propose this as a process model for continued innovation in structural interventions.
