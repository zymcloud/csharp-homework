Introduction: Despite the availability of an effective vaccine and treatment to reduce the viral load and progressive hepatocellular injury, approximately 240 million people worldwide are chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). In Colombia, the circulation of different viral genotypes has been confirmed. Mutations in the genome have been associated to antiviral therapy resistance, viral escape to neutralizing antibodies, occult infection and progression to hepatocellular carcinoma. Objective: To identify the genotypes and the presence of mutations in the coding region of the surface (S) antigen and the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of the polymerase of HBV obtained from serum samples for hepatitis B diagnosis received by the Instituto Nacional de Salud during the period 2002-2014. Materials and methods: A total of 495 serum samples with previous HBsAg reactive result were used for molecular detection. A fragment of 1,591 nucleotides was sequenced, and the corresponding phylogenetic analysis was performed. Results: We detected the viral genome of HBV in 66 samples and 28 were successfully sequenced. The phylogenetic analysis allowed the identification of subgenotypes F3 and A2. The L180M and M204V resistance mutations were simultaneously identified in one sample, while the I169L resistance mutation was identified in another one. A single escape mutation, P120Q, was identified in one more. Two samples showed a deletion of 105 nucleotides in the preS1-preS2 region. Conclusions: The circulation of genotypes/subgenotypes F3 and A2 of HBV in Colombia was corroborated, as well as the presence of some resistance and escape mutations. The present study constitutes a contribution to the molecular epidemiology of HBV in Colombia.
