Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a problem in obese people caused by increasing intake of high-calorie food such as fructose implicated in the elevated prevalence. It is necessary to identify novel drugs to develop effective therapies. In this study, we combined LOPACÂ® (The Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds) and High-Content screening to identify compounds that significantly reduced intracellular lipid droplets (LD) after high fat medium (HFM) treatment. Among 1280 compounds, we identified 239 compounds that reduced LD by >50%. Of these, 17 maintained cell viability. Nine of them were selected for validation using normal primary hepatocytes, of which five compounds showed dose-dependent efficacy. Whole genome transcriptomic network analysis was performed to construct the underlying regulatory network. There were 831 (711 up-regulated and 120 down-regulated genes) and 3480 (2009 up-regulated and 1471 down-regulated genes) genes that showed a significant change (>2-fold; p
