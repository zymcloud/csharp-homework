Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is an important post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism and involved in many diseases, including cancer. CFIm25, a subunit of the cleavage factor I encoded by NUDT21, is required for 3'RNA cleavage and polyadenylation. Although it has been recently reported to be involved in glioblastoma tumor suppression, its roles and the underlying functional mechanism remain unclear in other types of cancer. In this study, we characterized NUDT21 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Reduced expression of NUDT21 was observed in HCC tissue compared to adjacent non-tumorous compartment. HCC patients with lower NUDT21 expression have shorter overall and disease-free survival times than those with higher NUDT21 expression after surgery. Knockdown of NUDT21 promotes HCC cell proliferation, metastasis, and tumorigenesis, whereas forced expression of NUDT21 exhibits the opposite effects. We then performed global APA site profiling analysis in HCC cells and identified considerable number of genes with shortened 3'UTRs upon the modulation of NUDT21 expression. In particular, we further characterized the NUDT21-regulated genes PSMB2 and CXXC5. We found NUDT21 knockdown increases usage of the proximal polyadenylation site in the PSMB2 and CXXC5 3' UTRs, resulting in marked increase in the expression of PSMB2 and CXXC5. Moreover, knockdown of PSMB2 or CXXC5 suppresses HCC cell proliferation and invasion. Taken together, our study demonstrated that NUDT21 inhibits HCC proliferation, metastasis and tumorigenesis, at least in part, by suppressing PSMB2 and CXXC5, and thereby provided a new insight into understanding the connection of HCC suppression and APA machinery.
