Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the fifth most common malignancy in women, with a 5-year mortality of >70% in North America. As the symptoms are often not observed until the cancer has spread extensively, few women are diagnosed at an early stage of disease. Large-scale gene expression analyses have identified molecular subtypes within high-grade ovarian cancer with variable survival rates and drug resistance. The understanding of gene expression, the mechanisms underlying cancer processes and drug resistances have facilitated the development of targeted therapies. The far-upstream element (Fuse)-binding protein 1 (FBP1) is overexpressed in a number of malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma, and has been identified as an oncoprotein. In our early studies, FBP1 was demonstrated to physically interact with p53 and suppresses p53 transcription activity. In the present study, FBP1 expression increased as ovarian cancer developed. Among ovarian normal, adenoma and carcinoma tissues, the highest FBP1 expression was identified in carcinoma tissues. Furthermore FBP1 did not influence the apoptosis of ovarian carcinoma cells, yet enhanced cell cycle transition and metastasis. Therefore, it was hypothesized that FBP1 promotes ovarian cancer development through the acceleration of cell cycle transition and metastasis, and FBP1 is a novel potential biological marker for epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosis.
