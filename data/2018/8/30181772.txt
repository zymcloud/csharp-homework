Background:The impact of different anti-virus regimens on prognosis of Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) related cirrhosis remains to be explored. We aim to investigate whether CHB-related HCC patients receiving nucleoside analogue regimen or not have a different prognosis.Methods:Two hundred forty-two CHB-related compensated cirrhosis patients were attributed into groups regarding their anti-virus regimens containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or not. The results of two groups were reviewed and investigated. The probability of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development among each group were analyzed and compared.Results:Two hundred forty-two CHB-related compensated cirrhosis patients from 2008 June to 2011 December were included in our study. One hundred twenty-seven patients received anti-virus regimen containing TDF and 115 patients received anti-virus regimen without TDF. Child-Pugh score, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin level, status of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and serum HBV DNA level were compared between groups. The cumulative probability of HCC development in TDF-contained group were significantly lower than it in non-TDF-contained group (p < 0.05). Multi-variant analysis indicated that TDF-containing regimen treatment was significantly associated with lower probability of HCC development, (hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% confidence interval range, 0.07-0.45, p < 0.05).Conclusion:Anti-virus regimen containing TDF benefits for the prognosis of CHB-related liver cirrhosis patients.
