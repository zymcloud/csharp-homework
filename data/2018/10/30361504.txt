Some types of circular RNA (circRNA) are aberrantly expressed in human diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its regulation mechanism and diagnostic roles are largely unknown. Here, we identified that circRNA_104075 (circ_104075) was highly expressed in HCC tissues, cell lines and serum. Mechanistically, HNF4a bound to the -1409 to -1401 region of the circ_104075 promoter to stimulate the expression of circ_104075. Moreover, circ_104075 acted as a ceRNA to upregulate YAP expression by absorbing miR-582-3p. Interestingly, an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) motif was identified in the 353-357 region of YAP 3'UTR, and this m6A modification was essential for the interaction between miR-582-3p and YAP 3'UTR. Further, the diagnostic performance of circ_104075 was evaluated. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) for circ_104075 was 0.973 with a sensitivity of 96.0% and a specificity of 98.3%. Collectively, we determined that circ_104075 was highly expressed in HCC and elucidated its upstream and downstream regulatory mechanisms. circ_104075 additionally has the potential to serve as a new diagnostic biomarker in HCC. Targeting circ_104075 may provide new strategies in HCC diagnosis and therapy.
