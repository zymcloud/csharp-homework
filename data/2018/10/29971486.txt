The disappearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) from serum and tissues for 12 weeks after the end of treatment (EOT) with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) is known as a "sustained virologic response" (SVR) and occurs more frequently in non-cirrhotic patients than in cirrhotic patients. In this study, we evaluated the outcome of HCV treatment with sofosbuvir (SOF) plus ledipasvir (LDV) at both EOT and 12 weeks after EOT in patients with and without hepatic cirrhosis to address the relationship of serologic relapse to persistent infection of PBMCs and the frequency of hepatic encephalopathy and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after treatment. Seventy-five patients with post-HCV liver cirrhosis were assigned to one of three groups (A, B, and C), each of which included 25 patients and corresponded to the patients' Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) classification. All of the patients received a daily dose of SOF (400 mg) plus LDV (90 mg) for 24 weeks and were tested using HCV single-strand reverse transcription (SRT) and PCR analysis of PBMCs at both EOT and 12 weeks after EOT. Fourteen (18.7%) out of 75 patients (all study populations) had intra-PBMC HCV RNA, but only nine of them (64.3%) developed HCV RNA serum relapse (seroconversion) 12 weeks after EOT (P
