In the present work novel para chloro, para fluoro and para nitro maleanilic acid derivatives were prepared and investigated using FT-IR, thermal analyses (TA) measurements (TGA/DTG and DTA) in comparison with mass spectral (MS) fragmentation at 70 eV. The crystallographic structures of studied compounds were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The vibrational frequencies and the corresponding normal modes were evaluated at the optimized geometry. Vibrational modes were analyzed using GAUSSVIEW software. Experimental FT-IR and Raman spectra of the three newly prepared derivatives, namely, (E) - oxo -4- ((4- nitro phenyl) amino)-4- oxobut-2-enoic acid (p-NMA), (E) -4- ((4- chloro phenyl)amino)-4- oxobut -2- enoic acid (p-ClMA), (E) -4- ((4- fluoro phenyl) amino)- 4- oxobut -2- enoic acid (p-FMA) were compared with the theoretically calculated one. FT-IR and the observed vibrational frequencies were assigned; thermal analysis and mass spectrum measurements of the maleanilic acid derivatives were recorded and discussed. The computational calculations were carried out by DFT - B3LYP method with 6-311++G(d,p) basis sets and the corresponding results were tabulated. The alternations of structures of p-FMA, p-ClMA and p-NMA due to the subsequent substitutions were investigated. This correlation between experimental and theoretical calculations provided a good confirmation of the proposed structures of the newly prepared compounds. The derivatives were found to be highly effective against Hepatocellular carcinoma cells > Breast carcinoma cells > colon carcinoma cells. It was recognized, that cancer cells over expression promotes tumorigenic functions; can be suppressed by p-NMA > p-FMA > p-ClMA inhibitors.
