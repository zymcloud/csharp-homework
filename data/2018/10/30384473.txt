Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is a lethal malignancy with poor prognosis and easy recurrence. There are few agents with minor toxic side effects that can be used for treatment of HCC. Evodiamine (Evo), one of the major bioactive components derived from fructus Evodiae, has long been shown to exert anti-hepatocellular carcinoma activity by suppressing activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). In addition, in the Nucleotide-Binding Oligomerization Domain 1 (NOD1) pathway, NOD1 could initiate NF-κB-dependent and MAPK-dependent gene transcription. Recent experimental studies reported that the NOD1 pathway was related to controlling development of various tumors. Here we hypothesize that Evo exerts anti-hepatocellular carcinoma activity by inhibiting NOD1 to suppress NF-κB and MAPK activation. Therefore, we proved the anti-hepatocellular carcinoma activity of Evo on HCC cells and detected the effect of Evo on the NOD1 pathway. We found that Evo significantly induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, upregulated P53 and Bcl-2 associated X proteins (Bax) proteins, and downregulated B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), cyclinB1, and cdc2 proteins in HCC cells. In addition, Evo reduced levels of NOD1, p-P65, p-ERK, p-p38, and p-JNK, where the level of IκBα of HCC cells increased. Furthermore, NOD1 agonist γ-D-Glu-mDAP (IE-DAP) treatment weakened the effect of Evo on suppression of NF-κB and MAPK activation and cellular proliferation of HCC. In an in vivo subcutaneous xenograft model, Evo also exhibited excellent tumor inhibitory effects via the NOD1 signal pathway. Our results demonstrate that Evo could induce apoptosis remarkably and the inhibitory effect of Evo on HCC cells may be through suppressing the NOD1 signal pathway in vitro and in vivo.
