Background:The Child-Pugh (CP) class is a commonly used scoring system to measure liver function in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We correlate the Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) grading system and CP to overall survival in our HCC patients receiving radioembolization.Methods:We retrospectively evaluated patients who received radioembolization for HCC between the years 2009-2014. We evaluated the albumin and bilirubin levels in our patients prior to receiving their first (n=124) radioembolization. The ALBI grades were calculated from these data with the formula (log10 bilirubin ×0.66) + (albumin × -0.085) and correlated to outcomes using Mantel-Cox Log analysis. These statistical comparisons were duplicated with CP classes.Results:Median survival differences between CP class A and B and between ALBI grade 1 and 2 were 4.7 and 9.9 months, respectively. A subset of ALBI grades 1 and 2 were identified within our CP class A patients with a median survival difference of 9.9 months.Conclusions:ALBI is a more sensitive marker of liver function than CP in the setting of mild dysfunction. Using ALBI, we identified a subset of patients that have significantly better outcomes from Y-90 radioembolization than previously identified with CP.
