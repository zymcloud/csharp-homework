Background:We aimed to describe the real-world efficacy and safety of combination therapy with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 (GT1) infection.Methods:This retrospective analysis of a prospective, nationwide, multicenter registry included GT1-infected patients treated with LDV/SOF for 12 weeks. We assessed the rate of sustained virological response at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12), incidence of adverse events, and serum markers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Results:Among the 1461 patients included (mean age, 69 years; 29.5% aged > 75 years; cirrhosis, 23.8%; history of treatment for HCC, 10.9%), the overall SVR12 rate was 98.4% (1438/1461). Factors associated with treatment failure were cirrhosis (odds ratio, 4.19; p = 0.014) and resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) in NS5A at baseline (odds ratio, 7.78; p = 0.0004). The SVR12 rate in patients with cirrhosis and NS5A RASs was 93.0% compared to 100% in patients without cirrhosis or NS5A RASs. In patients with SVR, the levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), AFP-L3, and Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) decreased from baseline to end of treatment (from 13.4 ± 37.6 to 6.0 ± 10.6 ng/mL, p Conclusions:LDV/SOF therapy is highly effective and safe in elderly Japanese patients with HCV GT1, even in the presence of cirrhosis or NS5A RASs. Patients with SVR may have a lower risk of HCC.
