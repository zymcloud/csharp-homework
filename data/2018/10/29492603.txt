Purpose:The purpose of the study is to report the efficacy and safety of combined transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) of the right inferior phrenic artery (IPA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) near the diaphragm supplied by the right IPA.Methods:From July 2009 through April 2015, 11 patients with small (â‰¤ 3 cm) HCC near the diaphragm, which was infeasible for ultrasound-guided RFA and supplied by the right IPA, received TACE of the right IPA and subsequent RFA in one session. The safety and therapeutic efficacy, including technique effectiveness and local tumor progression (LTP), were evaluated.Results:Technique effectiveness was achieved in all the 11 patients (100%). During average follow-up period of 39.2 months (range 13-89 months), LTP occurred in none of the 11 patients. There were twelve minor complications in eight patients, including right shoulder pain (n = 4), right pleural effusion (n = 2), diaphragmatic thickening (n = 2), transient lung change (n = 2), subsegmental intrahepatic bile duct stricture (n = 1), and subsegmental hepatic infarction (n = 1). No major complications were encountered CONCLUSION: Combined TACE of the right IPA and RFA can be a safe and effective treatment for small HCC near the diaphragm that is supplied by the right IPA.
