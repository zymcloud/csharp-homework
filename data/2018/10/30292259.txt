Objective:To evaluate a dynamic contrast-enhanced CT-protocol and compare this method with standard of care monophasic portovenous CT for detection of colorectal liver metastases.Materials and methods:A dynamic contrast-enhanced CT protocol was developed to detect liver metastasis in patients suffering from colorectal cancer, in clinical practice. The study was approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. 135 patients were included in this prospective study. All patients were naive to treatment. A dynamic contrast-enhanced CT was performed, followed by routine monophasic portovenous CT of thorax-abdomen-pelvis. 42 of these patients presented with liver metastasis. The number and lesion conspicuity of detected liver metastasis on dynamic contrast-enhanced CT using perfusion maps, was compared to monophasic CT.Results:135 patients were included, of which 42 presented with metastases to the liver. Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT outperformed portovenous CT for detection as well as conspicuity of colorectal liver metastasis, at a relatively low dose increment. Wilcoxon Signed Rank test had a p-value of 0.016 and <0.001 respectively for detection and conspicuity of colorectal liver metastasis.Conclusion:Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT increases the detection of colorectal liver metastasis, especially for lesions smaller than 15 mm, when compared to monophasic portovenous CT. Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT also has the added advantage of improved lesion conspicuity, which can positively influence reader confidence and clinical workflow.
