Endometrial stromal sarcomas are rare tumors that may recur or metastasize many years after their initial presentation. Though most recurrences are within the pelvis, distant metastases can occur, and are most common to the lungs. Metastases to the liver are extremely rare. Herein we report two cases of endometrial stromal sarcoma with metastases to the liver without a prior history of endometriosis, accompanied by their histology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular analysis in the context of a relevant literature review.
Endometrial stromal sarcoma; Extra-pelvic; JAZF1-SUZ12 rearrangement; Metastases.
