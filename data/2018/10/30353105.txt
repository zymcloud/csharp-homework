Centrosome-associated proteins are recognized as prognostic factors in many cancers because centrosomes are critical structures for the cell cycle progression and genomic stability. SAC3D1, however, is associated with centrosome abnormality, although its prognostic potential has not been evaluated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, 3 independent cohorts (GSE10186, n = 80; TCGA, n = 330 and ICGC, n = 237) were used to assess SAC3D1 as a biomarker, which demonstrated SAC3D1 overexpression in HCC tissues when compared to the matched normal tissues. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis also showed that its overexpression was associated with poor prognosis of HCC with good discriminative ability in 3 independent cohorts (GSE10186, P = 0.00469; TCGA, P = 0.0000413 and ICGC, P = 0.0000114). Analysis of the C-indices and AUC values further supported its discriminative ability. Finally, multivariate analysis confirmed its prognostic significance (GSE10186, P = 0.00695; TCGA, P = 0.0000289 and ICGC, P = 0.0000651). These results suggest a potential of SAC3D1 as a biomarker for HCC.
