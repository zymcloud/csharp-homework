Background:To compare the clinical value of acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography and transient elastography (TE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence prediction after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and to investigate other predictors of HCC recurrence.Patients and methods:Between 2011 and 2016, 130 patients with HCC who underwent ARFI elastography and TE within 6 months before curative RFA were prospectively enrolled. Independent predictors of HCC recurrence were analyzed separately using ARFI elastography and TE. ARFI elastography and TE accuracy to predict HCC recurrence was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.Results:Of all included patients (91 men; mean age, 63.5 years; range: 43-84 years), 51 (42.5%) experienced HCC recurrence during the follow-up period (median, 21.9 months). In multivariable analysis using ARFI velocity, serum albumin and ARFI velocity [hazard ratios: 2.873; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.806-4.571; PConclusion:ARFI elastography and TE yield comparable predictors of HCC recurrence after RFA.
