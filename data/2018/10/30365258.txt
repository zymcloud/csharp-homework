Objective:To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the rhythm of running-wheel activity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mice and the expression of Per 1 and Per 2 (circadian rhythm genes) in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), so as to investigate its mechanism underlying regulating circadian rhythm.Methods:A total of 108 male C 57 BL / 6 J mice were randomly divided into control, HCC model and EA groups which were further assigned to six zeitbeger (environmental light-dark cycle) time (ZT) point (ZT 0, ZT 4, ZT 8, ZT 12, ZT 16 and ZT 20) subgroups. The HCC model was established by injection of H 22 cancer cell (abdominal 3rd generation, 10 µL) suspension into the larger live lobe. Mice of the control group received saline injection of the liver lobe. EA (2 Hz/15 Hz, 0.2 mA) was applied to bilateral "Ganshu" (BL 18) and "Zhiyang" (GV 9) for 15 min, once daily for 10 days. Mice of the control and model groups received the same binding-fixing to those of the EA group. Circadian running-wheel activity of 12 h∶12 h light darkness (LD) cycle (activity onset and acrophase of actogram, amplitude or peak of periodogram) was recorded by using ClockLab (ACT-500) software and analyzed by MATLAB (R 2007 b) before and after EA treatment. The pathological changes of liver cells were observed under light microscope after sectioning and H．E. staining. The expression levels of Per 1 mRNA and Per 2 mRNA in the liver tissues were determined by fluorogenic quantitative real time-PCR.Results:(1) Following modeling, the amplitude of periodogram of running-wheel activity was significantly lowered at ZT 0, ZT 4, ZT 8, ZT 12, ZT 16, and ZT 20 relevant to the control group (P<0.05). After EA intervention, the amplitude of periodogram at ZT 8 (15：00) was considerably increased relevant to the model group (P<0.05), and the acrophase at ZT 8 was remarkably advanced (P<0.05). No significant changes were found in the onset time and periods of periodogram at the 6 time-points after modeling and EA intervention (P>0.05). (2) The expression levels of Per 1 mRNA and Per 2 mRNA in the SCN were significantly up-regulated at the 6 time-points in the model group relevant to the control group (P<0.05), and obviously down-regulated at ZT 8 after EA intervention relevant to the model group (P<0.05)．.Conclusion:EA can benignly regulate the rhythm of running-wheel activity of HCC mice, which may be closely related to its effect in down-regulating the expression of circadian rhythm genes Per 1 and Per 2 in the SCN.
