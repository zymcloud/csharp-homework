The Notch signaling pathway plays a key role in cell proliferation and development that is closely related to an inverted CCAAT box binding protein (ICBP90), but little is known about whether there is a correlation between Notch signaling and ICBP90. The aim of the current study was to elucidate this. MTT assay and flow cytometry were used to determine the proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis of HepG2 or Hepa1-6 cells treated by N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), a specific inhibitor of the Notch pathway. RT-PCR, Western Blot and in situ immunofluorescence staining were employed to examine expression of ICBP90 in the cells. DAPT caused inhibition of the activation of the Notch signaling pathway, followed by preventing the cells at the G0/G1 phases to enter S and G2/M phases. ICBP90 and Hes-1 proteins were highly expressed in the untreated cells. The reduced levels of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) protein were observed in the DAPT-treated cells, thereby bringing about the down-regulation of ICBP90 with the increment of the DAPT dose. Consistent with this, knockdown of the Hes-1 gene, which encodes a critical transcriptional factor in the Notch pathway, also led to the attenuation of ICBP90. On the contrary, Jagged-1, a Notch ligand, facilitated ICBP90 production. Adriamycin could result in the reduction of ICBP90, which was not accompanied with the alteration of Hes-1. ICBP90 was almost fully distributed within the nuclei, but Hes-1 was visible within both the cytoplasm and nuclei. Our novel findings strongly indicate that inactivation of the Notch signaling pathway impedes hepatocellular carcinoma progress via reduction of ICBP90.
