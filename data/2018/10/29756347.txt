Oxidative stress has been hypothesized to affect cancer development via various mechanisms, but the evidence from human is limited and inconclusive. 15-F2t -isoprostane (15-F2t -IsoP) is an accurate marker of oxidative stress in humans. Recent studies showed that the evidence of urinary 15-F2t -IsoP level correlating cancer risk is conflicting. We conducted a case-control study nested within two population-based cohort studies. Pre-diagnosis urine samples, collected at cohort enrollment, from 363 incident liver cancer cases and 725 individually matched controls, were used to determine the level of 15-F2t -IsoP by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds ratio to measure the association between the urinary 15-F2t -IsoP level and liver cancer risk. We found that higher pre-diagnostic urinary 15-F2t -IsoP level was associated with an increased liver cancer risk, with an adjusted OR in males (OR4th vs. 1st quartile = 8.84, 95% CI 2.74-28.60), which was significantly higher than those in females (OR4th vs. 1st quartile = 1.75, 95% CI 0.70-4.42). HBsAg carriers with higher 15-F2t -IsoP had a significantly increased liver cancer risk (ORfemale = 59.04, 95% CI 12.26, 284.30; ORmale = 92.55, 95% CI 34.83, 245.96) compared to non-carriers with lower 15-F2t -IsoP. High urinary 15-F2t -IsoP level was associated with high liver cancer risk, suggesting that 15-F2t -IsoP may be a promising biomarker for liver cancer risk. The result suggests that people with sero-positive HBsAg and higher level of 15-F2t -IsoP might be given a higher priority on future surveillance program of liver cancer.
