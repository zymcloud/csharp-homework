Aim:To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) for decompensated liver cirrhosis.Methods:Consecutive patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis were included and assigned into the SCT group and non-transplantation (non-SCT) group according to whether they received SCT treatment. Patients were followed up for ten years. The long-term survival rate and incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were compared between groups.Results:A total of 159 patients were enrolled, including 27 cases in the SCT group and 132 cases in the non-SCT group. The baseline characteristics were significantly different between the two groups. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to match SCT and non-SCT patients. After PSM, 92 subjects were enrolled in the final analysis, including 23 cases in the SCT group and 69 cases in the non-SCT group. The overall mortality was 73.9% and 55.1%, and the median survival period was 48 and 64 mo, respectively. However, no significant difference was found in the long-term survival rate between the two groups (P > 0.05). In addition, the incidence of HCC was higher in the SCT group than in the non-SCT group (47.8% vs 21.7%, P < 0.05). After adjusting for other covariates, SCT (OR = 3.065, 95%CI: 1.378-6.814) and age (OR = 1.061, 95%CI: 1.021-1.102) were independently correlated with the development of HCC in this decompensated liver cirrhosis cohort.Conclusion:Autologous SCT may fail to improve the long-term efficacy and increase the incidence of HCC for decompensated liver cirrhosis. Close monitoring of HCC is strongly recommended in patients undergoing autologous SCT.
