In cancer treatment, herbal medicines may be a good choice because of the reduced risk of adverse side effects. Artemisia capillaris has been recognized as a promising candidate due to its hepatoprotective effects. Herein, we investigated whether A. capillaris-derived fraction (ACE-63) could inhibit the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its underlying mechanism. In this study, ACE-63 effectively inhibited the growth and proliferation of HCC cells. ACE-63 induced apoptosis, as observed using Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, which was accompanied with increases in cleaved Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3 in HCC cells. Additionally, the pro-apoptotic effect of ACE-63 was demonstrated by a decrease in the expression of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and survivin via a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. In an ex vivo model, ACE-63 significantly inhibited tumor cell growth and induced apoptosis by increasing the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation. In addition, ACE-63 decreased the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± and vascular endothelial growth factor and inhibited tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. A mechanistic study revealed that ACE-63 effectively suppressed the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways, which were observed as a target signaling by phosphokinase array. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that ACE-63 could not only efficiently induce apoptosis but also inhibit the growth/angiogenesis of human HCC cells by blocking the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, suggesting that ACE-63 may be a new chemotherapeutic candidate against HCC.
