Purpose:The prognostic value of tissue and serum osteopontin (OPN) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain controversial. The aim of present meta-analysis was to evaluate the prognostic value of OPN in patients with HCC.Methods:Eligible studies were systematically searched by PubMed, EMBASE, and Google scholar. A meta-analysis of 12 studies included 2117 cases was performed to estimate the association between OPN level and overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) in HCC patients. Subgroup analyses were also performed in the meta-analysis.Results:The pooled data of studies showed that high OPN level was significantly associated with poor OS (hazard ratios [HR] 1.84; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.54-2.20; P = .000) and DFS (HR 1.67; 95% CI 1.40-1.98; P = .000) in HCC. Furthermore, in subgroup analysis, high tissue based OPN by immunohistochemistry detection and serum-based OPN by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection were both significantly associated with OS (tissue: HR 1.88; 95% CI 1.53-2.31; P 5 cm; OR 2.001; 95% CI1.036-3.867).Conclusion:The current evidence indicates that OPN could serve as a prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for HCC.
