MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are solid factors involved in the initiation and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, miR-298 is recognized as a cancer-associated miRNA in breast, gastric and ovarian cancer. However, the functional role of miR-298 and its underlying mechanism are rarely reported in HCC. Herein, we found that the expression of miR-298 was down-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. The in vitro experiments showed that miR-298 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and induced G1 arrest and apoptosis of HCC cells. miR-298 knockdown exerted an opposite effect on these cellular behaviors of HCC cells. Moreover, miR-298 restoration suppressed HCC tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Additionally, catenin delta 1 (CTNND1) was demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-298 in HCC cells. CTNND1 knockdown led to similar effects with miR-298 overexpression on HCC cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and mobility. CTNND1 restoration reversed miR-298-induced inhibitory effects on HCC cells. Mechanistically, both miR-298 overexpression and CTNND1 knockdown repressed Wnt/β-catenin signaling and resulted in reduced expression of β-catenin, WNT11, Cyclin D1 and MMP7 in HCCLM3 cells. While, CTNND1 restoration abolished miR-298-induced inactivation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In conclusion, our findings provide the first evidence that miR-298 suppresses HCC progression at least partially by targeting CTNND1-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling. MiR-298 may be a target for new therapies in HCC patients.
