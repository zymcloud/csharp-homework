The complex pathophysiology in β-thalassemia can translate to multiple morbidities that affect every organ system. Improved survival due to advances in management means that patients are exposed to the harmful effects of ineffective erythropoiesis, anemia, and iron overload for a longer duration, and we started seeing new or more frequent complications in adult compared with younger patients. In this article, we highlight particular aspects of managing adult patients with β-thalassemia, using our own experience in treating such patients. We cover both transfusion-dependent and nontransfusion-dependent forms of the disease and tackle specific morbidities of highest interest.
