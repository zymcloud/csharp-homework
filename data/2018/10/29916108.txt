Background:Surgery remains the gold standard both for delimited hepatocellular carcinoma by selective anatomic liver segentectomy and for colorectal liver metastases by parenchymal sparing liver resection. Right anterior sector (RAS) (segments V-VIII; Couinaud) is the largest and most difficult sector to operate on. A better knowledge of its segmentation could prevent postoperative remnant liver ischemia and its impacts on patient's survival.Methods:A literature search was conducted in PubMed for papers on anatomy and surgery of the right anterior sector.Results:Segmentation of the RAS depended of the anatomic variations of the third-order portal branches. Cranio-caudal segmentation was the most commonly found (50-53%), followed by ventro-dorsal (23-26%), trifurcation (13-20%), and quadrifurcation types (5-11%). Ventral and dorsal partial or total subsegmentectomy seemed accessible in 47 to 50% of patients, including bifurcation, trifurcation, and quadrifurcation types, and could spare up to 22% of the total liver volume. The RAS hepatic vein was present in 85-100% of the patients and could be used as a landmark between RAS dorsal and ventral part in 63% of patients. Reported overall morbidity rate of RAS subsegmentectomy ranged from 33 to 59% among studies with a postoperative major complication rate (Clavien-Dindo â‰¥ III) ranging around 18% and a biliary leakage rate from 16 to 21%. In-hospital reported mortality rate was low (0-3%), and results were comparable to "classic" liver resections. RAS subsegmentectomy remains a complex procedure; median operating time ranged from 253 to 520 min and median intraoperative blood loss reached 1255 ml.Conclusion:Better knowledge of RAS anatomy could allow for parenchymal preservation by using subsegmentectomy of the RAS, selective or as a part of a major hepatectomy.
