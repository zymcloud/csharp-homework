Background:The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level has been used to identify at-risk patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) who need antiviral therapy. However, the level associated with increased liver-related mortality requiring active treatment is still unclear.Methods:We used a Health Examination Cohort of the National Health Insurance Service of Korea that included approximately 0.5 million individuals aged 40-79 years. In total, 12 486 patients with CHB and no other concurrent liver disease were enrolled, and patients' liver-related mortality, including that owing to liver cancer, was investigated over 9 years.Results:The serum ALT level was correlated positively with liver-related mortality. The rates in men were 0.14, 0.17, 0.24, 0.57, 0.63 and 0.85 per 100 person-years (%) for serum ALT levels of 34 U/L in men and >30 U/L in women.Conclusions:The liver-related mortality rate increased significantly, even in CHB patients with relatively low serum ALT levels. Careful monitoring or earlier antiviral therapy should be considered for patients aged >40 years with serum ALT levels above the upper limit of normal.
