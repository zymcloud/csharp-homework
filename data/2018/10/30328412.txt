BACKGROUND Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains difficult to diagnose at an early stage. Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) is an oxidoreductase that is upregulated in some chronic liver diseases. The aim of this study was to use immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression of AKR1B10 in liver tissue from patients with HCC of different stages. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty-four patients with a tissue diagnosis of HCC (35 males and 9 females) with 37 control samples of liver tissue containing liver cirrhosis were studied using immunohistochemistry for the expression of AKR1B10. Histological examination determined the grade of HCC; the stage of HCC was determined according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were measured and compared between the patients with HCC. RESULTS Immunohistochemistry showed increased expression of AKR1B10 in moderately-differentiated HCC compared with well-differentiated HCC, poorly-differentiated HCC, and liver cirrhosis (P
