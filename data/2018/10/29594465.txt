Few things in radiology are "pathognomonic" in their appearance or presentation. However, having an awareness of those findings which are specific to a certain entity is important when interpreting imaging studies. These classic findings can be identified with many imaging modalities, but no modality provides as many recognizable observations as an MRI. This results from the large variety of pulse sequences that provide high contrast resolution, prior to and following contrast administration. In this article, the most classically recognized abdominal findings are presented including the following: Liver: Cyst, hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatic adenoma, hemosiderosis, hepatocellular carcinoma. Spleen: Cyst, hemangioma, lymphangioma, hemosiderosis, Gandy-Gamna bodies. Biliary system: Biliary stones and choledocholithiasis, pneumobilia, choledochal cyst. Gallbladder: Adenomyomatosis, sludge, surgical clips in the gallbladder fossa. Pancreas: Pancreatic divisum, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, pseudocyst, autoimmune pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, adenocarcinoma. Kidneys: Simple cyst, hemorrhagic cyst, renal sinus cyst, angiomyolipoma, solid mass.
