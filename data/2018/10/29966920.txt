Sensitive detection of cancer cells is beneficial to the early diagnosis of cancer and individual treatment. In the present study, a DNA nanostructured aptasensor was used for the sensitive electrochemical detection of human liver hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) based on multibranched hybridization chain reaction amplification strategy. We established a well-designed platform by immobilizing DNA tetrahedron, a three-dimensional DNA nanostructure, on the gold electrode to capture HepG2 cells more specifically and efficiently. Meanwhile, functional hybrid nanoprobes consisted of MIL-101@AuNPs (Au nanoparticles), numerous hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzyme from multibranched hybridization chain reaction, and natural horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was designed. The hybrid nanoprobes possessed the functions of specific discernment and enzymatic signal amplification simultaneously. With the help of nanoprobes, HepG2 cells were recognized and captured to form a DNA tetrahedron-cell-nanoprobe sandwich-like structure on the electrode surface. The lower detection limit of this established cytosensor is 5 cells per ml. Moreover, it delivered a broad detection range from 102 to 107 cells per ml. The results revealed that the as-proposed cytosensor may be utilized as a powerful tool for early diagnosis of cancer in the future.
