Caffeic acid is a natural phytochemical structurally similar to other cinnamic acids. In this study we found caffeic acid (CA) but not ferulic, sinapic or cinnamic acids inhibited proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCC) and reduced cell numbers by inducing apoptosis. Only transient exposure to CA was required for these lethal effects that are associated with disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and induction of reactive oxygen species. By comparison, primary hepatocytes resisted CA toxicity for nearly 48 h, consistent with selective sensitivity of HCC to CA. These results support use of CA as an anti-tumor agent to inhibit HCC, especially if delivered by locoregional catheterization in an embolization procedure.
