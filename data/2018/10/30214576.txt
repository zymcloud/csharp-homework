Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV X protein (HBx) is an important carcinogen for HBV-induced HCC. When the HBx gene is integrated into the host cell genome, it is difficult to eradicate. The identification of an effective target to inhibit the oncogenic function of HBx is therefore critically important. The present study demonstrated that HBx, particularly truncated HBx, was expressed in several HBV-derived cell lines (e.g., Hep3B and SNU423). By analyzing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, it was revealed that high expression of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was associated with the process and prognosis of HCC. In vitro experiments confirmed that HBx could regulate the expression of HMGB1 and knockdown of HMGB1 could decrease the ability of HBx to promote cellular proliferation. HBx could also upregulate six transcription factors (GATA binding protein 3, Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3, heat shock transcription factor 1, nuclear factor ÎºB subunit 1, TATA-box binding protein and Kruppel-like factor 4), which could directly regulate HMGB1. By analyzing genes that are co-expressed with HMGB1, several signaling pathways associated with the development of HCC were identified. HBx and HMGB1 were revealed to be involved in these pathways, which may be the mechanism by which HBx promotes HCC by regulating HMGB1. These findings suggested that HMGB1 may be an effective target for inhibiting HBV-induced HCC.
