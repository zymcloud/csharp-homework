Jejunal varices are a rare manifestation of portal hypertension, and they are associated with a high mortality and poor prognosis when bleeding occurs. A bleeding jejunal varix is much more challenging to diagnose and manage because of its anatomic location. Herein, we describe the case of a 62-year-old man with active jejunal variceal bleeding who presented with massive hematochezia and hypovolemic shock. He was treated successfully with a high volume and concentration of a glue mixture as endoscopic sclerotherapy using single-balloon enteroscopy in the intensive care unit. Enteroscopic sclerotherapy is an effective option for jejunal variceal bleeding.
