Obesity is associated with cancer risk and its link with liver cancer is particularly strong. Obesity causes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that could progress to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Chronic inflammation likely plays a key role. We carried out a bioassay in the high-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6J mice to provide insight into the mechanisms of obesity-related HCC by studying γ-OHPdG, a mutagenic DNA adduct derived from lipid peroxidation. In an 80-week bioassay, mice received a low-fat diet (LFD), high-fat diet (HFD), and HFD with 2% Theaphenon E (TE) (HFD+TE). HFD mice developed a 42% incidence of HCC and LFD mice a 16%. Remarkably, TE, a standardized green tea extract formulation, completely blocked HCC in HFD mice with a 0% incidence. γ-OHPdG measured in the hepatic DNA of mice fed HFD and HFD+TE showed its levels increased during the early stages of NAFLD in HFD mice and the increases were significantly suppressed by TE, correlating with the tumor data. Whole-exome sequencing showed an increased mutation load in the liver tumors of HFD mice with G>A and G>T as the predominant mutations, consistent with the report that γ-OHPdG induces G>A and G>T. Furthermore, the mutation loads were significantly reduced in HFD+TE mice, particularly G>T, the most common mutation in human HCC. These results demonstrate in a relevant model of obesity-induced HCC that γ-OHPdG formation during fatty liver disease may be an initiating event for accumulated mutations that leads to HCC and this process can be effectively inhibited by TE.
