Objectives: In the present study, we aimed to identify the anti-proliferative potential of [Cu(L)(2imi)] complex [L = 2-(((5-chloro-2-oxyphenyl)imino)methyl)phenolato) and 2imi = 2-methyl imidazole] against HepG2 cells as an in vitro model of human hepatocellular carcinoma and normal mouse fibroblast L929 cells. Methods: The cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of [Cu(L)(2imi)] complex on HepG2 cells and normal fibroblasts (L929) were examined by MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Results: Cytotoxicity induced by [Cu(L)(2imi)] complex was time dependent. Also, there was a positive correlation between cytotoxicity and an increase in Cu complex concentration. For HepG2 cells, the cell viability percentage was 50% at 58 μg/mL after 24 h treatment, whereas in the same concentration and conditions, the viability percentage was surprisingly higher (about 100%) for L929 cells. Also, after 48 h treatment, the viability percentage of HepG2 cells at 55 μg/mL concentration was 50% in contrast with 89.3% for L929 cells in the same conditions. Flow cytometry findings suggest that [Cu(L)(2imi)] complex is capable of decreasing cancer cell viability through apoptosis and did not efficiently activate the necrosis process. Conclusions: Finally, we found that [Cu(L)(2imi)] complex possess the potential for development as an anti-cancer drug for human hepatocellular carcinoma.
