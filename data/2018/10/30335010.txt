Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is the most common genetic disease in Caucasians which is characterized by an increased intestinal iron absorption, resulting into a progressive accumulation of iron in organs including liver, heart, and pancreas, leading to their progressive dysfunction. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a long-term complication of HH, which contributes to increased mortality.We evaluated the risk factors of HCC in a prospective cohort of Swiss hemochromatosis patients with a long-term follow-up.We included 147 patients with the mean age at diagnosis of 48 years, in whom 70% were men. Overall, 9% of the patients developed HCC during the mean follow-up time of 14 years (range 1-40 years). Patients with HCC had higher age at diagnosis (61 ± 11 vs 47 ± 13 years, P = .003), more frequently liver cirrhosis on biopsy (90% vs 37.5%, P = .004), and higher serum ferritin levels [3704 (Q1:2025, Q3:4463) vs 1338 (Q1:691, Q3:2468) μg/L, P 1000 μg/L) require regular screening even if they have no liver cirrhosis.
