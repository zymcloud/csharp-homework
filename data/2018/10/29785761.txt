Aim:A sustained proportion of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients worldwide received either chemotherapy or sorafenib. However, to date, effective and convenient biomarkers to predict their therapeutic outcomes remained elusive. Hypothyroidism was associated with favorable anticancer treatment outcomes in several advanced cancers. Here, we aimed to investigate the potential of using thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 (FT4) levels as biomarkers to predict clinical outcomes in HCC patients receiving chemotherapy or sorafenib.Methods:Total 123 advanced HCC patients at Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer Stage C were included. They were separated into two cohorts, one treated by sorafenib (n = 62) and the other by chemotherapy (n = 61). Clinical data including TSH and FT4 were retrieved and correlated with treatment outcomes.Results:Because of restriction in local insurance policy, the baseline liver function reserve was better in patients receiving sorafenib. Therefore, the two cohorts were analyzed separately. The results showed that a higher (> median) TSH × FT4 value was independently associated with favorable time-to-tumor progression (P = 0.006) and overall survival (P = 0.002) if chemotherapy was provided; whereas it was associated with unfavorable time-to-tumor progression (P = 0.017) and overall survival (P = 0.001) if sorafenib was administrated. These opposite associations remained valid when patients with Child-Pugh class A liver function from either cohort were included for analysis.Conclusion:A novel thyroid function index, TSH × FT4, significantly predicted opposite clinical outcomes in advanced HCC patients receiving sorafenib or chemotherapy treatment.
