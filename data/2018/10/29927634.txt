Objective::To compare the diagnostic performance of non-contrast liver MRI to whole MRI using gadoxetic acid for detection of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatectomy.Methods::This retrospective study analyzed 483 patients who underwent surveillance with liver MRI after hepatectomy for HCC (median time interval, 7.7 months). Non-contrast MRI set (T1- and T2 weighted and diffusion-weighted images) and whole MRI set (gadoxetic acid-enhanced and non-contrast MRI) were analyzed independently by two observers. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used (with the observers' individual observations and consensus) to detect recurrent HCC. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated.Results::A total of 113 patients had 197 recurrent HCCs on first follow-up MRI. Although non-contrast MRI had fairly high sensitivity for recurrent HCC, there were significant differences in sensitivity (94.7% vs 99.1%, p = 0.025) and accuracy (97.5% vs 99.2%, p = 0.021) between the two image sets (per-patients base analysis). However, in patients followed for ≥1 year after surgery, the diagnostic performance of non-contrast MRI and whole MRI were not significantly different (p > 0.05).Conclusion::Non-contrast MRI may serve as an alternative follow-up method which can potentially replace whole MRI at least in selected patients followed up ≥1 year after surgery who have relatively lower risk of HCC recurrence.Advances in knowledge::There is no consensus regarding the ideal imaging modality or follow-up interval after resection of HCC. Non-contrast MRI had comparable performance to that of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI in the detection of HCC recurrence during surveillance ≥1 year after surgery.
