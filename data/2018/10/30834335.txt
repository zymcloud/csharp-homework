Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with a poor prognosis and a low chemotherapeutic efficiency except for when sorafenib is administered. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events (AEs) of sorafenib therapy in a Chinese population diagnosed with HCC.Method:Data for the subjects with HCC receiving sorafenib at Taichung Veterans General Hospital from June 2012 to October 2016 were evaluated. All enrolled cases belonged to the HCC Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification stage C. The AEs were defined as appearances of hand-foot syndrome reaction (HFSR), hypertension (HTN), or diarrhea. The exclusion criteria included a poor performance status, lack of compliance to drugs, and loss of follow-up within the following day.Results:Of a total of 116 subjects enrolled, there were 43 (37.1%), 13 (11.2%), and 15 (12.9%) cases experiencing HFSR, HTN, and diarrhea, respectively. The cases with AE had both a longer time to progression (TTP) (HFSR 5.16 vs. 3.33 months, P = 0.003; HTN 6.62 vs. 3.68 months, P = 0.001; diarrhea 6.67 vs. 3.61 months, P = 0.001) and overall survival (OS) (HFSR 8.12 vs. 4.75 months, P = 0.001; HTN 9.08 vs. 5.61 months, P = 0.008; diarrhea 8.20 vs. 5.67 months, P = 0.042) than those without. More AEs were correlated with a longer TTP and OS.Conclusion:The appearance of sorafenib AEs, including HFSR, HTN, and diarrhea, can predict a positive therapy efficacy to HCC.
