Purpose:Embolotherapies are commonly used for management of primary liver cancer. Explant studies of treated livers, however, reveal an untreated tumor in a high fraction of cases. To improve on this, we propose a new concept referred to as thermoembolization. In this technique, the embolic material reacts in local tissues. Highly localized heat energy is released simultaneously with the generation of acid in the target vascular bed. Combined with ischemia, this should provide a multiplexed attack. We report herein our initial results testing the feasibility of this method in vivo.Materials and methods:Institutional approval was obtained, and three outbred swine were treated in a segmental hepatic artery branch (right or left medial lobe) with thermoembolic material (100, 400, or 500 ÂµL). Solutions (2 or 4 mol/L) of an acid chloride were made using ethiodized oil as the vehicle. Animals were housed overnight, scanned by CT, and euthanized. Necropsy samples of treated tissue were obtained for histologic analysis.Results:All animals survived the procedure. Vascular stasis occurred rapidly in all cases despite the small volumes used. The lower concentration (2 mol/L) penetrated more distally than the 4 mol/L solution. At CT the following day, vascular casts of ethiodized oil were observed, indicating recanalization had not occurred. Histology specimens demonstrated coagulative necrosis centered on the vessel lumen extending for several hundred microns with a peripheral inflammatory infiltrate.Conclusions:Thermoembolization is a new technique for embolization with initial promise. However, results indicate much work must be done to optimize the technique.
