CAMP responsive element binding protein 5 (CREB5) has been reported to be overexpressed in several types of human cancers and has crucial roles in regulating cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and the cell cycle. However, the expression and function of CREB5 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of CREB5 in HCC, and its prognostic significance. We measured the expression of CREB5 in 91 specimens of paraffin-embedded HCC tissue by immunohistochemistry and performed a clinicopathological analysis. Gain of function and loss of function assays were used to evaluate the effect of CREB5 on cell proliferation in vitro. We found that up-regulation of CREB5 was associated with a poor prognosis, and CREB5 status was an independent prognostic factor. The overexpression of CREB5 increased the proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells, but the knockdown of CREB5 had the opposite effect. The results indicate that CREB5 may be useful when determining a treatment strategy for patients with HCC.
