Background:The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) used to be poor, but it has recently improved, which has meant that clinicians have greater opportunity to treat spinal metastases and the associated epidural spinal cord compression. However, there have been few systematic functional studies about HCC-derived spinal metastases. The treatment outcomes of surgical treatment for HCC-derived metastatic spinal tumors were investigated.Methods:The post-treatment survival period and pain, paralysis, and disturbance of activities of daily living (ADL) were investigated in 60 patients (surgery 25, conservative treatment 35).Results:The mean post-treatment survival period was 7.4 Â± 8.2 months (range 0.3-36 months). Univariate analysis indicated that the following factors influenced survival: the patient's general condition, presence/absence of major internal organ metastasis, serum albumin level, Child-Pugh classification, surgical treatment for spinal metastasis, and bone-modifying agent treatment. In the multivariate analysis of these 6 items, 3 significant factors were extracted: the patient's general condition, the serum albumin level, and bone-modifying agent treatment. Pain significantly improved in both groups (p Conclusion:Most patients exhibited poor survival. In the conservative treatment group, paralysis was significantly aggravated, and little improvement was seen in the patients' ADL abilities. In the surgical group, the patients' ADL abilities improved significantly, but their paralysis did not. Therefore, surgery should be actively performed for HCC-derived spinal metastasis whenever it is indicated.
