Introduction and aim:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a lethal malignancy, but the molecular mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis remain undefined. The present study aims to investigate the relationship between polymorphisms of the hepatic lipase (HL) gene promoters and risk of HCC.Material and methods:Totally, 279 HCC patients and 200 healthy individuals were enrolled. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) was used to analyze the genotypes of HL gene. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify risk factors of HCC.Results:There was significant difference in the distribution of smoking history, drinking history, and family history of subjects between the case and control groups (all p < 0.05). Difference in the -250G/A (p = 0.011; OR = 1.61; 95%CI: 1.11-2.34) and -514C/T (p = 0.007; OR = 1.65; 95%CI: 1.14-2.38) genotypes and allele frequencies between two groups was significant. A higher risk of HCC was identified in those with polymorphisms in the - 250G/A (p = 0.007; OR = 1.45; 95%CI: 1.11-1.89) and -514C/T (p = 0.003; OR = 1.51; 95%CI: 1.15-2.00). Polymorphisms at - 250G/A (GA + AA) (p = 0.025; OR = 1.55; 95%CI: 1.06-2.28), -514C/T (CT + TT) (p = 0.021; OR = 1.57; 95%CI: 1.07-2.29), smoking history (p = 0.017; OR = 1.70; 95%CI: 1.10-2.63) and drinking history (p = 0.003; OR = 2.04; 95%CI: 1.27-3.27) were significantly related to the risk of HCC (all p < 0.05).Conclusion:The results obtained from this study indicated that polymorphisms of -250G/A and -514C/T in HL gene promoters were associated with the risk of HCC.
