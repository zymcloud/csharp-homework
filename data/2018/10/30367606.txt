Background:The 2-week schedule of hypofractionated radiotherapy as a salvage treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has previously exhibited promising results; this study aimed to assess its long-term clinical outcomes in patients with recurrent HCC ineligible for curative treatments.Methods:We retrospectively enrolled 77 patients (84 lesions) with HCC who were treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy between December 2008 and July 2013. Primary inclusion criteria were HCC unsuitable for curative treatments and HCC located within 2 cm of a critical normal organ. We administered 3.5-5 Gy/fraction for 2 weeks, resulting in a total dose of 35-50 Gy.Results:The median follow-up period was 33.6 (range, 4.8-78.3) months. The 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 52.3% and 40.9%, respectively, and local control rates were 79.5% and 72.6% in all treated lesions, respectively. The 5-year local control rate was better in the higher radiation dose group than in the lower radiation dose group (50 Gy: 79.7% vs. Conclusions:The 2-week schedule of hypofractionated radiotherapy for recurrent HCC exhibited good local control and acceptable treatment-related toxicity during the long-term follow-up period. Thus, this fractionation schedule can be a potential salvage treatment option for recurrent HCC, particularly for tumors located close to a radiosensitive gastrointestinal organ.
