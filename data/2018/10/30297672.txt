Proteoglycans, which consist of a protein core and glycosaminoglycan chains, are major components of the extracellular matrix and play physiological roles in maintaining tissue homeostasis. In the carcinogenic tissue microenvironment, proteoglycan expression changes dramatically. Altered proteoglycan expression on tumor and stromal cells affects cancer cell signaling pathways, which alters growth, migration, and angiogenesis and could facilitate tumorigenesis. This dysregulation of proteoglycans has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the underlying mechanism has been studied extensively. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the roles of proteoglycans in the genesis and progression of HCC. It focuses on well-investigated proteoglycans such as serglycin, syndecan-1, glypican 3, agrin, collagen XVIII/endostatin, versican, and decorin, with particular emphasis on the potential of these factors as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in HCC regarding the future perspective of precision medicine toward the "cure of HCC".
