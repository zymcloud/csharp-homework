Purpose/objectives:There is little consensus regarding the application of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) in pediatrics. We evaluated patterns of pediatric SRT practice through an international research consortium.Materials and methods:Eight international institutions with pediatric expertise completed a 124-item survey evaluating patterns of SRT use for patients 21 years old and younger. Frequencies of SRT use and median margins applied with and without SRT were evaluated.Results:Across institutions, 75% reported utilizing SRT in pediatrics. SRT was used in 22% of brain, 18% of spine, 16% of other bone, 16% of head and neck, and <1% of abdomen/pelvis, lung, and liver cases across sites. Of the hypofractionated SRT cases, 42% were delivered with definitive intent. Median gross tumor volume to planning target volume margins for SRT versus non-SRT plans were 0.2 versus 1.4 cm for brain, 0.3 versus 1.5 cm for spine/other bone, 0.3 versus 2.0 cm for abdomen/pelvis, 0.7 versus 1.5 cm for head and neck, 0.5 versus 1.7 cm for lung, and 0.5 versus 2.0 cm for liver sites.Conclusions:SRT is commonly utilized in pediatrics across a range of treatment sites. Margins used for SRT were substantially smaller than for non-SRT planning, highlighting the utility of this approach in reducing treatment volumes.
