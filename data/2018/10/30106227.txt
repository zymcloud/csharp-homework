Neutral sphingomyelinase 1 (NSMase1) mediates caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. However, the role of NSMase1, especially exosome-borne NSMase1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), remains unclear. We report that NSMase1, which converts sphingomyelin (SM) to ceramide, was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues. Low NSMase1 expression predicted poor long-term survival of HCC patients. NSMase1 downregulation in HCC resulted in increased SM and reduced ceramide (Cer) that led to an increased SM/Cer ratio. Interestingly, NSMase1 and NSMase activity were also decreased in exosomes isolated from HCC tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, NSMase activity increased in exosomes isolated from the culture medium of L02 cells transfected with pEGFP-C3-NSMase1 (NSMase1-Exo). NSMase1-Exo suppressed HCC cell growth and induced apoptosis via reduction of the SM/Cer ratio. Thus, NSMase1 in exosomes inhibits HCC growth by decreasing the SM/Cer ratio.
