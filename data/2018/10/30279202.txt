Background: Linc-ITGB1 is a newly identified long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) involved in the regulation of cell migration and invasion of gallbladder cancer cell lines, while its involvement in human hepatoma carcinoma (HCC) is unknown. Methods: In the present study, HCC patient tumor tissues, adjacent healthy tissues and whole blood were collected from both HCC patients and healthy controls. Expression of LINC-ITGB1 was examined by qRT-PCR. Diagnostic value of serum LINC-ITGB1 for HCC was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Correlation between the serum LINC-ITGB1 and basic clinical information of patients was analyzed by chi-square test. LINC-ITGB1 overexpression HCC cell lines were established and the effects on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were explored by CCK-8 assay and Transwell assay. Effects of LINC-ITGB1 overexpression on Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) expression were investigated by Western blot. Results: We found that LINC-ITGB1 was up-regulated in tumor tissues than in adjacent healthy tissues. Serum levels of LINC-ITGB1 were higher in HCC patients than in healthy controls. Serum levels of LINC-ITGB1 were significantly correlated with tumor size and distant tumor metastasis. LINC-ITGB1 overexpression promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells and the expression of ROCK1. ROCK1 inhibitor reduced the effects of LINC-ITGB1 overexpression on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Conclusion: We conclude that lncRNA LINC-ITGB1 can promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells by up-regulating ROCK1.
