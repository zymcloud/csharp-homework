Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. MiR-299-5p has been demonstrated to play important roles in multiple human cancers. Nevertheless, little is known about the detailed function and molecular mechanism of miR-299-5p on HCC progression.Methods:Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay was used to assess the expression patterns of miR-299-5p and siah E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (SIAH1) in HCC tissues and cell lines. Loss-of-function experiments were performed to explore the effect of miR-299-5p on HCC progression in vitro and in vivo. Target predicted by software algorithms, the connection between miR-299-5p and SIAH1 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. Subsequently, anti-miR-299-5p and si-SIAH1 were cotransfected into LM9 and Huh-7 cells to further explore whether the regulatory effect of miR-299-5p on HCC was mediated by SIAH1.Results:qRT-PCR assay revealed that miR-299-5p was upregulated and SIAH1 was downregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Moreover, miR-299-5p knockdown suppressed HCC progression in vitro and in vivo. In addition, anti-miR-299-5p-mediated regulatory effect on HCC cells was abated following the restoration of SIAH1 expression.Conclusions:MiR-299-5p knockdown suppressed the progression of HCC by targeting SIAH1, highlighting its role as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target of HCC.
