Background:Multimodal strategy including chemotherapy and hepatectomy is advocated for the management of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of neoadjuvant Bevacizumab-based chemotherapy on survival in patients with resected stage IVA colorectal cancer and liver metastases.Methods:Data from 120 consecutive patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent curative-intent hepatectomy for synchronous CRLM were retrospectively reviewed. Overall survival (OS) was stratified according to administration of Bevacizumab before liver resection and surgical strategy, i.e., classical strategy (primary tumor resection first) versus reverse strategy (liver metastases resection first).Results:Patients who received Bevacizumab (n = 37; 30%) had a higher number of CRLM (p = 0.003) and underwent more often reverse strategy (p = 0.005), as compared to those who did not (n = 83; 70%). Bevacizumab was associated with an improved OS compared with conventional chemotherapy (p = 0.04). After stratifying by the surgical strategy, Bevacizumab was associated with improved OS in patients who had classical strategy (p = 0.03). In contrast, Bevacizumab had no impact on OS among patients who had liver metastases resection first (p = 0.89).Conclusions:Neoadjuvant Bevacizumab-based chemotherapy was associated with improved OS in patients who underwent liver resection of synchronous CRLM, especially in those who underwent primary tumor resection first.
