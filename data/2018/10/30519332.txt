Purpose: Single nucleotide variations in the liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP, FABP1) gene lead to changes in cellular signaling pathways and lipid metabolism. FABP1 polymorphisms were associated with some liver diseases, like steatotic hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the association between FABP1 rs1545224 and rs2241883 polymorphisms and hepatitis B virus-related liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been reported. We performed this study to explore their relationship. Methods: One thousand individuals (250 healthy controls, 250 chronic HBV (CHB), 250 LC, and 250 HCC patients) were recruited. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were applied to assess the difference in allele and genotype frequencies. Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to evaluate the cumulative effect. Significant difference would be defined when the P value was less than 0.05. Results: The distribution of rs1545224 GG, AG and AA genotypes in healthy controls or CHB carriers was not significant when compared to LC or HCC patients (P>0.05). LC patients carrying at least one A allele are more likely to develop HCC in contrast with those with G allele (P<0.05). After adjustment for confounders, meaningful results were only seen in the comparison between rs1545224 AG+AA genotype carriers and GG genotype carriers among the LC patients (P<0.05). Rs2241883 polymorphism did not influence the risk of developing LC or HCC in healthy and CHB individuals, nor did it influence the risk of HCC in LC patients (P>0.05). Conclusions: Taken together, FABP1 rs1545224 polymorphism might increase HCC risk in LC patients, indicating that FABP1 rs1545224 polymorphism may be related to the process of developing HCC in Chinese patients with LC.
