Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the most severe form of sleep disordered breathing, is characterized by intermittent hypoxia during sleep (IH), sleep fragmentation, and episodic hypercapnia. OSA is associated with increased risk for morbidity and mortality affecting cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurocognitive systems, and more recently with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cancer-related deaths. Substantial variability in OSA outcomes suggests that genetically-determined and environmental and lifestyle factors affect the phenotypic susceptibility to OSA. Furthermore, OSA and obesity often co-exist and manifest activation of shared molecular end-organ injury mechanisms that if properly identified may represent potential therapeutic targets. A challenge in the development of non-invasive diagnostic assays in body fluids is the ability to identify clinically relevant biomarkers. Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) include a heterogeneous population of vesicular structures including exosomes, prostasomes, microvesicles (MVs), ectosomes and oncosomes, and are classified based on their size, shape and membrane surface composition. Of these, exosomes (30-100nm) are very small membrane vesicles derived from multi-vesicular bodies or from the plasma membrane and play important roles in mediating cell-cell communication via cargo that includes lipids, proteins, mRNAs, miRNAs and DNA. We have recently identified a unique cluster of exosomal miRNAs in both humans and rodents exposed to intermittent hypoxia as well as in patients with OSA with divergent morbid phenotypes. Here we summarize such recent findings, and will focus on exosomal miRNAs in both adult and children which mediate intercellular communication relevant to OSA and endothelial dysfunction, and their potential value as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.
