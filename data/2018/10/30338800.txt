Objective:To investigate the regulatory effect of miR-328 on biological behaviors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, such as invasion and proliferation.Patients and methods:The expressions of miR-328 were detected in 48 pairs of HCC tissue samples and matched adjacent tissues, as well as in 3 kinds of HCC cell lines via quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Further, we analyzed the effects of miR-328 inhibition on cell invasion, proliferation, cell apoptosis, and cell cycle. Dual-luciferase activity assay was performed to examine the potential target gene PTEN which was predicted by an online database. Protein levels were detected using Western blot assay.Results:The expression of miR-328 was significantly increased in HCC tissue samples. Decreased miR-328 in HCC cells significantly attenuated cell invasion and proliferation capacities, promoted cell apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. Moreover, PTEN was verified as a target gene of miR-328 by dual-luciferase activity assay, qRT-PCR and Western blot. Furthermore, the silence of PTEN neutralized the suppressive effect of decreased miR-328 on cell growth and metastasis.Conclusions:MiR-328 is involved in the development of HCC via regulating PTEN, which might provide a new target for HCC diagnosis and therapy.
