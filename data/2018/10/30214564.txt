This study aimed to investigate the correlation between CT features and liver function and p53 expression in hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Forty patients with HCC, 30 patients with cirrhosis and 30 patients with chronic hepatitis were enrolled between December, 2015 and December, 2016. At the same time, normal liver tissues collected from 30 patients with hepatic hemangioma were used as the normal control group. All the patients were scanned by CT. Average body surface area, left outer lobe and caudate lobe volume, and the proportions of left outer lobe and caudate lobe to the whole liver were calculated. Biochemical indexes of liver function were determined. The pathological tissues of all the subjects were analyzed. Compared with the control group, total liver volume of the HCC group was significantly reduced (P
