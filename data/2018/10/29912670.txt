Lycii Fructus is the dried ripe fruits of Lycium chinense and L. barbarum, which has long been used as a traditional food material in East Asia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the indirect antioxidative action in the Lycii fructus extract (LFE)-induced cytoprotective effect in vitro. LFE significantly enhanced the expression of the drug-metabolizing enzyme genes and intracellular glutathione level in mouse hepatoma Hepa1c1c7 cells. LFE stimulated the nuclear translocation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor as well as nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2. The pretreatment of LFE for 24 h, but not for 30 min, completely inhibited the cytotoxic effect of hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, chlorogenic acid, one of the main constituents of LFE, showed cytoprotection against hydrogen peroxide with the enhanced phase 2 enzyme gene expression. These results suggested that LFE exhibits a cytoprotective effect, possibly through the enhancement of the antioxidant gene expression.Abbreviations:LFE: Lycii Fructus extract; GSH: glutathione; NQO1: NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1; HO-1: heme oxygenase-1; GCLC: glutamate-cysteine ligase, catalytic subunit; xCT: a component of cysteine/glutamate antiporter (cystine/glutamate exchanger); CYP1A1: cytochrome P450 1A1; GSH: glutathione; AhR: aryl hydrocarbon receptor; Nrf2: nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2; CGA: chlorogenic acid; RT-PCR: reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; DTT: dithiothreitol; PMSF: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; ARE: antioxidant response element; XRE: xenobiotic responsive element.
