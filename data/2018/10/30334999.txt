Rationale:Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) with metastases to the right atrium (RA) and lungs are rare, with a poor prognosis. Furthermore, the treatment outcomes in patients with advanced HCCs remain unsatisfactory.Patient concerns:A 46-year-old man presented to our hospital for dyspnea on exertion and abdominal pain.Diagnoses:HCC and extra-hepatic metastases to the lung and RA.Interventions:Multidisciplinary treatment including radiotherapy (RT), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and sorafenib. During a follow-up evaluation computed tomography, he experienced a radio-contrast-induced anaphylaxis. After the event, treatment such as RT, TACE, and sorafenib were continued.Outcomes:His tumor burden decreased, finally leading to a complete response as per the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. The patient is still alive, 30 months after the episode. Subsequent blood tests showed increased natural killer (NK) cell activity, which was significantly higher than that seen in other age-matched HCC patients with an identical stage of the tumor, receiving sorafenib. This suggests that the increase in NK cells induced by anaphylaxis influenced the tumor burden.Lessons:We report here a rare case of long-term survival of an HCC patient with multiple metastases treated with multidisciplinary modalities, in which high NK cell activity was observed after a radio-contrast-induced anaphylactic reaction during follow-up investigations.
