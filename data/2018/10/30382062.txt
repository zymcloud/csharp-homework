We report a case of effective treatment comprising mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab for neuroendocrine carcinoma of the ascending colon. A 60-year-old woman was admitted for diarrhea and abdominal pain. Colonoscopy showed a Type 2 tumor in the ascending colon. She was diagnosed with neuroendocrine cell carcinoma based on biopsy and immunostaining. CT and MRI showed liver metastasis and lymph node #12a metastasis. Right hemi-colectomy, lymphadenectomy, and partial hepatectomy were performed(T4a, N2, M1b, Stage IV). Neuroendocrine cell carcinoma(small-cell type)was finally diagnosed based on a histological examination because the nuclear fission image was 30(/10HPF)and the Ki-67 index was 42%. Three months after the surgery, multiple lymph node metastases were found using CT and MRI. mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab was initiated. After 4 courses of the chemotherapy, the metastases responded completely. A total of 10 courses of chemotherapy were administered. About 2 years and 6 months after the surgery, no recurrence is allowed.
