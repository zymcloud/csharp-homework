Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key regulators in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we explored the expression profile and biological role of lncRNA FEZF1-AS1 in HCC. We observed remarkable upregulation of FEZF1-AS1 in HCC tissues and cell lines, and high FEZF1-AS1 expression was correlated with aggressive phenotypes and poor prognosis of HCC patients. Furthermore, we found that FEZF1-AS1 knockdown markedly inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells by inducing cell cycle arrest. In addition, FEZF1-AS1 knockdown suppressed HCC tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, FEZF1-AS1 knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of HCC cells through suppression of JAK2/STAT3 signaling-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In conclusion, the present study for the first time demonstrated that FEZF1-AS1 serves as an oncogenic lncRNA in human HCC and implicated FEZF1-AS1 as a valuable therapeutic target for HCC treatment.
