Background:This study compared the impact of neoadjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and adjuvant RT on survival for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Patients with HCC were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. The Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to compare the impact of neoadjuvant RT on survival with adjuvant RT. Subsequently, a propensity score-matched analysis was performed to confirm the result.Results:A total of 244 patients with HCC identified from the SEER database (2004-2014) received preoperative or post-operative radiation. A total of 151 patients received post-operative RT and 93 patients received preoperative RT. Preoperative RT had a clear superiority in terms of unadjusted overall survival and cancer-specific survival (P Conclusion:We found that neoadjuvant RT was associated with improved long-term survival for patients with HCC versus adjuvant RT.
