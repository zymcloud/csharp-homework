Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is now the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally and many patients have incurable disease. HCC predominantly occurs in the setting of liver cirrhosis and is a paradigm for inflammation-induced cancer. The causes of chronic liver disease promote the development of transformed or premalignant hepatocytes and predisposes to the development of HCC. For HCC to grow and progress it is now clear that it requires an immunosuppressive niche within the fibrogenic microenvironment of cirrhosis. The rationale for targeting this immunosuppression is supported by responses seen in recent trials with checkpoint inhibitors. With the impact of immunotherapy, HCC progression may be delayed and long term durable responses may be seen. This makes the management of the underlying liver cirrhosis in HCC even more crucial as studies demonstrate that measures of liver function are a major prognostic factor in HCC. In this review, we discuss the development of cancer in the setting of liver inflammation and fibrosis, reviewing the microenvironment that leads to this tumourigenic climate and the implications this has for patient management.
