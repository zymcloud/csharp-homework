Purpose:The purpose of our study was to correlate the quantitative analysis of benign hepatocellular tumor uptake on delayed hepatobiliary phase (HBP) imaging with the quantitative level of OATP expression.Methods:This single-center retrospective study, which took place between September 2009 and March 2015, included 20 consecutive patients with a proven pathologic and immunohistochemical (IHC) diagnosis of FNH or HCA, including quantification of the OATP expression. The patients underwent Gd-BOPTA-enhancement MRI, including an HBP. The analysis of HBP uptake was performed using the liver-to-lesion contrast enhancement ratio (LLCER). Mean LLCER and OATP expressions were compared between FNH and HCA, and the expression of OATP was correlated with the LLCER value.Results:Of the 23 benign hepatocellular tumors, 9 (39%) were FNH and 14 (61%) were HCA, including 6 inflammatory, 2 HNF1a inactivated, 3 β-catenin-mutated and 3 unclassified HCAs. On HBP, 100% of the FNH appeared hyper- or isointense, and 79% of the adenomas appeared hypointense. The mean OATP expression of FNH (46.67 ± 26.58%) was significantly higher than that of HCA (22.14 ± 30.74%) (p = 0.0273), and the mean LLCER of FNH (10.66 ± 7.403%) was significantly higher than that of HCA (-13.5 ± 12.25%) (p Conclusion:In benign hepatocellular tumors, the quantitative analysis of hepatobiliary contrast agent uptake on HBP is correlated with the level of OATP expression and could be used as an imaging biomarker of the molecular background of HCA and FNH.Key points:• Gd-BOPTA uptake on HBP correlates with the OATP level in benign hepatocellular tumors • FNH and β-catenin-mutated HCA showed an increased lesion-to-liver contrast enhancement ratio (LLCER) • Increased LLCER may be explained by activation of the Wnt β-catenin pathway.
