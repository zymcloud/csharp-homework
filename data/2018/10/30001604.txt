Galactomannan isolated from the fruit rind of Punica granatum was previously reported to have excellent antioxidant, immunomodulatory and anticancer properties against both human and murine cancer cells. This polysaccharide was proved to be an anticancer agent either alone or as an adjuvant to chemotherapy. An exploration leads to the fabrication of silver nanoparticles with an average size around 30 nm and a negative surface charge of 35.2 mV using this biopolymer which acted both as reducing and capping agent and displayed good stability and biocompatibility. UV-vis spectrum of the aqueous medium containing silver nanoparticles showed an absorption peak at around 440 nm. The nanoparticles displayed an upgraded and selective cytotoxicity towards human adenocarcinoma, colorectal carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The induction of cancer cell toxicity was proved to be through the induction of programmed cell death pathway mediated with the active involvement of caspases. The significant anti-metastatic properties will further favour the safer in vivo application of these silver nanoparticles against neoplasia. The nontoxic nature of polysaccharide endowed the resultant silver nanoparticles with excellent biocompatibility towards red blood cells and extended the biomedical potential of this candidate. Hence, the surfactant-free green method mediated orchestration of biogenic silver nanoparticles resembled a potential theransonstic nano-construct with synergistic anticancer and immunomodulatory potential in a single platform.
