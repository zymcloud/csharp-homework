Aim:To explore JNK1/2 and ERK1/2 activation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Patients & methods:Phosphorylated-JNK1/2 and -ERK1/2 (p-JNK1/2 and p-ERK1/2) expressions were determined and analyzed in 104 unique HCC tissue specimens.Results:Expression of p-JNK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 was not correlated with clinicopathological characteristics. High p-JNK1/2 and low p-ERK1/2 expressions predicated significantly lower tumor recurrence for HCC patients. However, HCC patients with low p-JNK1/2 and high p-ERK1/2 had higher tumor recurrence. Moreover, p-JNK1/2 positively, but p-ERK1/2 negatively, associated with overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in HCC patients. In addition, HCC patients with simultaneous low p-JNK1/2 and high p-ERK1/2 had poorer OS and RFS. On the contrary, patients with high p-JNK1/2 and low p-ERK1/2 presented better OS and RFS.Conclusion:HCC patients with low p-JNK1/2 and high p-ERK1/2 either independently or simultaneously, had significantly higher tumor recurrence and worse OS.
