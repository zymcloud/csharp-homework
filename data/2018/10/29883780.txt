Arginase-1 has been demonstrated as a marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with higher sensitivity and specificity than HepPar-1 and glypican-3. However, its sensitivity is diminished in moderately and poorly differentiated HCCs. In the current study, we evaluated the utility of AGXT1 as a diagnostic marker. Immunostains for AGXT1 and arginase-1 were performed in tissue microarrays of 139 HCCs and 374 gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal carcinomas. AGXT1 exhibited granular cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in contrast to the diffuse cytoplasmic staining characteristic of arginase-1 in nonneoplastic and neoplastic hepatocytes. Sensitivities of AGXT1 for all HCCs were 90.0% compared to 87.8% for arginase-1. A small number of tumors expressed only 1 of the 2 markers. Sensitivity increased to 92.1% when the presence of either marker was considered positive. Excepting 5 cases of cholangiocarcinoma, both AGXT1 and arginase-1 were negative in all non-HCC tumors with specificities of 98.7%. Our data support the consideration of AGXT1 as a novel hepatocellular marker with equally high specificity and slightly higher sensitivity as compared to arginase-1. AGXT1 may aid in diagnostic workup especially in conjunction with arginase-1 for HCCs that may otherwise defy conventional immunostaining patterns.
