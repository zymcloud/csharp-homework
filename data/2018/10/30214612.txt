The present study aimed to investigate the prognostic factors for recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following curative resection, and evaluate the efficacy of postoperative adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in improving prognosis. A total of 166 patients who underwent curative resection followed by adjuvant TACE, and 190 patients who underwent curative resection alone were studied retrospectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate the risk factors of recurrence. Separated based on risk factors, subgroup studies were conducted and the association between TACE and recurrence rates was examined. Postoperative overall survival rates were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method and differences between the two therapeutic strategies were identified through log-rank analysis. Computerized tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images were used to evaluate the function of postoperative adjuvant TACE for enhancing the efficacy of CT/MRI in detecting recurrence. The results of the univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that tumor capsule invasion, vascular invasion, and multiple nodules were risk factors of early recurrence. For patients with these risk factors, recurrence rates were markedly decreased at 6 and 12 months, but not at 18 and 24 months, if TACE was added to curative resection. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) was a risk factor for late recurrence. Postoperative TACE was not effective in reducing the recurrence rate in patients with HBV. Survival increased following curative resection with TACE compared with curative resection alone. Furthermore, adjuvant TACE enhanced the efficacy of CT/MRI in detecting recurrence. Postoperative adjuvant TACE may improve the prognosis of HCC following curative resection.
