Background:Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in disease occurrence. However, the roles of circRNAs in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are largely unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical diagnostic values of hsa_circ_0068669 (Alias: hsa_circ_103561), one of the representative HCC-associated circRNAs.Methods:Hsa_circ_0068669 expression levels in HCC tissues, HCC cell lines, and chronic hepatitis tissues were detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Its expression levels between HCC tissues and adjacent non-tumorous tissues were analyzed using paired t test. Independent t test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed to analyze the relationships between hsa_circ_0068669 expression levels and clinicopathological factors of patients with HCC. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was established to estimate the value of hsa_circ_0068669 as a biomarker in HCC.Results:Hsa_circ_0068669 expression was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues and HCC cell lines compared with paired non-tumorous tissues and normal hepatic cell line, respectively. Moreover, hsa_circ_0068669 expression in HCC tissues was decreased comparing with chronic hepatitis tissues. Furthermore, hsa_circ_0068669 expression was correlated with microvascular invasion and TNM stages.Conclusions:Our findings indicate that hsa_circ_0068669 might be served as a novel potential biomarker for HCC metastasis.
