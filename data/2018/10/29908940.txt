Background:Because of the mutual influence of liver dysfunction and malignancy, overall survival (OS) is a composite clinical endpoint in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We developed a nomogram integrating albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade, a new index of hepatic reserve, and tumor characteristics of HCC for predicting OS following curative liver resection.Methods:The nomogram was built to estimate the probabilities of 1, 3, and 5-y OS based on training cohort of 709 HCC, which was validated in an international independent dataset. The prognostic value of the nomogram was determined by concordance index (C-index), time-dependent receiver operating characteristics (tdROC), and decision curves, comparing with ALBI grade alone, the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP), the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC), and Okuda staging systems.Results:Independent factors derived from multivariable Cox analysis of the training cohort to predict OS were tumor grade, microvascular invasion, tumor size and ALBI grade which were assembled into nomogram. The calibration curves for probability of OS showed optimal agreement between nomogram-prediction and actual observation, which was tested in validation cohort. The C-index, tdROC and decision curves showed the nomogram was superior to CLIP, ALBI grade, BCLC and Okuda. The patients could also be stratified into low, intermediate risk, and high risk of the mortality by the normogram in both development and validation cohorts.Conclusions:The nomogram integrating hepatic reserve and tumor characteristics provided a highly accurate estimation of OS in patients with HCC after curative liver resection, contributing to assess patient prognosis.
