Background:XB130 is a recently discovered adaptor protein that is highly expressed in many malignant tumors, but few studies have investigated its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, this study explored the relationship between this protein and liver cancer and investigated its molecular mechanism of action.Methods:The expression of XB130 between HCC tissues and adjacent nontumor tissues was compared by real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunochemistry, and Western blotting. XB130 silencing was performed using small hairpin RNA. The effect of silencing XB130 was examined using Cell Counting Kit-8, colony assay, wound healing assay, and cell cycle analysis.Results:We found that XB130 was highly expressed in HCC tissues (cancer tissues vs. adjacent tissues: 0.23 ± 0.02 vs. 0.17 ± 0.02, P Conclusions:Our findings suggest that XB130 might be used as a predictor of liver cancer as well as one of the targets for its treatment.
