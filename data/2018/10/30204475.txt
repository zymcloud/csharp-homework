Chia seed (Salvia hispanica L.) contains high amounts of n-3 α-linolenic acid (ALA) and has been associated with many health benefits. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the AIN-93 diet supplemented by chia flour on cancer-cachexia development and tissues inflammatory response. Wistar rats at 30 days old were treated with control diet or diet supplemented with chia flour for eight weeks. After this period, half of the animals in each diet group were inoculated with Walker 256 tumor cells. On the 14th day after tumor inoculation, the animals were euthanized and white adipose tissue depots, liver, gastrocnemius muscle, and tumor were removed. The tumor weight was higher and IL-10 content was lower in chia flour group. The tumor bearing did not modify the cytokines content in gastrocnemius muscle, retroperitoneal and epididymal adipose tissue, however, it decreased IL-1β and TNF-α content in liver, and IL6R and IL-10R protein content in mesenteric adipose tissue. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that supplementation with chia flour did not prevent the tumor bearing effects in Walker 256 model.
