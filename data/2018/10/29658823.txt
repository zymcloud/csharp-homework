Background:The initial mortality rates of associating liver partition and portal vein occlusion for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) were high. However, recent data from the International Registry show a continuous reduction of early mortality and major morbidity due to risk adjustment in patient selection and less invasive techniques in stage-1 surgery. During the first ALPPS International Consensus in 2015, we introduced a paradigm inversion of ALPPS, the so-called "Mini-ALPPS."Methods:We combined a partial liver partition with a novel technique of laparoscopic-assisted percutaneous cannulation of the inferior mesenteric vein for intraoperative transmesenteric portal vein embolization. We report here for the first time, a case of a successful totally laparoscopic Mini-ALPPS, and describe in detail the technical aspects of this new approach.Results:A 61-year-old man with a 6 cm hepatocellular carcinoma compromising the right glissonian pedicle in a fibrotic liver was treated by an extended right hepatectomy using the laparoscopic Mini-ALPPS approach. The patient had an uneventful first stage and was discharged 3 days after. A CT scan performed on postoperative day 8 showed sufficient future liver remnant volume after a 59% hypertrophy. An extended right hepatectomy was uneventfully completed and the patient was discharged 5 days after surgery. The histopathological analysis indicated advanced F4 liver fibrosis and negative tumor margins.Conclusions:This technical innovation allows avoiding a laparotomy to access the mesenteric venous territory and the risks of liver remnant injuries during percutaneous transhepatic approach. This new alternative may result of great utility not only in ALPPS but also for many different circumstances and scenarios.
