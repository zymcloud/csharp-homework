Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains among the neoplastic diseases with the most unfavorable prognosis. Historically, systemic treatments for HCC have been scarce. In particular, sorafenib was the only registered drug for the treatment of unresectable HCC until 2017. Last year, regorafenib was approved by the global regulatory agencies as second-line therapy. Since then, further randomized, controlled trials have been successful in this patient population. This paper deals with the most recent data concerning cabozantinib and ramucirumab, the two drugs that have recently demonstrated efficacy in phase III, randomized, controlled trials in HCC patients who failed previous treatment with sorafenib.
