Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the major subtype of primary liver cancer, and is typically diagnosed late in its course. Considering the limitations and the reluctance of patients to undergo a liver biopsy, a reliable, noninvasive diagnostic marker that predicts and assesses the treatment and prognosis of HCC is needed. With recent technological advances of mass spectrometry, glycomics is gathering momentum and holds substantial potential to discover new glycan markers in cancer research. Here, to discover specific glycan markers for the early diagnosis of HCC, we analyzed the glycan profiles of gel-separated serum proteins of progressive liver disease model mice. By focused protein glycomics of 12 gel-separated glycoproteins using sera from the mouse models, we revealed the entire profile of glycans in each major serum protein. We found that the levels of trisialylated triantennary glycans of haptoglobin and vitamin D-binding protein increased significantly as the disease progressed, while the alteration in these protein levels were modest. Furthermore, these glycan increases were not observed in age-matched control mice. In conclusion, our approach has identified specific glycan marker candidates for the early diagnosis of HCC.
