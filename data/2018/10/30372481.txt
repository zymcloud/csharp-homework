Background:The National Liver Cancer Surveillance Program (NLCSP) targets patients with liver diseases that lead to liver cancer in South Korea. This study aimed to investigate the risk of liver disease leading to liver cancer using nationally representative data to establish an efficient NLCSP.Methods:This study used data from the National Health Insurance Service National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) from 2002 to 2013. A retrospective matched cohort design was applied to compare the development of liver cancer in patients with and without liver disease. Cox- proportional hazard regression for liver cancer with competing risk of death was performed for all subjects or each group stratified according to age or income level.Results:A total of 66,192 patients with liver disease and matched subjects without liver disease were included in the study. The incidences of liver cancer among patients with and without liver disease within a median 8-year follow-up period were 2.68% (n = 1,772) and 0.34% (n = 210), respectively. Cox- regression analysis for liver cancer incidence indicated that cirrhosis had the highest risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 18.13, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.24-21.58), followed by hepatitis B (HR: 9.32, 95% CI: 8.00-10.85). Subgroup analysis showed that the presence of liver disease was an important risk factor in younger as well as elderly people, and a higher risk of liver disease was also observed in the patients with Medicaid.Conclusions:Attention should be paid to the development of liver cancer in young people under 50 years old and preventive efforts to decrease the incidence of liver cancer among Medicaid recipients is needed.
