Men have a much higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the predominant form of liver cancer, than women, suggesting that estrogens play a protective role in liver cancer development and progression. To begin to understand the potential mechanisms of estrogens' inhibitory effects on HCC development, RNA sequencing was used to generate comprehensive global transcriptome profiles of the human HCC-derived HepG2 cell line following treatment of vehicle (control), estradiol (E2), estrogen receptor alpha- (ERα-) specific agonist 1,3,5-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-propyl-1H-pyrazole (PPT), or ERβ-specific agonist 2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile (DPN) using a small set of cells. Gene ontology (GO) analysis identified increased expression of genes involved in the biological process (BP) of response to different stimuli and metabolic processes by E2 and ER agonists, which enhanced molecular function (MF) in various enzyme activities and chemical bindings. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional pathway analysis indicated enhanced pathways associated with carbohydrate metabolism, complement and coagulation cascades, and HIF-1 signaling pathway by E2 and ER agonists. GO analysis also identified decreased expression of genes by E2, PPT, and DPN involved in BP related to the cell cycle and cell division, which reduced MF in activity of multiple enzymes and microtubule activity. KEGG analysis indicated that E2, PPT, and DPN suppressed pathways associated with the cell cycle; E2 and PPT suppressed pathways associated with chemical carcinogenesis and drug metabolism, and DPN suppressed DNA replication, recombination, and repair. Collectively, these differentially expressed genes across HepG2 cell transcriptome involving cellular and metabolic processes by E2 and ER agonists provided mechanistic insight into protective effects of estrogens in HCC development.
