Liver function is a major prognostic factor following hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is well correlated with the degree of fibrosis. On the other hand, the presence of liver cirrhosis itself leads to a higher incidence of HCC than chronic hepatitis. Therefore, preoperative noninvasive markers of fibrosis are important for the assessment of prognosis for treatment of HCC. The present study aimed to analyze whether aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) could predict prognosis following hepatic resection for HCC. The subjects were 162 patients who underwent hepatic resection for HCC between January 2000 and December 2011. The relationship between APRI and disease-free and overall survival were retrospectively investigated. In multivariate analysis, indocyanine green at 15 min (ICG-R15) ≥15% (P=0.0306), APRI ≥0.45 (P=0.0184), perioperative blood transfusion of red cell concentrates (RCC; P=0.0034) and TNM stage II, III or IV (P=0.0184) were significant predictors in disease-free survival. For overall survival, ICG-R15 ≥15% (P=0.0454), APRI ≥0.45 (P=0.0417), perioperative blood transfusion of RCC (P=0.0036) and TNM stage II, III or IV (P=0.0033) were significant predictors. In addition, higher APRI values were positively correlated with hepatitis C virus infection and preoperative liver function. In conclusion, APRI is an independent risk factor for disease-free and overall survival following hepatic resection for HCC.
