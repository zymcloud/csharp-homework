Sorafenib, as a multi-kinase inhibitor, was the first FDA-approved anti- hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) drug. Rhizoma Paridis saponins (RPS) as natural products have shown antitumor activity through regulation of glycolytic and lipid metabolism which was regarded as the side effect limited the utility of sorafenib. In this research, we tried to use metabolomics to verify the probability of combinatorial treatment of RPS and Sorafenib. As a result, Sorafenib + RPS increased the antitumor effect of sorafenib and RPS in H22 mice. They mitigated the change of liver weight and the increasing levels of AST and ALT in serum, and AFP and MDA in liver tissues, which indicated their liver protective activity. They also up-regulated the activity of NOX and SDH, concentration of ATP, and down-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of HIF-1a and concentration of lactate, which suggested they protected against mitochondria damage and inhibited anaerobic glycolysis. Meanwhile, the combination group remarkably down-regulated the concentration of octadecanoic acid and hexadecanoic acid in serum, and tetradecanoic acid in liver tissues compared with model group (p
