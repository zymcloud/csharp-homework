Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has been regarded as the most prominent component in tumor microenvironment. The correlation between TAM density and poor prognosis in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients suggests a supportive role for TAMs in tumor progression. Here we employed a co-culture system to interrogate the molecular link between Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) and TAMs chemotaxis in HCC cells. We found that YAP activation was critical for the recruitment of TAMs towards HCC cells. Furthermore, cytokine array and quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that IL-6 secreted by YAP-activated HCC cells might induce the TAMs recruitment. Interrupting YAP function by statins, the inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, could robustly suppress the chemotaxis of TAMs. Together with our findings that the expression levels ofIL-6inhumanHCC tumors were highly correlated with the prognosis of HCC patients, the current study highlight the possibility of improving HCC treatment by targeting YAP-IL-6 mediated TAMs recruitment.
