Purpose:This study aimed to report intraoperative abortion of adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT).Methods:From June 1997 to December 2016, 1,179 adult LDLT cases were performed. 15 cases (1.3%) of intraoperative abortions in LDLT were described.Results:Among 15 cases, 5 intraoperative abortions were donor-related, and remaining 10 cases were recipient-related. All donor-related abortions were due to unexpected steatohepatitis. Among remaining 10 recipient-related intraoperative abortions, unexpected extension of hepatocellular carcinoma was related in 5 cases. Two cases of intraoperative abortions were related to bowel inflammation, and 2 cases were associated with severe adhesion related to previous treatment. One recipient with severe pulmonary hypertension was also aborted.Conclusion:Complete prevention of aborted LDLT is still not feasible. In this regard, further efforts to minimize intraoperative abortion are required.
