Objective:To explore the effects of interventional therapy on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Tat interactive protein 2/Tat interactive protein 30 (HTATIP2/TIP30), B7-H4 and short-term curative effect in primary hepatocellular carcinoma.Patients and methods:62 patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma admitted in our hospital from June 2015 to June 2016 were enrolled in this study and divided into observation group (n = 31) and control group (n = 31) according to the random number table. The patients in the control group were treated with radiofrequency ablation, and the patients in the observation group were treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). The patients in both groups received liver protection therapy, hydration, antiemetic and stomach protection. The curative effects, the serum HTATIP2/TIP30, B7-H4, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin in serum (TBIL), life quality before and after treatment, and survival during the 1-year follow-up, were compared.Results:The total short-term effective rate (70.97%) was higher than the control group (38.71%) (p 0.05).Conclusions:The short-term curative effect of interventional therapy of primary hepatocellular carcinoma is good. It can decrease serum HTATIP2/TIP30 and B7-H4, improves the liver function and the life quality of patients, prolonging the survival time. It has a high research value and it is worthy of further application.
