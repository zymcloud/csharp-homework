BACKGROUND Liver cancer is the third leading cause of tumor-related deaths worldwide. Stomatin-like protein 2 (STOML2) is obviously upregulated in various tumors. In this study, we explored the potential roles and mechanisms of si-STOML2 in the migration and invasion of human hepatoma LM3 cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS The expression levels of STOML2 in tissues and cells were separately analyzed with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. The viability, migration, and invasion of cells were assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), wound healing, and transwell analysis, respectively. The mRNA and protein levels of various factors were separately measured using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Correlation analysis between the expression of STOML2 and the clinicopathological features of liver cancer patients was evaluated using the chi-square test. RESULTS Surprisingly, our results showed that STOML2 was upregulated in liver cancer tissue and cells, and this upregulation was linked to tumor size, histologic grade, and metastasis, but was not associated with sex, age, or TNM stage. The knockdown of STOML2 significantly repressed the viability, migration, and invasion of LM3 cells. We also observed that silencing STOML2 markedly downregulated the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, metastatic tumor antigen 1 (MTA1), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and upregulated levels of E-cadherin, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2), and the inhibitor of kappa B (IκB). CONCLUSIONS STOML2 has a vital role in the progression of liver cancer. STOML2 silencing in LM3 cells obviously repressed the abilities of migration and invasion via suppressing the NF-κB pathway.
