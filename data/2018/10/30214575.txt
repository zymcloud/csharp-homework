Although liver transplantation (LT) lengthens the survival time of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), LT patients exhibit a high recurrence rate; particularly those that had advanced HCC associated with the tumor biological characteristics and long-term application of immunosuppressants. A consensus on optimal prophylaxis and treatment for recurrent HCC following LT does not currently exist. The present study retrospectively analyzed data from 36 non-University of California at San Francisco criteria-eligible patients with advanced HCC who underwent LT, and then treated them with sirolimus (SRL)-based therapy with thymalfasin and huaier granules (SRL+, n=18), or with tacrolimus-based therapy (controls; n=18). The SRL+ group had significantly longer recurrence times (P=0.008) and survival times (P+ Treg lymphocytes (P<0.001) during the first year. In the SRL+ group, FoxP3+/cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ Treg lymphocyte percentages decreased significantly following LT (P<0.001); however, CD8+/CD3+ T-cells significantly increased (P<0.001). Levels of serum AFP and FoxP3+ Treg cells increased when tumors relapsed, and decreased to near-normal when relapse foci were cured or stabilized. SRL+ therapy may decrease AFP and Treg levels, while increasing CD8+ T cells, indicating an associated mechanism among them. In conclusion, SRL+ therapy appears to be safe and effective in preventing HCC recurrence following LT with no significant adverse events, and warrants further investigation.
