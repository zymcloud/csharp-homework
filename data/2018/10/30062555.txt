Sorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor for treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Beyond its clinical benefit against advanced HCC, the efficacy and safety of sorafenib chemotherapy are critical concerns. In this study, we addressed the lipid profiles associated with the efficacy and safety of sorafenib chemotherapy. Plasma samples from HCC patients before sorafenib chemotherapy (N = 44) were collected and subjected to lipidomic analysis. We measured the levels of 176 lipids belonging to 8 classes of phosphoglycerolipids, 2 classes of sphingolipids, 3 classes of neutral lipids, and 4 other classes of lipids. To characterize lipids associated with efficacy, we compared the responder group (N = 21; partial response and stable disease) with non-responder group (N = 22; progressive disease). To characterize lipids associated with hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), we compared the susceptible group (N = 12; grade 2 and 3) with non-susceptible group (N = 32; grade 0 and 1). The levels of 8 lipids, including phosphatidylcholine (PC)[34:2], PC[34:3]a, PC[35:2], PC[36:4]a, PC[34:3e], acylcarnitine (Car)[18:0], cholesterol ester[20:2], and diacylglycerol (DG)[34:2], were significantly lower in the responder group, and 6 out of 8 these lipids contained FA(18:2). In addition, the levels of 7 lipids (Car[12:0], Car[18:0], Car[18:1], Car[20:1] and fatty acid amides (FAA[16:0], FAA[18:0], and FAA[18:1]b)) were significantly lower in the group susceptible to HFSR. Our comprehensive lipidomics study using samples from sorafenib-treated patients with HCC revealed that significant differences in the lipid profiles of pre-treatment plasma were associated with sorafenib efficacy and sorafenib-induced HFSR. Validation using another set of patient plasma samples and elucidating the molecular basis of these changes will lead to better treatment with sorafenib chemotherapy.
