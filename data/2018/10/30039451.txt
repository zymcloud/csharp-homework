The precise intraoperative navigation of the surgical plane remains challenging in liver surgery; however, an innovative imaging technique-real-time virtual sonography (RVS)-may provide a solution. In this modality, preoperative three-dimensional (3D) resection simulation data are transmitted to an RVS workstation and can be used in combination with intraoperative ultrasound to navigate the surgical plane in real time. This paper describes this technique and our experiences in detail. From November 2015 to March 2017, 26 patients with primary liver cancer underwent liver resection under RVS navigation. The operative procedures employed included hemihepatectomy, bisegmentectomy, segmentectomy, and limited resection. RVS was utilized uneventfully and successfully in each operation. The median time required for spatial position registration was 3 (1-12) min, and as the case volume increased, the time required for registration markedly decreased. The surgical plane under RVS navigation was consistent with that of the preoperative plan, and the resection margin was confirmed negative in each case. In conclusion, RVS in combination with 3D simulation is a feasible, safe, and promising technique for the precise intraoperative navigation of liver resection for primary liver cancer. It could be applied to other resectable liver diseases and may be utilized in other centers.
