Introduction:Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has the potential to progress to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, limited therapies are currently available for the treatment of advanced HCC, and one must strive to search for novel strategies.Areas covered:We provide insight on current knowledge related to gut microbiota and NAFLD, summarize the sequence linking obesity to HCC and highlight gut dysbiosis in obesity and its consequences on the liver. We detail the impact of the gut microbiota on immune checkpoint inhibitors, and speculate on the role of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in NAFLD and in improving anti-neoplastic immune response.Expert opinion:Manipulation of the gut microbiota seems promising in the secondary prevention of NAFLD/NASH and/or in potentiating anti-cancer immune response, notably by a global 'resetting' using FMT. However, the composition of a 'harmful' gut microbiome in HCC still needs to be characterized, and the impact of FMT on HCC growth needs to be assessed.
