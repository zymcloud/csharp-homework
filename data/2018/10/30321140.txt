BACKGROUND Recently, miR-146a C>G, miR- 149 T>C, miR-196a2 T>C and miR-499 A>G polymorphisms have been associated with susceptibility to many diseases, including ischemic stroke (IS). However, results have been reported inconsistency in IS, especially in the Chinese population. This study aimed to investigate the polymorphisms of the 4 miRNAs and IS risk in the Chinese population. MATERIAL AND METHODS We used a case-control study to explore these associations in 396 patients with IS and 378 healthy controls. According to TOAST standards, the selected patients were divided into subgroups: the large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) subgroup and the small artery occlusion (SAO) subgroup. The method of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used to detect the genotypes. RESULTS The miR-146a C>G polymorphism was remarkably different (CC vs. CG+GG: P=0.027; CC+CG vs. GG: P=0.020; C vs. G: P=0.006). The miR-149 T>C polymorphism was also remarkably different (TT vs. TC+CC: P=0.017; TT+TC vs. CC: P=0.020; T vs. C: P=0.004). The miR-146a and miR-149 polymorphisms were also remarkably different in the LAA subgroup (PC or miR-499 A>G polymorphisms with IS (P>0.05); we did not find any association in the LAA subgroup or the SAO subgroup (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS Our study suggested that miR-146a C>G and miR-149 T>C polymorphisms might remarkably increase the risk of IS, which might be mainly associated with an increased risk in LAA stroke; however, the miR-196a2 T>C and miR-499 A>G polymorphisms might not be associated with IS risk in the northern Chinese Han population.
