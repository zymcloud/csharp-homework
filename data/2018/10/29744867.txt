Lorlatinib (PF-06463922) is a promising oral anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and ROS1 inhibitor currently in Phase III clinical trials for treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) containing an ALK rearrangement. With therapy-resistant brain metastases a major concern in NSCLC, lorlatinib was designed to have high membrane and blood-brain barrier permeability. We investigated the roles of the multidrug efflux transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2, and the multispecific drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A in plasma pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of lorlatinib using genetically modified mouse strains. In vitro, human ABCB1 and mouse Abcg2 modestly transported lorlatinib. Following oral lorlatinib administration (at 10 mg/kg), brain accumulation of lorlatinib, while relatively high in wild-type mice, was still fourfold increased in Abcb1a/1b-/- and Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2-/- mice, but not in single Abcg2-/- mice. Lorlatinib plasma levels were not altered. Oral coadministration of the ABCB1/ABCG2 inhibitor elacridar increased the brain accumulation of lorlatinib in wild-type mice fourfold, that is, to the same level as in Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2-/- mice, without altering plasma exposure. Similar results were obtained for lorlatinib testis accumulation. In Cyp3a-/- mice, the plasma exposure of lorlatinib was increased 1.3-fold, but was then twofold reduced upon transgenic overexpression of human CYP3A4 in liver and intestine, whereas relative tissue distribution of lorlatinib remained unaltered. Our data indicate that lorlatinib brain accumulation is substantially limited by P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 in the blood-brain barrier, but this can be effectively reversed by elacridar coadministration. Moreover, oral availability of lorlatinib is markedly restricted by CYP3A4 activity. These insights may be used in optimizing the therapeutic application of lorlatinib.
