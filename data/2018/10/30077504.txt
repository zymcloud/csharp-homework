Aims:Investigating the association between the dietary inflammatory index (DIIÂ®) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) components and liver enzymes in Iranian population.Methods:The present cross-sectional study consist of 606 participants from East-Azarbaijan-Iran. The MetS status was determined using ATPIII NCEP criteria. Moreover, liver enzymes including alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were measured. The DII was calculated according to Shivappa et al. method using a validated quantitative FFQ. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between DII and MetS.Results:About 34.3% of the participants had metabolic syndrome. Higher DII score was significantly associated with MetS [OR: 2.26 (95% CI: 1.03, 4.92)] after adjusting for covariates. After adjustment, participants in the highest quartile of DII score had significantly higher FBG [OR: 2.56 (95% CI: 1.00, 7.05)] compared with the participants in the lowest quartile of DII score. No other significant association was observed between DII and liver enzymes level and other MetS components (P>0.05).Conclusions:The results showed that the DII score was associated with overall MetS and FBG, after adjusting for all covariates. For precise conclusion there is a need for longitudinal studies with larger sample size and considering more food parameters.
