Background:Kindlin-2 is one of the Kindlin family members which are evolutionarily conserved focal adhesion proteins with integrin Î²-binding affinity. Recently, accumulative studies have suggested that Kindlin-2 plays important roles in tumor biology. However, the prognostic significance of Kindlin-2 in patients with solid tumors remains controversial. Therefore, this study aimed to clarify the prognostic value of Kindlin-2 in solid tumors via meta-analysis.Methods:A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and EBSCO for all relevant studies reporting the prognostic significance of Kindlin-2 expression in solid cancer patients. The summary hazard ratio (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to estimate the association between Kindlin-2 expression with survival of solid cancer patients.Results:We included 14 eligible studies containing 1869 patients in our meta-analysis. The pooled results indicated that high Kindlin-2 expression was significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS) (pooled HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.44-1.92, P < 0.0001), disease-free survival (DFS)/recurrence-free survival (RFS)/progression-free survival (PFS) (pooled HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.16-2.57, P = 0.0067). For certain tumor types, high Kindlin-2 expression was significantly correlated with a poor outcome in patients with solid tumors, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (DFS/RFS/PFS), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OS, DFS/RFS/PFS), hepatocellular carcinoma (OS), clear cell renal cell carcinoma (OS), bladder cancer (OS, DFS/RFS/PFS), chondrosarcoma (OS), osteosarcoma (OS), gastric cancer (DFS/RFS/PFS), and glioma (OS).Conclusions:Our meta-analysis demonstrated that high Kindlin-2 expression might indicate poor outcome in patients with solid tumors and could serve as a prognostic biomarker for solid cancer patients.
