Background:LINE-1 ORF-1p is encoded by the human pro-oncogene LINE-1. Our previous work showed that LINE-1 ORF-1p could enhance the resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells to antitumor agents. However, the mechanisms involved in LINE-1 ORF-1p-mediated drug resistance remain largely unknown.Materials and methods:The endogenous mRNA level of LINE-1 ORF-1p in clinical HCC specimens was examined using quantitative PCR (qPCR). The prognosis of HCC patients was assessed using time to progression and overall survival. The transcription factor activity of pregnenolone X receptor (PXR) was examined using luciferase gene reporter assays, qPCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and cellular subfraction assays. Protein interaction between LINE-1 ORF-1p and PXR was detected by co-immunoprecipitation. The effect of LINE-1 ORF-1p on sorafenib resistance in HCC cells was studied using in vitro and in vivo models.Results:A high level of LINE-1 ORF-1p in clinical specimens was related to poor prognosis in patients who received sorafenib treatment. LINE-1 ORF-1p increased the transcription factor activity of PXR by interacting with PXR and enhancing its cytoplasmic/nuclear translocation, and recruiting PXR to its downstream gene promoter, in turn enhancing the expression of the sorafenib resistance-related genes, CYP3A4 and mdr-1. LINE-1 ORF-1p enhanced the resistance to and clearance of sorafenib in HCC cells.Conclusion:LINE-1 ORF-1p enhances the transcription factor activation of PXR and promotes the clearance of and resistance to sorafenib in HCC cells.
