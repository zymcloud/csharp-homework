Introduction:The greater survival of transplanted patients is accompanied by an increase in the rate of de novo malignancies (NM), which are the most frequent late-onset complication. We can distinguish between non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) and solid organ cancers (SOC). Our objective is to determine the incidence of the different types of NM, the time elapsed until diagnosis and survival rates in our setting.Methods:We conducted a retrospective study of 1071 liver transplant patients from 1990 to 2015 at our center. We analyzed the demographic variables, incidence of NM and survival.Results:184 NM developed in 1071 transplant patients (17%), specifically 19% of the males and 13% of the females (P=.004). The most frequent NM were NMSC (29%), lung (18%), head and neck (16%), PTLD (10%) and gastrointestinal (8%). The median time of diagnosis was 7.9 years in NMSC, 3.9 years in PTLD and 9.8 years in SOC. Patients with NMSC had significantly better survival than those with PTLD or SOC. The incidence of de novo tumors (excluding NMSC) was 1889/100,000 transplants/year. By gender, lung cancer was the most common TOS in men and breast cancer in women.Conclusion:In our setting, excluding NMSC, the incidence is 8.8 times greater than estimations for the general population, with a high rate of lung cancer, so we should implement preventive and diagnostic strategies.
