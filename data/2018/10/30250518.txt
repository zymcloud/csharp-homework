Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common primary tumor of the liver, has a poor prognosis, rapid progression. The aim of the current study was to establish a stable lentiviral expression vector for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and to evaluate biological characteristics on HCC growth and migration following transfection of HCC cells with EGFP. McA-RH7777 cells were transfected with EGFP overexpression lentiviral vector. Cell activity and mobility were monitored with a Cell-IQ Analyzer. Transwell assays were performed to detect invasiveness and flow cytometry was performed for cell cycle analysis. A subcutaneous tumor rat model was established to analyze the stability of fluorescent protein expression. The result suggested no significant differences between wild-type and EGFP-overexpressing McA-RH7777 cells with regards to cell proliferation, activity, mobility, invasiveness and cell cycle. Green fluorescence was detected over 108 days of culturing. The subcutaneous tumor rat model demonstrated that EGFP expression had no influence on tumor growth and long-term expression was stable. The stable EGFP expression of the HCC transplanted tumor rat model may share biological characteristics with human liver cancer. The model established in the current study may be suitable for various applications, including research focusing on liver cancer metastasis and recurrence, interventional therapy, imaging diagnosis and drug screenings.
