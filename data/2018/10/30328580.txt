Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors show clinical promise for the treatment of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we investigated the effect of HDAC inhibitor treatment on hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication in Huh7 human liver cells and in a mouse model of HCV infection. Viral replication was markedly suppressed by the HDAC3 inhibitor at concentrations below 1 mmol/L, with no cellular toxicity. This was accompanied by upregulation of liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 1(LEAP-1) and downregulation of apolipoprotein-A1 (Apo-A1), as determined by microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analyses. Moreover, HDAC3 was found to modulate the binding of CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) to the LEAP-1 promoter. HDAC3 inhibitor treatment also blocked HCV replication in a mouse model of HCV infection. These results indicate that epigenetic therapy with HDAC3 inhibitor may be a potential treatment for diseases associated with HCV infection such as HCC.
