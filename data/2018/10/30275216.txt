Background/aim:To investigate the role of programmed cell death-ligand 2 (PD-L2) expression as a predictive biomarker for response to anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) drugs in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Patients and methods:Ten patients who had undergone curative lung resection and received the anti-PD-1 drugs for the recurrence were enrolled. The cut-off value for PD-L2 (antibody clone 176611) expression on tumor cells was set at 50%. Tumor response was evaluated according to immune-related response criteria.Results:Seven patients (70.0%) were positive for PD-L2. The response rates were 28.6% (2/7) and 33.3% (1/3) in patients with PD-L2-positive and PD-L2-negative NSCLC, respectively. Disease control was obtained in 2 patients despite the programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-negativity (antibody clone 22C3: 0%, antibody clone SP142: 0%), and these tumors expressed PD-L2 (â‰¥1%).Conclusion:PD-L2 expression may be a target of immunotherapy in patients with PD-L1-negative NSCLC.
Programmed cell death-ligand 1; non-small cell lung cancer; programmed cell death-ligand 2.
