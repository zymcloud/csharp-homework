Arginine depletion has shown anticancer effects among arginine auxotrophic cancers. An anti‑proliferative effect of pegylated arginase (BCT‑100) has been shown in acute myeloid leukaemia, hepatocellular carcinoma and mesothelioma. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of BCT‑100 in lung adenocarcinoma. A panel of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and xenograft models were used to investigate the effect of BCT‑100. Protein expression, arginine level, putrescine level, spermidine level and apoptosis were analyzed by western blotting, ELISA, high performance liquid chromatography, dot blot and TUNEL assay, respectively. BCT‑100 converts arginine to ornithine. BCT‑100 reduced in vitro cell viability across different lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and suppressed tumour growth in an HCC4006 xenograft, while paradoxical growth stimulation was observed in H358, HCC827, H1650 and H1975 xenografts. Upon BCT‑100 treatment, ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) was induced in two solid tumour xenografts (H1650 and H1975). It was postulated that the accumulated ornithine could be channeled via ODC1 to produce polyamines that promoted tumour growth. The action of an ODC1 inhibitor (α‑difluoromethylornithine, DFMO) was studied in the restoration of the anticancer effects of BCT‑100 in lung adenocarcinoma. In both H1650 and H1975 xenografts, a combination of DFMO and BCT‑100 significantly suppressed tumour growth, resulting in doubled median survival compared with the control. Putrescine was decreased in almost all treatment arms in the H1650, H1975 and HCC4006 xenografts. Nonetheless spermidine was reduced only following DFMO/BCT‑100 treatment in the H1650 and H1975 xenografts. Apoptosis was enhanced in the combined treatment arm in both H1650 and H1975 xenografts. In the HCC4006 xenograft, addition of DFMO did not alter the tumour suppressive effect of BCT‑100. In conclusion, inhibition of ODC1 by DFMO was crucial in facilitating BCT‑100 treatment in lung adenocarcinoma that was partially mediated by depleting arginine and polyamines with consequent apoptosis.
