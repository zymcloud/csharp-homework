Background:Several reported complications associated with radiofrequency ablation for liver tumors are due to thermal damage of neighboring organs. We herein report a first case of esophageal perforation due to thermal injury of laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Case presentation:A 75-year-old woman was treated repeatedly with RFA (percutaneous and laparoscopic) and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma. One week after laparoscopic RFA for recurrent HCC located in segment 2 of the liver, dysphagia and thoracic pain occurred. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a perforated esophageal ulcer at the esophago-gastric junction. Inflammation was localized because of severe intra-abdominal adhesion due to repeat surgery, so we decided to treat the patient conservatively. The perforation of the esophagus gradually scarred, and exacerbation did not occur after restarting oral intake.Conclusions:When patients with a history of abdominal surgery or intra-abdominal inflammation undergo thermal ablation therapy, caution is required, as there is a possibility of thermal injury of unexpected organs.
