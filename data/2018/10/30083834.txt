Background:Locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) has a poor oncological outcome. This study evaluated the oncological outcomes and prognostic factors of surgical resection after downstaging with localized concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC).Methods:From 2005 to 2014, 354 patients with locally advanced HCC underwent CCRT followed by HAIC. Among these patients, 149 patients with PVTT were analyzed. Exclusion criteria included a total bilirubin â‰¥ 2 mg/dL, platelet count 20%. During the same study period, 18 patients with PVTT underwent surgical resection as the first treatment. Clinicopathological characteristics and oncological outcomes between groups were compared.Results:Among 98 patients in the CCRT group, 26 patients (26.5%) underwent subsequent curative resection. The median follow-up period was 13 months (range 1-131 months). Disease-specific survival differed significantly between the resection after localized CCRT group and the resection-first group {median 62 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 22.99-101.01) versus 15 months (95% CI 10.84-19.16), respectively; P = 0.006}. Multivariate analyses showed that achievement of radiologic response was an independently good prognostic factor for both disease-specific survival (P = 0.039) and disease-free survival (P = 0.001) CONCLUSIONS: Localized CCRT could be an effective tool for identifying optimal candidates for surgical treatment with favorable tumor biology. Furthermore, with a 26.5% resection rate and 100% response in PVTT for resection after CCRT, our localized CCRT protocol may be ideal for PVTT.
