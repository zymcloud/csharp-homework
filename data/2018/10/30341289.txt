Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α) is a master regulator of liver-specific gene expression with potent tumor suppressor activity, yet many liver tumors express HNF4α. This study reveals that P1-HNF4α, the predominant isoform expressed in the adult liver, inhibits expression of tumor promoting genes in a circadian manner. In contrast, an additional isoform of HNF4α, driven by an alternative promoter (P2-HNF4α), is induced in HNF4α-positive human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). P2-HNF4α represses the circadian clock gene ARNTL (BMAL1), which is robustly expressed in healthy hepatocytes, and causes nuclear to cytoplasmic re-localization of P1-HNF4α. We reveal mechanisms underlying the incompatibility of BMAL1 and P2-HNF4α in HCC, and demonstrate that forced expression of BMAL1 in HNF4α-positive HCC prevents the growth of tumors in vivo. These data suggest that manipulation of the circadian clock in HNF4α-positive HCC could be a tractable strategy to inhibit tumor growth and progression in the liver.
