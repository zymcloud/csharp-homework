miRNAs regulate gene expression and enable clinicians to distinguish between benign and malignant tissues in cancers. PH domain leucine-rich repeat-containing protein phosphatase 1 (PHLPP1) is known to be a tumour suppressor. A lentiviral overexpression system was used to stably express miR-190, leading to the enhancement of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) proliferation and metastasis as a result of inhibited PHLPP1 expression. The results showed that stable miR-190 expression increased the expression of EMT-related proteins (Snail and TCF8/ZEB1) as well as the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and the expression of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 1 (ADAMTS1). However, restoring PHLPP1 expression counteracted the effects of miR-190 on HCC proliferation, migration and invasion. The results of the animal experiments showed that miR-190 improved the HepG2 cell tumour formation and lung metastasis ability. Stable miR-190 overexpression leads to the downregulation of PHLPP1 protein expression. miR-190 has potential as a target in the treatment and diagnosis of HCC.
