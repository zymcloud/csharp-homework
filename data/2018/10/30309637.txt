Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) comprise the majority of primary liver cancers. Both HCC and ICC have characteristic imaging appearances on multiphase computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Several locoregional therapies, including radiation therapy, are used to treat unresectable disease and residual or recurrent tumor. The tumor response following locoregional therapies has variable imaging manifestations. Focal liver reaction, the imaging changes of the liver following radiation treatment, should be recognized and not mistaken for tumor. We review the diagnostic imaging of HCC and ICC, imaging of tumor response to treatment, and imaging of the liver response to radiation.
