T helper (Th)22 and Th17 cells are implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of types of cancer. However, the function of Th22 and Th17 cells in malignant ascites (MA) remains unknown. The present study aimed at examining the distribution, phenotypes, recruitment, and prognostic value of Th22 and Th17 cells in MA from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 26 patients with HCC with MA and 15 healthy controls were included in the present study. The proportion of Th22 cells, Th17 cells, C-C motif chemokine receptor (CCR)4, CCR6 and CCR10 were examined using flow cytometry. Interleukin (IL-)22, IL-17, C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL)20, CCL22 and CCL27 were investigated using ELISA. In addition, the chemoattractant activity of chemokines for Th22 and Th17 cells in vitro were examined via a chemotaxis assay. The results of the present study demonstrated that Th22 cells, Th17 cells, IL-22 and IL-17 were significantly increased in MA compared with the corresponding blood and peripheral blood from healthy controls. Additionally, Th22 cells expressed increased concentrations of CCR6, CCR4 and CCR10, and Th17 cells expressed increased concentrations of CCR4 and CCR6 in MA compared with the corresponding blood. The chemotaxis assay revealed that CCL20/CCR6, CCL22/CCR4 and CCL27/CCR10 were responsible for the recruitment of Th22 cells into MA, whereas CCL22/CCR4 was responsible for the recruitment of Th17 cells. Furthermore, the patients with an increased number of Th17 cells exhibited an increased survival time compared with patients with a limited number of Th17 cells. Th22 and Th17 cells serve an important function in the development of MA, and the accumulation of Th22 and Th17 cells in MA may be due to a local increase in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Increased Th17 cell numbers in MA may indicate the improvement of patient survival.
