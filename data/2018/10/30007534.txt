Background:Left lateral sectionectomy (LLS) is frequently performed for surgical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) located in the left lateral section. However, no reports have described liver resection for such HCCs using a parenchyma-sparing strategy involving anatomic resection (AR) of segment II (S2 AR) or segment III (S3 AR).Methods:From 1994 to 2014, patients who underwent LLS and S2 AR or S3 AR for HCC were included in the analysis. Short- and long-term outcomes and pre- and postoperative LV were assessed.Results:Of the 89 patients selected, 49 underwent LLS (LLS group) and 40 underwent S2 AR and S3 AR (S2/S3 AR group). The postoperative LV was not significantly smaller than the preoperative LV in the S2/S3 AR group (p = 0.114), whereas the postoperative LV was significantly smaller in the LLS group (p = 0.019). The overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS) rates were not significantly different between the groups (OS, p = 0.056; RFS, p = 0.102).Conclusions:Parenchyma-sparing liver resection for HCC in the left lateral section is associated with better postoperative LV recovery than LLS with similar oncological outcomes. S2/S3 AR can be a reasonable therapeutic option when LLS results in the removal of more parenchyma than necessary.
