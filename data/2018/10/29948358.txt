Sorafenib has been widely used to treat unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but most studies have been done in Child-Pugh A (CP-A) patients with well-preserved liver function. We evaluated the overall survival (OS) and tolerance to sorafenib in a large cohort of Child-Pugh B (CP-B) HCC patients as compared to CP-A HCC patients. We prospectively studied 130 patients with advanced HCC who started sorafenib between January 2011 and December 2015. Patients were classified as CP-A (n = 65) or CP-B (n = 65). The average OS for all 130 patients was 10 months. CP-A patients had a median survival rate significantly longer than CP-B patients: 12 months vs. 6 months. The OS found in our group of CP-B patients was 6.5 months, which is higher than that found in most studies done so far. When stratified, our CP-B patients had better OS than ever reported. The dose of the drug was interrupted due to adverse events (AEs) in 38 (29%) of the patients, of whom 20 (30%) were CP-A patients and 18 (28%) were CP-B patients. This real-life cohort of CP-B HCC patients treated with sorafenib had a higher survival than that described in the literature, with a satisfactory safety profile. Despite the high prevalence of severe AEs in CP-B patients, there were fewer treatment interruptions in this group, indicating that Child-Pugh B patients can tolerate treatment and may benefit from sorafenib.
