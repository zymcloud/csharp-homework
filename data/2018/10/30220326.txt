Purpose:To evaluate the efficacy of induction chemotherapy in the treatment of stage II nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in era of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).Methods and materials:A total of 173 patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th stage II NPC from two institutions were included. All patients were divided into two groups: induction chemotherapy + concurrent chemoradiotherapy group (ICRT) group and concurrent chemoradiotherapy group (CCRT). Induction chemotherapy was consisted of one to three cycles of cisplatin plus fluorouracil (PF) or paclitaxel plus cisplatin (TP). Concurrent chemotherapy included one to three cycles of cisplatin. We retrospectively assessed overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional failure free survival (LRFFS) and distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) in patients of both groups. T-test, Chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier methodology and Cox proportional hazards model were used to analyze.Results:With a median follow up of 64.7 months, no significant difference was found in grade 3-4 hematologic toxicity, liver dysfunction and renal impairment between ICRT and CCRT group. Univariable analyses shown adding induction chemotherapy to CCRT significantly decreased 5-year OS (87.9% vs 95.5%, P = 0.033), 5-year PFS (74.0% vs 86.1%, P = 0.035), 5-year LRFFS (80.0% vs 91.2%, P = 0.016), but there was no statistically significant difference in 5-year DMFS (87.1% vs 94.7%, P = 0.095). In multivariable analyses, we found the consistent results that induction chemotherapy was a negative factor associated with OS (HR of death = 3.768, 95% CI = 1.117-12.709; P = 0.032), PFS (HR of progression = 2.156, 95% CI = 1.060-4.386; P = 0.034), LRFFS (HR of locoregional relapse = 2.435, 95% CI = 1.009-5.874; P = 0.048) and also DMFS (HR of metastasis = 2.873, 95% CI = 1.005-8.211; P = 0.049), in stage II NPC patients.Conclusion:In present study, we found that induction chemotherapy caused deleterious effect on stage II NPC patients. However, this is a retrospective study and the adverse effects of induction chemotherapy has not been previously reported. It warrants further investigation.
