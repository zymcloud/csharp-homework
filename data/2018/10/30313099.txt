Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is highly accurate in depicting the vascularity of liver nodules. The aim of this study was to verify the characteristics of CEUS in distinguishing small (â‰¤3 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).A total of 65 patients with a liver nodule (HCC, n = 58; ICC, n = 7) smaller than 3 cm who underwent liver CEUS and pathologic confirmation were retrospectively reviewed. CEUS findings were compared with histopathologic and clinical data.Arterial-phase hyperenhancement and portal-delayed-phase wash-out on CEUS were observed in 77.6% (45/58) of HCCs and 85.7% (6/7) of ICCs. Time of arterial-phase hyperenhancement (11 seconds [6-20] vs 16 seconds [14-19], P = .008), time of portal-delayed-phase wash-out (65 seconds (15-260) vs 35 secconds (27-54), P = .002), and time interval between arterial-phase hyperenhancement and portal-delayed-phase wash-out (50 seconds [5-249] vs 19 seconds [13-35], P
