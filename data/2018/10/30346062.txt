It was reported that long non-coding RNA nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) is involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the underlying mechanism of tumorigenesis is still largely unclear. Here, we found that NEAT1 is remarkably upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of NEAT1 notably accelerated HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Knockdown of NEAT1 significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. MiR-384 expression was lower in HCC tissues and cell lines than adjacent nontumor tissues and L02 cell. MiR-384 exhibited the functions of tumor-suppressive. The expression of miR-384 was negatively correlated with the expression of NEAT1. Overexpression of NEAT1 reduced miR-384 expression, whereas inhibition of miR-384 led to a distinct upregulation of NEAT1 expression. In addition, we provided evidence that miR-384 was directly bound to the sequence of NEAT1 by luciferase reporter and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation assays. Overexpression of miR-384 inhibited NEAT1 function. Thus, we demonstrated that NEAT1 promotes the malignant biological properties of hepatocellular carcinoma by negatively regulating miR-384.
