The present study aimed to determine whether HepG2 can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via angiotensin II (AngII) simulation. The expression levels of EMT markers vimentin and E-cadherin in cancer tissues and adjacent tissues of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were detected by immunohistochemistry. In addition, HepG2 cells were stimulated with AngII, and the gene and protein expression levels of vimentin and E-cadherin were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses, respectively, whereas cell migration and invasion were assessed using Transwell assays. The AngII inhibitor Ang1-7 and the Ang1-7 inhibitor A779 were added to the system to further evaluate AngII-induced EMT. Compared with that in normal tissue, the expression level of vimentin in HCC tissue was increased, whereas that of E-cadherin was decreased. EMT occurred 48 h following AngII stimulation. The transcription level of E-cadherin in HepG2 cells was decreased, whereas that of vimentin was increased. In addition, the migration and invasion abilities of the cells were increased simultaneously. Ang1-7 partly inhibited AngII-induced EMT. When stimulated at an appropriate time, HepG2 cells have the ability to undergo EMT.
