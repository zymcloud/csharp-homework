For hepatocellular carcinomas, radiofrequency ablation is extensively used to alleviate primary and metastatic hepatic tumours. Common complications of this procedure include bleeding, infection, and hollow organ perforation. We present the case of a patient with hepatoma who underwent radiofrequency ablation. He had intractable cough with yellowish sputum, particularly while lying down, three weeks after treatment. Chest computed tomography demonstrated a right middle lobe consolidation with pleural effusion and right subphrenic fluid collection. Thoracoscopic decortication was performed under the diagnosis of empyema. The attending anaesthesiologist noted bile-like fluid aspirated from the endotracheal tube. Therefore, we suspected bronchobiliary fistula. Percutaneous transhepatic drainage of the subphrenic fluid and simultaneous cholangiography confirmed bronchobiliary fistula. The patient was successfully treated using percutaneous drainage combined with endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage. An imaging finding of subphrenic fluid collection with right lower lung consolidation after radiofrequency ablation for hepatic tumours should raise the suspicion of bronchobiliary fistula.
