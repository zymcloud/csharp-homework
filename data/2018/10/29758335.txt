Background & aims:Recent studies reveal that the rate of normal on-treatment alanine aminotransferase (ALT) appears different for different nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs); yet its clinical significance is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the impact of normal on-treatment ALT during antiviral treatment with entecavir (ETV) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Methods:A territory-wide cohort of patients with CHB who received ETV and/or TDF in 2005-2016 was identified. Serial on-treatment ALT levels were collected and analyzed. Normal on-treatment ALT (ALT-N) was defined as ALT Results:A total of 21,182 patients with CHB (10,437 with and 10,745 without ALT-N at 12 months after antiviral treatment) were identified and followed for 4.0 Â± 1.7 years. Patients with and without ALT-N differed in baseline ALT (58 vs. 61 U/L), hepatitis B virus DNA (4.9 vs. 5.1 log10 IU/ml) and cirrhosis status (8.8% vs. 10.5%). A total of 627 (3.0%) patients developed composite hepatic events. Compared to no ALT-N, ALT-N at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months reduced the risk of hepatic events, after adjustment for baseline ALT and other important covariates, with adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) of 0.61 (0.49-0.77), 0.55 (0.45-0.67), 0.54 (0.44-0.65) and 0.51 (0.42-0.61) respectively (all p Conclusions:Normal on-treatment ALT is associated with a lower risk of hepatic events in patients with CHB receiving NA treatment, translating into improved clinical outcomes in these patients.Lay summary:We investigated 21,182 patients with chronic hepatitis B receiving antiviral treatment. Alanine aminotransferase is a laboratory marker of liver function, with raised levels indicating liver dysfunction and in severe cases hepatitis. Normal on-treatment alanine aminotransferase during the first year of treatment in patients with CHB is associated with a lower risk of hepatic events.
