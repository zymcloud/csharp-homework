Gapmer antisense oligonucleotides (gapmers) sometimes cleave nontarget pre-mRNAs by recognizing target-like intronic/exonic portions. This off-target RNA cleavage could be a major cause of the hepatotoxicity that is induced by gapmers. In line with these findings, we hypothesized that gapmers with higher specificity have less hepatotoxicity, and that those with lower specificity have greater toxicity. To examine this concept, we investigated various Malat1-targeting gapmers with various computationally evaluated target specificities. We had expected that higher specificity gapmers would have lower hepatotoxicity, but these factors were not significantly related. In silico analysis of gapmer sequences does not always contribute to mitigating the risk of hepatotoxicity. Transcriptome analysis indicated that nontoxic gapmers do not cleave off-target RNAs, although they have many target-like RNA sequences. The present results shed light on the mechanism of the hepatotoxicity of gapmers.
