Pogostemins A-C (1-3), three new meroterpenoids with pyrone-sesquiterpenoid hybrid skeletons, were isolated from the aerial parts of Pogostemon auricularius. Their chemical structures were elucidated by 1D- and 2D-NMR and HRESIMS analyses. Compound 1 showed significant cytotoxicities against the human colon adenocarcinoma SW-480, epidermoid carcinoma KB, gastric cancer AGS, hepatoma cancer Hep-G2, and lung cancer LU-1 cell lines with IC50 values of 7.21, 8.49, 9.44, 11.75, and 12.76 Î¼g/mL, respectively.
