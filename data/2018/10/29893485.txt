Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) related plasma cell neoplasms are rare in pediatric patients. We report a pediatric liver transplant recipient with plasma cell myeloma type PTLD. Cytogenetics included 1q duplication, associated with poor prognosis in adult multiple myeloma, and t(8;14). High-risk cytogenetics has not been reported in pediatric plasma cell myeloma type PTLD. The patient was treated with bortezomib, dexamethasone, and lenalidomide with subsequent autologous stem cell transplant. He achieved a 6-year remission, demonstrating tolerance to and efficacy of this modern myeloma regimen in a pediatric patient. Unfortunately, he subsequently died from complications of repeat liver transplant.
