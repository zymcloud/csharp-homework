The thioredoxin domain containing proteins are a group of proteins involved in redox regulation and have been recently reported to be associated with tumor progression. However, the role of thioredoxin proteins in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains largely unknown. Here in our study, we demonstrated that thioredoxin domain containing protein 9 (TXNDC9) was over-expressed in HCC and promoted HCC progression. We found that TXNDC9 expression was amplified in HCC tissues and associated with an advanced grade of HCC. And, we demonstrated that overexpression of TXNDC9 was correlated with poor prognosis of HCC. Furthermore, by using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated TXNDC9 knockout and RNA-seq analysis, we found that TXNDC9 accelerated HCC proliferation regulation. Moreover, we demonstrated that TXNDC9 directly interacted with MYC and knockout/knockdown of TXNDC9 decreased the protein levels of MYC and inhibited MYC-mediated transcriptional activation of its targets. Besides, we identified that TXNDC9 was trans-activated by FOXA1, JUND, and FOSL2 in HCC. Taken together, our study unveiled an oncogenic role of TXNDC9 in HCC and provided a mechanistic insight into the TXNDC9 mediated gene regulation network during HCC development.
