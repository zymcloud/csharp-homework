Rationale:Esophageal carcinosarcoma generally comprises 2 histological components: squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) and sarcoma. Esophageal carcinosarcoma comprising 3 components is extremely rare and no reports have described therapeutic effects for this disease with metastasis.Patient concerns:A 76-year-old man with dysphagia presented to a local clinic. Gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a polypoid tumor in the middle esophagus and he was referred to our hospital.Diagnosis and interventions:Thoracoscopic esophagectomy with super-extended (D3) nodal dissection and gastric tube reconstitution was performed, which resulted in carcinosarcoma comprising neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC), SqCC, and sarcoma. Pathological stage was T1bN1M0 stage IIB according to the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors-7th edition. The NEC component was observed in lymph node. At 47 days after surgery, lymph nodes, liver, and bone metastasis appeared, and tumor markers such as ProGRP and NSE were elevated. Combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide (EP) adapted to NEC was performed.Outcomes:The patient showed complete response within 4 cycles of chemotherapy. However, the disease recurred 5.5 months after the final course of EP chemotherapy.Lessons:A therapeutic strategy based on assessment of which component caused metastasis might be important for metastatic carcinosarcoma comprising 3 components, although more accumulation of data about the efficacy of chemotherapy is necessary. Moreover, elucidation of the mechanisms underlying generation of carcinosarcoma is expected in the future.
