Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor with antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, and proapoptotic properties, constitutes the only effective first-line drug approved for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Despite its capacity to increase survival in HCC patients, its success is quite low in the long term owing to the development of resistant cells through several mechanisms. Among these mechanisms, the antiangiogenic effects of sustained sorafenib treatment induce a reduction of microvessel density, promoting intratumoral hypoxia and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs)-mediated cellular responses that favor the selection of resistant cells adapted to the hypoxic microenvironment. Clinical data have demonstrated that overexpressed HIF-1α and HIF-2α in HCC patients are reliable markers of a poor prognosis. Thus, the combination of current sorafenib treatment with gene therapy or inhibitors against HIFs have been documented as promising approaches to overcome sorafenib resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Because the depletion of one HIF-α subunit elevates the expression of the other HIF-α isoform through a compensatory loop, targeting both HIF-1α and HIF-2α would be a more interesting strategy than therapies that discriminate among HIF-α isoforms. In conclusion, there is a marked correlation between the hypoxic microenvironment and sorafenib resistance, suggesting that targeting HIFs is a promising way to increase the efficiency of treatment.
