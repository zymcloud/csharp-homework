Diseases associated with the accumulation of lipid droplets are increasing in western countries. Lipid droplet biogenesis, structure and degradation are regulated by proteins of the perilipin family. Perilipin 5 has been shown to regulate basal lipolysis in oxidative tissues. We examine perilipin 5 in normal human tissues and in diseases using protein biochemical and microscopic techniques. Perilipin 5 was constitutively located at small lipid droplets in skeletal myocytes, cardiomyocytes and brown adipocytes. In addition, perilipin 5 was detected in the epithelia of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tract, especially in hepatocytes, the mitochondria-rich parietal cells of the stomach, tubular kidney cells and ductal cells of the salivary gland and pancreas. Granular cytoplasmic expression, without a lipid droplet-bound localization was detected elsewhere. In cardiomyopathies, in skeletal muscle diseases and during hepatocyte steatogenesis, perilipin 5 was upregulated and localized to larger and more numerous lipid droplets. In steatotic human hepatocytes, perilipin 5 was moderately increased and colocalized with perilipins 1 and 2 but not with perilipin 3 at lipid droplets. In liver diseases implicated in alterations of mitochondria, such as mitochondriopathies, alcoholic liver disease, Wilson's disease and acute liver injury, perilipin 5 was frequently localized to small lipid droplets and less in the cytoplasm. In tumorigenesis, perilipin 5 was especially upregulated in lipo-, leio- and rhabdomyosarcoma and hepatocellular and renal cell carcinoma. In summary, our study provides evidence that perilipin 5 is not restricted to certain cell types but localizes to distinct lipid droplet subpopulations reflecting a possible function in oxidative energy supply in normal tissues and in diseases.
