The effects of Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) differs in various types of cancers. However, its function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well-explored. In this study, we investigated the effect of HDAC inhibition on EMT in HCC cells by using trichostatin A (TSA) and valproic acid (VPA). The results showed that TSA/VPA significantly induced EMT phenotype, as demonstrated by the decreased level of E-cadherin, increased level of N-cadherin, vimentin, Twist and snail, and enhanced capacity of cell migration and invasion. In addition, CCR7 was speculated and confirmed as a function target of HDAC inhibition. CCR7 promotes the progression of HCC and is associated with poor survival. Knockdown of CCR7 significantly attenuated the effect of TSA on EMT. Moreover, our results demonstrated that HDAC inhibition up-regulates CCR7 via reversing the promoter hypoacetylation and increasing CCR7 transcription. Taken together, our study has identified the function of HDAC in EMT of HCC and suggested a novel mechanism through which TSA/VPA exerts its carcinogenic roles in HCC. HDAC inhibitors require careful caution before their application as new anticancer drugs.
