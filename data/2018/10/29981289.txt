Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a novel class of noncoding RNAs, are commonly defined as RNA molecules more than 200 nucleotides in length. Emerging research indicated that lncRNA played a vital role in human tumorigenesis and progression by serving as tumor oncogenes or suppressors. LncRNA has been shown to get involved in participate various biological processes, such as cell growth, anti-apoptosis, migration and invasion. LncRNA HOXA cluster antisense RNA2 (HOXA-AS2) is a novel cancer-related lncRNA. It was recently found to exhibit aberrant expression in a variety of malignancies, including breast cancer, gastric cancer, gallbladder carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. The oncogenicity of lncRNA HOXA-AS2 mainly inhibits or promotes the expression of related genes through direct or indirect pathways, suggesting that HOXA-AS2 likely represents a feasible biomarker or therapeutic target in human cancers. In this review, we summarize current evidences concerning the biological functions and mechanisms of HOXA-AS2 during tumor development.
