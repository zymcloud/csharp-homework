The present study examined the role of a polysaccharide (LSP, 25 and 100 μg/ml) from the fruiting bodies of Lepista sordid on the immunosuppressive enzyme indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) in HepG2 cells, and the possible mechanism of action. IDO expression and kynurenine production from LSP-treated HepG2 cells following IFN-γ stimulation were dramatically inhibited by LSP treatment. In line with this, the medium of HepG2 cells pretreated with LSP improved the survival rate of primary CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as compared with IFN-γ-treated control cells. Moreover, tyrosine 701 and serine 727 phosphorylation of STAT1 were dramatically reduced by LSP pretreatment in IFN-γ-stimulated HepG2 cells. Furthermore phosphorylation of JAK-1 and JAK-2 was also inhibited by LSP. Additionally, two IDO promoters (GAS and ISRE) were inhibited in cells pretreated with LSP prior to IFN-γ exposure. These findings suggest that LSP exerts antitumor effects on HepG2 cells by inhibiting IDO via JAK-PKC-δ-STAT1 signaling pathway.
