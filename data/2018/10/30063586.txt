Introduction:Pediatricians and liver specialists in the United States and Canada continue to encounter hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in high-risk populations, including unvaccinated children, adopted children, and immigrants. Although hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a known complication of HBV, there exists a paucity of data regarding the clinical presentation of HBV-associated HCC in children in these countries.Methods:Investigators at 4 medical centers with large numbers of HBV-positive children queried their pathology and/or oncology databases to identify all cases of HBV-infected children Results:The group identified 8 patients, 8 to 17 years old, including 6 (75%) males. All individuals were assumed to be infected through vertical transmission. Three (38%) presented initially to the emergency room, 2 (25%) to a general pediatrician, 1 (13%) to a hepatologist, and the initial location was not documented in 2 (25%) cases. Three patients were asymptomatic, but the most common symptoms were abdominal pain (50%) and fatigue (38%). Hepatomegaly was present in 5 (63%) patients. Viral load was not documented in any patient. Only 3 patients had their HBeAg status documented and all individuals were HBeAg(-) and anti-HBe(+). Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ranged from 13 to 575 IU/L, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ranged from 14 to 212 IU/L; 4 patients had AST and ALT Conclusions:Although rare, HBV-associated HCC occurs in young children, often with normal liver enzymes, bilirubin, GGT, and AFP. Only routine imaging with ultrasound or computerized axial tomography scan consistently identified the tumor. These data may help inform screening for HCC including age of initiation and the role for imaging over laboratory testing.
