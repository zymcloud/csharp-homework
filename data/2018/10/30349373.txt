Objective:The effects of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor size on clinical presentation and treatment selection and its role as a prognostic factor remain unclear. The present study is a comprehensive analysis of the clinical correlation between tumor size at diagnosis and pathological grades, clinical staging, disparities of treatment, and survival of patients with HCC.Materials and methods:Patients with HCC were separated into groups according to tumor size as follows: 0.1-2.0, 2.1-5.0, 5.1-10.0, and 10.1-20.0 cm. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between tumor size at diagnosis and pathological grade, Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) historic stage A, and treatment selection. The survival of HCC patients stratified by tumor size was estimated by Kaplan-Meier and 5-year survival analyses using the log-rank test. Multivariable analysis of overall survival was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Tumor size at diagnosis was an independent risk factor of pathological grade, and SEER historic stage A was revealed by logistic regression analysis.Results:The 5-year survival rate was 21.9% vs 14.3% vs 9.2% vs 7.7% for all HCC patients and 31.2% vs 23.6% vs 20.3% vs 15.5% for patients who underwent surgery with tumor sizes of 0.1-2.0 vs 2.1-5.0 and 5.1-10.0 vs 10.1-20.0 cm, respectively; multivariable Cox regression analysis identified tumor size at diagnosis as an independent predictor of survival risk with HR of 1.00 vs 1.66 vs 2.92 vs 3.67, respectively.Conclusion:Tumor size at diagnosis could be used as an independent risk predictor associated with histological grade, stage, selection of surgery, and survival in HCC.
