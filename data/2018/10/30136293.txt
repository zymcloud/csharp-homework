Background:Given the lack of long-term prospective studies, it is challenging for clinicians to make informed decisions about screening and treatment decisions regarding the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) who do not have cirrhosis.Aim:To characterise the pooled risk of HCC in the non-cirrhosis population.Methods:Published studies were identified through April 2016 in MEDLINE, Scopus, Science Citation Index, AMED and the Cochrane Library. Two independent reviewers screened citations and extracted data. Random effect odds ratios (OR) were calculated to obtain aggregate estimates of effect size between NASH and non-NASH groups. Between-study variability and heterogeneity were assessed.Results:Nineteen studies with 168 571 participants were included. Eighty-six per cent of included subjects had cirrhosis. The prevalence of HCC in non-cirrhotic NASH was 38.0%; among other aetiologies in non-cirrhotics, it was 14.2% (P Conclusions:In non-cirrhotic subjects, those with NASH have a higher risk of HCC compared to other aetiologies of liver disease. Further study investigating the risk factors of HCC among non-cirrhotic NASH patients is needed.
