Background:Underlying liver function is a major concern when applying surgical resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to explore the capability of the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade to predict post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) and long-term survival after hepatectomy for HCC patients with different Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages.Methods:Between January 2010 and December 2014, 338 HCC patients who were treated with liver resection were enrolled. The predictive accuracy of ALBI grade system for PHLF and long-term survival across different BCLC stages was examined.Results:A total of 26 (7.7%) patients developed PHLF. Patients were divided into BCLC 0/A and BCLC B/C categories. ALBI score was found to be a strong independent predictor of PHLF across different BCLC stages by multivariate analysis. In terms of overall survival (OS), it exhibited high discriminative power in the total cohort and in BCLC 0/A subgroup. However, differences in OS between ALBI grade 1 and 2 patients in BCLC B/C subgroup were not significant (P = 0.222).Conclusion:The ALBI grade showed good predictive ability for PHLF in HCC patients across different BCLC stages. However, the ALBI grade was only a significant predictor of OS in BCLC stage 0/A patients and failed to predict OS in BCLC stage B/C patients.
