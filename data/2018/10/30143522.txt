Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and the underlying pathophysiology of HCC is highly complex. In this study, we report that, in a bioinformatic screen of 2,783 genes encoding metabolic enzymes, GNPAT, which encodes the enzyme glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase, is amplified, upregulated, and highly correlated with poor clinical outcome in human patients with HCC. High GNPAT expression in HCC was due to its amplification and transcriptional activation by the c-Myc/KDM1A complex. GNPAT compensated the oncogenic phenotypes in c-Myc-depleted HCC cells. Mechanistically, GNPAT recruited the enzyme USP30, which deubiquitylated and stabilized dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), thereby facilitating regulation of mitochondrial morphology, lipid metabolism, and hepatocarcinogenesis. Inhibition of GNPAT and DRP1 dramatically attenuated lipid metabolism and hepatocarcinogenesis. Furthermore, DRP1 mediated the oncogenic phenotypes driven by GNPAT. Taken together, these results indicate that GNPAT and USP30-mediated stabilization of DRP1 play a critical role in the development of HCC.Significance: This study identifies and establishes the role of the enzyme GNPAT in liver cancer progression, which may serve as a potential therapeutic target for liver cancer.
