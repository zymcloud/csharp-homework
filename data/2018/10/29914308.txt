Background:A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the interleukin 28B (IL28B) gene may alter the trajectory of hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronic infection. Several studies have sought to determine a link between IL28B rs12979860 SNP and the development of HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but with variable results, and consensus is awaited. We hypothesised that IL28B rs12979860 SNP is linked to HCC in patients with HCV type 4.Methods:IL28B genotyping of 300 patients with HCV-related fibrosis (n = 100), cirrhosis (n = 100) and HCC (n = 100) was carried out and the results were analysed to determine the association between the IL28B genotype and clinical outcome.Results:In IL28B TT genotype carriers, the proportions of moderate/severe fibrosis, advanced cirrhosis (Child B-C) and HCC (50%, 84% and 60.2%, respectively) were higher (p 3cm) increased (p = 0.028) in TT genotype carriers (81.8% vs.52.6% in CC/CT).Conclusion:IL-28B rs12979860 TT genotype is more prevalent in patients with advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and HCC stages. Thus, it seems to be associated with poor outcomes in chronic HCV patients and to augment the risk of developing HCC.
