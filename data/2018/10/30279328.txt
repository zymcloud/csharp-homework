Chronic liver disease is an intractable disease, which can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatic iron overload is considered to be involved in the progression of chronic liver diseases; however, the mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here we investigate the role of dietary iron overload using chemically-induced liver cirrhosis model. Rats were fed a high-iron or standard diet and were injected intraperitoneally with thioacetamide (TAA) or saline twice a week for 20 weeks. Rats with TAA treatment (TAA group) had progressive liver cirrhosis characterized by persistent hepatocellular injury, mononuclear cell inflammation and bridging fibrosis; these lesions were markedly reduced in rats with iron feeding and TAA treatment (Fe-TAA group). Rats with iron feeding alone (Fe group) had no evidence of liver injury. Hepatic expression of cleaved caspase-3, but not phospho-RIP3, was decreased in Fe-TAA group compared with that in TAA group. The number of TUNEL-positive (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) apoptotic hepatocytes was lower in the Fe-TAA group than in the TAA group. Hepatic xenobiotic metabolism and lipid peroxidation were shown to be less related to the abrogation of liver cirrhosis. Our results suggested that dietary hepatic iron overload abrogates chemically-induced liver cirrhosis in rats, which could partly involve decreased hepatocellular apoptosis.
