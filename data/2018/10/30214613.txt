Baculoviral IAP repeat containing 7 (BIRC7/Livin/ML-IAP/KIAP; referred to as Livin throughout the present study) and placental growth factor (PlGF) are not detectable in the majority of normal differentiated tissues, but are present in a number of types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian cancer and renal cell carcinoma. The aim of the present study was to assess the expression levels of Livin and PlGF in human osteosarcoma specimens and cell lines, and to analyze the functions of Livin and PIGF in the prognosis of osteosarcoma. The expression levels of Livin and PlGF in 48 osteosarcoma specimens and three osteosarcoma cells were determined using immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The positivity rates of Livin and PlGF in osteosarcoma specimens were 58.3 and 60.4%, respectively, but were 0% in normal bone tissues. The expression levels of Livin and PlGF were increased in MG-63 cells, compared with those in the other cell lines evaluated in the present study. In addition, the expression levels of Livin and PlGF were significantly associated with tumor diameter and Enneking staging, but were independent of tumor site, age and sex of patients. The expression level of Livin was not associated with PlGF. Furthermore, the 5-year overall survival rate was decreased in the Livin or PlGF expression group, compared with that in the non-expression group (P=0.034 and P=0.012, respectively). The expression levels of Livin and PlGF were independent prognostic factors for patients with osteosarcoma. The results of the present study demonstrated that Livin and PlGF may participate in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma. Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of Livin or PlGF may provide a novel strategy for osteosarcoma treatment.
