A 59-year-old patient with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma presented with decreased consciousness and left hemiparesis. A rim-enhanced mass lesion without diffusion restriction was observed in contrast-enhanced MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging. Based on these findings, metastatic brain tumor was suspected. However, brain abscess (BA) was diagnosed after multiple bacterial colonies were observed in aspiration biopsy. Initial conventional antibiotic treatment including vancomycin had failed, so linezolid was used as second-line therapy. As a result, infection signs and clinical symptoms were resolved. We report a case with atypical imaging features and antibiotic susceptibility of a BA in an immunocompromised patient undergoing chemotherapy.
