Background and aims:Long-term prognosis after liver transplantation for alcoholic liver disease is impaired because of the occurrence of de novo malignancies and recurrent disease on liver graft. The aim of the present retrospective study was to evaluate the risk of de novo malignancy and to identify the predictive factors in a large cohort of liver-transplanted patients with a long follow-up in the setting of alcoholic liver disease.Methods:All patients who underwent a first liver transplantation for alcoholic liver disease in our centre, from December 1985 to October 2010, and who survived more than 6 months were included. Survival, incidence of de novo malignancies and several clinical and biological parameters were studied.Results:The study population consisted in 368 patients (284 males, median age 52.6 years). The cumulative incidence of a first solid organ de novo malignancy after LT was 8.7% at 5 years, 22.3% at 10 years, 31.5% at 15 years, and 33.1% at 20 years. Tobacco use (both past and current) was associated with a significant increased risk of de novo solid organ malignancy (HR 3.35 and 4.62, respectively), whereas immunosuppressive regimen including mTOR inhibitors (mTORi) was associated with a decreased risk (post-transplant time under mTORi-including immunosuppressive regimen was significantly longer in patients who did not present de novo malignancy (10.6% vs. 2.3%, P=1.4Ã—10-5)).Conclusions:Our study provides additional evidence that de novo malignancies in alcoholic liver disease liver transplant patients is a major long-term complication, and that conversion from to an mTORi-including immunosuppressive regimen could reduce this risk.
