Background:Digestive system cancers are recognized as associated with high morbidity and mortality. It is generally accepted that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) is aberrantly overexpressed or downregulated in digestive system cancers, and its prognostic value remains controversial. Accordingly, we herein conducted a meta-analysis to explore whether NDRG1 expression is correlated with overall survival (OS) and clinicopathological characteristics of patients with digestive system cancers.Methods:We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science for eligible studies up to June 6, 2017. In all, 19 publications with 21 studies, were included.Results:The pooled results showed that low NDRG1 expression was significantly associated with worse OS in colorectal cancer (pooled HR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.22-2.28, P < .001) and pancreatic cancer (pooled HR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1-3.5, P < .0001). Moreover, the relationships between low NDRG1 expression and higher OS ratio of patients with liver cancer (pooled HR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.32-0.62, P = .009) and gallbladder cancer (pooled HR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.23-1.38, P = .01) were observed. Nevertheless, no significant association was observed between low NDRG1 expression and OS in gastric cancer (pooled HR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.45-1.43, P = .46) or esophageal cancer (pooled HR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.26-2.24, P = .62).Conclusion:The prognostic significance of NDRG1 expression varies according to cancer type in patients with DSCs. Considering that several limitations existed in this meta-analysis, more studies are required to further assess the prognostic value of NDRG1 expression in patients with DSCs and relevant mechanisms.
