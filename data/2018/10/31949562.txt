This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE), and to explore its prognostic factors in elderly Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. 93 elderly HCC patients undergoing DEB-TACE were prospectively enrolled. Treatment response was assessed by mRECIST criteriaat1 month post DEB-TACE treatment, and progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated. Liver function and adverse events (AEs) within 1 month post DEB-TACE were documented. Complete response (CR) rate and objective response rate (ORR) were 18.3% and 87.1%, respectively. Additionally, medians of PFS and OS were 9.0 months and 21.0 months, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that no factor independently predicted CR achievement, while tumor size â‰¥5.0 cm and AFP abnormal were independent factors for predicting both shorter PFS and OS, and higher BCLC stage was an independent predictive factor for unfavorable OS. As to safety profiles, the percentages of patients with abnormal TBIL, ALT, AST, and ALP were increased at 1 week, while they were not different at 1 month post DEB-TACE treatment compared with baseline. Most frequent AEs were pain, fever, nausea or vomiting; skin discolorations, myelosuppression, and other AEs were relatively rare. In conclusion, DEB-TACE was efficient and well tolerated in elderly HCC patients, and increased tumor size, abnormal AFP, as well as higher BCLC stage could be independent markers for predicting worse prognosis.
