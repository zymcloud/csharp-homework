Objective: To investigate the safety and efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) using bleomycin for the treatment of medium-advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Between December 2015 and December 2017, a total of 160 patients from the Chinese PLA General Hospital with moderate-advanced HCC whose diagnoses were confirmed by pathology or clinical imaging and were in accord with the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging criteria were prospectively analyzed.All patients had shown persistent viable tumor or tumor progression after at least 2 sessions of TACE.All patients included 135 males and 25 females , age 35-74 (57Â±8)years, were randomly divided into two groups, the treatment group: TACE procedures consisted of bleomycin+ pirarubicin+ oxaliplatin+ fluorouracil, the control group: pirarubicin+ oxaliplatin+ fluorouracil, and according to modified RECIST criteria the tumor response was evaluated once every 4-6 weeks, survival analysis was performed, overall survival and progression free survival were evaluated.the adverse events were recorded. Results: Response rate of the treatment group was 27.5%(22/80), the median progression free survival(mPFS)was 5.8 months, and the median overall survival (mOS) was 8.1 months.Response rate of the control group was 7.5%(6/80), mPFS of 2.9 months, and mOS of 4 months.The differences in mPFS and in mOS between the two groups were statistically significant (P=0.009, 0.002 respectively), and no serious adverse occurred. Conclusion: It is suggested that transarterial chemoembolization with bleomycin is safe and effective for medium-advenced HCC.
