Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been one of the most highly lethal cancers. The acquisition of drug resistance accounts for the majority of poor effects of chemotherapy in HCC. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) including miRNAs, long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNA (circRNA) have been well-documented to participate in cancer occurrence and progression. Recently, multiple studies have highlighted the key roles of ncRNAs in chemoresistance of HCC. In addition, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that they can serve as biomarkers in diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of HCC. In this review, we first overviewed up-to-date findings regarding miRNA and lncRNA in drug resistance of HCC, then summarized specific mechanisms that they modulate chemoresistance of HCC, and finally discussed their potential clinical application in overcoming the obstacle of HCC chemoresistance in the future.
