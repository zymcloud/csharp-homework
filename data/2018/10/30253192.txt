Cellular miRNAs influence Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in multiple ways. In this study, we demonstrate that miR-125b-5p is upregulated in HCV infected patient serum samples as well as in HCV infected liver carcinoma cells and is involved in translational regulation of one of its predicted targets, Human antigen R (HuR). We used miRNA mimics and antagomiRs to confirm that HuR is a bonafide miR-125b target. Previously, we have shown that HuR is a positive regulator of HCV replication, whereas we noticed that miR-125b is a negative regulator of HCV infection. As a connecting link between these two observations, we showed that knockdown of miR-125b-5p increased HuR protein levels and rescued HCV replication when the availability of HuR in the cytoplasm was compromised using siRNAs against HuR or an inhibitor of HuR export to the cytoplasm. Overall, the study sheds light on the ability of host cell to use a miRNA as a tool to control virus propagation.
