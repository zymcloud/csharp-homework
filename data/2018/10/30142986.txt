Zinc-binding protein-89 (ZBP-89) is a Kr√ºppel-type zinc-finger transcription factor that regulates target gene expression profiles via directly binding to GC-rich gene promoters, recruiting chromatin modifiers or by interacting with other proteins. The importance of ZBP-89 in the regulation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis has led to increased interest and investigations for its role in cancer development. Areas covered: We describe ZBP-89 as a candidate therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from several perspectives. ZBP-89 can upregulate apoptosis in HCC in a p53-dependent or - independent manner. In addition, the negative regulation of ZBP-89 on liver cancer stemness sheds light on its possible effect on sensitizing HCC to chemotherapies and the reduction of HCC relapse. The prognostic significance of ZBP-89 in HCC patients further suggests its clinical importance as a potential tumor suppressor. Expert opinion: Given the roles of ZBP-89 in HCC, we believe, ZBP-89 is a promising therapeutic target for enhancing apoptosis and diminishing the liver cancer stemness. At the same time, we also face a series of challenges, especially in the clinical implication of ZBP-89. Resolving the current controversies will advance the development of ZBP-89 for anti-HCC therapy.
