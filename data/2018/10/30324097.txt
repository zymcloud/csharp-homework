At the 2018 Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium, sponsored by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, significant advances in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were announced. In intermediate-stage disease (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B), interest in combining transarterial chemoembolization and sorafenib has been reignited as a consequence of the TACTICS trial. In advanced-stage disease (BCLC C), external-beam radiotherapy combined with transarterial chemoembolization proved to be superior to sorafenib in patients with portal vein thrombosis according to the START trial. Also, in patients with advanced-stage HCC, the CELESTIAL trial demonstrated survival benefits for patients undergoing treatment with cabozantinib in the second-line setting. Lastly, recent data on the activity of pembrolizumab in patients with HCC highlight the role of immunotherapy in the management of this disease in the years to come.
