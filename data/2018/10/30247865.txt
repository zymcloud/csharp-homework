Background:Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality after liver resection. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have a higher risk of AKI owing to the underlying association between hepatic and renal dysfunction. Use of the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) diagnostic criteria is recommended for patients with cirrhosis, but remains poorly studied following liver resection. We compared the prognostic value of the AKIN creatinine and urine output criteria in terms of postoperative outcomes following liver resection for HCC.Methods:All patients who underwent a liver resection for HCC from January 2010 to June 2016 were included. We used AKIN urine output and creatinine criteria to assess for AKI within 48 hours of surgery.Results:Eighty liver resections were performed during the study period. Cirrhosis was confirmed in 80%. Median hospital stay was 9 (interquartile range 7â€“12) days, and 30-day mortality was 2.5%. The incidence of AKI was higher based on the urine output than on the creatinine criterion (53.8% v. 20%), and was associated with prolonged hospitalization and 30-day postoperative mortality when defined by serum creatinine (hospital stay: 11.2 v. 20.1 d, p = 0.01; mortality: 12.5% v. 0%, p < 0.01), but not urine output (hospital stay: 15.6 v. 10 d, p = 0.05; mortality: 2.3% v. 2.7%, p > 0.99).Conclusion:The urine output criterion resulted in an overestimation of AKI and compromised the prognostic value of AKIN criteria. Revision may be required to account for the exacerbated physiologic postoperative reduction in urine output in patients with HCC.
