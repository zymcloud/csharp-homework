The prognosis for small hepatocellular carcinomas (SHCC) remains uncertain. The aim of the present study was to compare three local tumor lesion treatments and identify the prognostic factors in patients with SHCC by analyzing preoperative indicators. A retrospective study was performed using data from 206 patients with SHCC from 2006-2015. All of the patients had undergone transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) alone, TACE plus percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy (PMCT) or surgical resection (SR). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the survival rates. Multivariate analysis was conducted using Cox regression analysis. The median survival time of patients with SHCC was 27 (range, 14-49) months in the TACE group, 29.5 (range, 16-52) months in the TACE-PMCT group and 36.5 (range, 26-52) months in the SR group (P=0.091). The 1, 3 and 5-year survival rates for patients with SHCC were 82.4, 64.9 and 46.8% in the TACE group; 89.0, 72.6 and 58.3% in the TACE-PMCT group and 88.8, 72.3 and 58.6% in the SR group (P=0.181), respectively. Analysis from the Cox regression model demonstrated that preoperative Î±-fetoprotein (AFP;
