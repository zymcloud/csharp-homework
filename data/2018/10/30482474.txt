Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most predominant tumor types worldwide, being particularly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia. However, HCC is inexplicably underreported in South America, despite unsettling clinical epidemiological trends of the disease on this continent. Here, we review the current knowledge on HCC presentation in Peru. We emphasize the well-documented occurrence of an early-age nosological form of the disease in Andean descent populations. We further discuss the reasons for such HCC clinical presentation, as well as the implications for liver cancer screening, management, and prevention.
