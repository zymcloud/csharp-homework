There is a worldwide problem of waiting time and mortality rate associated with remaining on the waiting list for a liver transplant. However, some situations have been encouraging in terms of determining appropriate recipients and expanding the donor criteria. We herein report a case of useful liver donor with sickle cell anemia for liver transplantation. Here we described a case of liver transplantation from a donor with sickle cell anemia to a recipient with hepatocellular carcinoma who was deemed to be at risk of tumor growth and at risk of being dropped from the waiting list. The literature reveals the importance of using safe donors, and we describe the benefits of using a safe, deceased liver donor with sickle cell anemia who was an adequate option for liver transplantation.
