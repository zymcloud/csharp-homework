Objective:MicroRNA (miR)-431 plays an essential role in various human cancer types, particularly in the process of invasion. However, the function and mechanism of miR-431-5p in the invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain undefined.Methods:The expression levels of miR-431-5p and its potential target protein UROC28 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and tissues were detected, and the levels of EMT markers in vivo and in vitro were also detected.Results:MiR-431-5p was downregulated in HCC cell lines and tissues and associated with vascular invasion and tumor encapsulation. Furthermore, miR-431-5p was able to influence the epithelialto-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in HCCLM3 and HUH7 cells. Mechanistically, it was discovered that miR-431-5p repressed invasion by targeting UROC28. Furthermore, miR-431-5p influenced the EMT markers in HCCLM3 and HUH7 cells by downregulating UROC28 expression. Similarly, in vivo assays confirmed that miR-431-5p upregulation in HCC cells remarkably inhibited tumor proliferation and influenced the EMT markers.Conclusion:The current study has demonstrated that the miR-431-5p/UROC28 axis acts possible influence on the EMT in HCC. Upregulation of miR-431-5p could be an original approach for inhibiting tumor invasion.
