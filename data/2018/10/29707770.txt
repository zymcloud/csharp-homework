To better inform the next clinical trials of vascular disrupting agent combretastatin-A4-phosphate (CA4P) in patients with hepatic malignancies, this preclinical study aimed at evaluating CA4P therapeutic efficacy in rats with primary hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) of a full spectrum of differentiation and vascularity by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), microangiography and histopathology. Ninety-six HCCs were raised in 25 rats by diethylnitrosamine gavage. Tumor growth was monitored by T2-/T1-weighted-MRI (T2WI, T1WI) using a 3.0 T scanner. Early vascular response and later intratumoral necrosis were detected by dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI and diffusion-weighted-imaging (DWI) before, 1 and 12 hr after CA4P iv-administration. In vivo MRI-findings were validated by postmortem-techniques. Multi-parametric MRI revealed rapid CA4P-induced tumor vascular shutdown within 1 hr, followed by variable intratumoral necrosis at 12 hr. Tumor volumes decreased by 10% at 1 hr (p
