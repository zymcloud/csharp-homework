Objective: To investigate the clinical effectiveness of postoperative nutritional support in patients undergoing hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: A total of 379 HCC patients who received partial hepatectomy from January 2010 to December 2013 in Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery of Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences were selected. Based on the nutritional method, all of the enrolled patients were divided into two group: 142 patients who received early enteral nutrition (EEN) combined with parenteral nutrition (PN) were identified as EEN+ PN group; 237 patients who received total parenteral nutrition (TPN) were identified as TPN group. These two groups were even divided into two subgroups, centrally located HCC (cl-HCC) and non-centrally located HCC (ncl-HCC). The clinical effectiveness of different groups was assessed and compared. Results: The age, gender, body mass index (BMI), the maximum diameter of the tumor, the amount of operative bleeding and postoperative infective rate did not show statistically significant differences between EEN+ PN group and TPN group (P>0.05). On the seventh postoperative day (7(th) POD), aspartate transaminase (AST) of EEN+ PN group and TPN group were (41.6±2.0) IU/L and (50.4±3.2) IU/L respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of these two groups were (80.8±2.4) IU/L and (90.2±2.3) IU/L, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Total bilirubin (TBIL) of these two groups were (15.8±0.7) μmol/L and (19.1±0.7) μmol/L, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). On the 7(th) POD, AST in cl-HCC subgroups of EEN+ PN group and TPN group were (39.6±2.6) IU/L and (61.0±7.0) IU/L, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). TBIL in cl-HCC subgroups of these two groups were (14.4±0.9) μmol/L and (20.7±1.3) μmol/L, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). On the 7(th) POD, ALP in ncl-HCC subgroups of these two groups were (79.3±3.0) IU/L and (89.9±3.1) IU/L, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The total length of stay (t-LOS) of these two groups were (15.8±0.4) days and (17.1±0.4) days, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Postoperative LOS (postop-LOS) of these two groups were (8.6±0.2) days and (10.1±0.3) days, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Total length of stay (t-LOS) in ncl-HCC subgroups of these two groups were (15.1±0.5) days and (16.6±0.3) days, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Postoperative LOS (postop-LOS) in ncl-HCC subgroups of these two groups were (8.4±0.2) days and (9.5±0.2) days, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Postoperative LOS (postop-LOS) in cl-HCC subgroups of these two groups were (8.7±0.2) days and (11.0±0.8) days, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Postoperative hospitalization expenses of these two groups were (20 855.0±549.8) yuan and (23 373.0±715.5) yuan, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Postoperative hospitalization expenses in cl-HCC subgroups of these two groups were (21 012.0±748.5) yuan and (24 697.0±1 409.0) yuan, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Conclusion: EEN+ PN can improve the liver function, shorten the postoperative hospitalization time and reduce the postoperative hospitalization expenses of HCC patients in need of nutritional support.
