PlncRNA-1 has been suggested to function as an oncogenic role in prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and gastric cancer. The expression pattern of PlncRNA-1 in retinoblastoma remained unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the clinical significance of PlncRNA-1 in retinoblastoma patient and the biological function and molecular mechanism of PlncRNA-1 in regulating retinoblastoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The results showed the level of PlncRNA-1 expression was obviously increased in retinoblastoma tissues and cell lines compared with compared with normal retina tissues and retina cell lines, respectively. Meanwhile, patients with advanced stage retinoblastoma had higher levels of PlncRNA-1 expression than patients with early stage retinoblastoma. There was an inverse correlation between PlncRNA-1 expression and CBR3 expression in retinoblastoma tissues, and PlncRNA-1 negatively regulated mRNA and protein expressions of CBR3. The in vitro experiments showed that down-regulation of PlncRNA-1 expression suppressed retinoblastoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion through up-regulating CBR3. In conclusion, PlncRNA-1 serves as an oncogenic lncRNA in regulating retinoblastoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through proliferation, migration, and invasion through up-regulating CBR3.
