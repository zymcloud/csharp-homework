Background:Application of dendritic cells (DC) for cancer immunotherapy involves tumor-associated immunogenic antigens for effective therapeutic strategies. The present study investigated whether DC co-cultured with autologous cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) could induce a more specific immune response against liver cancer stem cells (LCSC) generated from human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in vitro and in vivo.Methods:Human DC and CIK were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) taken from consenting liver cancer patients. Flow cytometry was used to determine the phenotypes of DC and CIK, and cell proliferation. The tumor growth and anti-tumor activity of these cells were further evaluated using a nude mouse tumor model.Results:We demonstrated that DC and CIK significantly enhanced the apoptosis ratio, depending on DC-CIK cell numbers, by increasing caspase-3 protein expression and reducing proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein expression against LCSC. The in vivo data indicated that DC-CIK exhibited significant LCSC cell-induced tumor growth inhibition in nude mice, which was most significant with LCSC antigen loaded DCs.Conclusions:The results showed, that DC-CIK cells could inhibit HCC and LCSC growths in vitro and in vivo and the most successful DC triggering of cell cytotoxic activity could be achieved by their LCSC antigen loading.
