Purpose:In isolated adrenocorticoropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency (IAD), autoimmunity against corticotrophs has been suggested; however, the pathogenesis remains largely unknown. Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) of the lung is a pulmonary tumor of high-grade malignant neuroendocrine tumor and it reportedly caused paraneoplastic syndrome by autoimmunity in several cases.Methods:A 42-year-old woman with isolated adrenocorticotropic (ACTH) hormone deficiency (IAD) was diagnosed with large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) 3 years after being diagnosed with IAD. We hypothesized that the LCNEC played a causal role in the development of IAD as a paraneoplastic syndrome and analyzed the autoimmunity. We also analyzed another case of ectopic ACTH syndrome to prove this hypothesis.Results:The LCNEC tissue revealed an ectopic ACTH expression and lymphocyte infiltration. Interestingly, autoantibody against the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) protein was detected in the peripheral blood. Although, patient's serum did not show any effects on cell viability, proliferation, nor pomc expression in a corticotroph cell line, AtT20 cells, patient's lymphocytes in the peripheral blood specifically reacted toward POMC protein, indicating a presence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In addition, the analysis of another case of ectopic ACTH syndrome showed lymphocyte infiltration not only in the metastatic liver tumors but also in the pituitary. Moreover, most CD8-positive cells resided adjacent to corticotrophs.Conclusions:These data indicate that the ectopic ACTH expression in the tumor evoked the autoimmunity to corticotrophs and caused IAD as a form of paraneoplastic syndrome.
