Background:To date, epidemiological evidence of the association between preoperative prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial.Methods:A literature search was performed in the databases of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Hazard ratio (HR), odds ratio (OR), and 95% confidence interval (CI) were extracted to estimate the association of preoperative PNI with overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and postoperative recurrence of HCC, respectively. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled effect size.Results:Thirteen studies with a total of 3,738 patients with HCC met inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis. It indicated that a lower level of preoperative PNI was a significant predictor of worse OS (HR = 1.82, 95%CI: 1.44-2.31) and DFS (HR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.06-2.07). In addition, risk of postoperative recurrence was significantly higher in patients with a lower preoperative PNI (OR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.33-2.76). Subgroup analysis based on therapeutic intent demonstrated a significant positive association between preoperative low PNI and worse OS for those patients undergoing surgical resection and for those undergoing TACE or non-surgical treatment.Conclusion:The current meta-analysis demonstrates that preoperative PNI is a prognostic marker in HCC.
