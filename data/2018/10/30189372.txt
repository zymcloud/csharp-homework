Background:It is unclear whether elevated fasting serum glucose level and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), irrespective of obesity in patients with chronic hepatitis B.Patients and methods:Our study population comprised 214,167 Korean men with chronic hepatitis B in the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database between January 2002 and December 2006. Data on new events of HCC were obtained by records of the NHIS during the follow-up. We used Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle, health status and clinical conditions to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of HCC associated with different categories of fasting serum glucose level and T2DM, using fasting serum glucose Results:During the 8 years of follow-up, there were 11,241 HCCs in men with chronic hepatitis B. Compared with the reference group, fasting serum glucose level of more than 140 mg/dL (HR = 1.46; 95% CI: 1.36-1.57; p 2) and obese (â‰¥25.0 kg/m2) patients (Ptrend < 0.001).Conclusion:In this cohort of men with chronic hepatitis B infection, elevated fasting serum glucose level and T2DM were significantly associated with an increased risk of HCC, regardless of obesity. Glycaemic control in men with chronic hepatitis B patients should be considered in clinical practice to prevent HCC.
