Aim:The effects of circulating eosinophils and basophils on cancer survival are unclear. Here, we aimed to explore the impacts of eosinophils and basophils on prognosis of stage I-III colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.Methods:From February 2003 to March 2013, 569 stage I-III CRC patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. The associations between pretreatment circulating eosinophils, basophils and CRC overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) were investigated. Moreover, the prognostic value of combined eosinophils/basophils and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR)/platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) was investigated.Results:Kaplan-Meier methods showed the associations of eosinophils < 0.095 × 109 /L and shorter OS (P < 0.0001), eosinophils < 0.055 × 109 /L and shorter DFS (P < 0.0001), basophils < 0.015 × 109 /L and shorter OS (P = 0.001), basophils < 0.015 × 109 /L and shorter DFS (P = 0.005). Cox regression model showed that eosinophils < 0.095 × 109 /L (hazard ratio [HR], 1.723; 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 1.177-2.523) and basophils < 0.015 × 109 /L (HR, 1.714; 95% CI = 1.152-2.548) were independent prognostic factors for OS, and eosinophils < 0.055 × 109 /L (HR, 2.309; 95% CI = 1.587-3.361) and basophils < 0.015 × 109 /L (HR, 1.397; 95% CI = 1.003-1.945) were independent prognostic factors for DFS, respectively. The combined eosinophil-PLR (HR, 2.611; 95% CI = 1.328-5.130) and basophil-PLR (HR, 2.520; 95% CI = 1.240-5.123) were the independent prognostic factors for OS. The combined eosinophil-NLR (HR, 2.770; 95% CI = 1.528-5.019) and eosinophil-PLR (HR, 4.788; 95% CI = 2.458-9.329) were the independent prognostic factors for DFS.Conclusion:Pretreatment circulating eosinophils < 0.095 × 109 /L/0.055 × 109 /L and circulating basophils < 0.015 × 109 /L have significant impacts on prognosis of stage I-III CRC patients.
