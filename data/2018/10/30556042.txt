Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, and an association between altered bile acid (BA) metabolism, down-regulation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which is a master regulator of BA metabolism, and hepatocarcinogenesis has been documented. While global FXR deficiency in mice results in spontaneous HCC with aging, the contribution of tissue-specific FXR deficiency to hepatocarcinogenesis remains unclear. In this study, the prevalence of hepatic tumors, expression of genes related to tumorigenesis, and serum/liver BA levels were compared among male whole-body Fxr-null, hepatocyte-specific Fxr-null (Fxr ∆Hep), and enterocyte-specific Fxr-null (Fxr ∆IE) mice at the age of 3, 14, and 20 months. More than 90% of 20-month-old whole-body Fxr-null mice had hepatic tumors with enhanced hepatic expression of myelocytomatosis oncogene (Myc) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4) messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and elevated serum taurocholate (TCA) and tauromuricholate (TMCA) and their respective unconjugated derivatives. The incidence of hepatic tumors was significantly lower in Fxr ∆Hep and Fxr ∆IE mice (20% and 5%, respectively), and the increases in Myc and Cdk4 mRNA or serum BA concentrations were not detected in these mice compared to Fxr floxed [fl]/fl mice; a similar tendency was observed in 14-month-old mice. However, increased hepatic c-Myc protein expression was found only in Fxr-null mice at the age of 3, 14, and 20 months. Treatment with TCA induced Myc expression in Fxr-null cultured primary mouse hepatocytes but not in wild-type (WT) mouse hepatocytes, demonstrating that the combination of hepatocyte FXR disruption with elevated TCA is required for Myc induction and ensuing age-dependent hepatocarcinogenesis in Fxr-null mice. Conclusion: There is a relatively low risk of hepatic tumors by inhibition of FXR in enterocytes, likely due to the lack of increased TCA and Myc induction.
