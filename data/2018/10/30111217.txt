Objectives This study aimed to examine a simple, effective, time-saving, and low-cost protein microarray method for detecting serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and AFP-L3 levels. Methods Serum samples from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (n = 33) and control subjects (n = 39) were collected and evaluated for the presence of AFP using a novel protein microarray. Glycoprotein (including AFP-L3) was enriched from crude samples by a Hotgen Biotech glycosyl capture spin column and then detected by protein microarray. An electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) was used to validate the measured values. Results Neither AFP levels lower than 20 ng/mL in the HCC group nor AFP levels higher than 20 ng/mL in the control group were found when tested by the ECLIA and protein microarray. The kappa test showed good consistency in the diagnostic performance of measuring serum AFP levels and the percentage of AFP-L3 in total AFP by the ECLIA and protein microarray. Protein microarray had advantages of smaller sample size required, low cost, and convenience compared with the ECLIA. Conclusion The protein microarray assay that was developed in the present study shows potential as an economic and convenient technique for detecting AFP and AFP-L3 levels in serum samples from patients with HCC.
