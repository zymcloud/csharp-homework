Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most frequent tumor worldwide and it is responsible for approximately 750 000 deaths each year. It is the third leading cause of cancer death in Mexico. Despite the existing therapeutic regimens, HCC has a poor prognosis with a life expectancy of approximately one month in advanced cases. The use of celecoxib and pentoxifylline has recently been reported in tumor patients with promising results due to its anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, antifibrotic and proapoptotic effects. Nonetheless, the combination of both drugs for the treatment of HCC has never been employed.Clinical case:58-year-old male patient, who arrived to the examination room for presenting nausea, jaundice, asthenia, adynamia and encephalopathy grade I-II. The patient had a history of alcoholism for 47 years and diagnosis of cirrhosis in Child C stage. An image with focal lesion in the right lobe of 8 x 8 cm, which was highly vascularized, suggested HCC by means of imaging studies (ultrasound, computed axial tomography [CAT] and magnetic resonance imaging). Management began in January, 2015, and continues until today with 400 mg of pentoxifylline every 12 hours, 200 mg of celecoxib every 12 hours and vitamin supplements.Conclusion:After one month, patient showed a surprising response, reduction in tumor size almost in its entirety, improvement of clinical condition, and turned into Child A stage. Eight months after treatment it was observed by CAT that the tumor had practically disappeared. Patient has survived for more than two years. These results are encouraging; however, it is necessary to conduct multicenter studies that prove the efficacy of the treatment.
