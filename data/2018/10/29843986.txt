Background:potentially curative treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) include liver transplantation (LT), liver resection (LR) and thermal ablation (TA). Long term intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis from a single-centre using all three modalities contemporaneously has not been published.Methods:An ITT analysis was undertaken of all patients with HCC listed for LT, or have undergone LR or TA.Results:444 patients were identified; 145 were listed for LT (121 underwent LT), 190 underwent LR and 109 underwent TA. One and 3-year overall survival (OS) was similar among LT, LR and TA (88/77%, 88/64% and 95/72%) whereas 5-year OS was higher following LT than LR or TA (73% vs. 54% vs. 49%). Disease-free survival at 1- and 5-years was higher for LT (97% and 84%) than LR (66% and 35%) or TA (73%, and 19%).Conclusion:LT offered the lowest rate of cancer recurrence and highest chance of long-term survival. Differences in outcome likely reflect a combination of cancer-related factors (AFP, micro- and macrovascular invasion), patient-related factors (performance status, co-morbidities and psychosocial issues) and treatment type. Two thirds of patients treated by LR and three quarters treated by TA had HCC recurrence by 5 years, reinforcing the need for close long-term surveillance.
