Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains as the fifth most common cancer in the world and accounts for more than 700,000 deaths annually. Changes in serum glycosylation have long been associated with this cancer but the source of that material is unknown and direct glycan analysis of HCC tissues has been limited. Our laboratory previously developed a method of in situ tissue based N-linked glycan imaging that bypasses the need for microdissection and solubilization of tissue prior to analysis. We used this methodology in the analysis of 138 HCC tissue samples and compared the N-linked glycans in cancer tissue with either adjacent untransformed or tissue from patients with liver cirrhosis but no cancer. Ten glycans were found significantly elevated in HCC tissues as compared to cirrhotic or adjacent tissue. These glycans fell into two major classes, those with increased levels of fucosylation and those with increased levels of branching with or without any fucose modifications. In addition, increased levels of fucosylated glycoforms were associated with a reduction in survival time. This work supports the hypothesis that the increased levels of fucosylated N-linked glycans in HCC serum are produced directly from the cancer tissue.
