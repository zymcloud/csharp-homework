Viral Hepatitis B is a major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa accounting for approximately 65 million of chronic carriers and 56.000 deaths per year. Our study aims to investigate the epidemiological paraclinical, therapeutic and evolutionary features of viral hepatitis B in patients followed up in our Department and to describe their serological profiles. We conducted a retrospective, longitudinal study in the Hepatogastroenterology Department at the Aristide Le Dantec Hospital in Dakar from 2010 to 2014. We included all HBsAg positive patients followed up on an ambulatory basis or hospitalized. We collected data from 728 medical records of patients infected with Hepatitis B virus: 7 cases of acute hepatitis, 442 cases of chronic infections, 161 cases of cirrhosis and 118 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. The average age of patients was 33 years [14 - 83 years] with a sex ratio of 2.2. The circumstances in which it was diagnosed included systematic screening (26.2%), right hypochondrium pain (23%) and donation of blood (18.6%). Fifty nine were Hepatitis B virus mono-infected and had chronic active hepatitis. Inactive carriers were 118. Serological status was undetermined in 252 patients due to clinical examination inadequacy related to economic constraints. Antiviral Hepatitis B treatment wasn't performed in 58 patients. Patients' virologic and biochemical response after 120 weeks of treatment with Tenofovir was 85% and 100% respectively. Hepatitis B virus is a major cause of liver disease in Senegal.
