Psyllium leaves polysaccharides were physicochemically characterized and evaluated for antioxidant, free-radical scavenging and anticancer activities. The polysaccharide comprised of arabinose, rhamnose, xylose, galactose, and glucose. FTIR and NMR study exhibited the presence of key functional groups whereas morphological study revealed that crude polysaccharides are aggregates of irregular shape, non-porous, and smooth surface, while the purified products are porous and fibrous in nature. Extracted polysaccharides were thermally stable and exhibited the characteristic diffraction curve with a higher viscosity and size distribution. Biochemical analyses demonstrated the higher antioxidant and scavenging activities. In vitro anticancer assay showed the maximum inhibitory effect about 33% on Huh7 and about 30% on HeLa cell lines. The study confirmed the presence of high antioxidant and free-radical scavenging activities with a potential anticancer activity. The polysaccharide could be developed as a potential natural antioxidant and anticancer agents after comprehensive studies on experimental animal models.
