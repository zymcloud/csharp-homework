Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Early diagnosis and treatment of HCC remain a key goal for improving patient survival. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk factor for HCC development. Pre-S mutants harboring deletions in HBV large surface antigen have been well demonstrated as HBV oncoproteins that dysregulate multiple signaling pathways in hepatocytes, leading to HCC formation. The presence of pre-S mutants in plasma represents important predictive and prognostic markers for HCC in patients with chronic HBV infection. However, the method to detect pre-S mutants remains to be optimized. In this study, we developed a platform, based on the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, for detection of pre-S mutants in plasma of HBV-related HCC patients. Compared to the current TA cloning-based analysis, the NGS-based analysis could detect pre-S deletion quantitatively, and the detection rate was significantly more sensitive in 49 plasma analyzed (McNemar's paired proportion test, P value
