Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation show a high response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). Clinically, EGFR-positive NSCLC acquires several resistance mechanisms during EGFR-TKI treatment, such as the emergence of a secondary mutation (T790M), MET gene amplification, and transformation to small cell lung cancer. However, the mechanism of resistance to afatinib, a second-generation EGFR-TKI, remains unclear. In this study, we prospectively investigate the mechanism of resistance to afatinib using proteomic analyses.In total, 35 EGFR-positive NSCLC patients of both sexes and â‰¥20 years old will be included. NSCLC patients with major obstacles in major organs, such as bone marrow, heart, lung, liver, and kidney, will be excluded. Eligible patients will be administered afatinib or gefitinib until disease progression and proteomic analysis will be performed with biopsy samples before treatment and at disease progression.The primary outcome is to detect the potential predictive anomalies in proteins that can be candidates for the resistance factor of afatinib. The secondary outcome is to detect gene and protein abnormalities affecting progression-free survival, response rate, and rate of disease control in afatinib therapy.The protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine and all the participating hospitals. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before registration, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The results of the study will be disseminated via publications in peer-reviewed journals.Trial registration number is UMIN000031013.
