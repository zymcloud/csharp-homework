Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), especially non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic liver disease commonly associated with hepatic fibrosis. NASH patients have an increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An altered retinol metabolism is one of the pathways involved in the process of hepatic fibrosis, and enzymes involved in retinol metabolism have been associated with HCC. We aimed to determine the association between plasma retinol levels and hepatic expression of genes related to retinol metabolism, as well as to assess the hepatic expression of transcription factors regulated by retinoic acid in patients with NAFLD. Cross-sectional study where hepatic gene expression (Illumina microarray) and plasma retinol levels (HPLC) were measured in 17 patients with simple steatosis (SS), 15 with NASH, and 22 living liver donors (LD) as controls. Plasma retinol levels were higher in SS (1.53 ± 0.44 μmol/L) and NASH (1.51 ± 0.56 μmol/L) compared to LD (1.21 ± 0.38 μmol/L; p
