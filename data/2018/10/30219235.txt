To investigate the effect of multi-kinase kinase inhibitors (sorafenib; regorafenib; lenvatinib) on the invasion and metastasis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, and the outcome of this effect on the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs), yet unclarified. Cells were subjected to four different treatments: blank control group, sorafenib (10 μmol/L) treatment group, regorafenib (20 mmol/L) treatment group, and lenvatinib (4 μmol/L) treatment group. Anti-invasion and anti-metastasis effects were tested using the wound-healing assay and transwell invasion assay. Real-time PCR and Western blot analyses were used to determine the impact of sorafenib, regorafenib, and lenvatinib on the gene expression of MMPs and TIMPs in the two HCC lines (Hep3B and SMMC-7721). Results from the wound-healing and transwell invasion assays showed the three tested anti-cancer drugs to have a significant inhibitory effect on the metastasis and invasion of HCC cells. Real-time PCR and western blot analyses revealed that sorafenib down-regulated the expressions of MMP-7,10,16 and up-regulated those of TIMP-1,3,4, regorafenib down-regulated the expression of MMP-1 and up-regulated TIMP-3 gene expression, and lenvatinib down-regulated the expressions of MMP-1,2,7,9,10,16 and up-regulated those of TIMP-1,3,4. However, these three targeted anti-cancer drugs seem to have no significant regulatory effect on the expressions of other MMPs and TIMPs family genes. In conclusion, sorafenib, regorafenib, and lenvatinib inhibit the invasion and metastasis of HCC cells by regulating MMPs/TIMPs expression levels.
