Background:Malignant ovarian germ cell tumours typically require multimodal therapy including surgery and systemic platinum-based chemotherapy. Most patients are cured, with survival rates exceeding 95%.Case:This report describes an unusual case of ovarian germ cell tumour (GCT) recurring 15 years after surgery and manifesting as metastatic disease to the liver, lung, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.Conclusion:Thymic hyperplasia was a confounding finding in this case, and it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a mediastinal mass in heavily treated patients with GCT.
