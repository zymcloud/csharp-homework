Purpose:To evaluate whether changes in volumetric iodine concentration (VIC) could serve as a suitable predictor of therapeutic response to microwave (MW) ablation in a rabbit intrahepatic VX2 tumor model.Materials and methods:Sixteen intrahepatic VX2 tumors were transplanted in 8 New Zealand White rabbits treated with MW ablation. Contrast-enhanced dual-energy CT scans were obtained at baseline and follow-up. Therapeutic response assessment by modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (mRECIST), Choi criteria, and VIC changes was performed. An intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to characterize consistency of assessment results among the criteria used. Technical success was evaluated with explant pathologic findings as a reference. Correlations between technical success and variations in diameter, CT density, and VIC were analyzed.Results:Disease control was observed in 4, 8, and 10 of the 16 tumors per mRECIST, Choi criteria, and VIC changes, respectively. VIC exhibited strong consistency (ICC = 0.807, P Conclusions:Compared with mRECIST and Choi criteria, dual-energy CT-derived VIC allowed for better prediction of therapeutic response after MW ablation and could provide a potential imaging biomarker of tumor response to MW ablation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
