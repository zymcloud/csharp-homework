The S100 protein family is widely involved in the pathological process of various types of cancer. However, the prognostic value of the S100 protein family member S100A12 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. A total of 139 patients undergoing curative surgical resection for HCC from December 2005 to June 2006 were investigated. Immunohistochemistry of S100A12 tissue was performed and expression was classified according to the total positive staining area. Co-expression of S100A12 with cluster of differentiation (CD)11B, CD15 and CD68 was evaluated using immunofluorescence. Associations between S100A12 expression and preoperative clinicopathological parameters were assessed using a χ2 test or independent sample Student's t-test. Kaplan-Meier estimator survival analysis and multivariate Cox's proportional hazard regression model were used to evaluate the prognostic value of S100A12 expression. The expression of S100A12 was restricted exclusively to stroma cells, primarily to myeloid-derived immune cells, CD15-positive neutrophils and CD68-positive macrophages in particular. A total positive staining area of 1,600 µm2 was selected as the threshold between high and low S100A12 expression. There was a statistically significant association between intratumoral S100A12 expression and tumor differentiation (P=0.010). High expression of S100A12 on intratumoral stroma cells was an independent prognostic factor for the overall (P=0.002) and disease-free survival (P=0.007) rates of HCC following curative surgical resection. No significant association was identified between peritumoral S100A12 expression and HCC prognosis. The results of the present study demonstrated that high expression of S100A12 on intratumoral stroma cells is associated with poor HCC prognosis following curative resection, which may serve as a potential target for an adjuvant therapy.
