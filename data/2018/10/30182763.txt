Background:The effect of nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) versus interferon (IFN) on the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is controversial. We assessed whether antiviral strategy affected HCC development in CHB patients at different HCC risks.Methods:1112 CHB patients with antiviral therapy were included in this retrospective study. Patients treated with NAs only were classified into NAs group (n = 682) while those received IFN treatment with or without NAs were defined as IFN group (n = 430). Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to minimize baseline differences.Results:Totally, 31 patients developed HCC during follow-up (median 5.41 years). The cumulative HCC incidence at 10 years was significantly lower in the IFN group than NAs group (2.7% vs 8.0%, p Conclusions:Reduction of HCC development was more significant in CHB patients at higher HCC risk with IFN-based therapy than NAs treatment.
