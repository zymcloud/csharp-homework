Kinetochore fibers (K-fibers) are microtubule bundles attached to chromosomes. Efficient K-fiber formation is required for chromosome congression, crucial for faithful chromosome segregation in cells. However, the mechanisms underlying K-fiber formation before chromosome biorientation remain unclear. Depletion of hepatoma up-regulated protein (HURP), a RanGTP-dependent microtubule-associated protein localized on K-fibers, has been shown to result in low-efficiency K-fiber formation. Therefore, here we sought to identify critical interaction partners of HURP that may modulate this function. Using co-immunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we determined that HURP interacts directly with the centrosomal protein transforming acidic coiled coil-containing protein 3 (TACC3), a centrosomal protein, both in vivo and in vitro through the HURP1-625 region. We found that HURP is important for TACC3 function during kinetochore microtubule assembly at the chromosome region in prometaphase. Moreover, HURP regulates stable lateral kinetochore attachment and chromosome congression in early mitosis by modulation of TACC3. These findings provide new insight into the coordinated regulation of K-fiber formation and chromosome congression in prometaphase by microtubule-associated proteins.
