Introduction:Recurrence after liver surgery or radiofrequency is a clinical and biological challenge because it worsens the colorectal cancer prognosis. To date, no biomarker is yet validated to predict the recurrence in order to intensify adjuvant therapy for patients with higher risk. Matrix metalloproteinases play a major role in the metastasis dissemination and tumoral microenvironment and could be a potential biomarker of interest.Methods:Forty-four patients with liver metastasis treated by surgery or radiofrequency were enrolled in this study. Serum levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were monitored in Elisa after therapy and correlated to the recurrence from January 2004 to December 2007. After the curative treatment, patients were assessed for the recurence for two years by CT-scan and examination.Results:Post-operative serum level of MMP-9 was significantly higher between J0, J1 and J45 after liver surgery or radiofrequency (***P≤0.001). Level of MMP-2 was significantly increased at M3 and M6 (***P≤0.001) but does not appear to be a risk factor of liver recurrence. The level of TIMP-1 at J0 is a deleterious factor (HR=1.76, P=0.042*).Conclusion:This is the first study wich correlates the post-operative level of 4 MMPs and TIMP-1 with the risk of liver recurrence after surgery or radiofrequency. Serum TIMP-1 level at J0 could be helpful to identify patients with higher risk but these results need to be confirmed in a large-scale study.
