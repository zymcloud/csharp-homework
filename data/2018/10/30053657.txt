Intra-tumoral injection of radiopharmaceuticals such as yttrium-90 (90Y) or phosphorus-32 (32P) is an important route for brachytherapy in unresectable solid tumors such as locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the injected radiopharmaceuticals can potentially leak out from the tumor site due to high intra-tumoral pressure. In this study, we demonstrated the use of thermogelling copolymers that can be injected into tumor and subsequently solidify as hydrogels within the tumor that can potentially overcome the above problem. To this end, a series of thermogelling polyurethane copolymers with varying compositions were designed and synthesized from Pluronic F127, poly(3-hydroxylbutyrate), and poly(propylene glycol), which were characterized in terms of their molecular structures, compositions, phase diagrams, rheological properties, and injectability and body temperature stability in vitro and in vivo. The analyses of our data elucidated the injectability of the copolymer solutions at low temperatures, and the stability of the hydrogels at the body temperature. This provided the basis on which we could identify one copolymer with balanced composition as the most suitable candidate for intra-tumoral injection and for prevention of the leakage. Finally, the injectability and in vivo stability of the copolymer solution and hydrogel loaded with 90Y were further demonstrated in a mouse tumor model, and the in vivo biodistribution of 90Y showed that the radionuclide could be retained at the tumor site, indicating that the 90Y-loaded copolymer has a great potential for tumor radio-brachytherapy.
