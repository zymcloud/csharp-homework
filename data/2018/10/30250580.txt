The objective of the present study was to investigate the association between zinc finger protein (ZNF) 689 expression and the clinicopathological features and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 102 paired HCC and paired non-cancerous tissues, and 16 normal liver tissues were collected. ZNF689 expression was examined in HCC tissues, paired-noncancerous tissues, and normal liver tissues using RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry analysis, and the association between ZNF689 expression and HCC prognosis was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. ZNF689 expression was not significantly different between HCC tissues and paired-noncancerous tissues (P=0.61). ZNF689 expression in HCC and paired-noncancerous tissues was significantly increased compared with that in normal liver tissues (P
