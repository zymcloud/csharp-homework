Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells are immature compared with healthy mature hepatocytes. Transcription factors serve a role in hepatocyte differentiation. The expression levels of transcription factors in HCC cell lines have been investigated to determine potential therapeutic targets. In the present study, the HLE, HLF, PLC/PRF/5, Huh-7, Hep3B, Huh-6 and HepG2 HCC cell lines were subjected to reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of transcription factors, including NANOG, Oct3/4, GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4), GATA6 and hematopoietically expressed homeobox (HHEX). In addition, these cell lines were analyzed using RT-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) of NANOG and Oct3/4. The 201B7 human induced pluripotent stem cells were evaluated as a model of pluripotent cells. The HLF cells were transfected with Oct3/4 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and used in an MTS colorimetric assay and a scratch assay. NANOG was not expressed in any of the cell lines. However, GATA4, GATA6 and HHEX were expressed in the majority of the HCC cell lines. In addition, NANOG and Oct3/4 were expressed in 201B7 cells. Oct3/4 was expressed in HLE, HLF and Hep3B cells; however, its expression levels were significantly reduced compared with those in 201B7 cells. RT-qPCR demonstrated that the expression of Oct3/4 siRNA suppressed the proliferation and motility of HLF cells. Oct3/4 siRNA may be a potentially effective therapy for the suppression of the proliferation and motility of HCC cells.
