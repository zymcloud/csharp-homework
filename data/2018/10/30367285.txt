Crizotinib is an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor for patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite that crizotinib-induced hepatotoxicity may cause a dose reduction or interruption that can affect the patient's treatment, there is no study to investigate factors for crizotinib-induced hepatotoxicity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate factors affecting crizotinib-induced hepatotoxicity. From February 2012 to April 2018, a retrospective study was performed on NSCLC patients treated with crizotinib. Various factors were reviewed including sex, age, body weight, height, body surface area, underlying disease, smoking history, genetic mutation, and concomitant drugs. Among 153 patients, incidence of crizotinib-induced hepatotoxicity of grade I or higher was 83% (n = 127). The presence of liver disease or HBV revealed significant effect on hepatotoxicity within 28 days after crizotinib administration in univariate analysis. Patients with liver disease or HBV carriers revealed 2.3 times the hazard of time to hepatotoxicity compared to those without liver disease or HBV. Use of H2-antagonist or H2-antagonist/proton pump inhibitor revealed 1.7 times the hazard of time to hepatotoxicity compared to those that did not use those medications. Thus, close monitoring of liver function is recommended, especially in patients with liver impairment or using anti-acid secreting agents.
