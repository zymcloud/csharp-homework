The last two decades have seen a paradigm shift in the selection of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for liver transplantation. Microvascular invasion and differentiation have been the most significant factors affecting post-transplant recurrence; however, because of inherent disadvantages of pre-transplant biopsy, histological criteria never gained popularity. Recently, the selection criteria evolved from morphological to biological criteria, such as biomarkers and response to loco-regional therapy. With the introduction of multimodality imaging, combination of computed tomography with nuclear medicine imaging, particularly, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography fulfilled an unmet need and rapidly became a critical component of HCC management. This review article will focus on the use of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography in the pre-transplant evaluation of HCC patients with special discussion on its ability to predict HCC recurrence after liver transplantation.
