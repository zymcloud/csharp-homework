Background:Dendritic cell (DC)-derived exosomes (Dexs) have been proved to induce and enhance antigen-specific T cell responses in vivo, and previous clinical trials have shown the feasibility and safety of Dexs in multiple human cancers. However, there is little knowledge on the efficacy of Dexs against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) until now.Methods:In this study, human peripheral blood-derived DCs were loaded with recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV)-carrying alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene (rAAV/AFP), and high-purity Dexs were generated. Then naive T cells were stimulated with Dexs to investigate the specific T cell-mediated immune responses against HCC.Results:Our findings showed that Dexs were effective to stimulate naive T cell proliferation and induce T cell activation to become antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), thereby exhibiting antitumor immune responses against HCC. In addition, Dex-sensitized DC precursors seemed more effective to trigger major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I)-restricted CTL response and allow DCs to make full use of the minor antigen peptides, thereby maximally activating specific immune responses against HCC.Conclusion:It is concluded that Dexs, which combine the advantages of DCs and cell-free vectors, are promising to completely, or at least in part, replace mature DCs (mDCs) to function as cancer vaccines or natural antitumor adjuvant.
