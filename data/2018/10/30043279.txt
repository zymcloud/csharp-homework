Purpose:Distinct subgroup of the Ras family member 3 (DIRAS3), also called Aplasia Ras homolog member I, is a tumor suppressor gene that induces autophagy in several cancer cell lines.Methods:This study analyzed DIRAS3, and markers of autophagy (p62, and LC3B-II) in surgically resected GC samples from 420 patients. The promotion of autophagy by DIRAS3 in gastric cancer (GC) cells was explored, which might explain its inhibitory role in gastric cancer cells.Results:DIRAS3 expression in GC was positively correlated with LC3B-II amount, and negatively with metastasis; DIRAS3 and p62 levels were independent prognostic factors in GC. Overexpression of DIRAS3 in BGC-823 cells induced autophagy, led to decreased proliferation, cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, increased apoptosis, and impaired migration and invasion. While knockdown of DIRAS3 promoted proliferation and migration in MKN-45 cells. Overexpression of DIRAS3 in BGC-823 cells elevated autophagy levels in subcutaneous xenograft and inhibited tumor growth in mice; the hematogenous liver and lung metastasis of cancer cells were also suppressed.Conclusions:In conclusion, the results suggest DIRAS3 may play a role in affecting proliferation and metastatic potential of GC cells, which may be associated with its involvement in autophagy regulation.
