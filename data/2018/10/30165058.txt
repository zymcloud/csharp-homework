Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality of liver disorders and a major health issue globally. ALD refers to a spectrum of liver pathologies ranging from steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Various mechanisms, including oxidative stress, protein and DNA modification, inflammation and impaired lipid metabolism, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALD. Further, reactive oxygen species (ROS) in particular, have been identified as a key component in the initiation and progression of ALD. Nuclear factor erythroid 2 like 2 (Nrf2) is a master regulator of the intracellular adaptive antioxidant response to oxidative stress, and aids in the detoxification of a variety of toxicants. Given its cytoprotective role, Nrf2 has been extensively studied as a therapeutic target for ALD. Paradoxically, however, emerging evidence have revealed that Nrf2 may be implicated in the progression of ALD. In this review, we summarize the role of Nrf2 in the development of ALD and discuss the underlying mechanisms. Clearly, more comprehensive studies with proper animal and cell models and in human are needed to verify the potential therapeutic role of Nrf2 in ALD.
