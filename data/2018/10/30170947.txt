Purpose:To evaluate feasibility of using three-dimensional (3D) quantitative color-coding analysis (QCA) to quantify substasis endpoints after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:This single-institution prospective study included 20 patients with HCC who had undergone segmental or subsegmental transcatheter arterial chemoembolization between December 2015 and March 2017. The chemoembolization endpoint was a sluggish anterograde tumor-feeding arterial flow without residual tumor stains. Contrast medium bolus arrival time (BAT) was used as an indicator of arterial flow. BAT of the proper hepatic artery was obtained as a reference point. BATs of the proximal right lobar artery, proximal left lobar artery, and segmental artery that received embolization were analyzed before and after chemoembolization. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to evaluate the difference between BATs before and after chemoembolization.Results:BATs before and after chemoembolization of the segmental artery that received embolization were 0.47 seconds (interquartile range [IQR], 0.31-0.70 s) and 1.04 seconds (IQR, 0.78-2.01 s; P Conclusions:3D QCA is a feasible method for quantifying sluggish segmental arterial flow after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization in patients with HCC.
