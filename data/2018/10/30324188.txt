Herein, we report the potential of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) as an active targeting ligand for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for the development of diagnosis/therapy using small-molecule based approaches. Our preliminary results demonstrated that GA-conjugation to diagnostic/therapeutic counterparts significantly enhanced their HCC targeting ability and excellent therapeutic efficacy.
