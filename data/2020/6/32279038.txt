The optimization and synthesis of new CK2 and CK1 inhibitors are the basis for the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders associated with overexpression and abnormal functioning of these enzymes. Triazole derivatives appear to be especially interesting as potential kinase inhibitors. In this context we synthesized a series of 1,2,4-triazolin-5-thione derivatives as CK1γ kinase inhibitors. The antiproliferative activity of synthesized compounds was assessed against cancer cells: human lung adenocarcinoma (A549), human hepatoma (HepG2), and human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7). Compound 1 exhibited antiproliferative potency against A549 cancer cells and was characterized by a selective antiproliferative effect. Additionally, this compound has high apoptotic activity against A549, HepG2, MCF-7 cells and induced only slight amount of necrotic cells in these cell lines. In order to decipher the mechanism of anticancer activity of the studied compounds PASS software was used and these compounds were assayed for the inhibition of CK1γ and CK2α kinases. The reported series of 1,2,4-triazolin-5-thiones inhibits CK1γ and CK2α kinases in micromolar range. The most active compound shows activity against isoform γ3 which at concentration of 50 μM reduced the kinase activity by 69% while at 100 μM by 80%. CK2α was found to be less susceptible to the effects of the triazoles tested, as the reduction in kinase activity by 29% was observed for compound 15, and by 27% for compound 1 only at the concentration of 100 μM. The inhibition of CK1γ and CK2α kinases was rationalized using molecular docking.
