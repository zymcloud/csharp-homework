Despite the availability of a protective vaccine for over 3 decades, the number of persons with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains high. These persons are at risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current treatment is effective at inhibiting viral replication and reducing complications of chronic HBV infection, but is not curative. There is a need for novel, finite therapy that can cure chronic HBV infection. Several agents are in early-phase development and can be broadly viewed as agents that target the virus directly or indirectly or the host immune response. This article highlights key developments in antiviral/immunomodulatory therapy, the rationale for these approaches, and possible therapeutic regimens.
