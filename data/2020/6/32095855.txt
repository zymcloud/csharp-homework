Background:The outcomes of liver resection (LR) with a narrow margin in patients with transplantable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been studied. The aim was to assess whether narrow margin following up-front LR impacts the incidence, timing, pattern, and transplantability of tumor recurrence in patients with initially transplantable HCC.Methods:All initially transplantable HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy with either narrow (Results:This study included 187 patients (narrow group, n = 107 vs. wide group, n = 80). Recurrence was significantly more frequent in the narrow margin group (44% vs. 26%; p = 0.01) with a shorter RFS (p = 0.03). The transplantability of recurrence and ITT-OS were, however, not different between the two groups. The presence of satellite nodules on the resected specimens emerged as the sole independent predictor of non-transplantability of tumor recurrence. The stratification of the analysis according to the presence of cirrhosis achieved essentially the same results as in the whole study population.Conclusions:Narrow margin was associated with a higher tumor recurrence rate and a shorter RFS for patients with initially transplantable HCC. However, transplantability of recurrence and long-term ITT-OS were not impaired.
