Background and objectives:The impact of metabolic syndrome (MetS) on surgical outcome, mostly in patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent hepatectomy.Methods:A propensity score matching analysis was conducted. Patients were categorized into two groups MetS-related hepatocellular carcinoma (MetS-HCC) and 1:1 matched non-MetS-related HCC (non-MetS-HCC). Surgical outcomes were compared between the two groups.Results:Seventy-four MetS-HCC patients and 74 propensity score-matched non-MetS-HCC patients were selected for analysis. The incidence of surgical site infection was higher in the MetS-HCC group than in the non-MetS-HCC group (12.16% vs 0%, P .05). Microvascular invasion and severe postoperative complications were independent risk factors for recurrence-free survival and overall survival.Conclusions:Hepatectomy for patients with mostly HBV-related HCC in the presence of MetS can result in a higher rate of postoperative surgical site infection compared with those in the absence of MetS, but long-term survival rates are comparable.
