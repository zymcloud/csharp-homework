Background: The current study aimed to investigate the effects of TUG1 on the migration and invasion of hepatoma cells. Materials and Methods: The expressions of TUG1, miR-137, and AKT2 were detected in hepatoma tissues and cells by performing quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The correlations among TUG1, miR-137, and AKT2 were predicted by bioinformatics analysis and confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay, and Pearson test was performed to analyze their relevance. The effects of TUG1, miR-137, and AKT2 on viability, migration, and invasion of transfected hepatoma cells were detected by CCK-8, wound scratch, and Transwell. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related protein levels were determined by western blot and qRT-PCR. Results: TUG1 was highly expressed in hepatoma tissues and cells. Silencing TUG1 expression inhibited the viability, migration, and invasion of hepatoma cells. TUG1 targeted miR-137 and the two was negatively correlated, and silencing TUG1 expression inhibited the effects of low-expressed miR-137 on promoting proliferation, migration, and invasion of hepatoma cells. AKT2 was predicted to be the target gene for miR-137, and the two were negatively correlated. Moreover, inhibiting miR-137 expression promoted the expression of MMP2, MMP9, and N-cadherin and inhibited E-cadherin expression, while silencing TUG1 expression reversed the effects of low-expressed miR-137 on EMT-related protein levels. Conclusion: LncRNA TUG1 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma migration and invasion through targeting miR-137/AKT2 axis.
