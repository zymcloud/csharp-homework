Dengue virus infection is associated with the upregulation of metabolic pathways within infected cells. This effect is common to infection by a broad array of viruses. These metabolic changes, including increased glucose metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and autophagy, support the demands of viral genome replication and infectious particle formation. The mechanisms by which these changes occur are known to be, in part, directed by viral nonstructural proteins that contact and control cellular structures and metabolic enzymes. We investigated the roles of host proteins with overarching control of metabolic processes, the transcriptional regulators, cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) and its paralog, CDK19, as mediators of virally induced metabolic changes. Here, we show that expression of CDK8, but not CDK19, is increased during dengue virus infection in Huh7 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, although both are required for efficient viral replication. Chemical inhibition of CDK8 and CDK19 with Senexin A during infection blocks virus-induced expression of select metabolic and autophagic genes, hexokinase 2 (HK2) and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), and reduces viral genome replication and infectious particle production. The results further define the dependence of virus replication on increased metabolic capacity in target cells and identify CDK8 and CDK19 as master regulators of key metabolic genes. The common inhibition of CDK8 and CDK19 offers a host-directed therapeutic intervention that is unlikely to be overcome by viral evolution.
