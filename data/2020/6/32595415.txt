Background:The effect of lncRNA FTX on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) conversion to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear.Methods:In our study, C57BL/6 mice was fed with high fat diet for obtaining NAFLD mouse model, and diethylnitrosamine induced the formation of HCC tumor. The expression of iNOS and CD206 in tissues were examined using immunohistochemistry. In addition, qRT-PCR was implemented to detect the expression of FTX and mRNAs. The percentage of M1 and M2 Kupffer cells (KCs) were determined using flow cytometry. The pathological change in liver tissues was displayed by H&E staining. Besides, immunofluorescence assay was performed to ensure the primary KCs through labeling F4/80.Results:Here, we found that the expression of FTX and the ratio of M1/M2 KCs in liver tissues from NAFLD-transformed HCC (NAFLD-HCC) patients lower than in liver tissues from NAFLD patients. Subsequently, we revealed that the expression of FTX and M1/M2 KCs ratio were downregulated during NAFLD conversion to HCC. Importantly, increasing of FTX inhibited HCC tumor growth, improved liver damage and promoted M1 polarization of KCs during NAFLD conversion to HCC, while these effects of FTX were reversed by inactivating of KCs. Finally, in vitro experiments, our data indicated that FTX facilitated the M1 polarization of KCs.Conclusion:In conclusion, our results demonstrated that upregulation of FTX suppressed NAFLD conversion to HCC though promoting M1 polarization of KCs. Our findings presented a new regulatory mechanism for NAFLD conversion to HCC, and provided a new biomarker for inhibiting this conversion.
