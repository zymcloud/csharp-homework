The adaptor protein 14-3-3ζ is encoded by the yhwaz gene and implicated in a wide range of biological processes. In tumorigenesis, 14-3-3ζ recognizes specific phosphorylation motifs and interacts with hundreds of target proteins and is, thus, involved in the regulation of tumor proliferation, migration and differentiation. In the present study, bioinformatics tools were used to analyze data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases and the expression of yhwaz, and gene regulation networks were identified as potentially relevant in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In HCC, yhwaz expression was demonstrated to be upregulated and significantly associated with poor prognosis. Expression levels of microRNAs targeting yhwaz were associated with improved prognosis in patients with liver cancer. Gene networks that are regulated by yhwaz were found to be involved in cell cycle regulation and tumorigenesis, indicating the potential use of the expression levels of yhwaz in liver tissue as predictive biomarkers in patients with liver cancer. In the present study, yhwaz was identified as a gene of interest through data mining gene expression databases and its involvement in regulatory networks in HCC was indicated. Therefore, further in vitro and in vivo studies on the role of yhwaz in the carcinogenesis of HCC would be greatly beneficial.
