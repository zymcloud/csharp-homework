Importance:Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved life expectancy for individuals with HIV infection, but recent data comparing life span and comorbidity-free years by HIV status are lacking.Objective:To quantify the gap in life span and comorbidity-free years by HIV status among adults with access to care.Design, setting, and participants:This matched cohort study used data from insured adults with and without HIV infection (aged ≥21 years) matched 1:10 at medical centers of Kaiser Permanente in northern and southern California and the mid-Atlantic states of Washington DC, Maryland, and Virginia from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2016. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2019, through March 31, 2020.Exposures:HIV status and, for individuals with HIV infection, ART initiation at a CD4 cell count of 500/μL or greater.Main outcomes and measures:Overall life expectancy and expected years free of major chronic comorbidities, including chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.Results:Of 39 000 individuals with HIV infection and 387 785 matched uninfected adults, 374 421 (87.7%) were male, with a mean (SD) age of 41.4 (10.8) years. Among 359 244 individuals with known race/ethnicity, 90 177 (25.1%) were non-Hispanic black and 87 191 (24.3%) were Hispanic. From 2000 to 2003, overall life expectancy at age 21 years of age was 37.6 years among individuals with HIV infection and 59.7 years among uninfected adults, (difference, 22.1 years; 95% CI, 20.2-24.0 years). From 2014 to 2016, overall life expectancy at 21 years of age among individuals with HIV infection increased to 56.0 years compared with 65.1 years among uninfected adults (difference, 9.1 years; 95% CI, 7.9-10.2 years). During 2011 to 2016, individuals with HIV infection who initiated ART with a CD4 cell count of 500/μL or greater had a life expectancy at 21 years of age of 57.4 years compared with 64.2 years among uninfected adults (difference, 6.8 years; 95% CI, 5.0-8.5 years). From 2000 to 2003, the expected number of comorbidity-free years remaining at 21 years of age was 11.3 for individuals with HIV infection and 26.6 years for uninfected adults (difference, 15.3 years; 95% CI, 13.9-16.6 years). This difference in comorbidity-free years persisted over time but decreased to 9.5 years (95% CI, 7.7-11.2 years) for individuals with HIV infection who initiated ART at a CD4 cell count of 500/μL or greater.Conclusions and relevance:The results suggest that life expectancy of adults with HIV infection may be near that of life expectancy of individuals without HIV infection, but greater attention is needed to prevention of comorbidities among individuals with HIV infection.
