Tumor-initiating stem-like cells (TICs) are defective in maintaining asymmetric cell division and responsible for tumor recurrence. Cell-fate-determinant molecule NUMB-interacting protein (TBC1D15) is overexpressed and contributes to p53 degradation in TICs. Here we identify TBC1D15-mediated oncogenic mechanisms and tested the tumorigenic roles of TBC1D15 in vivo. We examined hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in alcohol Western diet-fed hepatitis C virus NS5A Tg mice with hepatocyte-specific TBC1D15 deficiency or expression of non-phosphorylatable NUMB mutations. Liver-specific TBC1D15 deficiency or non-p-NUMB expression reduced TIC numbers and HCC development. TBC1D15-NuMA1 association impaired asymmetric division machinery by hijacking NuMA from LGN binding, thereby favoring TIC self-renewal. TBC1D15-NOTCH1 interaction activated and stabilized NOTCH1 which upregulated transcription of NANOG essential for TIC expansion. TBC1D15 activated three novel oncogenic pathways to promote self-renewal, p53 loss, and Nanog transcription in TICs. Thus, this central regulator could serve as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of HCC.
