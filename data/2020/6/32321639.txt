Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most commonly diagnosed liver malignancy, ranking third in the overall global cancer-related mortality. A complex network of interacting proteins controls HCC growth and progression. Lysophosphatidic acid receptors (LPAR) are commonly overexpressed in HCC. In particular, we have previously reported that the expression of LPAR6 sustains tumorigenesis and growth of HCC and results in a poor prognosis in HCC patients. Here, we applied a comparative proteomic approach to compare protein expression in both LPAR6 expressing (HLE-LPAR6) and nonexpressing HCC cells (HLE-neo). We found changes in the expression levels of 19 proteins, which include carbohydrate metabolism enzymes, redox and detoxification enzymes, and gene-expression regulatory proteins. Our findings support the role of LPAR6 in controlling the expression of a distinctive protein signature in HCC cells, which can offer a valuable resource for the identification of potential theranostic biomarkers.
