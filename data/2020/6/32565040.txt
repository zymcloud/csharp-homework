Background:Anatomical resection (AR) is a recommended surgical treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the conventional procedure (dye injection) for AR is difficult to reproduce. As an alternative, the tumour-feeding portal pedicle compression technique (finger-compression technique) has been proposed as an easy and reversible procedure. Here, we propose a new method combining indocyanine green (ICG) imaging with the finger-compression technique.Methods:Eligible patients were prospectively enrolled to undergo ICG compression (ICG-C) anatomical hepatectomy for HCC.Results:Fifteen patients underwent AR using the ICG-C technique. Overall, the surgical procedures included six segmentectomies, seven subsegmentectomies, and two right posterior sectionectomies. The median tumour size was 5.8 cm (range 2-7 cm). All procedures had an R0 margin. There were no major complications among patients, and minor morbidity occurred in three patients.Conclusions:ICG-C is a safe, feasible and effective technique for patients eligible for AR.
