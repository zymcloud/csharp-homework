The authors state that UNOS have developed a policy of reducing the pretransplant alfa-feto protein (AFP) from 1000 to below 500 ng/ml by locoregional therapy (LRT). Although it is known fact that AFP>1000 ng/ml is a significant risk factor for recurrence even in patients with HCC within the Milan criteria, 72% of the patients in the present study have an AFP>1000 ng/ml and this point should be explained. About 76 % of the patients should have been considered for LRT prior to liver transplantation (LT) according to the UNOS criteria.
