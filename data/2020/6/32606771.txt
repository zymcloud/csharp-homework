Background:Small nucleolar RNA host gene 12 (SNHG12) expression is associated with multiple cancers, including renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, cervical cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, SNHG12 biological function is unclear in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).Methods:SNHG12 expression and associated clinicopathological characteristics were evaluated in DLBCL tissues. CCK-8 and transwell assay were used to analyze the in vitro role of SNHG12 in DLBCL progression. The xenograft model was used to explore the in vivo role of SNHG12 in DLBCL growth. The physical interaction between SNHG12 and miR-195 was confirmed using bioinformatics analysis and a dual luciferase assay.Results:SNHG12 expression was upregulated in DLBCL tissues and correlated with patients' prognosis. SNHG12 downregulation inhibited cell growth, migration, and invasion of DLBCL cells in vitro, while its overexpression promoted these cellular processes. Moreover, SNHG12 knockdown repressed tumorigenesis of DLBCL cells in vivo. Further experiments demonstrated that miR-195 is a target of SNHG12 in DLBCL and that their expression negatively correlates in DLBCL. SNHG12 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-195 in DLBCL cells and miR-195 upregulation abolished the effects of SNHG12 on of DLBCL progression.Conclusion:SNHG12 predicts poor clinical outcome and serves as a novel oncogene in DLBCL via miR-195 sponging. We also suggest that SNHG12 can be used as a potential therapeutic candidate for DLBCL patients.
