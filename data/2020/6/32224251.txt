MiR-142-3p as one key molecule in oncogenesis and inflammation plays crucial roles in hepatic fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and other liver disease. However, there have no literatures to report its effects on hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (HI/R) injury. In the present work, hypoxia reoxygenation (H/R) models on AML12 and HepG2 cells, and ischemia/reperfusion model in mice were established. The methods of real-time PCR, dual luciferase reporter, mimic, inhibitor, agomir, antagomir and siRNA transfection assays were used. The expression levels of miR-142-3p were decreased in model groups in vitro and in vivo compared with control group or Sham group, which directly targeted MARCKS to regulate its expression. Then, MARCKS activated p38/JNK signal, up-regulated NF-ÎºB expression to accelerate inflammation, and inhibited PI3K/AKT signal to promote apoptosis. Moreover, miR-142-3p mimic in vitro and agomir in vivo lowered the expression levels of MARCKS, thereby alleviating apoptosis and inflammation to relieve HI/R injury. Furthermore, miR-142- 3p inhibitor in vitro and antagomir in vivo up-regulated the expression levels of MARCKS to aggravate HI/R damage via promoting inflammation and apoptosis. Consistently, MARCKS siRNA markedly inhibited HI/R injury by restraining apoptosis and inflamm- ation in mice. MiR-142-3p played a considerable part in adjusting HI/R injury by targeting MARCKS, and miR-142-3p/MARCKS should be a new therapeutic target for HI/R injury.
