Background and objectives:Thermal ablation can be used as a bridge to transplant or with curative intent for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We report our experience with laparoscopic ablation of HCC in patients deemed inaccessible by the percutaneous approach.Methods:We performed a retrospective review of surgical ablations from 2009 to 2017. Patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, and outcomes were abstracted from the medical record. Kaplan-Meier modeling was performed for survival and recurrence.Results:Thirty-three patients were included with a median age of 62 (interquartile range [IQR], 57-67). Most patients were male (76%) and Caucasian (70%). Ninety-seven percent had underlying cirrhosis. Median model for end stage liver disease-sodium was 9.5 (IQR, 8-12). The median maximal diameter of ablated lesions was 2.6 cm (IQR, 1.8-3.0). Thirty-nine lesions were ablated; 97% were completed laparoscopically. The median maximal diameter of the ablation zone was 4.8 cm (IQR, 3.8-5.7) with a median difference of ablation zone to the tumor of 2.0 cm (IQR, 1.5-2.75). Twelve patients received additional treatment. Median disease-free survival was 66.7 months and median follow-up 42.9 months. Disease recurrence occurred in 13 patients (39%)-systemic recurrence in 6%, intrahepatic recurrence in 27% and local recurrence in 6%.Conclusion:Laparoscopic thermal ablation of HCC is safe and provides good oncologic outcomes for otherwise inaccessible tumors.
