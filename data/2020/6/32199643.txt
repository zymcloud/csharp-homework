Background:Liver retransplantation can be classified as urgent (when performed in the first week after the transplantation) or elective, which may be considered as early (first month post-transplantation) or late (after the first month). The time in which retransplantation takes place is determined by the cause that makes it necessary. The goal of this study is to analyze the causes and results of early retransplantation in our center.Methods:A retrospective analysis of liver retransplantations performed within the first month after the original transplantation in our center between 2007 and 2017 was carried out. The variables analyzed were demographic, causes of the first transplant and retransplantation, and the complications and mortality resulting from the latter.Results:A total of 698 liver transplants were performed, including 67 patients who required retransplantation (8.9%). Among these, 37 were late elective retransplantations and 30 were early retransplantations. Regarding the latter, the causes that led to the first transplant were hepatocellular carcinoma (46.7%) and noncholestatic cirrhosis (30%). On the other hand, the main precipitants of the retransplantation were hepatic artery thrombosis (60%) and primary graft failure (13.3%). The reoperation rate was 16.7%, and the perioperative mortality rate was 16.7%. The 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival rates were 83.3%, 76.7% and 59.9%, respectively.Conclusion:Despite the high perioperative morbidity of liver retransplantation, its results in terms of survival are similar to those of the global series of liver transplantation.
