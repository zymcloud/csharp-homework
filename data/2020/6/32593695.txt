Background:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is widely applied in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who are not suitable for surgical treatment. We aimed to investigate the treatment outcomes and comprehensive prognostic factors of CalliSpheres® microspheres (CSM) drug-eluting bead TACE (DEB-TACE) treatment and conventional TACE (cTACE) treatment in HCC patients.Methods:Three hundred and thirty-five HCC patients received DEB-TACE or cTACE treatment were consecutively enrolled in multi-center, retrospective cohort study. Treatment response was conducted at M1, M3 or M6 after treatment. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were recorded. Thirty-seven baseline factors including demographic characteristics, clinical features, biochemical indexes and previous treatment histories were selected.Results:In total patients, history of drink and largest nodule size≥7cm independently predicted worse ORR, DEB-TACE predicted better OS, while largest nodule size≥7cm, increased Child-Pugh stage, ALB abnormal, ALP abnormal or AFP abnormal predicted worse survival. For DEB-TACE group, previous cTACE and ANC abnormal independently predicted worse ORR, and hepatic vein invasion, increased Child-Pugh stage or AFP abnormal independently predicted poor survival. For cTACE group, largest nodule size≥7cm independently predicted poor ORR, and multifocal disease as well as ALB abnormal predicted poor OS.Conclusions:History of drink, largest nodule size≥7cm, DEB-TACE, increased Child-Pugh stage, abnormal ALB, ALP or AFP are potential prognostic factors in total patients, previous cTACE and ANC abnormal, hepatic vein invasion, increased Child-Pugh stage or AFP abnormal are potential prognostic factors in DEB-TA group, and largest nodule size≥7cm, multifocal disease and ALB abnormal are potential prognostic factors in cTACE group.
