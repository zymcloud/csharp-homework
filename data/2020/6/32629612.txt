Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes), the specialized translational machinery for mitochondrial genes, exclusively encode the subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. Although OXPHOS dysfunctions are associated with hepatic disorders including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), their underlying mechanisms remain poorly elucidated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of mitoribosome defects on OXPHOS and HCC progression. By generating a gene signature from HCC transcriptome data, we developed a scoring system, i.e., mitoribosome defect score (MDS), which represents the degree of mitoribosomal defects in cancers. The MDS showed close associations with the clinical outcomes of patients with HCC and with gene functions such as oxidative phosphorylation, cell-cycle activation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. By analyzing immune profiles, we observed that mitoribosomal defects are also associated with immunosuppression and evasion. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the roles of mitoribosome defects in HCC progression.
