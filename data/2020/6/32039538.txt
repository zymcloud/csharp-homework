Aim:Liver-specific non-coding RNAs have been reported to play crucial roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated the possible biological performance of a novel liver-specific long non-coding RNA, LINC02499, in HCC.Methods:The association between LINC02499 expression and HCC was evaluated based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases, and then confirmed in a HCC cohort by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The effects of LINC02499 on HCC cells were verified by gain- and loss-of-function assays. Pathway enrichment analyses were used to explore the potential mechanism of LINC02499 in HCC.Results:LINC02499 expression was remarkably decreased in HCC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues based on TCGA (P Conclusion:LINC02499 could be a potential novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for HCC patients, and it could exert a tumor suppressor role in the progression of HCC.
