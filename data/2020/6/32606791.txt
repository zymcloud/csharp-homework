Purpose:Accumulating studies have explored the potential diagnostic value of lncRNA MALAT1 in various cancers. However, there are still inconsistent results in diagnostic accuracy and reliability in individual studies. The aim of this pooled study was to summarize the overall diagnostic capacity of lncRNA MALAT1 in cancer detection and diagnosis.Methods:Eligible studies satisfying the inclusion criteria were screened and selected from the online database. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14.0.Results:A total of 17 eligible studies were included in this pooled analysis, with 1777 cases and 1478 controls. The overall results were shown as follows: sensitivity, 0.74 (95% CI=0.65-0.81), specificity, 0.79 (95% CI=0.73-0.84), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), 3.48 (95% CI=2.79-4.32), negative likelihood, 0.33 (95% CI=0.25-0.44), diagnostic score, 2.34 (95% CI=1.99-2.69), diagnostic odds ratio, 10.41 (95% CI=7.33-14.78) and area under the curve, 0.83 (95% CI=0.80-0.86). Deeks' funnel plot asymmetry test (p = 0.66) suggested no potential publication bias.Conclusion:All these results indicate that lncRNA MALAT1 achieves a relatively moderate accuracy in cancer detection and diagnosis, and could serve as a diagnostic biomarker for cancers.
