Primary liver cancer includes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, 75-85%) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (10-15%). The vast majority of patients with primary HCC are not candidates for surgical treatment. Surgical resection, liver transplantation and percutaneous puncture are effective potentially curable treatments for patients with early stage liver cancer. Radiation therapy is a non-surgical alternative treatment that has generally been used to treat patients with advanced liver cancer, although it's use in the potentially curative setting is increasing. Radiotherapy is a non-invasive local treatment which works through ionizing radiation. This review summarizes the efficacy and safety of commonly used radiotherapy methods, and reviews three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT), intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), volume-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and internal radiation therapies, for primary liver cancer (in particular for HCC).
