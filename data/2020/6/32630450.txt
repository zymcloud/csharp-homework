Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) regardless of achieving a sustained viral response (SVR). Because advanced liver fibrosis is a powerful risk factor for HCC, we analyzed the association between autotaxin (ATX), a liver fibrosis marker, and post-SVR HCC development within 3 years after antiviral treatment. We included 670 patients with HCV who received direct-acting antivirals, achieved SVR and were followed up for at least 6 months (270 of them were followed up for 3 years or more). We measured serum ATX levels before treatment and 12/24 weeks after treatment. The diagnosis of HCC was based on imaging modalities, such as dynamic computed tomography and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging and/or liver biopsy. The present study revealed that high levels of serum ATX predicted post-SVR HCC development (area under the receiver operating characteristic: 0.70-0.76). However, Wisteria floribunda agglutinin positive Mac-2 binding protein (M2BPGi), another liver fibrosis marker, was a more useful predictive marker especially post-treatment according to a multivariate analysis. Patients with a high rate of ATX reduction before and after antiviral treatment did not develop HCC regardless of high pretreatment ATX levels. In conclusion, post-treatment M2BPGi level and the combination of pretreatment ATX levels and rate of ATX reduction were useful predictive markers for post-SVR HCC development in patients with chronic HCV infection.
