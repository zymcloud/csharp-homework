Background:Dysregulation of miRNAs is closely involved with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression, oncogenesis and signalling pathways. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in expression of miRNAs in HCC tissue in comparison to healthy liver tissue, as well as to explore the key miRNA-targeted genes.Methods:Gene Chip microarray analysis was used to analyse differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) in tissues, and qRT-PCR was performed to validate the top 9 downregulated miRNAs. Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed for target genes using the DAVID database. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the target genes was created by STRING and visualised using Cytoscape. Three online miRNA databases were utilised to aid in the prediction of genes targeted by the top 10 significantly altered DEMs.Results:In total, 153 upregulated and 206 downregulated miRNAs were identified in HCC tissue. The genes targeted by the top 10 increased and decreased miRNAs were 6 and 1060, respectively. Moreover, FOXO1 was projected to be regulated by all twenty miRNAs. A PPI network was constructed that consisted of 956 nodes and 1298 edges. Four signiÔ¨Åcant modules, consisting of 66 hub genes, were detected from the PPI system via MCODE. Functional enrichment demonstrated that miRNAs have a vital function in cancer development and advancement.Conclusion:In summary, our study identified DEMs in HCC tissue, major target genes and possible molecular mechanisms that underlie HCC, providing novel insights for treatment approaches.
