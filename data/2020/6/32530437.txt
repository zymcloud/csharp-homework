Resveratrol is a common, naturally occurring polyphenol confirmed with inhibited the cellular effects of carcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying resveratrol's action against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unclear. In addition, MARCH1 promotes the initiation and progression of HCC, but it is unclear whether resveratrol exerts antitumor efforts by regulating MARCH1 expression. This study determined the molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumor effects of resveratrol in HCC. Resveratrol induced apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cell lines (HepG2 and Hep3B). In addition, it inhibited MARCH1 and phospho-protein kinase B (p-AKT) expression but upregulated the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) dose-dependently both in vitro and in vivo. MARCH1 knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA) also increased PTEN expression. Meanwhile, MK2206 (an AKT inhibitor) and bisperoxovanadium (BPV; a PTEN inhibitor) combined with resveratrol decreased MARCH1 expression more than the single-treatment HCC group. These results suggested that resveratrol affects the biological characteristics of HCC via downregulation of MARCH1 expression.
