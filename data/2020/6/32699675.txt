Introduction This study aims to analyze the patterns of care, including fractionation and utilization, of hypofractionated stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods The National Cancer Database was queried for patients diagnosed with HCC from 2004 to 2014 and treated with SABR in three, four, or five fractions in 15-20Gy, 10-13Gy, or 6-12Gy per fraction, respectively. Patients with stage IV and Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Index > 0 were excluded in order to avoid bias resulting from the selection of poorer prognosis patients. The patients were then stratified based on several characteristics including biologically equivalent doses (BEDs) of =/> 100 Gy and 100Gy, which was associated with a median OS of 30.8 months (95% CI 5.25-32.08). On MVA, BED =/> 100Gy was not significantly associated with improved OS (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64-1.14, p = 0.28). Factors that were associated with significantly worse survival were tumor size in the largest quartile (HR 2.197 CI 1.440-3.354, p
