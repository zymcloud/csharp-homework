Epithelioid hepatic angiomyolipoma (Epi-HAML) is a rare hepatic tumor frequently misdiagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Unlike conventional angiomyolipoma (AML), Epi-HAML contains minimal amount of adipose tissue, which is a radiological distinguishing feature between AML and HCC. Two patients were referred for management of incidentally found hepatic lesions confirmed to be Epi-HAML on post-resection tissue analysis. CT and MRI findings were suggestive of HCC. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound demonstrated intratumoral shunting, a feeding artery, and early draining hepatic vein. These findings should alert radiologists to the possibility of Epi-HAML. Furthermore, these features may be better assessed by contrast-enhanced ultrasound due to its superior dynamic temporal resolution.
