Growth hormone (GH) activates multiple signal transduction pathways. To investigate these pathways, we identified novel genes whose transcription was induced by GH in the liver of hypophysectomized (HPX) rats using the suppression subtractive hybridization technique. We found that regulator of calcineurin 1 (Rcan1) mRNA was upregulated by GH administration. RCAN1 regulates the activity of calcineurin, a Ca/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase. Rcan1 encodes two major transcripts, Rcan1-1 and Rcan1-4, resulting from differential promoter use and first exon choice. We found that a single injection of GH increased the levels of Rcan1-4 mRNA and RCAN1-4 protein transiently, but did not increase Rcan1-1 mRNA in HPX rat liver. Then the molecular mechanism of GH to induce Rcan1-4 transcription was examined in rat hepatoma H4IIE cells. Experiments using inhibitors suggested that c-JUN N-terminal kinase was required for the induction of Rcan1-4 mRNA by GH. GH increased the levels of phosphorylated c-JUN protein and c-Jun mRNA in HPX rat liver. The luciferase and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that c-JUN upregulated Rcan1-4 mRNA by binding to the cAMP-responsive element in the upstream of Rcan1 exon 4. These results indicate that GH activates c-JUN to affect the activity of calcineurin by the induction of Rcan1-4 in rat liver.
