Objective:The objective of this study is to analyze the liver transplant complications in a reference transplant hospital in southern Brazil.Methods:The researchers used a cross-sectional, quantitative, exploratory, and descriptive study, conducted using 103 medical records of patients who underwent liver transplantation from 2011 to 2018. Data were analyzed through median, mean, and standard deviation, and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used.Results:There was a higher proportion of men (70.9%), with a mean age of 53.3 years, who had hepatitis C (43.7%). The indication for the procedure was hepatocellular carcinoma (34%). The most frequent complications included pulmonary (26.7%), graft-related complications such as rejection (21.1%), and viral infections (14.4%). In addition, infectious complications, such as pneumonia (45%) and septicemia (29%), occurred. The main causes of death were septic shock (15.6%) and multiple organ failure (21.9%). There was statistical significance between the recipient's age and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease value at the time of transplantation for the development of complications.Conclusions:The data from the present study provide important information about liver transplant. These data may enable the team to propose strategies for practice improvements, which will certainly offer better living conditions and transplant survival.
