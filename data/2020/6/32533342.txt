Primary hepatic carcinoma with inhibin positivity is a rare aggressive liver tumor with seven cases described. The tumor presents at a younger age than primary hepatic carcinoma with all cases being females. RNA albumin ISH positivity suggests the tumor to be a primary hepatic carcinoma. The tumor is different from hepatocellular carcinoma as well as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma because of its distinct morphology, lack of hepatocellular differentiation, strong inhibin staining, and lack of typical mutations. A 26-year-old male presented with a 20-cm liver mass. The tumor progressed on therapy with development of multiple lung metastasis. Currently, the patient is enrolled in phase II clinical trial utilizing nivolumab and ipilumumab. While the tumor has a female preponderance, it is not exclusively found in females. Additional studies are necessary to determine the cause of inhibin staining, driving molecular alterations, natural history of this rare tumor, and to come up with consensus nomenclature.
