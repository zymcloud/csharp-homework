Background:The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate and determine those patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that would benefit from the administration of postoperative adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (PA-TACE).Methods:PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies up to July 30, 2019. The outcome of Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were extracted and converted to hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs).Results:A total of 40 studies (10 RCTs and 30 non-RCTs) involving 11,165 patients were included. Overall, PA-TACE was associated with an increased OS [HR, 0.71 (95% CI, 0.65-0.77); P 5 cm or multinodular tumors demonstrated that PA-TACE improved OS and DFS. In patients without MVI, PA-TACE showed no improvement in OS [HR, 1.14 (95% CI, 0.85-1.53); P = 0.370], and resulted in worse DFS than curative resection alone [HR, 1.20 (95% CI, 1.03-1.39); P = 0.002].Conclusion:This meta-analysis indicated that PA-TACE was beneficial in patients with HCC who were at high risk of postoperative recurrence including tumor diameter >5 cm, multinodular tumors and MVI-positive. In patients with tumor diameter â‰¤5 cm, single tumor or MVI-negative. PA-TACE does not appear to improve outcomes and may potentially promote postoperative recurrence in certain patients.
