Although carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) may be elevated in benign diseases, elevated CA 19-9 may cause a fear of cancer and unnecessary follow-up studies. Research on how to approach systematically in this case is very limited. The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical features and the causes of CA 19-9 elevation without evidence of malignant or pancreatobiliary diseases. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who had CA 19-9 elevation (â‰¥80 U/mL) and were found to be unrelated to cancer after follow-up. After exclusion, 192 patients were included in this study. The median level of CA 19-9 was 136.5 U/mL. The causes of CA 19-9 elevation were determined in 147 (76.6%) patients, and that was unknown in 45 (23.4%). The estimated causative diseases were hepatic diseases in 63 patients, pulmonary diseases in 32, gynecologic diseases in 38, endocrine diseases in 13, and spleen disease in 1. Of 45 patients with unknown cause, 35 had normalization of CA 19-9 and 10 had persistently elevated CA 19-9. In conclusion, CA 19-9 elevation without malignancies or pancreatobiliary diseases should be systematically evaluated and followed up. We suggest an algorithm to investigate the causes and follow up these patients.
