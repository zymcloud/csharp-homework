Here we rank order small molecule inhibitors of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) using severity of oxygen induced retinopathy (OIR) as an outcome measure. Dose response analyses in cell cultures of hepatoma (Hep3B), retinal M端ller cells (MIO-M1) and primary retinal endothelial cells were conducted to evaluate potency by comparing dose to HIF-1,2 protein levels by western blotting. In vivo dose response was determined using the luciferase-transgene HIF reporter (luc-ODD). Each compound was placed in rank order by their ability to reduce neovascularization and capillary drop out in the OIR mouse model. An Epas1 KO confined to retinal M端ller cells was used to determine whether successful protection by HIF stabilization requires HIF-2. Two candidate small molecules can prevent OIR by stabilizing HIF-1 to prevent oxygen induced growth attenuation and vascular obliteration. M端ller cell HIF-2, the mediator of pathologic retinal angiogenesis, is not required for protection. The lack of dependence on M端ller cell HIF-2 predicts that inhibition of HIF PHD will not drive pathological angiogenesis.
