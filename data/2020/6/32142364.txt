Objective:To evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with HepaSphere for patients with pulmonary or mediastinal metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Between June 2009 and January 2018, 14 patients with pulmonary or mediastinal metastases from HCC were treated with TACE with a combination of 1-3 chemotherapeutic drugs followed by HepaSphere embolization. As first end point, local tumor response and adverse events were evaluated after the first session of TACE, with Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors v. 1.1 and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v. 4 criteria, respectively. Overall survival was evaluated as secondary end point. TACE was repeated on-demand.Results:TACE with HepaSphere was well tolerated with acceptable safety profile and no 30 day mortality. 1 month objective response and disease control rate were calculated to be 7.1 and 100%, respectively. Mean tumor size reduction rate was 15.6Â±9.5% at the first month. Two Grade 3 cytopenia events were seen (14.3 %), however none of the Grade 2 or more post-embolization syndrome was observed. The median overall survival time was 15.0 months and the 1 year, 3 year and 5 year survival rate were, 57.1%, 28.6%, 19.1%, respectively.Conclusion:Early experience showed that the transarterial treatment with HepaSphere is safe and effective treatment for patients with pulmonary or mediastinal metastases from HCC.Advances in knowledge:Currently, the effects of molecular targeted drugs on HCC metastases are limited and side-effects are relatively frequent. In the present study, transarterial treatment might be a promising treatment for HCC metastasis.
