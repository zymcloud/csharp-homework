Aims:CD47 is upregulated on the surface of various tumour cells, and it is known to inhibit the phagocytosis of tumour cells by macrophages. Immunotherapy that targets CD47 has demonstrated success in preclinical trials and is now under clinical investigation for both solid and haematological malignancies. However, data regarding CD47 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue and its correlation with clinical outcomes in patients with HCC remain limited. Here, we investigated the clinicopathological features associated with CD47 expression in HCC.Methods:CD47 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in tissue microarray sections containing 166 HCC tissues. CD47 expression was considered positive if 10% or more tumour cells were stained.Results:CD47 expression was observed in 36 (21.7%) of 166 HCC tissues and was significantly associated with frequent large vessel invasion, advanced American Joint Committee on Cancer stage and higher Ki-67 proliferation index. In the survival analyses, CD47 expression was not associated with recurrence-free survival or overall survival in total patients with HCC. However, in patients who received surgical resection without any adjuvant treatment, CD47 expression was associated with shorter recurrence-free survival.Conclusions:CD47 expression was significantly associated with adverse pathological features and poor clinical outcomes in patients with HCC who did not receive adjuvant treatment.
