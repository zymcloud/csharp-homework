There are currently no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatments for NAFLD; however, this is a field of active research. This review summarizes emerging pharmacotherapies for the treatment of adult and pediatric NAFLD. Investigated pharmacotherapies predominantly target bile acid signaling, insulin resistance, and lipid handling within the liver. Three drugs have gone on to phase III trials for which results are available. Of those, obeticholic acid is the single agent that demonstrates promise according to the interim analyses of the REGENERATE trial. Obeticholic acid showed reduction of fibrosis in adults with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) taking 25 mg daily for 18 months (n = 931, reduction in fibrosis in 25% vs. 12% placebo, P
