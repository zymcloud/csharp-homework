Aim:Opportunities to treat older patients with hepatitis C virus infection have increased. We investigated the efficacy and safety of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in patients with HCV infection aged ≥75 years.Methods:We retrospectively evaluated 131 patients with hepatitis C virus infection treated with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir at nine institutions in Japan. The patients were divided into two groups according to their age: the elderly group (n = 43, aged ≥75 years) and younger group (n = 88, aged Results:The presence of cirrhosis (27.9%), a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (23.3%) and comorbidities (88.4%) were more frequently observed in the elderly group than in the younger group. Six (14.0%) patients in the elderly group and 19 (21.6%) in the younger group dropped out before the sustained virologic response 12 assessment. In the intention-to-treat population, 86.0% in the elderly group and 78.4% in the younger group achieved sustained virologic response 12 (P = 0.30). In the modified intention-to-treat population, all patients achieved sustained virologic response 12. A total of 27.5% of patients experienced adverse events. The most frequently observed adverse events was pruritus, and was significantly associated with female sex, the presence of hemodialysis and serum albumin at baseline Conclusion:Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir therapy was effective and well tolerated, even in elderly patients with hepatitis C virus infection aged ≥75 years.
