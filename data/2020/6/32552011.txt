The study was designed to investigate the effect of chemokine CXCL14 on in vitro angiogenesis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. CXCL14 mRNA expression in HCC tissue samples and adjacent tissue samples was detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). CXCL14 mRNA and protein expression in human normal hepatocyte HL-7702 and HCC cell line HepG2 were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. In HepG2 cell line, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, cell viability was detected by CCK-8, cell proliferation was detected by colony formation assay, and cell migration as well as invasion ability was detected by Transwell assay. Moreover, human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) tube formation assay was carried out to determine the cell ability of angiogenesis. Results showed that the overexpression of CXCL14 could inhibit angiogenesis, proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of HCC cells.Highlights CXCL14 is lowly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and cells. CXCL14 overexpression inhibits the angiogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. CXCL14 overexpression inhibits proliferation, invasion, and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
