Purpose of review:Immunotherapy shows great promises in solid tumors. Locoregional therapy can promote systemic immune response in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The combination of locoregional therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) activates a synergistic effect that can enhance the potency of anti-tumor immunity. This review aims to summarize the underlying mechanisms of locoregional therapy combined with ICIs and their applications in clinical settings.Recent findings:The characteristics of high invasiveness and refractoriness of HCC are what limit the outcomes of treatments. Sorafenib provides an additional treatment option for extrahepatic spread and vascular invasion, making long-term survival possible for patients with advanced HCC to some degree. However, its shortcomings of low response rate and high toxicity result in limited applications in clinical practice. Immunotherapy is a promising emerging therapy with great prospect in HCC, but the self-tolerance of HCC constrains the effectiveness of ICIs. Consequently, the efficacy of single immunotherapy is unsatisfactory. Locoregional therapy can not only destroy primary tumors but also stimulate the release of neoplasm antigens to increase the efficiency of immune response in HCC. Locoregional therapy combined with ICIs may have an amplification effect on immune response. Locoregional therapy plays a vital role in stimulating anti-tumor immune response. The combination of locoregional therapy and ICIs has a synergistic effect on anti-tumor immunity.
