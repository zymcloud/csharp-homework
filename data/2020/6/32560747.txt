Sorafenib, a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is a standard treatment for advancedhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the clinical response to sorafenib is seriouslylimited by drug-resistance. Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) is one of the mostimportant inhibitory molecules involved in tumor immune evasion. Recently, it has beenreported that PD-L1 could play crucial roles in drug-resistance of many kinds ofcancers. However, the expression, function and regulation of PD-L1 in sorafenibresistanthepatoma cells remain unclear. In this study, we reported that PD-L1 wasoverexpressed in sorafenib-resistant hepatoma cells and shRNA-mediated PD-L1depletion attenuated drug-resistance and suppressed the migration, invasion, colonyformation and tumorigenesis in sorafenib-resistant hepatoma cells in vitro and in vivo.Mechanistic investigations indicated that loss of microRNA-1 (miR-1), a tumorsuppressivemicroRNA, contributed to the PD-L1 up-regulation in sorafenib-resistanthepatoma cells and PD-L1 was a direct regulatory target of miR-1. Further studyrevealed that an oncogenic transcriptional factor: Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2(NRF-2) was induced in sorafenib-resistant hepatoma cell and inhibited expression ofmiR-1 in vitro. From molecular mechanism insight back to the functional verification,we eventually demonstrated that miR-1 executed its tumor suppressive effects on drugresistanceand other malignant properties in sorafenib-resistant hepatoma cells partiallyby PD-L1 inhibition in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our data suggested a NRF-2/miR-1/PD-L1 regulatory axis contributed to development and maintenance of drugCopyrightÂ© 2020 Cognizant Communication Corporation4ORM-A-3264 Oncology Research E-pubresistance and other tumorigenic properties in sorafenib-resistant hepatoma cells andprovided a potential therapeutic target for overcoming sorafenib resistance in HCC.
