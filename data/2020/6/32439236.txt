Background and study aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Talin-1 was previously proposed as a potential novel biomarker for HCC diagnosis but with limited and inconsistent data. We aimed to study the possible role of talin-1 in diagnosis and prognostic stratification of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.Patients and methods:Ninety-six patients were recruited and classified into three groups; 1) cirrhosis group: 40 patients with liver cirrhosis, 2) HCC group: 40 patients with HCC, 3) control group: 16 healthy volunteers with matched age and sex. Serum talin-1 level was detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Results:The highest levels of talin-1 were observed among the HCC group followed by cirrhosis then control groups (p = 0.000). In the HCC group, a significant correlation was found between talin-1 and each of multifocal HCC (p = 0.013), portal vein invasion (p = 0.022) and presence of ascites (p = 0.001), while no significant correlation was detected with tumour foci size (p = 0.605). For HCC detection, talin-1 had AUC = 0.858, 100% sensitivity and 65% specificity, while AFP had AUC = 1.000, 100% sensitivity and specificity.Conclusion:Talin-1 is a potential marker for diagnosis and prognostic assessment of HCC. Further studies are needed to investigate the ultimate diagnostic and prognostic utility of serum talin-1.
