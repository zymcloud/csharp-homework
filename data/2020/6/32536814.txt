Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common tumor characterized by high morbidity and mortality rates. The importance of circRNA in cancer diagnosis has been established. The study aimed to identify differentially-expressed circRNAs (DECs) in human blood exosomes from patients with HCC and to investigate their diagnostic value.Methods:The circRNA expression profiles of HCC and normal human blood samples were downloaded and processed from the exoRBase database. At the cutoff criteria of a fold change (FC) > 2.0 and P Results:Compared with the normal samples, seven up-regulated and five down-regulated circRNAs were determined in the HCC samples. ROC analyses demonstrated that hsa_circ_0004001, hsa_circ_0004123, hsa_circ_0075792, and a combination of the three biomarkers exhibited higher sensitivity and specificity. The qRT-PCR confirmed that the three circRNAs were upregulated in the blood samples with HCC. Chi squared tests implied that the expression of three circRNAs was positively correlated with the TNM stage and tumor size. The circRNAs participated in VEGF/VEGFR, PI3K/Akt, mTOR, and Wnt signaling pathways by targeting miRNAs.Conclusions:The study established the existence of seven up-regulated and five down-regulated circRNAs in HCC. Additionally, hsa_circ_0004001, hsa_circ_0004123, hsa_circ_0075792, and a combination of the three were utilized as valuable diagnostic biomarkers in HCC.
