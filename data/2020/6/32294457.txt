Despite advances in cancer treatment modalities, DNA still stands as one of the targets for anticancer agents. DNA minor groove binders (MGBs) represent an important investigational chemotherapeutic class with promising cytotoxic capacity. Herein this study reports the potent cytotoxic effect of a series of repurposed flexible bis-imidamides 1-4, triaryl bis-guanidine 5 and bis-N-substituted guanidines 6,7 having a 1,4-diphenoxybenzene scaffold backbone on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Of these compounds, imidamide 4 was chosen for further in-vitro, in-vivo and molecular dynamics (MD) studies owing to its promising anti-tumor activity, with IC50 values on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines of 1.9 and 2.08 Î¼M, respectively. Annexin V/propidium iodide apoptosis assay revealed apoptosis induction on imidamide 4 treated MCF-7 cells. RT-PCR assay results demonstrated the proapoptotic effect of compound 4 through increase of mRNA levels of the pro-apoptotic genes; p53, PUMA, and Bax, and inhibiting the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 gene expression in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, compound 4 induced a G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest in MCF-7 in a dose-dependent manner. Corroborating in-vivo experiments on Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC)-bearing mice, reflected the anticancer strength of derivative 4. For further target validation, molecular dynamics (MD) studies demonstrated an energetically favorable binding of imidamide 4 with the DNA minor groove AT rich site. In effect, imidamide 4 can be viewed as a promising hit dicationic compound with good cytotoxic and apoptotic inducing activity against breast cancer that can be adopted for future optimization.
