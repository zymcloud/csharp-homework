Anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibodies has been approved to treat HCC. Some PD-1 ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) negative tumors respond to treatment of anti-PD-1 antibodies, and this fact may be caused by the expression of PD-1 ligands on non-tumor cells. PD-L1 was recently found to be expressed on CD14+ cells from cancer patients. We investigate PD-1 ligands expression on CD14+ cells of patients with HCC and the role of CD14+ cells in an antitumor response. In this study, 87 patients diagnosed with HCC were enrolled. CD14+ cells from patients with HCC expressed PD-L1 (4.5-95.5%) and PD-L2 (0.2-95.0%). According to cut-off values, we classified patients as those either with PD-L1+PD-L2+CD14+ cells or other types of CD14+ cells. The overall survival of patients with PD-L1+PD-L2+CD14+ cells was shorter than that of patients with other types of CD14+ cells (p = 0.0023). PD-L1+PD-L2+CD14+ cells produced IL-10 and CCL1, and showed little tumoricidal activity against HepG2 cells. The tumoricidal activity of CD8+ cells from patients with PD-L1+PD-L2+CD14+ cells were suppressed by co-cultivation with CD14+ cells from the syngeneic patient. Furthermore, anti-PD-1 antibody restored their tumoricidal activity of CD8+ cells. In conclusion, some patients with HCC have PD-L1+PD-L2+CD14+ cells that suppress their antitumor response. These inhibitory functions of CD14+ cells may be associated with a poor prognosis in these patients.
