Purpose of review:Liver transplantation is an important therapeutic option for patients with life-limiting liver disease, which may present in the form of acute liver failure, end-stage chronic liver disease, primary hepatic cancers, or inborn metabolic disorders. While significant strides have been made with respect to liver transplantation outcomes, the practice is constrained by an organ supply/demand mismatch. The purpose of this review, therefore, is to review the general indications and contraindication to liver transplantation, and to provide an overview of the transplant evaluation process. These considerations ultimately shape the specific criteria for patient selection, which will continue to evolve as means are developed to expand the donor pool, improve surgical techniques, broaden indications for safe transplant, and extend the lifetime of a graft.Recent findings:Selected patients with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma may be candidates for liver transplantation. Patients over 65 years may be transplant candidates if they possess a favorable comorbidity profile. Patients at body mass index extremes (â‰¥ 40 or Summary:Liver transplantation may be life saving for patients with acute liver failure or end-stage liver disease. It is therefore critical for healthcare providers caring for patients with liver disease to be familiar with the general indications for transplantation and to know when it is appropriate or inappropriate to refer for transplant evaluation.
