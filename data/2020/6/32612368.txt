Background:Sustained proliferation and active metastasis are hallmarks of cancer, and they pose major challenges to the development of treatments and a cure for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus, the mechanisms of proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells need to be investigated. Many studies indicate that dysregulation of microRNA plays important roles in the progression of HCC, but the role of placenta-specific microRNA (miR-512-3p) in HCC has not been systematically investigated.Purpose:In the current study, the expression, biological function, and mechanisms of miR-512-3p involvement in HCC were investigated.Methods:Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were conducted to determine miR-512-3p levels in HCC tissues and cell lines. The StarBase V3.0 online platform was used to compare miR-512-3p levels in HCC tissues with TCGA data and to identify potential miR-512-3p target genes. Associations between miR-512-3p and clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed statistically. MTT, ethynyl deoxyuridine, and transwell assays were performed to assess cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion. The luciferase reporter gene assay was used to verify target genes. Recuse assays were performed to confirm whether large tumor suppressor kinase 2 (LATS2) participated in the regulatory effects of miR-512-3p on HCC cell proliferation and motility, and whether miR-512-3p mediated the tumor-promoting effects of hypoxia.Results:miR-512-3p was upregulated in HCC and it was associated with worse survival and unfavorable clinicopathological characteristics. Functional assays indicated that miR-512-3p contributed to HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Mechanistically, LATS2-a downstream target of miR-512-3p-mediated the tumor-promoting effects of miR-512-3p in HCC. Hypoxia could elevate miR-512-3p levels in HCC cells, and miR-512-3p partially mediated the tumor-promoting effects of hypoxia.Conclusion:Hypoxia-induced miR-512-3p contributes to HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by targeting LATS2 and inhibiting the Hippo/yes-associated protein 1 pathways.
