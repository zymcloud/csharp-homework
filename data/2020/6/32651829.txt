Hepatocellular carcinoma is characterized by the pronounced vascularization, high levels of vascular endothelial growth factors, and intensive angiogenesis. Caveola-mediated endocytosis and clathrin-dependent endocytosis contribute to internalization of various growth factors, thus affecting blood supply to the tumor and neoangiogenesis. We performed a quantitative analysis of blood vessels in the tumor and evaluated the basal levels of endocytosis-associated vesicular structures in the endothelial cells of the hepatocellular carcinoma-29. The numbers of blood vessels and clathrin-coated vesicles in endothelial cells in the tumor tissue were significantly higher than in normal tissue. The association between clathrin-dependent endocytosis in the endotheliocytes of the capillaries and tumor angiogenesis can provide the basis for the development of new molecular targets for antiangiogenic antitumor therapy.
