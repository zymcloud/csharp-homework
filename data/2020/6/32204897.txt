Background:Currently, the diagnosis of acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) is clinical, and its early identification and proper management are essential for a better prognosis. The aim of this study was to identify histopathologic parameters by analyzing cirrhotic liver explants that could aid in the early recognition of this entity and to determine prognostic factors that would influence ACLF management.Method:We performed a retrospective analysis of histopathologic material from liver explants from patients transplanted because of chronic hepatitis C virus infection from January 2007 to July 2017. Twenty-nine (n = 29) cases without hepatocellular carcinoma were selected. Histopathologic analysis included the Laennec classification, vascularization, and portal vein thrombosis.Results:According to the diagnosis of ACLF, patients were divided in 2 groups: group ACLF (n = 10) and group no acute on chronic liver failure (NO-ACLF) (n = 19). Considering the whole series, mean age was 51 ± 11.48 years and prevalence of men was 58.62%. The mean Model of End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score at time of transplantation was significantly higher in the ACLF group than in the NO-ACLF group (35 ± 7 vs 22 ± 6, respectively, P Conclusion:In this preliminary approach, clinical and histologic findings contributed to the differential diagnosis of ACLF. The mean MELD score at time of liver transplantations, total bilirubin levels, and histologically evident cholestasis were significantly higher in patients with ACLF than in those without ACLF.
