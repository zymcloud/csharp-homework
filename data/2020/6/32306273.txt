Ideal time interval between end of neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy (NRCT) and surgery for rectal cancer is debated. Effect that different time intervals have on postoperative complications with particular regard to anastomotic dehiscence (AD) was evaluated on 167 patients who underwent surgery after long-course NRCT. Three different time intervals were considered: (0-42; 43-56; > 57 days). A time interval > 57 days was significantly protective for AD (p = 0.04, Odds ratio = 0.35; 95% CI 0.1254-0.9585) without influence on early oncological outcomes. Optimal time interval after end of NRCT and surgery may help achieving the best pathological response with lowest postoperative morbidity.Trial registration number: Clinical Trial.
