Objective:The presented study aimed to investigate the association of A-kinase interacting protein 1 (AKIP1) expression with tumor properties, liver functions, cancer markers, and overall survival (OS) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:A total of 432 HCC patients receiving surgery were retrospectively reviewed in our study. Clinical characteristics of patients were obtained. Tumor tissue specimens of all patients were collected, and AKIP1 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay. OS was assessed, and the median follow-up duration was 35.0 months. AKIP1 high expression was defined as total IHC score more than 3 and was further graded as AKIP1 high+ (IHC 4-6), AKIP1 high++ (IHC 7-9), and AKIP1 high+++ (IHC 10-12).Results:About 265 (61.3%) patients presented with AKIP1 low expression and 167 (38.7%) patients had AKIP1 high expression. AKIP1 high expression correlated with higher performance status score (P = .006), largest tumor size â‰¥5.0 cm (P Conclusion:AKIP1 is a novel and promising biomarker for disease monitoring and prognosis in HCC patients.
