Enhancing host immunity by vaccination to prevent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains the most important strategy for global control of hepatitis B. Currently, 187 countries have in place infant hepatitis B vaccination programs. Hepatitis B surface antigen prevalence has decreased to less than 1% in children after successful implementation of universal HBV vaccination in newborns. The incidence of primary liver cancer in children, adolescents, and young adults has drastically decreased to near zero in birth cohorts receiving hepatitis B vaccination. Elimination of chronic hepatitis B by 2030 is not a mission impossible.
