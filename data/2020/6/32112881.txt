The downregulation of the denitrosylating enzyme S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR, EC:1.1.1.284), is a feature of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This condition causes mitochondrial rearrangements that sensitize these tumors to mitochondrial toxins, in particular to the mitochondrial complex II inhibitor alpha-tocopheryl succinate (αTOS). It has also been reported the GSNOR depletion impairs the selective degradation of mitochondria through mitophagy; however, if this contributes to GSNOR-deficient HCC cell sensitivity to αTOS and can be applied to anticancer therapies, is still not known. Here, we provide evidence that GSNOR-deficient HCC cells show defective mitophagy which contributes to αTOS toxicity. Mitophagy inhibition by Parkin (EC: 2.3.2.31) depletion enhances αTOS anticancer effects, thus suggesting that this drug could be effective in treating mitophagy-defective tumors.
