Presently, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks fourth among common malignant tumors in China, and the mortality rate ranks second. The preferred method of clinical treatment for HCC is early surgical resection at this time, but most patients have reached to mid-advanced stage at the time of diagnosis, so surgery cannot be performed. Traditional radiotherapy and chemotherapy have poor prognosis and many adverse reactions, which make the current clinical treatment of HCC in China full of challenges. Therefore, new treatment strategies are urgently needed to improve the quality of life of liver cancer patients. With the advancement of modern medicine, the treatment of liver cancer is no longer limited to traditional treatments. Immunotherapy as a new treatment has become an important treatment for liver cancer. In recent years, immunotherapy and new targeted drugs for liver cancer have become a research hotspot, and many achievements have been made in the treatment of liver cancer. In this paper, the current situation and progress of single or combined immunotherapy for liver cancer of recent years are briefly reviewed.
