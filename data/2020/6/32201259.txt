Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver tumors. Although HCC is associated with chronic viral infections, alcoholic cirrhosis, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, genetic factors that contribute to the HCC risk remain unknown. The BRCA2 DNA repair associated (BRCA2) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) interacting protein, known as BCCIP, are essential for cell viability and maintenance of genomic stability. In this study, we established a new genetically engineered mouse model with Bccip deficiency. Mosaic or heterozygous Bccip deletion conferred an increased risk of spontaneous liver tumorigenesis and B-cell lymphoma development at old age. These abnormalities are accompanied with chronic inflammation, histologic features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, keratin and ubiquitin aggregates within cytoplasmic Mallory-Denk bodies, and changes of the intracellular distribution of high-mobility group box 1 protein. Our study suggests BCCIP dysregulation as a risk factor for HCC and offers a novel mouse model for future investigations of nonviral or nonalcoholic causes of HCC development.
