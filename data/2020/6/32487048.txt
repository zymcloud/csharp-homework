Background:Bone metastasis (BM) is one of the common sites of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the prognosis of BM patients is worse than patients without it. Our study aimed to identify predictors and prognostic factors of BM in HCC patients and develop two nomograms to quantify the risk of BM and the prognosis of HCC patients with BM.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients who were diagnosed as HCC between 2010 and 2015 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Independent predictors for BM from HCC patients were determined by the univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Independent prognostic factors for HCC patients with BM were identified by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Two nomograms were established and evaluated by calibration curves, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA).Results:Nine thousand and forty-seven patients were included. The independent risk factors of BM in newly diagnosed HCC patients are sex, grade, T stage, and N stage. The independent prognostic factors for HCC patients with BM are radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and lung metastasis. The AUC of diagnostic nomogram were 0.726 in the training set and 0.629 in the testing set. For the prognostic nomogram, the AUCs of 6-, 9-, and 12-months were 0.753, 0.799, and 0.732 in the training set and 0.698, 0.770, and 0.823 in the validation set. The calibration curve and DCA indicated the good performance of the nomogram.Conclusions:Two nomograms were established to predict the incidence of BM in HCC patients and the prognosis of HCC patients with BM, respectively. Both nomograms have satisfactory accuracy, and clinical utility may benefit for clinical decision-making.
