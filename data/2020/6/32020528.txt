Background:Our purpose was to assess the performance of ESR iGuide for assisting the selection of the most appropriate imaging tests based on clinical signs and symptoms in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or cholangiocarcinoma (CC).Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 113 patients with a final diagnosis of HCC or CC. Data from a cohort of 40 patients with a reported clinical history suggestive for either disease, who had undergone at least their first imaging test related to their condition at the same Institution, were entered into ESR iGuide. The appropriateness level of the diagnostic tests suggested by ESR iGuide was compared with that of the tests actually performed.Results:All patients underwent several imaging examinations, ranging from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 4, for a total of 98 diagnostic procedures. Of these, 79.6% (78/98) were considered "usually appropriate" by ESR iGuide, 11.2% (11/98) were designated as "may be appropriate", and 9.2% (9/98) were not even suggested. Given a total estimated cost of €14,016 for the 98 examinations performed within the regional (BLINDED) healthcare system, the usage of ESR iGuide would have allowed saving €3033 (21.6%) due to inappropriate testing.Conclusions:In patients with HCC or CC, ESR iGuide can be effective in guiding the selection of the appropriate imaging examinations and cutting costs due to inappropriate testing.
