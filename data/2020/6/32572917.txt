Objective:The aim of this study was to explore the functional changes of long non-coding ribonucleic acid (lncRNA)-HEIH on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Huh7 and Hep3B cells.Patients and methods:The expression changes of HEIH in 18 pairs of HCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were detected by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). According to its expression changes in HCC cells silenced by short hairpin ribonucleic acid (shRNA) transfection in vitro, these cells were divided into sh-HEIH group and sh-NC group. The effects of lowly expressed HEIH on the proliferation, migration and apoptosis of HCC cells were examined through functional assays. Western blotting was adopted to determine the expression changes of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) proteins, vimentin, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-3. In addition, the role of HEIH downstream effector micro RNA (miR)-199a-3p in HCC was explored.Results:Compared with adjacent normal tissues, HEIH was highly expressed in HCC tissues (pConclusions:LncRNA-HEIH suppresses HCC cell growth and metastasis by up-regulating miR-199a-3p. Our findings suggest that HEIH may be a promising target for HCC treatment.
