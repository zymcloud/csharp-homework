In various cancers, high-grade tumor and poor survival rate in patients with upregulated lncRNAs UCA1 have been confirmed. Urothelial carcinoma associated 1 (UCA1) is an oncogenic non-coding RNA with a length of more than 200 nucleotides. The UCA1 regulate critical biological processes that are involved in cancer progression, including cancer cell growth, invasion, migration, metastasis, and angiogenesis. So It should not surprise that UCA1 overexpresses in variety of cancers type, including pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, cervical cancer, bladder cancer, adrenal cancer, hypopharyngeal cancer, oral cancer, gallbladder cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, laryngeal cancer, osteosarcoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, leukemia, glioma, thyroid cancer, medulloblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and multiple myeloma. In this article, we review biological function and regulatory mechanism of UCA1in several cancers and also, we will discuss the potential of its as cancer biomarker and cancer treatment.
