Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is closely associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a severe form of NAFLD, can lead to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and hepatic decompensation. Patients with T2D have twice the risk of HCC incidence compared with those without T2D. Because the hepatic fibrosis grade is the main determinant of mortality in patients with NAFLD, identifying patients with advanced fibrosis using non-invasive tests (NITs) or imaging modalities is crucial. Globally, the fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4 index), NAFLD fibrosis score, and enhanced liver fibrosis test have been established to evaluate hepatic fibrosis. Two-step algorithms using FIB-4 index as first triaging tool are globally accepted. It remains unknown which kinds of NITs or elastography are best as the second step tool. In Japan, type IV collagen 7s or the CA-fibrosis index (comprising type IV collagen 7s and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)) is believed to precisely predict advanced fibrosis in NAFLD. Patients with NAFLD who have high non-invasive test results should be screened for HCC or esophageal varices. Risk factors of rapid fibrosis progression in NAFLD includes age, severe obesity, presence of T2D, menopause in women, and a patatin-like phospholipase domain containing the 3 GG genotype. Patients with NAFLD who have these risk factors should be intensively treated with lifestyle modification or pharmacotherapies for preventing liver-related mortality.
