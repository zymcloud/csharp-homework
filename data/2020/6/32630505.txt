Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common hepatobiliary malignancy with limited therapeutic options. On the other hand, melatonin is an indoleamine that modulates a variety of potential therapeutic effects. In addition to its important role in the regulation of sleep-wake rhythms, several previous studies linked the biologic effects of melatonin to various substantial endocrine, neural, immune and antioxidant functions, among others. Furthermore, the effects of melatonin could be influenced through receptor dependent and receptor independent manner. Among the other numerous physiological and therapeutic effects of melatonin, controlling the survival and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been recently discussed. Given its controversial interaction, several previous reports revealed the therapeutic potential of MSCs in controlling the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Taken together, the intention of the present review is to highlight the effects of melatonin and mesenchymal stem cells as a key for functional integrity for liver cancer treatment. We hope to provide solid piece of information that may be helpful in designing novel drug targets to control HCC.
