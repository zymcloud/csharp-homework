Objective:Studies have found that hsa_circ_103809, a newly discovered circRNA in recent years, can serve as an oncogene involved in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its role in gastric cancer (GCa) remains elusive. The aim of this study was to reveal the molecular mechanism of hsa_circ_103809 affecting the process of GCa, thus providing new ideas for its treatment.Patients and methods:Hsa_circ_103809 expression in GCa and adjacent tissues specimens were studied by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, and its effect on the prognosis of GCa patients was analyzed. In GCa cells lines, hsa_circ_103809 was knocked down by small interfering RNA, and GCa cell metastasis ability was detected by cell wound healing test and transwell assay. Finally, the potential target gene of hsa_circ_103809 was predicted through bioinformatics website and verified by Luciferase assay.Results:Hsa_circ_103809 showed an increased expression both in GCa tissues and cell lines, predicting a poor prognosis of GCa patients. Meanwhile, the invasive and migration capacities of GCa cells were remarkably reduced after the knockdown of hsa_circ_103809. Bioinformatics website predicted that there existed binding sites of hsa_circ_103809 on microRNA-101-3p, and Luciferase assay verified that hsa_circ_103809 can adsorb microRNA-101-3p. In GCa tissues, qPCR detected a significantly reduced expression of microRNA-101-3p, which was negatively correlated with that of hsa_circ_103809. In addition, the knockdown of hsa_circ_103809 enhanced microRNA-101-3p expression in GCa cell lines. Subsequent in vitro experiments further detected that the overexpression of hsa_circ_103809 partially reversed the inhibitory effect of microRNA-101-3p overexpression on GCa cell migration ability and invasiveness.Conclusions:Hsa_circ_103809, highly expressed in GCa, may promote the migration capacity of GCa cells by adsorbing microRNA-101-3p and thus become a new therapeutic target for GCa.
