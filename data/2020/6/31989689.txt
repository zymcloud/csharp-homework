The current study aimed to test the profile of serum lipids, phospholipase D (PLD) activity, and CD59 expression pattern in rat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after therapeutic treatment with Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). Three rat groups were allocated as normal control, untreated HCC, and treated HCC (HCC + CoQ10). The levels of serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), while proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was detected using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Serum lipids, classical (CH50), and alternative (APH50) pathways of complement activation, the liver cell HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), and PLD activities were assayed colorimetrically. The protein expression of CD59, scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SRB1), B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl2), and cleaved Caspase-3 (Casp-3) were detected using western blotting, while the level of serum CD59 (sCD59) was assessed using dot-blot. CoQ10 reduced the cell proliferation, histological alterations, and the levels of AFP and TNF-α but increased lipids, CH50, and sCD59 in serum. In the liver cell, CoQ10 decreased and increased PLD and HMGCR enzyme activities, respectively. In addition, reduction of liver CD59, Bcl2, and SRB1 vs increased cleaved Casp-3 expressions was observed. Statistical correlation indicated an inverse relationship between CH50 and each of CD59 expression and PLD activity after treatment with CoQ10. In conclusion, CoQ10 could protect against rat HCC through increased lipids and the reduction of CD59 expression and PLD activity. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: To our knowledge, this study is the first to describe the attenuating effect of antitumour natural product like Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) via the reduction of CD59 expression and phospholipase D (PLD) activity. This illustrates the important role of CD59 and PLD in relation to lipids in cancer prevention.
