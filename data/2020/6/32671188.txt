Transmembrane and ubiquitin-like domain-containing 1 (Tmub1) inhibits hepatocyte proliferation during liver regeneration, but its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has yet to be revealed. In this study, we show that the levels of Tmub1 were significantly lower in HCC tissues and cells than they were in adjacent tissues and normal hepatic cells, and the low levels of Tmub1 indicated a poor prognosis in HCC patients. Xenograft growth assay revealed that Tmub1 represses HCC growth in vivo. In addition, Tmub1 formed a protein complex with apoptosis-associated protein tumor protein 63 (p63), especially with the ΔN isoforms (ΔNp63α, β, and γ). Further loss- and gain-of-function analyses indicated that Tmub1 promotes apoptosis of Hep3B and MHCC-LM3 cells. Tmub1 decreased the protein expression of ΔNp63, and the pro-apoptotic effect of Tmub1 can be reversed by ΔNp63 isoforms (α, β, and γ). Additionally, we report that Tmub1 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of ΔNp63 proteins. Finally, we confirmed in HCC tissues that Tmub1 is negatively correlated with ΔNp63 and positively correlated with the level of apoptosis. Taken together, Tmub1 suppresses HCC by enhancing the ubiquitination and degradation of ΔNp63 isoforms to induce HCC cell apoptosis. These findings provide a potential strategy for the management of HCC.
