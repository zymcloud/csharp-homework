Background:Bariatric surgery (BS) may be associated with significant malabsorption and nutritional deficiencies.Methods:Between March 1987 and January 2017, we performed 922 liver transplants (LT) at our institution; 33 had antecedent BS. We matched the BS cohort to LT recipients without BS (1:3 matching) based on exact matching for gender and cancer and inverse variance matching for age, LT BMI, MELD score, and transplant date.Results:We analyzed outcomes in 132 LT recipients (33 BS; 99 non-BS). The BS cohort comprised of 26 (79%) women with a mean age of 52.4 years. The BS procedures included 20 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (61%), 6 jejunoileal bypass (18%), 3 gastric band (9%), 2 sleeve gastrectomy (6%), and 1 duodenal switch (3%). The primary indications for LT listing were alcoholic cirrhosis (9; 27%), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (7; 21%), hepatitis C (8; 24%), and hepatocellular carcinoma (3; 9%). At LT, BMI for the BS cohort was 29.6 and MELD was 24. Compared to matched controls, BS recipients did not have longer LT length of hospital stay (LOS; 17.8 vs 15.7 days, p = 0.71), longer ICU LOS (5.3 vs 4.1 days, p = 0.16), or higher 30-day complication rate (76% vs 85%, p = 0.43). Overall patient survival was similar (1- and 3-year survival was 90.1% and 75.9% for BS; 90.9% and 76.4% for non-BS, p = 0.34).Conclusion:A history of BS does not portend a deleterious effect on LT outcomes.
