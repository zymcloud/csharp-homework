Objective:To detect the expression level of organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to determine the relationship between OATP1B3 expression, clinicopathological features, and prognosis.Methods:Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed to detect the expression of OATP1B3 in 131 HCC specimens and in 89 adjacent nontumorous tissues. Moreover, the expression levels of OATP1B3 in 30 pairs of tumor and matched adjacent nontumorous tissues were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and 34 pairs of tumor and matched adjacent nontumorous tissues were detected by Western blotting. The Ï‡2 test was applied to analyze the correlation between OATP1B3 expression and the clinical parameters of HCC patients. The prognostic value of OATP1B3 in HCC patients was estimated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the Cox stepwise proportional hazards model.Results:Compared with that in adjacent nontumorous tissues (25.8%, 23/89), OATP1B3 expression was significantly downregulated in tumor tissues (59.5%, 78/131) (P Conclusions:The expression of OATP1B3 in HCC patients was significantly lower than that in adjacent nontumorous tissues. OATP1B3 expression may be a potential prognostic marker in HCC patients.
