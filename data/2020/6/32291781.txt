Background:Studies have shown a higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with higher baseline serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. However, the association between very high HBV DNA levels (>6 log10 IU/mL) and HCC risk remains unclear, especially in middle-aged and old HBeAg-positive patients.Aim:To identify the association between broad-range HBV DNA levels and HCC risk.Methods:We conducted a historical cohort study in Korea involving 6949 non-cirrhotic, treatment-naïve CHB patients with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 1 year. HBV DNA was >6 log10 IU/mL in 2029 (29.2%) patients. Follow-up was censored when the antiviral therapy was initiated.Results:The mean age of the patients was 45 years. During 8.0 years of median follow-up, 363 patients (5.2%) developed HCC. By multivariable Cox regression analysis, HCC risk was highest with baseline HBV DNA levels of 6-7 log10 IU/mL (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 4.98; P < 0.001), and lowest with >8 log10 IU/mL (aHR 0.90; P = 0.71) and ≤4 log10 IU/mL (aHR 1.00; reference), which was independent of other predictive factors. The similar association between HBV DNA levels and HCC risk was consistently observed in all age subgroups (age <40, 40-49 and ≥ 50 years).Conclusions:HCC risk was highest with moderate serum HBV DNA levels of 6-7 log10 IU/mL in CHB patients without significant ALT elevation. Extending treatment indication to CHB patients with moderate levels of HBV DNA may be considered to further prevent HCC, regardless of ALT levels.
