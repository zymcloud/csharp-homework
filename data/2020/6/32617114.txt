Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Sorafenib (Sora) is used as a targeted therapy for HCC treatment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are applied as a new approach to fight malignancies. Drug resistance and side effects are the major concerns with Sora administration. The effect of using the combination of sorafenib and MSCs on tumor regression in xenograft HCC models was evaluated in this study. Methods and Materials. Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2) were subcutaneously implanted into the flank of 18 nude mice. The animals were randomly divided into six groups (n = 3); each received Sora (oral), MSCs (IV injection), MSCs (local injection), Sora + MSCs (IV injection), Sora + MSCs (local injection), or no treatment (the control group). Six weeks after tumor implantation, the mice were scarified and tumoral tissues were resected in their entirety. Histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluations were used to measure tumor proliferation and angiogenesis. Apoptotic cells were quantified using the TUNEL assay. Results. No significant difference was found in the tumor grade among the treatment groups. Differentiation features of the tumoral cells were histopathologically insignificant in all the groups. Tumor necrosis was highest in the hpMSC (local) + Sora group. Tumor cell proliferation was reduced in hpMSC (local) + Sora-treated and hpMSC (IV) + Sora-treated mice compared with the other groups. Apoptotic-positive cells occupied a greater proportion in the Sora, hpMSC (IV) + Sora, and hpMSC (local) + Sora groups. Conclusion. A combination of chemotherapy and MSC can yield to more favorable results in the treatment of HCC.
