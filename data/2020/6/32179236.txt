Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is a widely known hepatotoxin which could induce the occurrence and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent years, with the frequent outbreak of cyanobacteria, the harm of MC-LR has gradually attracted more attention. Hence, this study focused on the effect of MC-LR on DNA damage in HepG2 cells, identifying the types and sources of free radicals that make an important function on this issue. Our data suggested that MC-LR induced concentration- and time-dependent increasement of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). After exposure to 1 μM MC-LR for 3 days, the protein expression and immunofluorescence staining of γ-H2AX was significantly increased. Using a scavenger of mitochondrial O2.- (4-hydroxy-tempo), a inhibitor of mitochondrial NOS (7-nitroindazole), and a scavenger of ONOO- (uric acid), it was revealed that ONOO- originated from mitochondria made a significant contribution to the genotoxicity of MC-LR. Moreover, a significant decreasement of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was observed. These findings suggested that peroxynitrite targeting mitochondria plays a vital role in the MC-LR-induced genotoxic response in mammalian cells.
