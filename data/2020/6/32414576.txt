Background:Recent studies showed that sequential selective transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and portal vein embolization (PVE) provided better future liver remnant (FLR) regeneration rate and disease-free survival following surgery compared with PVE alone. The present study aimed to clarify whether preoperative sequential TACE and PVE before right hemihepatectomy can reduce postoperative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence and improve long-term disease-free and overall survival.Methods:Recurrence and survival outcomes were retrospectively evaluated in 205 patients with HCC who underwent right hemihepatectomy by a single surgeon from November 1993 to November 2017. Patients were divided into four groups according to the procedure performed before the surgery: sequential TACE and PVE (TACE-PVE), PVE-only, TACE-only, or naïve control groups. The baseline patient and tumor characteristics, postoperative outcomes, recurrence-free survival and overall survival were analyzed.Results:Baseline patient and tumor characteristics upon diagnosis were similar in all four groups, while sequential TACE and PVE were well tolerated. The TACE-PVE group had a higher mean increase in percentage FLR volume compared with that of the PVE-only group (17.46% ± 6.63% vs. 12.14% ± 5.93%; P = 0.001). The TACE-PVE group had significantly better overall and disease-free survival rates compared with the other groups (both P Conclusions:Sequential TACE and PVE prior to surgery can be an effective therapeutic strategy for patients with HCC scheduled for major hepatic resection. The active application of preoperative sequential TACE and PVE for HCC would allow more patients with marginal FLR volume to become candidates for major hepatic resection by promoting compensatory FLR hypertrophy without the deterioration of basal hepatic functional reserve or tumor progression.
