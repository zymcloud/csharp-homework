Introduction:Surgical management is not a standard treatment option for metastatic recurrence of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, the surgical management of a solitary metastasis is useful in selected cases.Patient concerns:A 42-year-old woman was referred to our hospital on account of epigastric pain associated with a mass in the pancreatic body. The patient had a family history of branch duct-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas.Diagnosis:The patient was diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) complicated with pancreatitis due to pancreatic duct involvement.Interventions:The patient underwent distal pancreatectomy, and pathological examination revealed a tubular adenocarcinoma. Solitary liver and lung metastatic tumors were found 6 and 43 months after the initial presentation, respectively, and sequential metastasectomies were performed.Outcomes:The patient survived until 8 years after her initial presentation. The genetic profiles of the resected specimens, primary PDA, and recurrent tumors in the liver and lung possessed identical KRAS mutations at codon 12, whereas there were no mutations in the main tumor suppressor genes, such as TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based microsatellite instability assay demonstrated microsatellite stability.Conclusion:In our case, the patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma survived for over 8 years following the resection of the primary tumor and resections of metachronous metastatic tumors. The outcome of PDA may be associated with the genetic profile that regulates its biological behavior. Operative management of solitary metastatic tumors may be a therapeutic options for selected patients with pancreatic cancer.
