Background:Anti-Gerbich (Ge) alloantibody against high-frequency erythrocyte antigen is extremely rare. Owing to incomplete evidence regarding the degree and severity of adverse events induced by hemolytic transfusion reactions, the transfusion management often remains cumbersome in these patients. We report an anti-Ge alloantibody positive patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent central hepatectomy (CH) without the need for an allogeneic blood transfusion.Case presentation:A 76-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed with HCC measuring 9.5 × 8.0 cm in segments 4, 5, and 8 of the liver. This patient with anti-Ge alloantibody had a history of two pregnancies without transfusion. CH was planned, and based on the suggestion from the multidisciplinary team meeting, preoperative autologous donation (PAD) and acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) were performed. CH was successfully performed by using CUSA and Thunderbeat® with Pringle maneuver and infra-hepatic inferior vena cava clamping without perioperative need for an allogeneic blood transfusion. She has been alive without recurrence after a follow-up period of 45 months.Conclusion:To our knowledge, this is the first case report of hepatectomy in a patient with anti-Ge alloantibody. A multidisciplinary team approach, PAD and ANH, and bloodless liver surgical techniques appear to be useful for major hepatectomy in patients with extremely rare blood type.
