Objective:To study the expression of linc00601 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cells, and to study the biological function and downstream mechanism of linc00601 in HCC using in vitro experiments.Patients and methods:The expression of linc00601 in HCC was predicted via bioinformatics, and the expression of linc00601 in HCC tissues and cells was detected via quantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). After interference with the expression of linc00601, the interference efficiency was determined using qRT-PCR, and the changes in HCC cell proliferation, cycle distribution, and apoptosis were determined through Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Finally, the expressions of molecular markers in downstream signaling pathway were determined through Western blotting.Results:It was found via bioinformatics that the expression of linc00601 was upregulated in HCC. The results of qRT-PCR revealed that the expression of linc00601 was upregulated in 36 cases of HCC tissues compared with that in para-carcinoma tissues, and it was also upregulated in HCC cells. According to the results of CCK-8 assay, HCC cell proliferation was inhibited after interference with the expression of linc00601. In the si-linc00601 group, the apoptosis rate rose, and the cell cycle was arrested at the G1/G0 phase compared with those in the si-NC group. The results of Western blotting revealed that after the knockdown of linc00601 in HCC cells, the expressions of molecular markers (p-P38, p-ERK) in the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway were downregulated.Conclusions:Linc00601 is upregulated in HCC, which promotes the development of HCC via activating the MAPK signaling pathway.
