Background and aim:Although the serum sodium level has been reported to be a prognostic and predictive marker for the therapeutic effects of lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma treated with molecular targeted therapy, the serum sodium level has not been investigated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with sorafenib. The aim of our analysis was to assess the prognostic role of serum sodium levels in these patients.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 341 HCC patients treated with sorafenib between 2009 and 2012 in our hospital and other related institutions.Results:A total of 178 patients were enrolled in this study. The median age was 72 years (44-88), and 148 patients (83%) were male. The median overall survival (OS) was 12.9 months, and the median time to progression (TTP) was 3.1 months. Hyponatremia (hazard ratio (HR) 1.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-2.52), a lower sodium level (HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.07-2.80), and a high level of α-fetoprotein (AFP) (≥ 200 ng/mL) (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.26-2.52) were independent prognostic factors for TTP. We also categorized the patients into three groups according to serum sodium and AFP levels: Group A (n = 39) (serum sodium > 140 mEq/L, AFP Conclusion:Serum sodium levels are associated with the effectiveness of sorafenib. The serum sodium level can predict the therapeutic effect of sorafenib in advanced HCC patients.
