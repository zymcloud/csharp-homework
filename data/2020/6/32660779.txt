Purpose:This study evaluates overall survival (OS) between liver transplantation (LT) and liver resection (LR), while assessing the effect of margin status, in children with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The National Cancer Database was queried (2004-2015) for children (Results:One hundred six children with HCC treated surgically (LT 34, LR 72) were identified. For T1 stage, no difference in OS was observed for LT vs. margin-negative liver resection [LR(-)] (log-rank, p = 0.47). For T2/T3/T4 stage, no difference in OS was observed for LT vs. LR(-) (log-rank, p = 0.08); both subgroups exhibited superior OS vs. margin-positive liver resection [LR(+)] (log-rank, LT vs. LR(+): p = 0.001 and LR(-) vs. LR(+): p = 0.04). On multivariable Cox regression: (i) histology (fibrolamellar vs. not) and T stage (T1 vs. T2/T3/T4) were not associated with OS (both p = 0.06), (ii) chemotherapy and size >5 cm were not associated with OS (both p â‰¥ 0.42), (iii) when compared to LT, both LR(-) (p = 0.03) and LR(+) (p = 0.001) were associated with increased likelihood of mortality.Conclusion:Although margin-negative resection may be obtained with LT or LR, early LT consultation is warranted for children at high risk of LR(+) regardless of Milan criteria due to the negative impact of LR(+) on OS.Type of study:Retrospective cohort study.Level of evidence:III.
