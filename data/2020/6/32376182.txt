Purpose:To investigate the impact of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) and 12-week sustained virologic response (SVR12) in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated by interventional oncology (IO) therapies.Materials and methods:Retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed from 2005 to 2016 with HCC and receiving IO therapies. A total of 478 patients met inclusion criteria. Patients were age 29-90 years (mean 63.6 Â± 9.4 years) and 78.9% (n =3 77) male. Two hundred and eighty-five (57%) patients had chronic HCV, 93 (33%) received DAAs, and 63 (68%) achieved SVR12. Liver function, tumor characteristics, and IO therapy including ablation, image-guided transcatheter tumor therapies (ITTT) (eg, chemoembolization and radioembolization), and combination locoregional therapy were assessed in analysis.Results:Median overall survival (OS) of the cohort was 26.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 21.9-29.9). OS for ablation, combination locoregional therapy and ITTT, was 37.3 (CI 30.7-49.9), 29.3 (CI 24.2-38.0), and 19.7 months (CI 16.5-22.8), respectively (P Conclusions:DAA use and SVR12 is associated with higher OS in patients with HCV-related HCC treated by IO therapies.
