Background:Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a critical regulatory role in cancer progression. However, the underlying mechanisms of circRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis remain mostly unknown.Methods:Has_circ_0003998 (circ0003998) was identified by RNAs sequencing in HCC patients with /without portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) metastasis. The expression level of circ0003998 was further detected by in situ hybridization on tissues microarray (ISH-TMA) and qRT-PCR in 25 HCC patients with PVTT metastasis. Moreover, the 25 HCC patients with PVTT metastasis and 50 HCC patients without PVTT metastasis were recruited together to analyze the correlation between circ0003998 expression and HCC clinical characteristics. Transwell, migration and CCK8 assays, as well as nude mice model of lung or liver metastasis were used to evaluate the role of circ0003998 in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC. The regulatory mechanisms of circ0003998 in miR-143-3p and PCBP1 were determined by dual-luciferase reporter assay, nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation, fluorescent in situ hybridization, RNA pull- down, microRNA sequence, western blot and RNA immunoprecipitation.Results:Compared with adjacent normal liver tissues (ANL), circ0003998 expression was significantly upregulated in PVTT tissues and HCC tissues, and its expression correlates with the aggressive characteristics of HCC patients. Further assays suggested that circ0003998 promoted EMT of HCC both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, our data indicated that circ0003998 may act as a ceRNA (competing endogenous RNA) of microRNA-143-3p to relieve the repressive effect on EMT-related stimulator, FOSL2; meanwhile, circ0003998 could bind with PCBP1-poly(rC) binding protein 1 (PCBP1) to increase the expression level of EMT-related genes, CD44v6.Conclusion:Circ0003998 promotes EMT of HCC by circ0003998/miR-143-3p/FOSL2 axis and circ0003998 /PCBP1/CD44v6 axis.
