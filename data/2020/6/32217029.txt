The aim of this study was to pre-operatively investigate the diagnostic performance of 2D shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) for staging liver fibrosis and inflammation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who then undergo surgery and to determine the optimal locations for measurement. In total, 106 patients were enrolled in this prospective study from March 2017 to May 2018. Two-dimensional SWE was used to measure liver stiffness (LS) in each patient 0-1, 1-2 and 2-5 cm from the tumor border (groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively). Spearman's correlation was used to evaluate the relationships between LS and hepatic fibrosis and between LS and inflammation. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 2D-SWE. The technical success rate of SWE in tissue distant from the tumor (group 3) was significantly higher than that in peri-tumoral tissue (groups 1 and 2) (p
