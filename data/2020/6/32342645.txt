Growing evidence indicates that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are promising biomarkers, as they play significant roles in the development of various cancers. The circular RNA MYLK (circMYLK) has been reported to be involved in the development of malignant tumours, including liver, prostate and bladder cancers. Nevertheless, the biological function of circMYLK in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains unclear. In this study, we observed that circMYLK is notably up-regulated in RCC. Increased circMYLK expression led to a larger tumour size, distant metastasis and poor prognosis of RCC patients. Moreover, circMYLK silencing repressed RCC growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circMYLK can capture miR-513a-5p to facilitate VEGFC expression and further promote the tumorigenesis of RCC cells. In summary, our findings demonstrate that circMYLK has an oncogenic role in RCC growth and metastasis by modulating miR-513a-5p/VEGFC signalling. Thus, circMYLK has potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target in the treatment of RCC.
