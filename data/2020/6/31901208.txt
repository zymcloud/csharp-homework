Small recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can show atypical imaging patterns, and a specific diagnostic algorithm for HCC is lacking. This study aimed to better characterize postoperative recurrent HCCs 2 hyperintensity, and restricted diffusion) were significantly related to recurrent HCCs <20 mm in size according to a multivariate analysis. For subcentimeter recurrence, combining at least 2 of the 3 AFs only achieved better specificity (sensitivity, 83.3%; specificity, 87.7%) than the LR-4 category (sensitivity, 88.9%, P = 0.21; specificity, 70.8%, P = 0.006). For 10-19 mm recurrences, combining nonrim APHE and at least 1 of the 3 AFs achieved only a significantly enhanced sensitivity of 85.1% but a lower specificity of 86.5% compared with the LR-5 category (sensitivity: 63.5%, P < 0.001; specificity: 94.2%, P = 0.13). In conclusion, the diagnostic algorithms for subcentimeter and 10-19 mm recurrent HCCs should be stratified. Combining at least 2 AFs demonstrated comparable sensitivity with significantly enhanced specificity compared with the LR-4 category for characterizing subcentimeter recurrence.
