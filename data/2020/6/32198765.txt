Background and objectives:The aim was to evaluate long-term prognostic factors in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who survived over 10 years after hepatectomy and compare prognostic factors between patients with recurrence who died and survived 10 years after initial hepatectomy.Methods:We analyzed the HCC patients without recurrence over 10 years after hepatectomy (n = 35), those with recurrence who survived over 10 years (n = 48), and those who died within 10 years (n = 132).Results:The rate of recurrence was 16.3%, 10-year overall survival rate was 38.6%, and the 10-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate was 16.7%. Nonviral, solitary tumor, well differentiation, and without severe fibrosis were independent favorable factors for long-term RFS. High cholinesterase levels, small tumors and without portal vein invasion were independent favorable factors for long-term survival among patients with recurrence. Long-term survivors with recurrence showed significantly low early recurrence, extrahepatic recurrence, multiple intrahepatic recurrences.Conclusion:Important factors for long-term prognoses in HCC patients were a solitary tumor, small tumors, and no advanced fibrosis. A treatment for nonviral hepatitis is needed to achieve long-term RFS. Even patients who relapse might survive long term if they have a late or solitary intrahepatic recurrence, nonsevere cirrhosis, and curative treatment at recurrence.
