Background:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection causes liver failure, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The FOXP3 gene polymorphisms, the rs2232365 A/G and the rs3761548 A/C, were identified to be associated with regulatory T cell-mediated immunosuppression. The response to HBV infection may be affected by FOXP3 polymorphisms. The present study aimed to assess the relationship between FOXP3 gene polymorphisms and chronic HBV infection risk.Methods:FOXP3 gene polymorphisms were explored in 237 chronic HBV patients and in 237 individuals with HBV spontaneous clearance using a real-time polymerase chain reaction.Results:The patients with rs2232365 AG and rs3761548 AC genotype had a 1.20- and a 1.58-fold greater HBV risk than non-carriers patients, although they were not significant. Moreover, the AA genotypes of both polymorphisms in the males and females had an increased the persistent HBV risk, although this also was not statistically significant.Conclusions:In conclusion, the present study is the first report to demonstrate that these polymorphisms have no effect on the risk of chronic HBV infection. This results suggest that FOXP3 gene polymorphisms and FOXP3 expression should be evaluated together with frequency of regulatory T cells in HBV infection.
