Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is considered leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to examine the association of IL-6 and IL-10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms with the progression of chronic HCV (CHC) infection to cirrhosis and HCC. For comparative purposes, four groups were enrolled; chronic HCV group (CHC, n = 22), HCV-related liver cirrhosis group (HCV-LC, n = 22), HCV-related HCC group (HCV-HCC, n = 54), and an apparently healthy control group (controls, n = 48). HCC diagnosis and staging were in concordance to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system. IL-6 rs-1474347 and IL-10 rs-1800896 genotyping was performed by allelic (VIC- and FAM-labeled) discrimination method using assay-on-demand TaqMan real-time PCR assays. For IL-6 rs1474347, the AA genotype was more frequent in CHC, HCV-LC, and HCV-HCC compared to controls. Also, the IL-6 rs1474347 AC genotype was favorable for the progression of HCV chronic infection to cirrhosis and HCC. On the other hand, the IL-10 rs1800896 TT genotype was found to be prominent in the HCC group. Additionally, the IL-10 rs180096 TT genotype was favorable for the progression of chronic HCV infection to cirrhosis and HCC. Furthermore, higher levels of AFP were observed in HCC patients with IL-6 rs1474347 AA genotype and HCC patients with IL-10 rs1800896 CC and TT genotypes. Screening for IL-6 rs 1474347 AC genotype and IL-10 rs180096 TT genotype as well as the determination of AFP level showed to be good markers for examining the susceptibility of HCV Egyptian patients to develop cirrhosis and HCC.
