Purpose:To study the comparative performance of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and contrast-enhanced CT or MRI (CECT/MR) in evaluating liver lesions using the LI-RADS guidelines.Methods:Retrospective analysis of radiology database from July 2010 to April 2017 revealed 228 patients who had CECT/MR and CEUS. Patients at risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), had contemporaneous CEUS and CECT/CEMR studies within 3 months and adequate follow up were included; reviewed (2 reviewers) and graded according to the 2017 CEUS and 2018 CECT/MR LI-RADS guidelines. Reference standard was multidisciplinary clinical decisions, histology or follow-up imaging.Results:The study cohort consisted of 45 patients with 46 lesions. HCC were significantly larger than non-malignant (mean sizes of 2.5 and 1.4 cm, respectively, pConclusion:CEUS is useful for reassessment of lesions with intermediate probability (LR-3) or probable for HCC (LR-4) on CECT/MR. Lesions upgraded by CEUS tend to be HCC. Lesions that remain LR-3 on CEUS tend to be non-malignant.
