Glycogen storage disease type IX (GSD IX) is caused by a deficiency of hepatic phosphorylase kinase. The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical features, long term outcomes, and genetic analysis of GSD IX in Korea. A GSD gene panel was created and hybridization capture-based next-generation sequencing was performed. We investigated clinical laboratory data, results of molecular genetic analysis, liver biopsy findings, and long-term outcomes. Ten children were diagnosed with GSD IX at Seoul National University Children's Hospital. Hypoglycemia, hyperlactacidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia, liver fibrosis on liver biopsy, and short stature was found in 30%, 56%, 100%, 60%, 80% and 50% of the children, respectively. Seven PHKA2 variants were identified in eight children with GSD IXa-one nonsense (c.2268dupT; p.(Asp757Ter)), two splicing (c.918+1G > A, c.718-2A > G), one frameshift (c.405_419delinsTCCTGGCC; p.(Asp136ProfsTer11)), and three missense variants (c.3628G > A; p.(Gly1210Arg), c.1245G > T and c.2746C > T; p.(Arg916Trp)). Two variants of PHKG2 were identified in two children with GSD IXc-one frameshift (c.783delC; p.(Ser262AlafsTer6)) and one missense (c.661G > A; p.(Val221Met)). Elevated liver enzymes and hypertriglyceridemia in children with GSD IXa tended to improve with age. For the first time, we report hepatocellular carcinoma in a patient with GSD IXc. The GSD gene panel is a useful diagnostic tool to confirm GSD IX. The clinical phenotype of GSD IXc is severe and monitoring for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma should be implemented.
