Background:Microvascular invasion has been widely accepted as a major risk factor of hepatocellular carcinoma prognoses after surgery. It is still controversial whether postoperative adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization could improve the survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients with microvascular invasion.Purpose:To evaluate the effect of postoperative adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization for postoperative hepatocellular carcinoma patients with microvascular invasion.Material and methods:PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases were searched for eligible studies, and the one-, three-, and five-year recurrence rates and overall survival rates were extracted for meta-analysis.Results:A total of eight studies were included in this study. The results showed that the one-, three-, and five-year recurrence rate of the postoperative adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization group were better than those of the hepatectomy alone group, with a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-0.75, P < 0.00001), 0.82 (95% CI 0.76-0.88, P < 0.00001), and 0.89 (95% CI 0.82-0.97, P = 0.007), respectively. The overall survival rates with one-, three-, and five-year pooled RR were 0.34 (95% CI 0.25-0.47, P < 0.00001), 0.69 (95% CI 0.60-0.79, P < 0.00001), and 0.78 (95% CI 0.69-0.89, P = 0.0001), respectively. No serious side effects have been reported, indicating that postoperative intervention is safe.Conclusion:For hepatocellular carcinoma patients with microvascular invasion confirmed by postoperative pathology, postoperative adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization is a safe treatment, which could reduce the tumor recurrence rate and improve the patient's overall survival.
