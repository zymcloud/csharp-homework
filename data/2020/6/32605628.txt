Background:To explore the clinical value of texture analysis of MR images (multiphase Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and T2 weighted imaging (T2WI) to identify the differentiated degree of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Method:One hundred four participants were enrolled in this retrospective study. Each participant performed preoperative Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR scanning. Texture features were analyzed by MaZda, and B11 program was used for data analysis and classification. The diagnosis efficiencies of texture features and conventional imaging features in identifying the differentiated degree of HCC were assessed by receiver operating characteristic analysis. The relationship between texture features and differentiated degree of HCC was evaluated by Spearman's correlation coefficient.Results:The grey-level co-occurrence matrix -based texture features were most frequently extracted and the nonlinear discriminant analysis was excellent with the misclassification rate ranging from 3.33 to 14.93%. The area under the curve (AUC) of the combined texture features between poorly- and well-differentiated HCC, poorly- and moderately-differentiated HCC, moderately- and well-differentiated HCC was 0.812, 0.879 and 0.808 respectively, while the AUC of tumor size was 0.649, 0.660 and 0.517 respectively. The tumor size was significantly different between poorly- and moderately-HCC (p = 0.014). The COMBINE AUC values were not increased with tumor size combined.Conclusions:Texture analysis of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and T2WI was valuable and might be a promising method in identifying the differentiated degree of HCC. The poorly-differentiated HCC was more heterogeneous than well- and moderately-differentiated HCC.
