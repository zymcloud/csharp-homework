Background:Hepatic adrenal ectopia is a common clinical diagnosis, whereas adrenal tumors developed from hepatic adrenal ectopia are rare. Hepatic adrenal tumors are easily misdiagnosed as hepatic carcinoma and frequently treated by unnecessary operations.Case presentation:A 50-year-old female patient was hospitalized due to B-ultrasonic detection of "right focal liver lesions." After hospitalization, enhanced CT examination was performed. A 2.2 cm × 1.8 cm tumor was found in the seventh section of the right liver, as indicated by obvious enhancement of the arterial phase and low density during the portal vein and delay stages. Enhanced MRI examination detected a 2.0 cm × 1.8 cm tumor on the right liver, which was considered a "primary hepatic carcinoma". The patient was treated by open hepatectomy and recovered well after the operation. The postoperative pathological diagnosis was hepatic adrenal adenoma. No relapse was observed through the 1-year follow-up visit.Conclusions:According to imaging manifestations, pathological immunohistochemical treatment, alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and clinical features, hepatic adrenal tumors should be considered in the diagnosis of hepatic carcinoma to prevent misdiagnosis. Hepatic adrenal tumors should be ruled out during the diagnosis to avoid unnecessary operation.
