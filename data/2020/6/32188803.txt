Objective The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of a serum screening system for predicting the risk of gastric cancer. Methods Serum pepsinogen I (PG I)/pepsinogen II (PG II) and Helicobacter pylori (HP) antibody levels were measured. Subjects were classified into four groupsaccording to their serological status (the ABC classification system). The grade of atrophic gastritis was assessed endoscopically. We evaluated gastric cancer detection rates according to the ABC classification system and the endoscopic grade of atrophy. Patients Individuals who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in a health check were prospectively enrolled in the present study. Results According to the ABC classification system, the gastric cancer detection rates in groups A, B, C, and D were 0.07% (4/6,105), 0.5% (8/1,739), 0.8% (16/2,010), and 1.1% (3/281), respectively. The gastric cancer detection rates in subjects with no atrophy, closed type (C-type) atrophy, and open type (O-type) atrophy were 0% (0/4,567), 0.2% (4/2,581), and 0.9% (27/2,987), respectively. In group A (HP(-)/PG(-)), the proportions of subjects with no atrophy, C-type atrophy, and O-type atrophy were 71.2%, 22.8%, and 6.0%, respectively. In group A, the gastric cancer detection rates in subjects with no atrophy, C-type atrophy, and O-type atrophy were 0%, 0.07%, and 0.8%, respectively. Conclusion The ABC classification system is useful for predicting the risk of gastric cancer. However, this system was limited in group A, which included individuals with a high risk of developing gastric cancer. An endoscopic diagnosis of atrophy may be more effective than the ABC classification system for predicting the risk of gastric cancer.
