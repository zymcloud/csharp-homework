Presarcopenia is a prognostic factor in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The Japan integrated staging (JIS) score is a prognostic method that combines the Child-Turcotte-Pugh classification and the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging for HCC. We investigated the relationship between presarcopenia, the JIS score, and prognosis in patients with primary HCC. This retrospective study included 153 patients with primary HCC who were hospitalized from October 2011 to March 2018 at Municipal Hospital of Kofu. The skeletal muscle mass was measured using simplified psoas muscle mass index (PMI) based on CT imaging, and PMI using the volume analyzer SYNAPSE VINCENT ver3.0. We diagnosed presarcopenia based on the cut off value according to the assessment criteria for sarcopenia in liver disease defined by the Japan Society of Hepatology. Forty-three patients (28%) were diagnosed with presarcopenia. The median event-free survival was significantly worse in patients with presarcopenia than those without presarcopenia (P = 0.016). In multivariate analysis, presence of presarcopenia, JIS score ≥3, alpha-fetoprotein ≥200 ng/ml, and prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence-II ≥ 200 mAU/ml were significant prognostic factors. Among the patients with JIS scores ≥3, there was no difference in the event occurrence rate with presence of presarcopenia (P = 0.96). Among the patients with JIS scores ≤2, the median event-free-survival was significantly shorter in those with presarcopenia than those without presarcopenia (P = 0.045). Presarcopenia was an independent prognostic factor in patients with primary HCC. In patients with JIS scores ≤2, the median event-free survival was significantly shorter in those with presarcopenia compared to those without presarcopenia. In the patients with JIS scores ≥3, there was no difference in the event occurrence rates in those with and without presarcopenia.
