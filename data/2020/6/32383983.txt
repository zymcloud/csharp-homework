Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the human digestive system, and has been recognized as a serious threat to public health worldwide. This study explored the role of chondroitin polymerizing factor (CHPF) in the development and metastasis of HCC. Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed to detect CHPF expression in HCC tissues and para-carcinoma tissues. qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis were used to determine the mRNA and protein expression of CHPF. MTT assays, colony formation assays, and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell apoptosis, respectively. Wound-healing and Transwell assays were performed to evaluate cell migration. The results show that CHPF was not only up-regulated in HCC tissues compared with para-carcinoma tissues, but was also related with more advanced stages of HCC. Further studies revealed that CHPF knockdown significantly inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, and induce cell apoptosis of HCC cells. Moreover, suppressing the expression of CHPF reduced the migration and invasiveness of HCC cells. In conclusion, we demonstrated that CHPF plays important roles in the development and progression of HCC, and high expression levels of HCC may be related with poorer prognosis. The results from this study may provide a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment.
