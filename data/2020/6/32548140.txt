In colorectal cancer (CRC), liver metastasis remains a major contributor to the cause of cancer-related death. Putative biomarkers, therapeutic efficacy, and drug insensitivity still pose clinical challenges for metastatic CRC patients. Interestingly, previous studies indicated that tumor cells in CRC did not metastasize to the injured liver, which included hepatitis or cirrhotic liver. The benefits of antiviral therapy on hepatocellular carcinoma have also been identified. This review discusses the role of antiviral therapy on the liver. Antiviral therapy may reduce potential liver metastasis associated with CRC in several mechanistic aspects.
