Purpose:To assess feasibility, safety, and clinical outcome of simultaneous stereotactic radiofrequency (RF) ablation of multiple (≥ 4) primary and metastatic liver tumors.Materials and methods:This retrospective observational study included 92 patients (29 women, 62 men), 35 with ≥ 4 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and 57 with ≥ 4 metastatic liver tumors at initial stereotactic RF ablation between 2005 and 2018. The median size of 178 HCCs and 371 metastases was 2.2 cm (range, 1.0-8.5 cm) and 3.0 cm (range, 0.5-13 cm), respectively. At initial stereotactic RF ablation, 17 (48.6%) patients with HCC and 19 (33.3%) with metastases had 4 liver tumors, 11 (31.4%) and 19 (33.3%) had 5 tumors, and 7 (20%) and 19 (33.3%) had ≥ 6 tumors.Results:Major complications occurred in 2 of 35 ablations (5.4%) in patients with HCCs and in 7 of 63 (10%) with metastases. The primary technical efficacy rate (ie, successful initial ablation) was 100% (178/178) in HCCs and 98.8% (363/371) in metastases. Local recurrence was observed in 4 of 178 (2.2%) HCCs and in 17 of 371 (4.6%) metastases. Overall survival (OS) rates at 1, 3, and 5 years from the date of the first stereotactic RF ablation were 88.0%, 54.0%, and 30.4% for patients with HCCs with a median OS of 38.2 months and 86.1%, 53.1%, and 37.3% for patients with metastases with a median OS of 37.4 months.Conclusions:Stereotactic RF ablation is a feasible, safe, and efficacious option in simultaneous management of multiple primary and metastatic liver tumors.
