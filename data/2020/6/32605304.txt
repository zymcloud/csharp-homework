The tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib is the first-line treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in which hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may often coexist. Protein transporters like organic cation (OCT) and multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) are involved in the response to sorafenib, as well as in that to the anti-diabetic drug metformin or atorvastatin, used in hyperlipidemia. Changes in the activity of these transporters may lead to pharmacokinetic interactions, which are of clinical significance. The study aimed to assess the sorafenib-metformin and sorafenib-atorvastatin interactions in rats. The rats were divided into five groups (eight animals in each) that received sorafenib and atorvastatin (ISOR+AT), sorafenib and metformin (IISOR+MET), sorafenib (IIISOR), atorvastatin (IVAT), and metformin (VMET). Atorvastatin significantly increased the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of sorafenib by 134.4% (p < 0.0001) and 66.6% (p < 0.0001), respectively. Sorafenib, in turn, caused a significant increase in the AUC of atorvastatin by 94.0% (p = 0.0038) and its metabolites 2-hydroxy atorvastatin (p = 0.0239) and 4-hydroxy atorvastatin (p = 0.0002) by 55.3% and 209.4%, respectively. Metformin significantly decreased the AUC of sorafenib (p = 0.0065). The AUC ratio (IISOR+MET group/IIISOR group) for sorafenib was equal to 0.6. Sorafenib did not statistically significantly influence the exposure to metformin. The pharmacokinetic interactions observed in this study may be of clinical relevance in HCC patients with coexistent hyperlipidemia or T2DM.
