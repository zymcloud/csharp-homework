Aim of the study:Microwave ablation (MWA) for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a new promising modality. The prognosis after treatment is mainly linked to the recurrence. We aimed to investigate the predictive value of α-fetoprotein (AFP) score and Aurora B kinase (AURKB) in HCC recurrence after MWA.Material and methods:A cross-sectional study where 25 early-stage HCC patients (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer 0/A-B) were treated with MWA. Tumor biopsies were obtained just prior to MWA and assessed for WHO pathological grade and AURKB expression by immunohistochemistry. AFP score was calculated and a cut-off value of 2 classifies patients into high and low risk of recurrence. After achieving complete ablation, patients were followed every 3 months for 1 year by triphasic CT to detect recurrence.Results:Child-Pugh classification has no significant impact on prognosis of HCC after MWA (χ2 = 1.924, p = 0.165). Serum AFP level and AFP score can effectively predict the response to MWA among HCC patients (χ2 = 6.451, MC p = 0.031) (χ2 = 9.0, p = 0.003), respectively. AFP score was strongly associated with the pathological grade of the tumor (r = 0.467, p = 0.019). AURKB was over-expressed in tumoral more than non-tumoral specimens (p < 0.001). It was correlated with the size of the tumor, the number of tumor nodules and the pathological grade of the tumor (p < 0.05) but has no role in predicting recurrence after MWA (p = 0.869).Conclusions:AFP score but not AURKB can predict the risk of recurrence of HCC after MWA.
