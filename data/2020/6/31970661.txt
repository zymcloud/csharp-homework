Regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor affecting angiogenesis, oncogenesis, metastasis, and tumor immunity. As a systemic treatment, it has been shown to provide survival benefits in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients progressing on sorafenib treatment. We report herein a case of HCC with hepatic vein tumor thrombosis protruding into the inferior vena cava (IVC-HVTT) which was successfully treated by surgery following second-line chemotherapy with regorafenib. A 79-year-old man with chronic hepatitis was diagnosed with HCC. Computed tomography revealed a solitary tumor in segments 7 and 8 and an IVC-HVTT from the right hepatic vein. Since IVC-HVTT removal is a difficult procedure, the tumor was diagnosed as unresectable, and administration of sorafenib was started. Five weeks later, the lesion had increased in size by 15.3%; subsequently, regorafenib was given as second-line therapy for 12 months. After shrinkage of the IVC-HVTT, the patient was referred to our hospital for surgery. One month after the cessation of regorafenib, an extended resection of segment 8 and total removal of the IVC-HVTT was successfully performed without using total hepatic vascular exclusion. There were no serious postoperative complications. Additionally, there has been no recurrence for about 2 years since the initial therapy.
