Yes-associated protein (YAP) and its paralog, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), play pivotal roles in promoting the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the regulatory mechanism underpinning aberrant activation of YAP/TAZ in hepatocellular carcinoma remains unclear. In this study, we globally profiled the contribution of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) to both transcriptional activity and protein abundance of YAP/TAZ in hepatocellular carcinoma models and identified ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 (USP10) as a potent YAP/TAZ-activating DUB. Mechanistically, USP10 directly interacted with and stabilized YAP/TAZ by reverting their proteolytic ubiquitination. Depletion of USP10 enhanced polyubiquitination of YAP/TAZ, promoted their proteasomal degradation, and ultimately arrested the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. Expression levels of USP10 positively correlated with the abundance of YAP/TAZ in hepatocellular carcinoma patient samples as well as in N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN)-induced liver cancer mice models. Collectively, this study establishes the causal link between USP10 and hyperactivated YAP/TAZ in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and provides a rationale for potential therapeutic interventions in the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma harboring a high level of YAP/TAZ. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings identify USP10 as a DUB of YAP/TAZ and its role in hepatocellular carcinoma progression, which may serve as a potential therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.
