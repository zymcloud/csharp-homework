Sorafenib may provide survival benefits for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. However, tumor cells can display primary or secondary resistance to Sorafenib. To identify genes capable of conveying Sorafenib resistance, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR transcriptional activation library (SAM) in human Huh7 cells. We identified that a group of sgRNAs were significantly enriched in Sorafenib resistant Huh7 cells, which indicated that these sgRNAs up-regulated their target genes and induced resistance. We finally identified LRP8 as a key gene that can drive HCC cell to acquire sorafenib resistance. All three sgRNAs targeting LRP8 were identified in Sorafenib resistant Huh7 cells with high copy. We also showed that sorafenib-acquired resistant Huh7 cells have much higher LRP8 expression level than parental Huh7 cells. We proved that overexpression of LRP8 in HCC cell lines activated Î²-catenin and significantly promoted its resistance to Sorafenib. We further showed that overexpression of LRP8 reduced the apoptosis level of HCC cell lines. To summary, genome-scale CRISPR activation screening identifies a role of LRP8 in Sorafenib resistance in Hepatocellular carcinoma.
