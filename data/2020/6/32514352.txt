Background:Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells) therapy has been well recognized for treating B cell-derived malignancy. However, the efficacy of CAR-T cells against solid tumors remains dissatisfactory, partially due to the heterogeneity of solid tumors and T cell exhaustion in tumor microenvironment. PD-L1 is up-regulated in multiple solid tumors, resulting in T cell exhaustion upon binding to its receptor PD-1.Methods:Here, we designed a dominant-negative form of PD-1, dPD1z, a vector containing the extracellular and transmembrane regions of human PD-1, and a CAR vector against PD-L1, CARPD-L1z, a vector employs a high-affinity single-chain variable fragment (scFv) against human PD-L1. These two vectors shared the same intracellular structure, including 4-1BB and TLR2 co-stimulatory domains, and the CD3Î¶ signaling domain.Results:dPD1z T and CARPD-L1z T cells efficiently lysed PD-L1+ tumor cells and had enhanced cytokine secretion in vitro and suppressed the growth of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric cancer and hepatoma carcinoma in patient-derived xenograft (PDX). However, the combination of anti-mesothelin CAR-T cells (CARMSLNz T) with dPD1z T or CARPD-L1z T cells did not repress tumor growth synergistically in PDX, as CARMSLNz T cells upregulated PD-L1 expression upon activation and were subsequently attacked by dPD1z T or CARPD-L1z T cells.Conclusions:In conclusion, we demonstrate CAR-T cells targeting PD-L1 were effective for suppressing the growth of multiple types of solid tumors in PDX models though their safety needs to be carefully examined.
