MYB proto-oncogene-like 1 (MYBL1) has been reported to be a strong activator of transcription and plays an important role in the development of cancer. However, the precise biological function and molecular mechanism of MYBL1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells remain unclear. In the present study, we found that the expression of MYBL1 was markedly overexpressed in HCC cell lines and HCC samples, respectively. Moreover, MYBL1 expression positively correlated with tumor progression and inversely correlated with patient survival in 368 human HCC tissue samples. Overexpression of MYBL1 induced, whereas knockdown of MYBL1 reduced, HCC proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HCC patients with high MYBL1 expression had significantly shorter overall and poorer disease-free survival than those with low MYBL1 expression. MYBL1 transcriptionally upregulated TWIST1 expression by directly targeting the TWIST1 promoter. More importantly, the in vitro analysis was consistent with the significant correlation between MYBL1 and TWIST1 expression observed in a large cohort of human HCC specimens. Taken together, our results demonstrate that MYBL1 plays an important role in HCC growth and metastasis and reveal a plausible mechanism for upregulation of TWIST1 in HCC.
