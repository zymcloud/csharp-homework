Backgrounds and aims:To investigate the value of European Deprivation Index (EDI) and Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) characteristics and their relationships with outcome after liver transplantation.Methods:Patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) for HCC were included from a national database (from "Agence de la BiomÃ©decine" between 2006 and 2016. Characteristics of the patients were blindly extracted from the Database. Thus, EDI was calculated in 5 quintiles and prognosis factors of survival were determined according to a Cox model.Results:Among the 3865 included patients, 33.9% were in the 5 quintile (quintile 1, N= 562 (14.5%); quintile 2, N=647 (16.7%); quintile 3, N= 654 (16.9%); quintile 4, N= 688 (17.8%)). Patients in each quintile were comparable regarding HCC history, especially median size of HCC, number of nodules of HCC and AFP score. In the univariate analysis of the crude survival, having more than 2 nodules of HCC before LT and time on waiting-list were associated with a higher risk of death (pConclusion:EDI does not impact overall survival after LT for HCC. Number of HCC and time on waiting-list are independent prognostic factors of survival after LT for HCC.
