Background:Alcohol use is an important and potentially modifiable risk factor for gastrointestinal cancers. The more and the longer a person drinks, the higher the risk of cancer becomes. Even modest use of alcohol may increase cancer risk; 100 g of alcohol per week or less is currently considered to be the limit of low-risk use.Gastrointestinal cancer risk:Alcohol is causally associated with oesophageal squamous cell cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and most likely also with pancreatic cancer. Alcohol when combined with tobacco smoking or excess body weight can act synergistically to cause gastrointestinal cancer. Exposure to alcohol may have contributed to the recent incidence increases of early-onset gastrointestinal cancers in some Western countries.Conclusions:People with long-term risky alcohol use should be encouraged to join cancer screening programmes. Alcohol cessation appears to be effective in reducing the alcohol-induced, increased cancer risk.
