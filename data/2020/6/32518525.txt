Background:ZKSCAN3, a zinc-finger transcription factor containing KRAB and SCAN domains, has been reported to be regulated in several human cancers. However, its expression and function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown.Methods:Expression of ZKSCAN3 in HCC was analyzed by western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and real time PCR. Its correlation with the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of HCC patients was analyzed. The effects of ZKSCAN3 on the migration and invasion were determined by Transwell assays. The potential downstream targets of ZKSCAN3 and related molecular mechanisms were clarified by Western blot and dual luciferase reporter assay.Results:In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that ZKSCAN3 mRNA and protein was up-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. High ZKSCAN3 expression was significantly associated with poor prognostic features, including advanced TNM stage and vascular invasion. For 5-year survival, ZKSCAN3 served as a potential prognostic marker of HCC patients. Functionally, ZKSCAN3 promoted migration, invasion and EMT progress via directly binding to integrin Î²4 (ITGB4) promoter and enhanced its expression. Further investigation proved that ITGB4 triggers the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) to activate the AKT signaling pathway. Inactivation of FAK and AKT by their specific inhibitors respectively reversed the effects of ZKSCAN3 on HCC cells. In addition, we demonstrated that ZKSCAN3 expression was regulated by miR-124. In HCC tissues. MiR-124 has an inverse correlation with ZKSCAN3 expression.Conclusion:We demonstrate for the first time that ZKSCAN3 is overexpressed in HCC tissues and promotes migration, invasion and EMT process through ITGB4-dependent FAK/AKT activation, which was regulated by miR-124, suggesting the potential therapeutic value for HCC.
