Objective:To uncover the role of LINC01287 in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the indicated molecular mechanism.Patients and methods:Relative levels of LINC01287 and miR-559 in 32 pairs of HCC tissues and normal ones, as well as HCC cell lines were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and Kaplan-Meier curves were depicted for assessing the diagnostic and prognostic potentials of LINC01287 in HCC, respectively. Proliferative and migratory capacities in HCC cells influenced by LINC01287 were assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and transwell assay, respectively. The regulatory loop LINC01287/miR-559/TCF12 was ascertained by Dual-Luciferase reporter assay. The involvement of the regulatory loop in the progression of HCC was examined via rescue experiments.Results:LINC01287 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, whereas miR-559 was downregulated. LINC01287 displayed certain diagnostic and prognostic potentials in HCC. Knockdown of LINC01287 could inhibit proliferative and migratory capacities in HCC cells. The regulatory loop LINC01287/miR-559/TCF12 was responsible for the aggravation of HCC.Conclusions:LINC01287 drives proliferative and migratory capacities in HCC via targeting the miR-559/TCF12 axis.
