Liver diseases are one of the leading causes of mortality in the world, mainly caused by different etiological agents, alcohol consumption, viruses, drug intoxication, and malnutrition. The maturation of gene therapy has heralded new avenues for developing effective interventions for these diseases. Derived from a remarkable microbial defense system, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated proteins 9 system (CRISPR/Cas9 system) is driving innovative applications from basic biology to biotechnology and medicine. Recently, the mutagenic function of CRISPR/Cas9 system has been widely adopted for genome and disease research. In this review, we describe the development and applications of CRISPR/Cas9 system on liver diseases for research or translational applications, while highlighting challenges as well as future avenues for innovation.
