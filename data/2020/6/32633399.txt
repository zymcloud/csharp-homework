Objective:Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is the second most common primary hepatic malignancy after hepatocellular carcinoma. The current standard palliative treatment, chemotherapy regimen with gemcitabine and cisplatin, prolongs overall survival only of a few months. Established locoregional therapies are not a curative option or an alternative to surgery in the treatment of CCA. We report a case of a patient affected by a cholangiocellular carcinoma at hepatic hilum treated by Electrochemotherapy (ECT) at our oncologic center.Case presentation:A 71 years old male affected by a CCA at hepatic hilum was treated with ECT according to ESOPE guidelines. No complications occurred during ECT procedure. The patient was discharged after 10 days. The functional MR evaluation at 2 and at 4 months post-treatment showed a significant response without significant post-treatment adverse events. The Computed tomography (CT) assessment after 18 months did not show progression of disease.Conclusions:ECT is safe and its use could be suggested as a palliative treatment of advanced neoplastic lesions in which radical surgical treatment is not possible.
