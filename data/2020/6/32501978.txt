Background:In recent years, there has been considerable uncertainty about the optimal treatment option for very early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with tumor size less than 2 cm. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the outcomes of the different treatments.Methods:This study was designed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA). PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library were searched for calculating the survival rates, and the "time to event" method was used to compare the outcomes of liver resection (LR) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA). All studies focusing on the treatment of solitary HCC up to 2 cm by different techniques were included in our analysis. The Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) derived from multivariate and univariate analysis were utilized to assess the treatment risks.Results:We included 32 studies in our systematic review. The median 5-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival rate (RFS) for LR were 73% and 47%, respectively, and those for RFA were 73% and 43%, respectively. RFA was found to be associated with increased risk of mortality and recurrence compared to LR (HR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.35-1.92, P Conclusion:Our meta-analysis demonstrated that LR is superior to RFA in the treatment of solitary HCC up to 2 cm, with reduction in mortality and recurrence risk and improved long-term outcome.
