Background:Indocyanine green (ICG) opens up numerous possibilities for applications in hepatobiliary surgery, due to its exclusive hepatic excretion and its fluorescence properties in the near infrared (NIR) spectrum.Objective:Systematic review of the literature on the application of ICG imaging in open and laparoscopic liver surgery.Material and methods:Literature review and summary of the recent scientific original articles and reviews.Results:The ICG fluorescence imaging is increasingly being used in liver surgery. It allows real-time display of the segmental anatomy of the liver. Moreover, depending on the tumor entity, direct or indirect visualization of liver tumors and metastases is also possible. The detection of bile leaks might also be facilitated. Recent experiences in liver surgery have shown that ICG imaging enables a more sensitive intraoperative detection of additional foci and probably also a higher R0 resection rate; however, the application is mainly helpful for superficial lesions, since the depth of penetration of NIR is only 8-10 mm.Conclusion:Fluorescence staining using ICG is a valuable supplementary tool in modern liver surgery. It is particularly helpful in laparoscopic surgery where tactile control is eliminated and three-dimensional orientation is difficult. These disadvantages can be partially compensated by additional real-time imaging using ICG.
