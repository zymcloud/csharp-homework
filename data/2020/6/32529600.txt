Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are used in the clinic to provide life-saving therapies to patients with a variety of hematological malignancies and disorders. Yet, serious deficiencies in our understanding of how HSCs develop and self-renew continue to limit our ability to make this therapy safer and more broadly available to those who have no available donor. Finding ways to expand HSCs and develop alternate sources of HSCs is an urgent priority. In the embryo, a critical transition in development of the blood system requires that newly emergent HSCs from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region migrate to the fetal liver where they aggressively self-renew and expand to numbers sufficient to sustain the adult long term. This process of homing to the fetal liver is orchestrated by intrinsic regulators such as epigenetic modifications to the genome, expression of transcription factors, and adhesion molecule presentation, as well as sensing of extrinsic factors like chemokines, cytokines, and other molecules. Due to technical limitations in manipulating the fetal tissue microenvironment, mechanisms mediating the homing and expansion process remain incompletely understood. Importantly, HSC development is strictly dependent upon forces created by the flow of blood, and current experimental methods make the study of biophysical cues especially challenging. In the protocol presented herein, we address these limitations by designing a biomimetic ex vivo microfluidic model of the fetal liver that enables monitoring of HSC homing to and interaction with fetal liver niches under flow and matrix elasticity conditions typical during embryonic development. This model can be easily customized for the study of key microenvironmental factors and biophysical cues that support HSC homing and expansion.
