Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 loaded by vectors could induce high rates of specific site genome editing and correct disease-causing mutations. However, most monogenic genetic diseases such as hemophilia are caused by different mutations dispersed in one gene, instead of an accordant mutation. Vectors developed for correcting specific mutations may not be suited to different mutations at other positions. Site-specific gene addition provides an ideal solution for long-term, stable gene therapy. We have demonstrated SaCas9-mediated homology-directed factor IX (FIX) in situ targeting for sustained treatment of hemophilia B. In this study, we tested a more efficient dual adeno-associated virus (AAV) strategy with lower vector dose for liver-directed genome editing that enables CRISPR-Cas9-mediated site-specific integration of therapeutic transgene within the albumin gene, and we aimed to develop a more universal gene-targeting approach. We successfully achieved coagulation function in newborn and adult hemophilia B mice by a single injection of dual AAV vectors. FIX levels in treated mice persisted even after a two-thirds partial hepatectomy, indicating stable gene integration. Our results suggest that this CRISPR-Cas9-mediated site-specific gene integration in hepatocytes could transform into a common clinical therapeutic method for hemophilia B and other genetic diseases.
