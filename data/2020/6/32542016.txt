Tyrosine is mainly degraded in the liver by a series of enzymatic reactions. Abnormal expression of the tyrosine catabolic enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) has been reported in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Despite this, aberration in tyrosine metabolism has not been investigated in cancer development. In this work, we conduct comprehensive cross-platform study to obtain foundation for discoveries of potential therapeutics and preventative biomarkers of HCC. We explore data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), Oncomine and Kaplan Meier plotter (KM plotter) and performed integrated analyses to evaluate the clinical significance and prognostic values of the tyrosine catabolic genes in HCC. We find that five tyrosine catabolic enzymes are downregulated in HCC compared to normal liver at mRNA and protein level. Moreover, low expression of these enzymes correlates with poorer survival in patients with HCC. Notably, we identify pathways and upstream regulators that might involve in tyrosine catabolic reprogramming and further drive HCC development. In total, our results underscore tyrosine metabolism alteration in HCC and lay foundation for incorporating these pathway components in therapeutics and preventative strategies.
