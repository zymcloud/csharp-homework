A 59-year-old gentleman with a history of aortic valve replacement presented with spontaneously ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma in right lobe of a hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related chronic liver disease with hemoperitoneum. This acute emergency was managed by transarterial embolization. Right trisectionectomy with preservation of segment IVB after augmentation of future liver remnant by transarterial chemoembolization followed by portal vein embolization was subsequently performed. Sustained virological response to HCV was attained after surgery using sofosbuvir-based regimen. He had a delayed operative bed recurrence 1.5 years later with pulmonary metastatic disease which was managed by operative bed metastasectomy with mesh reconstruction of diaphragm and sorafenib. He is on sorafenib since past 3 years and doing well at 4.5-years follow-up since the first presentation, with significant regression of pulmonary disease and no other disease elsewhere, which highlights that where there is hope, there is a way.
