Zbtb7a is a transcription factor whose dysfunction is correlated to the development of several types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It generally acts as a repressor of transcription downregulating the expression of several target genes including oncosuppressors ARF and Rb. In this study, Zbtb7a was found to suppress the expression of miR-125a, an oncosuppressive miRNA that is often downregulated in HCC. This effect is mediated by the binding of the transcription factor to a regulatory sequence in the promoter of the transcription unit of miR-125a located 14 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Consistent with this observation, the analysis of 370 HCC samples showed an upregulation of Zbtb7a compared to 50 normal liver tissues and a reverse correlation with miR-125a expression. These data suggest that miR-125a may support the oncogenic potential of Zbtb7a.
