Background: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is limited by locoregional recurrence and/or residual tumors caused by incomplete ablation. Iodine-125 brachytherapy can achieve a high local control rate in solid carcinoma, but few studies have assessed the efficacy of this treatment for locoregional recurrence and/or residual HCC after RFA. Objective: To investigate the effectiveness and safety of iodine-125 brachytherapy for treating locoregional recurrence and/or residual HCC in patients treated with RFA. Methods: Eligible study patients were those with locoregional recurrence and/or residual HCC on abdominal imaging performed 1 month after RFA at this institution between February 2009 and September 2014 retrospectively. Patients were divided into either the control group (no treatment until the tumor progressed) or the treatment group (underwent iodine-125 brachytherapy). Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and complications of iodine-125 brachytherapy were evaluated. Results: A total of 42 patients were included in the final analysis, including 29 in the control group and 13 in the treatment group. A total of 457 iodine-125 particles were used (mean 32.8 Â± 21.3 mCi per case). The median follow-up time was 25 months. Median PFS was 9 months in the control group and 18 months in the treatment group (p = 0.026). The median OS was 28 months in the control group and 33 months in the treatment group (p = 0.441). There were no major complications observed in patients treated with iodine-125 brachytherapy. Conclusion: Iodine-125 brachytherapy can prolong PFS in patients with locoregional recurrence and/or residual HCC after RFA.
