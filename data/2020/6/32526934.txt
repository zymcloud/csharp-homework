1,2-naphthoquinone (1,2-NQ) and 1,4-naphthoquinone (1,4-NQ) are clinically promising biologically active chemicals that have been shown to stimulate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling pathway, but whether they are direct or indirect ligands or activate the AhR in a ligand-independent manner is unknown. Given the structural diversity of AhR ligands, multiple mechanisms of AhR activation of gene expression, and species differences in AhR ligand binding and response, we examined the ability of 1,2-NQ and 1,4-NQ to bind to and activate the mouse and human AhRs using a series of in vitro AhR-specific bioassays and in silico modeling techniques. Both NQs induced AhR-dependent gene expression in mouse and human hepatoma cells, but were more potent and efficacious in human cells. 1,2-NQ and 1,4-NQ stimulated AhR transformation and DNA binding in vitro and was inhibited by AhR antagonists. Ligand binding analysis confirmed the ability of 1,2-NQ and 1,4-NQ to competitively bind to the AhR ligand binding cavity and the molecular determinants for interactions were predicted by molecular modeling methods. NQs were shown to bind distinctly differently from that of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and differences were also observed between species. Mutation of amino acid residues (F289, M334, and M342) involved in critical NQ:AhR binding interactions, decreased NQ- and AhR-dependent gene expression, consistent with a role for these residues in binding and activation of the AhR by NQs. These studies provide insights into the molecular mechanism of action of NQs and contribute to the development of emerging NQ-based therapeutics.
