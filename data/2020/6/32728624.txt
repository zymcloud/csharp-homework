Aim of the study:Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) is a secreted protein which acts as an inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. DKK-1 was found to be a helpful biomarker for many cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is multifactorial in origin and its main etiology in Egypt is attributed to chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Objectives: To assess the serum level and diagnostic performance of DKK-1 and α-fetoprotein (AFP) in Egyptian patients with chronic HCV-related liver cirrhosis with and without HCC.Material and methods:80 subjects were divided into: a control group (group I, 20 healthy volunteers) and two patient groups: group II (HCV with liver cirrhosis, 30 patients), and group III, (HCV-related liver cirrhosis with HCC, 30 patients). Thorough physical examination, triphasic computed tomography, calculation of Child-Pugh score, laboratory investigations (complete blood picture, liver profile, hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-HCV antibodies, AFP (chemiluminometry) and DKK-1 (ELISA) were performed.Results:There was a significant decrease in DKK-1 level in HCV patients with liver cirrhosis (group II) and HCV patients with HCC (group III) compared to the control group (group I) (p < 0.001). However, there was a significant increase in DKK-1 level in HCV patients with HCC (group III) compared to HCV patients with liver cirrhosis (group II) (p < 0.033). The ROC curve showed that DKK-1 has less sensitivity but higher specificity in HCV patients with HCC (group III) compared with HCV patients with liver cirrhosis (group II).Conclusions:The combination of DKK-1 and AFP could further improve the diagnostic accuracy of HCV-related cirrhosis with or without HCC.
