Purpose:To perform an international survey on current practices in imaging-based surveillance, diagnosis, staging, and assessment of treatment response for HCC.Materials and methods:Three themes were covered in this international survey: demographics of respondents and liver imaging expertise; imaging practices for screening, surveillance, diagnosis, staging, and assessment of treatment response for HCC; and diagnostic imaging systems used. Descriptive summaries were created.Results:Of 151 respondents, 22.5% were from Asia, 6.0% from Europe, 19.9% from North America, 26.5% from South America, and 25.2% from Australasia; 57.0% respondents worked in academic and 34.4% in private or mixed settings. Non-contrast ultrasound was most commonly used for screening and surveillance of HCC (90.7%), and multiphase computed tomography was used for diagnosis (96.0%). Extracellular contrast agents (69.5%) were the most commonly used MRI contrast agents and Lumason/SonoVue (31.1%) is the most commonly used contrast-enhanced ultrasound contrast agent. A majority (94.0%) of respondents use ancillary imaging features for assessment of liver lesions in at-risk patients. Usage of diagnostic imaging systems for HCC varied by region. RECIST or mRECIST criteria were most commonly used for assessing HCC treatment response (48.3%). Most respondents agreed that a standardized classification for the diagnosis of HCC is needed (68.9%) and that an atlas and lexicon would help improve inter-reader agreement (71.5%).Conclusion:Practices and recommendations for imaging of HCC vary between geographical regions. Future efforts to develop a unified system should address regional differences and potential barriers for adoption of a standardized diagnostic system for HCC.
