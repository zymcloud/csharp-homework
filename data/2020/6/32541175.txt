A 64-year-old female presented to our hospital with a chronic cough. She was diagnosed with cStage â…¢A small cell lung cancer(cT2aN2M0, limited disease). On admission for chemoradiation therapy, laboratory data incidentally revealed liver dysfunction. Further examination resulted in the patient being diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis. Oral prednisolone therapy was started, and after the improvement of liver function tests, consecutive chemoradiation therapy with cisplatin and etoposide was administered. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with autoimmune hepatitis and small cell lung cancer. Autoimmune hepatitis might arise as a paraneoplastic syndrome.
