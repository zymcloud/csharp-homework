Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a primary tumor of the kidneys. It is characterized by the triad of flank pain, hematuria, and a palpable flank mass. However, most RCC patients present with a paraneoplastic manifestation of the disease. Stauffer's syndrome (a non-metastatic hepatic dysfunction) is a rare paraneoplastic manifestation associated with RCC. We report the case of a 30-year-old male, obese, who presented with hematuria and was found to have a right renal mass secondary to RCC. During his hospital stay, the patient developed acute hepatic dysfunction that resolved rapidly after tumor resection.
