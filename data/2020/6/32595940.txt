Hepatocellular carcinoma remains a deadly disease with poor prognosis in patients with unresectable cancer. Trans-arterial chemoembolization is the primary locoregional therapy for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma, with an estimated median overall survival of less than two years. For almost a decade, sorafenib has been the only standard systemic treatment for metastatic disease or tumors which progress or are considered unsuitable for locoregional therapy. Major breakthroughs have been made over the past few years in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma, especially in medical therapies for advanced disease. In this article, recent advances in intra-arterial therapy, multi-kinase inhibitors, and immunotherapy will be reviewed.
