The oxidative phosphorylation machinery in mitochondria, which generates the main bioenergy pool in cells, includes four enzyme complexes for electron transport and ATP synthase. Among them, the cytochrome c oxidase (COX), which constitutes the fourth complex, has been suggested as the major regulatory site. Recently, abnormalities in COX were linked to tumor progression in several cancers. However, it remains unclear whether COX and its subunits play a role in tumor progression of hepatoma. To search for the key regulatory factor(s) in COX for hepatoma development, in silico analysis using public transcriptomic database followed by validation for postoperative outcome associations using independent in-house patient cohorts was performed. In which, COX5B was highly expressed in hepatoma and associated with unfavorable postoperative prognosis. In addressing the role of COX5B in hepatoma, the loss- and gain-of-function experiments for COX5B were conducted. Consequently, COX5B expression was associated with increased hepatoma cell proliferation, migration and xenograft growth. Downstream effectors searched by cDNA microarray analysis identified UHMK1, an oncogenic protein, which manifested a positively correlated expression level of COX5B. The COX5B-mediated regulatory event on UHMK1 expression was subsequently demonstrated as bioenergetic alteration-dependent activation of AMPK in hepatoma cells. Phosphoproteomic analysis uncovered activation of ERK- and stathmin-mediated pathways downstream of UHMK1. Finally, comprehensive phenotypic assays supported the impacts of COX5B-UHMK1-ERK axis on hepatoma cell growth and migration.
