Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is a malignancy of the kidneys that most commonly metastasizes to lung, bone, lymph nodes, liver, adrenal glands, and brain. We present a 75-year-old man with severe and chronic gastrointestinal bleeding who was eventually discovered to have clear cell renal cell carcinoma metastatic to his jejunum as the source of his bleed. This is a rare phenomenon and an unusual cause of gastrointestinal bleeding.
