Purpose:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the prevalent risk factor for chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. The association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and HCV infection has not been studied effectively, particularly among different ethnic/racial groups in the US.Methods:A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2014). Unadjusted and adjusted associations were summarized using the prevalence ratio (PR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) after exploring possible interactions.Results:In the overall population, MetS was significantly associated with HCV infection with an interaction of age. After adjusting for all potential confounders, MetS was found to be significantly associated with HCV among non-obese and younger adults of age less than 60 years (PR 1.67, 95% CI 1.21-2.30, p = 0.002). MetS was also associated with an increased prevalence of HCV in each racial/ethnic group, while the association was strongly modified by age and obesity status of the subjects in different ethnic/racial groups.Conclusions:MetS or its components are associated with an increased prevalence of HCV in some sub-populations of all ethnic/racial groups in the US. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of MetS associated with HCV is important as MetS may have a role in HCV infection treatment outcomes.
