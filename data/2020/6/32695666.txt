Primary liver cancer [hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)] is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide, causing serious health threats because of its high morbidity and mortality, rapid growth, and strong invasiveness. Patients with HCC frequently develop resistance to the current chemotherapeutic drugs, and this is largely attributed to the high-level heterogeneity of the tumor tissue. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of master regulators for multiple physiological and pathological processes and play important roles in the tumorigenesis. More recent studies have indicated that miRNAs also play a non-negligible role in the development of drug resistance in liver cancer. In this review, we summarize the data from the latest studies on the mechanisms of drug resistance in liver cancer, including autophagy, membrane transporters, epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs), tumor microenvironment, and genes and proteins that are associated with apoptosis. The data herein will provide valuable information for the development of novel approaches to tackle drug resistance in the management of liver cancer.
