Abdominal wall transplant is developed in the context of intestinal and multivisceral transplant, in which it is often impossible to perform a primary wall closure. Despite the fact that abdominal wall closure is not as consequential in liver transplant, there are circumstances in which it might determine the success of the liver graft, especially in situations that compromise the abdominal cavity and facilitate an abdominal compartment syndrome. CASE 1: A 14-year-old girl suffering from cryptogenic cirrhosis with severe portal hypertension that causes ascites and severe malnutrition. Uneventful liver transplant, with a graft procured from a 14-year-old donor. At the time of wall closure it was decided to implant a nonvascularized fascia graft to supplement the right side of the transverse incision, with a 17 x 7 cm defect. This required reintervention after 4 months for biliary stricture. At that point, the wall graft was almost completely integrated into the native tissue. CASE 2: A 63-year-old man, transplanted for hepatitis C virus+ hepatocellular carcinoma+ nonocclusive portal thrombosis. Thirty-six hours after transplant the patient developed portal thrombosis. Thrombectomy and closure with biological mesh were performed. After 24 hours he was reoperated on for abdominal compartment syndrome and temporary closure with a Bogot√° bag. Six days later he underwent omentectomy, intestinal decompression, and left components separation, identifying a 25 x 20 cm defect. For definitive closure, a nonvascularized fascia graft procured from a different donor was used, accomplishing a reduction in intra-abdominal pressure. Nonvascularized fascia transplantation is an interesting alternative in liver transplant recipients with abdominal wall closure difficulties.
