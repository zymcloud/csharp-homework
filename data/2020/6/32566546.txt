Background:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may develop into liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to compare the clinical patterns and survival outcomes of NAFLD-related HCC patients and those of alcoholic liver disease (ALD)-related or hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients.Methods:A total of 622 HCC patients with associated NAFLD (n = 56), ALD (n = 173), or HBV infection (n = 393) were enrolled. The clinical characteristics and survival were analyzed according to the underlying liver diseases.Results:NAFLD-related HCC patients were more commonly older women and had more metabolic risk factors but were less likely to have cirrhosis and ascites, compared to ALD-related or HBV-related HCC patients. NAFLD-related HCC more often had an infiltrative pattern (P=0.047), a larger tumor (P=0.001), more macrovascular invasion (P=0.022), and exceeded the Milan criteria (P=0.001), but was less frequently diagnosed during tumor surveillance (P=0.025). Survival analysis did not show any difference among NAFLD-related, ALD-related, and HBV-related HCC patients. Furthermore, propensity score matching analysis did not reveal a significant difference in the median survival between the different groups (NAFLD vs. ALD, 14.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.0-26.0] vs. 13.0 months [95% CI, 0-26.3]; P=0.667, NAFLD vs. HBV, 14.0 months [95% CI, 2.0-26.0] vs. 12.0 months [95% CI, 4.3-17.8]; P=0.573).Conclusions:NAFLD-related HCCs were more often detected at an advanced stage with infiltrative patterns, although they showed no significant difference in survival compared to ALD-related or HBV-related HCCs. A future prospective research should be focused on identifying NAFLD patients who require strict surveillance in order to early detect and timely treat HCC.
