Increased expression of the small nucleolar RNA host gene 6 (SNHG6) has been reported in different cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer. The high expression level of SNHG6 is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. This paper provides an overview of recent studies on the oncogenic role and potential clinical utilities of SNHG6. Upregulated SNHG6 arrests tumor cell cycle and reduces apoptosis but promotes migration, invasion, metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and chemoresistance in tumors. Mechanically, SNHG6 primarily sponges tumor suppressor microRNA (miRNA), functioning as a competing endogenous RNA. Once sponged, miRNA is unable to degrade, silence, or hamper the translation of its downstream, mostly oncogenic genes, ultimately driving cancer-related processes. Thus, SNHG6 might serve as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
