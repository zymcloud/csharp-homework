As the leading cause of cancer-related death, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) threatens human health and limited treatments are available to cure the disease efficiently and effectively. The particularly immunotolerant environment of the liver lowers the efficacy of current therapies in patients with advanced HCC. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is gathering increasing interest due to the immunoregulatory properties of certain compounds. In advanced HCC, TCM can restore immunosurveillance to promote antitumor effects in several ways, including the upregulation of immunostimulatory factors and the downregulation of immunosuppressive factors. The characteristic multitarget regulation of TCM compounds may provide new insights regarding effective HCC immunotherapies. Here, we review the immunoregulatory potency of TCMs for treating HCC and explain how individual TCM drugs and complex formulas remodel the immune environment in various cell- and cytokine-dependent manners.
