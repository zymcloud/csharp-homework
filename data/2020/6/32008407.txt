Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the preferred treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but it lacks safe and effective embolic agents. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a broad-spectrum anticancer drug, but its clinical application is limited due to drug resistance and toxic side effects. Therefore, in this study, we developed a new liquid embolic agent with 5-FU as the model drug. We found that this liquid embolic agent possesses good gelling properties and embolic effects. An in vitro drug release model of the agent conformed to the Weibull model. Cumulative release of the drug over 7 d was âˆ¼90%, consisting of an initial burst followed by sustained release. Cytotoxicity testing showed that each liquid embolic composition is cytocompatible and only mildly cytotoxic. Pharmacokinetic experiments showed that the formulation significantly prolongs the t1/2 of 5-FU (approximately five times that of 5-FU solution) and 5-FU residence time in the body (approximately three times that of 5-FU solution). These results indicate that the liquid embolic agent has embolic capacity and could be used as a potential therapeutic method for TACE.
