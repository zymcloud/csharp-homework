The prognosis for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is extremely poor, mainly due to rapid progression and a paucity of effective drugs. Genome-wide analysis allows for potential drugs to be explored based on differentially expressed genes (DEGs). However, drug candidates and DEGs in HCC are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated DEGs and prognostication using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and immunohistochemical staining. Protein-protein interaction networks between DEGs were also analyzed to clarify 12 hub genes and query online databases for potential HCC therapeutic drugs. We found that 885 of 3219 DEGs from a TCGA dataset were associated with prognosis. We clarified 12 hub genes that were overexpressed in tumor samples and significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS) in HCC patients. These findings were validated using GEO and ICGC cohorts. Moreover, promising drug candidates targeted against HCC were predicted using online databases. Collectively, the upregulation of 12 hub genes was associated with poor prognosis for patients with HCC, and focusing on their expression may advance efforts towards targeted HCC therapies.
