Background:Noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis such as aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio (APRI) and transient elastography (TE) have largely replaced liver biopsy for staging hepatitis C virus (HCV). As there is little longitudinal data, we compared changes in these markers before and after sustained virologic response (SVR) in HIV-HCV coinfected patients.Methods:Participants from the Canadian Coinfection Cohort study who achieved SVR after a first treatment with either interferon/ribavirin or direct acting antivirals (DAAs), with at least one pre- and post-treatment fibrosis measure were selected. Changes in APRI or TE (DAA era only) were modelled using a generalised additive mixed model, assuming a gamma distribution and adjusting for sex, age at HCV acquisition, duration of HCV infection, and time-dependent BMI, binge drinking and detectable HIV RNA.Results:Of 1981 patients, 151 achieved SVR with interferon and 553 with DAAs; 94 and 382 met inclusion criteria, respectively. In the DAA era, APRI increased (0.03 units/year; 95% credible interval (CrI): -0.05, 0.12) before, declined dramatically during, and then changed minimally (-0.03 units/year; 95% CrI: -0.06, 0.01) after treatment. TE values, however, increased (0.74 kPa/year; 95% CrI: 0.36, 1.14) before treatment, changed little by the end of treatment, and then declined (-0.55 kPa/year; 95% CrI: -0.80, -0.31) after SVR.Conclusions:TE should be the preferred non-invasive tool for monitoring fibrosis regression following cure. Future studies should assess the risk of liver-related outcomes such as hepatocellular carcinoma according to trajectories of fibrosis regression measured using TE to determine if and when it will become safe to discontinue screening.
