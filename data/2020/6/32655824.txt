The gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase to platelet ratio (GPR) has been reported as a non-invasive parameter for evaluating hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. However, only a few of studies investigated the relationship between GPR and liver cancer. Here, we sought to clarify the prognostic value of GPR as well as its combination with fibrinogen in patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed a retrospective study using data collected from 302 HCC patients, and evaluated the association between GPR, fibrinogen and clinicopathological characteristics using the chi-square test. Additionally, we assessed disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test, then performed univariate and multivariate COX analyses to identify the prognostic factors. The prognostic performance of combined GPR and fibrinogen was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results showed that GPR was associated with gender, history of smoking and drinking, cirrhosis, antiviral treatments, tumor number, and Child-Pugh grade. Univariate analysis revealed a significant correlation between tumor diameter, vascular invasion, BCLC stage, alpha-fetal protein, GPR, fibrinogen, and NLR with both DFS and OS in HCC patients. Only GPR and fibrinogen were found to be independently associated with both DFS and OS according to multivariate analysis. Furthermore, predictive capacity was enhanced by combining GPR with fibrinogen owing to a larger area under the curve than other indexes or models. Overall, preoperative GPR could be an effective non-invasive predictor for prognosis of HBV-related HCC patients, and a combination of GPR and fibrinogen improved the prognostic performance.
