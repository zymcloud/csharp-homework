Background:Epidemiological studies investigating the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) on the risk of liver cancer and/or mortality among persons with chronic liver disease (CLD) have reported conflicting results. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the impact of PPI use on liver cancer and/or death among patients with CLD.Methods:The core databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane library were searched through January 2020. We included studies, evaluating the association between PPIs and liver cancer or mortality among patients with CLD including randomized controlled, nonrandomized controlled, and observational studies. We used inverse-variance random-effects models to estimate the pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for liver cancer or mortality.Results:Eleven studies including 173,894 patients were selected. In three studies, individuals with CLD who used PPIs had a 67% greater risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to nonusers (RR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.12-2.50; I2 = 92%). Combining data from the eight studies relating PPI to overall mortality, we observed a 57% increased risk of mortality in PPI users with CLD compared to CLD nonusers (RR: 1.57; 95% CI, 1.24-1.99; I2 = 69%).Conclusion:PPI use was associated with an increased risk of HCC and mortality in patients with CLD suggesting that PPI prescriptions in patients with CLD should be considered carefully.
