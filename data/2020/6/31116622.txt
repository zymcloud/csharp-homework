Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of simultaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined with laparoscopic splenectomy (Lap-Sp) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) complicated with cirrhosis and hypersplenism.Material and methods: Between January 2013 and June 2014, 42 patients with primary HCC complicated with cirrhosis and hypersplenism who underwent simultaneous RFA combined with Lap-Sp were enrolled at the Department of General Surgery, Beijing Di Tan Hospital. The median number of tumors ablated using RFA was one (range 1-3), and the median sum of the maximum diameter of tumors was 2.5 cm (range 1.2-5.4 cm). The related indicators before and after surgery, complications, and long-term effects were retrospectively analyzed.Results: The median operative time for 42 patients undergoing simultaneous RFA combined with Lap-Sp was 4.5 h (range 2.5-8.5 h), and the median blood loss was 120 mL (range 5-2200 mL). The incidence of moderate-to-severe postoperative complications and the perioperative mortality after surgery were 31.0 and 0%, respectively. The disease-free survival rate for one, three, and five years was 73.8, 19.7, and 16.4%, respectively. The overall survival rate was 90.5, 73.3, and 60.4%, respectively.Conclusion: Simultaneous RFA combined with Lap-Sp was safe and effective for patients with HCC complicated with cirrhosis and hypersplenism.
