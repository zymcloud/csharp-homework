Background:Trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is one first-line option therapy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not suitable for surgical resection.Aims:We evaluated the effects of sunitinib plus doxorubicin-TACE on bleeding or liver failure.Methods:Seventy-eight patients with HCC were included in this randomized, double-blind study. They received one to three TACE plus either sunitinib or placebo four weeks out of six for one year. The occurrence of severe bleeding or liver failure was assessed during the week after the TACE. The safety and survival outcomes were evaluated.Results:No bleeding complication was reported. One and two liver failures were respectively observed in sunitinib and placebo patients. Compliance to sunitinib treatment was acceptable. Sunitinib dose reduction occurred in 37% of patients due to acute toxicity. Main grade 3-4 toxicities were: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, increased bilirubin, increased ALT and asthenia. In the sunitinib group, the median PFS and OS were 9.05 [5.81;11.63] and 25.0 [13.5;36.8] months, respectively. In the placebo group, the median PFS and OS were 5.51 [4.14;7.79] and 20.5 [15.1;30.6] months, respectively.Conclusions:TACE plus sunitinib in the first-line therapy for patients with HCC not suitable for surgical resection was feasible.
