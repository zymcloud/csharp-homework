Background:A subset of patients have no risk factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We evaluated differences in clinical variables between patients with and without risk factors who underwent surgical resection.Methods:A prospectively maintained database was queried for patients who underwent R0/R1 resection of HCC between 1992 and 2016. Risk factors included HCV, HBV, hemochromatosis, alcoholic liver disease, or cirrhosis, stage 2 or 3 fibrosis or severe (>66%) steatosis of the non-neoplastic liver. Variables were compared between patients with and without risk factors.Results:There were 416 patients who underwent resection; 276 (66%) had known risk factors while 140 (34%) did not. Patients without risk factors were more likely to be older, female and have hyperlipidemia or coronary artery disease (p Conclusion:Patients without risk factors for HCC presented with larger tumors yet had similar outcomes, suggesting these tumors may represent a different disease process, and underlying liver dysfunction can influence overall outcome.
