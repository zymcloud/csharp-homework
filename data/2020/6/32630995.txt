Primary lung cancer commonly metastasizes to the brain, bones, liver, and adrenal glands. In some cases, bone metastasis serves as the first presenting sign of lung cancer with bone pain and headache, but it is not common. The incidence of skull metastasis in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is low, and there have been only a few cases of skull metastases serving as the first sign of malignancy with skull mass and epidural bleeding; however, no similar cases have been reported regarding that of hematoma. We report a case of an 84-year-old man who first presented with a simple forehead hematoma and was eventually diagnosed with SCC of the lung.
