Background:Matrine has been reported to exert anti-tumor effects in multiple types of cancers containing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the anti-tumor molecular mechanisms of matrine in HCC is still not fully revealed.Methods:Cell viability, apoptosis, cycle, migration and invasion were determined by Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), Flow cytometry and Transwell assays, respectively. Levels of all protein were analyzed by western blot analysis. The levels of circular RNA_0027345 (circ_0027345), microRNA-345-5p (miR-345-5p) and homeobox-containingD3 (HOXD3) were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The interaction between circ_0027345 and circ_0027345 was identified using dual-luciferase reporter assay. The mouse xenograft model was constructed to explore the effect of matrine on tumor growth in vivo.Results:Matrine suppressed cell growth, migration and invasion, while promoted apoptosis and autophagy in HCC cells. Matrine down-regulated the levels of circ_0027345 and HOXD3, and up-regulated miR-345-5p expression. Besides, circ_0027345 overexpression could reverse the inhibitory effect of matrine on cell progression. As the target gene of circ_0027345, miR-345-5p elevation counteracted the promotion effect of circ_0027345 overexpression on development of HCC cells. Moreover, miR-345-5p knockdown could facilitate cell growth, migration, invasion and repress cell apoptosis and autophagy by targeting HOXD3. Meanwhile, matrine restrained tumor growth of HCC by regulating circ_0027345/miR-345-5p/HOXD3 axis in vivo.Conclusion:Matrine inhibited cell development and tumorigenesis in HCC by increasing miR-345-5p and decreasing circ_0027345 and HOXD3.
