Objectives:This study aimed to analyze clinical and laboratory parameters and their association with long-term outcomes in patients who underwent liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment, according to the etiology of the underlying chronic liver disease, in order to identify predictors of response to this therapeutic modality.Methods:Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from a cohort of 134 patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment at a referral center in Brazil were retrospectively selected and compared according to the etiologic group of the underlying chronic liver disease. Events, defined as tumor recurrence or death from any cause, and event-free survival were also analyzed, and multivariate analysis was performed.Results:The etiologies comprised hepatitis C and B virus infection, alcohol abuse, and cryptogenic disorder. Although liver transplantation was performed outside the Milan criteria in 33.3% of the subjects, according to pathologic examination of the explanted liver, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score was low (Conclusion:Clinical and laboratory characteristics according to etiologic groups were not different, which might have led to comparable long-term outcomes among these patient groups and failure to identify predictors that could aid in better selection of subjects for liver transplantation in the management of this cancer.
