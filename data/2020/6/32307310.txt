Purpose:To determine predictors of survival after transarterial radioembolization of hepatic metastases from breast cancer.Materials and methods:Twenty-four patients with chemotherapy-refractory hepatic metastases from breast cancer who underwent radioembolization from 2013 to 2018 were evaluated based on various demographic and clinical factors before and after treatment. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank analysis was performed to determine predictors of prolonged OS from the time of first radioembolization and first hepatic metastasis diagnosis.Results:Median OS times were 35.4 and 48.6 months from first radioembolization and time of hepatic metastasis diagnosis, respectively. Radioembolization within 6 months of hepatic metastasis diagnosis was a positive predictor of survival from first radioembolization, with median OS of 38.9 months vs 22.1 months for others (P = .033). Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive status predicted prolonged survival (38.6 months for ER+ vs 5.4 months for ER-; P = .005). The presence of abdominal pain predicted poor median OS: 12.8 months vs 38.6 months for others (P < .001). The presence of ascites was also a negative predictor of OS (1.7 months vs 35.4 months for others; P = .037), as was treatment-related grade ≥ 2 toxicity at 3 months (5.4 months vs 38.6 months for others; P = .017).Conclusions:In patients with metastatic breast cancer, radioembolization within 6 months of hepatic metastasis diagnosis and ER+ status appear to be positive predictors of prolonged survival. Conversely, baseline abdominal pain, baseline ascites, and treatment-related grade ≥ 2 toxicity at 3 months after treatment appear to be negative predictors of OS.
