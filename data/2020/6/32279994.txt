Introduction:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been confirmed to play a crucial part in oncogenesis. Several studies suggested that MiR-3174 act as a tumor promoter in various Malignant neoplasm. However, the biological function of miR-3174 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) still highly unexplored.Methods:We screened differentially over-expressed miRNAs by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the GEO databases. The expression of miR-3174 in HCC cells and tissues was detected by qRT-PCR. The cellular behaviors of transfected cells were respectively examined by colony formation assays, EdU Assays and flow cytometry. Forkhead box O1 transcription factor (FOXO1) was predicted and confirmed as a direct target of miR-3174 by bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay.Results:MiR-3174 was up-regulated in HCC tissues and cells, and the expression level of it was highly associated with tumor size and Edmondson grade. Our study pioneering validates that upregulated miR-3174 promote cell proliferation and inhibit cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, our study verified that miR-3174 regulate Bim, P21, cyclin D1 and c-MYC expression by directly targeting FOXO1.Conclusion:The upregulated miR-3174 promote cell proliferation and inhibit cell apoptosis by downregulating FOXO1 expression in HCC. MiR-3174 may be a novel candidate for targeted delivery of miRNA therapeutics for HCC patients.
