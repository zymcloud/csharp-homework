Purpose:To evaluate safety and feasibility of improving radiation dose conformality via proximal radioembolization enabled by distal angiosomal truncation where selective administration was not practical.Materials and methods:Hepatic malignancies treated via angiosomal truncation between January 2017 and March 2019 were retrospectively evaluated. Thirty-three patients (8 women, 25 men; mean age, 62.2 y; range, 36-78 y) underwent 39 treatments. Of treatments, 74.3% (n = 29) were for hepatocellular carcinomas, 10.2% (n = 4) were for cholangiocarcinomas, and 15.4% (n = 6) were for metastatic tumors (1 colorectal adenocarcinoma, 1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 3 melanomas, and 1 endometroid carcinoma). Truncation was achieved using temporary embolic devices including a microvascular plug, detachable coil, gelatin slurry, and balloon microcatheter, after which proximal radioembolization was performed. Range of treatment activity was 0.47-5.75 GBq. Technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin and bremsstrahlung single photon emission computed tomography (CT)/CT threshold analysis was conducted to delineate and compare distribution of activity within the treatment angiosome before and after radioembolization.Results:Dosimetric analysis of 14 patients demonstrated a significant reduction in nontarget liver radiation exposure at 5, 20, and 40% thresholds (P = .002, P = .001, and P = .008, respectively). There were no grade 3 or higher adverse events. There was no significant change in Albumin-Bilirubin grade and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (P = .09 and P = .74) before and 3 months after the procedure. Truncated arteries were patent on subsequent angiography in 11 cases and on MR angiography or CT angiography in 38 of 39 cases.Conclusions:Proximal radioembolization enabled by distal angiosomal truncation is safe and decreases nontarget parenchymal radioembolization dose in cases not amenable to selective administration.
