Objective:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common cause of primary liver cancer. A major part of diagnostic HCC work-up is based on imaging findings from sonography, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) allows for the dynamic assessment of the microperfusion pattern of suspicious liver lesions. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of CEUS compared with CT scans for assessing HCC.Methods:We performed a retrospective, single-center study between 2004 and 2018 on 234 patients with suspicious liver lesions who underwent CEUS and CT examinations. All patients underwent native B-mode, color Doppler and CEUS after providing informed consent. Every CEUS examination was performed and interpreted by a single experienced radiologist (European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology level 3).Results:CEUS was performed on all included patients without occurrence of any adverse effects. CEUS showed a sensitivity of 94%, a specificity of 70%, a positive predictive value of 93% and a negative predictive value of 72% for analyzing HCC compared with CT as the diagnostic gold standard.Conclusions:CEUS has an excellent safety profile and shows a high diagnostic accuracy in assessing HCC compared with corresponding results from CT scans.
