The study of toxicities induced by sorafenib, as well as the identification of possible mechanisms and biomarkers of these toxicities, is important to improve the treatment and quality of life of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. This study focused on toxicities, cellular oxidative stress, adherence, and quality of life of 11 patients with HCC treated with sorafenib. Dermatotoxicity, myelotoxicity, gastro toxicity, nephrotoxicity, pain, and fatigue were investigated. For oxidative stress analysis, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and mitochondrial superoxide anion production was measured using MitoSOX Red test. Medication adherence was evaluated based on Morisky-Green and MedTake tests. Quality of life assessment was performed using EORTC QLQ C-30 and QLQ HCC18 questionnaires. The results showed that hand-foot syndrome (45.5%), thrombocytopenia (45.5%), diarrhea (54.5%), pain (54.5%), and fatigue (36.4%) were the most prevalent toxicities. A non-statistically significant change in the levels of superoxide anion was observed after the sorafenib treatment (Wilcoxon test, P = 0.4131). Moreover, 81.8% of patients had high adherence, 100% knew the correct indication of sorafenib, 81.8% knew the correct intake and drug regimen, and 36.4% knew the correct dose of antineoplastic. There was a significant worsening in the emotional and pain domains of quality of life after the sorafenib (Wilcoxon test, P = 0.0313 and P = 0.0313, respectively). A production of superoxide anion was not correlated with toxicities (Spearman's correlation and Mann-Whitney U tests, P > 0.05). This study suggests that oxidative stress might not be the mechanism of sorafenib toxicities.
