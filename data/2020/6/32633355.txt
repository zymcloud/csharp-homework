Objective:The aim of this study was to explore the expression manuals of microRNA-593 (miR-593) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to investigate its role in mediating the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells.Patients and methods:Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect miR-593 expression in HCC tissues and cells. HCC cells were, then, transfected with miR-593 mimic to exogenously overexpress miR-593. Cell counting kit 8 (CCK8) assay was exploited to detect the proliferation ability of HCC cells. In addition, wound healing assay and transwell assay were adopted to determine the migration and invasion abilities of HCC cells, respectively.Results:MiR-593 was abnormally down-expressed in HCC tissues and cells. Up-regulation of miR-593 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells.Conclusions:MiR-593 acted as a tumor suppressor gene in the development of HCC. Hence, we proposed that miR-593 might be a new potential therapeutic target marker for HCC treatment.
