Background:Clinical trials based on FGFR mutation or amplification as a druggable target of FGFR inhibitors have produced disappointing clinical outcomes. Therefore, the identification of predictive biomarkers for FGFR-targeted agents has remained a crucial issue.Methods:Expression profiles of FGFs and FGFRs in 8,111 patients with 24 types of solid tumors and 879 tumor cell lines along with drug sensitivity data were obtained and followed by integrative bioinformatics analysis.Results:FGFs and FGFRs were frequently dysregulated in pancancer. Most of the expression of FGFs and FGFRs were significantly associated with overall survival in at least two cancer types. Moreover, tumor cell lines with high FGFR1/3 expression were more sensitive to FGFR inhibitor PD173074, especially in breast, liver, lung and ovarian cancer. The predicted positive ratios of FGFR1-4 were generally over 10% in most tumor types, especially in squamous cell carcinoma. High positive FGFR1 or 3 expression ratios were predicted in cholangiocarcinoma (58%), followed by bladder cancer (42%), endometrial carcinoma (35%), and ovarian cancer (34%).Conclusions:FGFR expression was a promising predictive biomarker for FGFR inhibition response in clinical trials, and different combinations of FGFR genes should be used in screening for patients in certain tumor types.
