Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Studies have shown that the tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) plays an important role in the development of HCC; however, the association between genetic variations of TNF-α and HCC is not yet fully understood. To evaluate the correlation of TNF-α polymorphisms with HCC, we randomly selected 327 HCC patients and 432 healthy controls, all these subjects reported Han nationality. Genotyping of four TNF-α SNPs (rs1799724, rs1800629, rs1799964 and rs1800610) was performed using the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) method. Distributions of rs1799964 genotypes and rs1800610 alleles were found to be significantly different between cases and controls (p = .011, p = .001). The recessive model of rs1799964 significantly increased HCC risk (p = .0015), while the dominant and over-dominant models of rs1800610 significantly reduced HCC risk (p = .0096, p = .014). Haplotype analysis of the four TNF-α SNPs revealed that the TGTA haplotype was associated with a reduced HCC risk (p = .0033, OR = 0.53), while the TGTG haplotype was associated with an increased HCC risk (p = .0032, OR = 9.69). These findings indicated that specific TNF-α polymorphisms may be associated with the susceptibility to HCC.
