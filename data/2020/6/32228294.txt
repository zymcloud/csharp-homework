Background The recently described "macrotrabecular-massive" (MTM) histologic subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (MTM-HCC) represents an aggressive form of HCC and is associated with poor survival. Purpose To investigate whether preoperative MRI can help identify MTM-HCCs in patients with HCC. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients with HCC treated with surgical resection between January 2008 and February 2018 and who underwent preoperative multiphase contrast material-enhanced MRI. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-penalized and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify clinical, biologic, and imaging features associated with the MTM-HCC subtype. Early recurrence (within 2 years) and overall recurrence were evaluated by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of early and overall recurrence. Results One hundred fifty-two patients (median age, 64 years; interquartile range, 56-72 years; 126 men) with 152 HCCs were evaluated. Twenty-six of the 152 HCCs (17%) were MTM-HCCs. LASSO-penalized logistic regression analysis identified substantial necrosis, high serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) level (>100 ng/mL), and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B or C as independent features associated with MTM-HCCs. At multivariable analysis, substantial necrosis (odds ratio = 32; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.9, 114; P < .001), high serum AFP level (odds ratio = 4.4; 95% CI = 1.3, 16; P = .02), and BCLC stage B or C (odds ratio = 4.2; 95% CI = 1.2, 15; P = .03) were independent predictors of MTM-HCC subtype. Substantial necrosis helped identify 65% (17 of 26; 95% CI: 44%, 83%) of MTM-HCCs (sensitivity) with a specificity of 93% (117 of 126; 95% CI: 87%, 97%). In adjusted models, only the presence of satellite nodules was independently associated with both early (hazard ratio = 3.7; 95% CI: 1.5, 9.4; P = .006) and overall (hazard ratio = 3.0; 95% CI: 1.3, 7.2; P = .01) tumor recurrence. Conclusion At multiphase contrast-enhanced MRI, substantial necrosis helped identify macrotrabecular-massive hepatocellular carcinoma subtype with high specificity. © RSNA, 2020.
