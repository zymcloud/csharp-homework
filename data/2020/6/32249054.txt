Introduction:Routinely, pediatric donor (PD) grafts are allocated to pediatric liver transplantation (LT) recipients; however, occasionally they can be allocated for adult recipients (ARs). Some authors reported decreased patient/graft survival and higher vascular complications, such as hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT), in LT in ARs using PDs.Methods:It is a retrospective study enrolling 1202 ARs undergoing LT using whole liver grafts during the period of January 2002 to April 2019. The patients were categorized according to donor age in 2 groups: PDs and adult donors (ADs). The variables were collected from the database including the graft to recipient weight ratio (GWRW) and the incidence of HAT and graft primary nonfunction (PNF).Results:The AD group had 1152 patients, and the PD group had 50 patients. PNF occurred in 68 (5.66%) patients, and the distribution between the 2 groups were similar: 65 (5.64%) in the AD group, and 3 (6%) in the PD group (P = .915). HAT was diagnosed in 30 (2.6%) patients in the AD group and in 6 (12%) patients in the PD group. HAT was significantly higher in the PD group (P = .001). In the PD group, the GWRWs among patients diagnosed with HAT were similar (P = .152).Conclusion:HAT is higher in PDs, although it is a viable alternative with satisfactory results. Serial Doppler in the first week and early introduction of platelet antiaggregants and/or anticoagulants may be beneficial, albeit it is not clear if it could reduce the incidence of HAT.
