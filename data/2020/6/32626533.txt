Background: Primary Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC), a malignant gynecologic disease, is considered one of the leading causes of mortality in women. The development of Liver Metastases (LM) in women with primary ovarian cancer commonly results in a poorer prognosis. This retrospective population-based study aims to measure the prevalence, prognostic factors, and associated risk factors for epithelial ovarian cancer patients with liver metastases (EOCLM). Materials and Methods: The current study cohort of patients based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database identified with primary ovarian cancer between the years 2010 and 2016. A chi-square test was employed to compare Metastatic differences among demographic and clinical factors. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis models were used to predict related prognostic factors for LM development. 7-year Kaplan-Meier curves were applied to compare the survival patterns of patients with and without LM. The Multivariable Cox regression model was used to estimate potential risk factors associated with LM related deaths. Results: 33895 eligible primary EOC patients were identified. Among them 2635 (7.77%) patients were initially diagnosed with de novo LM, and 31260 (92.23%) without metastases disease to any site. Non-serous histology type; Malignant Brenner Carcinoma, NOS (OR 1.94; CI: 1.39-2.71; P<0.001), T3/T1 stage (OR 5.65; CI: 3.87-8.24; P<0.001), N1/N0 stage (OR 1.67; CI: 1.43-4.95; P<0.001), grade; G3/G1 (OR 2.16; CI: 1.29-3.59, P<0.001), and cancer antigen-125; Elevated/Normal (OR 1.79; CI: 1.19-2.69, P<0.001) were significantly associated with LM occurrence. The median survival of EOC patients with LM was 12.0 (95% CI: 11.0-14.0; P<0.001) months. Multivariable cox regression showed being unmarried (HR 1.16; CI: 1.04-1.30; P=0.001), non-serous histology types, Mucinous (HR 2.38; CI: 1.82-3.12; P<0.001), Clear cell (HR 1.83; CI: 1.32-2.55; P<0.001), Malignant Brenner Carcinoma, NOS (HR 1.44; CI:1.23-1.66; P<0.001), Carcinosarcoma NOS, (HR 1.44; CI: 1.11-1.88; P<0.001) and radiotherapy (HR 1.52; CI: 1.12-2.06; P<0.001), were positively related to death. Chemotherapy (HR 0.30; CI: 1.12-2.06; P<0.001) and surgery (HR 0.34; CI: 0.29-0.39; P<0.001) were related with reduced rate of death. Conclusion: The retrospective cohort study showed that women with primary EOC had some high-risk factors associated with LM. LM can intensely decrease the survival of EOC patients. The findings of our research provided estimates for LM occurrence prediction and potential prognostic factors of EOC with de novo LM development. These findings can be useful for follow-up strategies, guidelines for screening, and treatment of EOCLM.
