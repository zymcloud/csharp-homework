Real-world results of nivolumab monotherapy against HCC are lacking in the hepatitis B virus (HBV)-endemic, Asia-Pacific regions. Moreover, heterogeneous responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors have rarely been described in advanced HCC. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab monotherapy in a real-world setting in 33 Korean patients with unresectable HCC. In our cohort, twenty-nine patients (88%) showed HBsAg positivity. At the time of nivolumab initiation, 4 among 33 patients (12%) were classified as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC)-B stage and 29 (88%) as BCLC-C stage, respectively. Prior sorafenib treatment was given to 31 (94%) patients, and 13 (39%) received prior regorafenib treatment. For the liver reserve, patients were classified as Child-Pugh class A (79%) and B (21%), respectively. Grade 3 toxicities occurred in one patient, who developed pneumonitis after 5 cycles of nivolumab treatment. Best overall responses were complete response in 2 patients out of the 33 enrolled patients (6%), partial response in 4 patients (12%) and stable disease in 4 patients (12%). With 29 patients having images for the response evaluation, the objective response rate was 21.4%. The median overall survival (OS) of the cohort was 26.4 weeks (range 2.3-175.1). Achieving objective responses, pre-treatment small tumors (maximal diameter
