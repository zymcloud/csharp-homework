A 56-year-old man presented with an 11-cm hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at segment 7 of liver. To induce left liver hypertrophy, a sequential transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and portal vein embolization before right hepatectomy were adopted. However, the tumor further increased in size despite TACE and invaded through the diaphragm to the right lung base. Anterior approach right hepatectomy with en bloc wedge resection of the involved right lower lobe of lung by endovascular staplers via transdiaphragmatic approach was performed. The diaphragmatic defect was closed with Goretex mesh. Patient made an uneventful recovery. Pathology confirmed a 12.5 cm poorly differentiated HCC invading through diaphragm to lung. During follow-up, patient developed a 6 cm recurrence at left lung base 17 months after surgery for which he received sorafenib therapy. However, the lung mass further increased in size with new liver recurrence at segment 3 despite treatment. He succumbed 2 years and 3 months after surgery.
