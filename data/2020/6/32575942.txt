Objective: To investigate the characteristics of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-negative recurrent small hepatocellular carcinoma (rsHCC). Methods: The imaging characteristics of CEUS were retrospectively analyzed in 132 lesions from 116 patients with rsHCC, including 59 lesions from 51 AFP-negative patients and 73 lesions from 65 AFP-positive patients. The hemodynamic parameters such as contrast-enhanced onset time, time-to-peak, isoenhancement start time, low-enhancement start time, and perfusion mode were compared between two groups. Results: The time-to-peak, isoenhancement start time, low-enhancement start time of AFP-negative group were significantly increased than those in AFP-positive group (23.22±5.08)s vs. (20.30±3.41)s, (59.44±39.75)s vs. (40.75±16.16)s, (102.89±44.45)s vs. (87.08±25.27)s (all of P<0.05). Meanwhile, the proportion of isoenhancement during the portal and late phases in AFP-negative group was significantly higher than those in AFP-positive group (59.3% vs. 37.0%, 16.9% vs. 4.1%; all of P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the enhancement start time (14.87±6.00)s vs. (14.35±5.30)s (P>0.05) as well as isoenhancement proportion in the arterial phase (94.9% vs. 98.6%, P>0.05). Conclusions: The enhancement pattern of CEUS in AFP-negative rsHCC patients was "fast-in and slow-out" with a diverse and atypical trend. Recognizing its regular features will facilitate the early detection of AFP-negative rsHCC.
