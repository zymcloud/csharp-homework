Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) play important roles in human cancer development, including cell differentiation, apoptosis, and tumor progression. However, their underlying mechanisms of action are largely unknown at present. In this study, we focused on a novel suppressor lincRNA that has the potential to inhibit progression of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our experiments disclosed long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1488 (LINC01488) as a key negative regulator of HCC. Clinically, patients with high LINC01488 expression displayed greater survival rates and better prognosis. In vitro and in vivo functional assays showed that LINC01488 overexpression leads to significant suppression of cell proliferation and metastasis in HCC. Furthermore, LINC01488 bound to cyclin E to induce its ubiquitination and reduced expression of vimentin mediated by both miR-124-3p/miR-138-5p. Our results collectively indicate that LINC01488 acts as a tumor suppressor that inhibits metastasis and tumorigenesis in HCC via the miR-124-3p/miR-138-5p/vimentin axis. Furthermore, LINC01488 interacts with and degrades cyclin E, which contributes to its anti-tumorigenic activity. In view of these findings, we propose that enhancement of LINC01488 expression could be effective as a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC.
