Background:Monoprophylaxis with third-generation nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) can be safely adopted in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-positive, liver transplantation (LT) patients after at least 6 months of HBV immunoglobulin (HBIg)+NA. We investigated the efficacy of earlier initiation of post-LT entecavir (ETV) or tenofovir (TDF) monoprophylaxis.Methods:Between September 2011 and January 2017, all consecutive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive transplanted patients were scheduled to receive HBIg with ETV or TDF for a period related to the risk for HBV reinfection: 1. low-risk patients (HBeAg-negative and HBV DNA Results:Twenty patients with a median interquartile range (IQR) follow-up of 46 (64-39) months were enrolled in the study (40% receiving ETV, 60% receiving TDF). Two low-risk patients refused early HBIg withdrawal and were therefore treated and analyzed along with the high-risk group. Eventually, there were 2 groups: group A, which included 12 low-risk patients, and group B, which included 8 patients (six high-risk, 2 low-risk). After transplantation, group A and B patients received HBIg+NA for a median (IQR) time of 7 (9-7) days and 9 (13-5) months, respectively. All 20 recipients demonstrated HBV DNA Conclusion:In low-risk HBsAg-positive recipients, HBIg may be safely discontinued within 2 weeks of LT and replaced by ETV or TDF monotherapy.
