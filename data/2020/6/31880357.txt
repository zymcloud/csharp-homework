Objectives:To investigate the effect of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) modulation on tumor necrosis, apoptosis, tumor growth delay, and end point survival by combining microwave ablation (MWA) with an HSP90 inhibitor in a nude mouse model.Methods:This study was approved by the Ethics Committee. Forty mice with HepG2 subcutaneous xenograft tumors (10 Â± 1 mm) were randomized into 4 groups: (1) no treatment, (2) MWA only, (3) the HSP90 inhibitor ganetespib only, and (4) ganetespib combined with MWA. Tumors were harvested 24 hours after treatment, and gross coagulation diameters were measured. The effect of ganetespib on HSP90 and caspase 3 expression in the periablational rim was assessed. Another 40 mice with the same tumors and groupings were observed after treatment. Tumor growth curve and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed with a tumor diameter of 2.2 cm and 40 days of survival as the defined survival end points.Results:Combination treatment significantly increased the coagulation size compared to tumors treated with MWA or ganetespib alone (P Conclusions:Modulation of HSP production can improve MWA-induced tumor apoptosis and destruction, reduce residual tumor growth rates, and prolong end point survival.
