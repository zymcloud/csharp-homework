Leishmaniasis is an infection caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania, transmitted by sandflies and endemic to more than 88 countries. Visceral leishmaniasis in immunosuppressed patients is a growing concern. We report the case of a 61-year-old male patient with a previous history of alcoholic cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis who underwent liver transplantation for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Thirty-six days after the procedure, the patient showed an increase in liver enzymes and was diagnosed with moderate acute rejection of the graft. He was treated with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids, and while showing improvement in biochemical markers, he became febrile 12 days after corticosteroid treatment. He presented daily episodes of fever, even after the use of several antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal agents, and a number of negative cultures from different sites were obtained. A bone marrow biopsy was then performed, showing a large number of amastigote forms of Leishmania spp. Treatment with liposomal amphotericin B was initiated; however, the patient progressed to refractory septic shock and death. This case highlights several aspects of visceral leishmaniasis in liver transplant recipients, such as the association of malnutrition to Leishmania infection and the challenges of diagnosing leishmaniasis in cirrhotic patients in which splenomegaly and pancytopenia, the hallmarks of leishmaniasis, may also be attributed to portal hypertension and end-stage liver disease. A high index of suspicion is necessary for the correct diagnosis and treatment of leishmaniasis in this group of patients. This study is compliant with the Helsinki Congress and the Istanbul Declaration.
