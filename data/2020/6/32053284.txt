MicroRNA-216b (miR-216b) has been reported to be downregulated in several tumors, its mechanism is still little-studied in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we found that miR-216b was downregulated in HCC, but Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 28 (USP28) was upregulated. In addition, Kaplan-Meier-plotter analysis indicated that liver cancer patients with high miR-216b expression had a longer overall survival, but patients with high USP28 had a shorter overall survival. Further studies showed that overexpression of miR-216b inhibited HCC cell growth, and molecular investigations revealed that miR-216b targeted USP28 and inhibited its expression in HCC cells. In addition, overexpression of miR-216b suppressed the substrates' expression of USP28, for example, c-Myc, and miR-216b overexpression also inhibited Cyclin E expression as well as upregulating p27 expression, both of which were the downstream signals of c-Myc. These results indicated that miR-216b downregulated USP28/c-Myc signaling in HCC cells. Collectively, this study demonstrated that miR-216b/c-Myc axis could be as a potential target for HCC therapy in the future.
