Background:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. The increasing prevalence of NAFLD mirrors that of obesity and type 2 diabetes over the last two decades.Main:In a two-way pathophysiologic relationship, NAFLD increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, while the latter promotes the progression of simple fatty liver to a more advanced form called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH increases the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which may require liver transplantation. With the absence of FDA-approved medications for NAFLD treatment, lifestyle intervention remains the only therapy. Lately, extensive research efforts have been aimed at modifying NASH fibrosis and developing noninvasive screening methods.Conclusion:We highlight the pathophysiologic relationships between NAFLD and type 2 diabetes, discuss disease recognition, models of care, and current and emerging therapies for NASH treatment.
