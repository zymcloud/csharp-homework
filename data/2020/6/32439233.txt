Background and study aims:Host genetic modifiers of the risk and persistence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the Pakistani population have not been clearly elucidated. Recently, two genome-wide association studies described that STAT4 and IFNL3 variants are associated with different aspects of the course of HBV infection. However, the roles of these variants in the persistence of HBV infection have not been investigated in the HBV-infected population of Pakistan. Therefore, we examined the roles of the STAT4 and IFNL3 variants in a chronic HBV-infected population from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) region of Pakistan.Patients and methods:STAT4 rs7574865 and IFNL3 rs12979860 genotyping were performed in 297 subjects (240 infected with HBV and 57 controls). Statistical analyses were performed using the chi-squared test, Student's t-test, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium tests and logistic regression models.Results:Among the 297 subjects, compared with the IFNL3 rs12979860 genotype [odds ratio (OR) = 0.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.39-1.29, p = 0.2), the STAT4 rs7574865 genotype was independently associated with the risk of developing chronic HBV infection [OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.09-3.50, p = 0.02].Conclusion:The STAT4 rs7574865 and not the IFNL3 rs12979860 variant is associated with persistence of HBV infection in a Pakistani population from the KPK region.
