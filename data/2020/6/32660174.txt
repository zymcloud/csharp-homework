Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is a key enzyme in liver acetaldehyde metabolism (product of ethanol metabolism). Globally, about 8% of the population and about 30% to 40% of the East Asian population carry defective genes that encode no / low activity ALDH2. Recently, many studies have focused on the relationship between ALDH and viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, liver fibrosis and liver cancer. Importantly, ALDH2 expression is closely related to the risk, pathogenesis and prognosis of liver cancer, so it can be used as a potential therapeutic target. This article summarizes and reviews the new progress and new research directions of this field.
