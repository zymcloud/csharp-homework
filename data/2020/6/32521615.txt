The increase of the sedentary lifestyle and high-calorie diet have modified the etiological landscape of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with a recrudescence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), especially in Western countries. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the impact of high-fat diet feeding on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) establishment and HCC development. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic male mice were fed with high-fat-high-cholesterol diet (HFHCD) or high-fat-high-sugar diet (HFHSD) from 1 to 16 weeks. Even if liver tumors appear regardless of the high-fat diet, two distinct physiopathological patterns were evidenced, with much more severe NASH hallmarks (liver injury, inflammation and fibrosis) in diabetic mice fed with HFHCD. The mild hepatic injury, weak inflammation and fibrosis observed in HFHSD were interestingly associated with earlier emergence of more numerous liver tumors. When activated helper and cytotoxic T cells, detected by flow cytometry, infiltrated the liver of HFHCD-fed diabetic mice, a delay in the appearance of tumor nodules and a limitation of their numbers were observed, suggesting that the immune activities partly controlled tumor emergence. These data highlighted two different mouse models of HCC progression in diabetic mice depending on diet, which could be useful to evaluate new therapeutic approaches for HCC by targeting the immune response.
