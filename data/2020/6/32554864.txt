Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), such as LINC00462, HOTAIR, and MALAT1, are significantly upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. However, lncRNA expression in the serum of HCC patients is still unclear. To identify candidate lncRNAs for HCC diagnosis, we purified exosomal total RNA from the serum of healthy volunteers (controls) and hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC patients. To assess the function of lncRNAs, small interfering RNAs and overexpression vectors were designed and cell viability and cell apoptosis assays conducted. The exosomes of the control group had a larger number of lncRNAs with a high amount of alternative splicing compared to hepatic disease patients. qPCR assays showed that lnc-FAM72D-3, lnc-GPR89B-15, lncZEB2-19, and lnc-EPC1-4 are differentially expressed in HCC. Furthermore, the expression level of lnc-EPC1-4 correlated with age. While the expression levels of lnc-GPR89B-15 and lnc-EPC1-4 correlated with serum alpha-fetoprotein level. lnc-FAM72D-3 knockdown decreased cell viability and promoted cell apoptosis, indicating that lnc-FAM72D-3 functions as an oncogene in HCC. In contrast, lnc-EPC1-4 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis, indicating that it functions as a tumor suppressor gene. Collectively, these findings show that lnc-FAM72D-3 and lnc-EPC1-4 play a novel role that might contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis and identify potential candidate biomarkers for HCC diagnosis.
