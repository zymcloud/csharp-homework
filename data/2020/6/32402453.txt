Background:Native hepatectomy represents the most demanding surgical step during orthotopic whole liver transplantation (LT). The surgical risk assessment of LT candidates is currently mainly based on clinical and laboratory data, but even preoperative imaging data may be predictive of a complex native hepatectomy.Methods:A retrospective study on a cohort of 110 LT recipients was conducted. The radiologic variables investigated on pre-LT multidetector computed tomography scan were the length of the retrohepatic inferior vena cava (IVC-L), volume of the dorsal liver sector (DLS-V), complete encirclement of the IVC by the DLS (IVC-CE), max diameter of the native liver (L-D), max diameter of the spleen (S-D), and presence of large spontaneous portosystemic shunts (SPSS). The parameters defining complex native hepatectomy were the operative time, number of red blood cell (RBC) units transfused, IVC replacement technique switch, and post-LT relaparotomy for major bleeding.Results:In a multivariate analysis, the operative time was predicted by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis (regression coefficient [RC]: 18.237, P = .009), S-D (RC: 3.733, P = .007), and IVC-CE (RC: 20.174, P = .01); the RBC units transfused by an history of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding (RC: 2.503, P = .039), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score (RC: .259, P = .039), and L-D (RC: -0.519, P = .027); the switch to a IVC replacement technique by L-D (odds ratio [OR]: 0.641, P = .028) and IVC-L (OR: 1.065, P = .023); and the relaparotomy for bleeding by L-D (OR: 0.632, confidence interval [CI]: 0.437 to 0.916, P = .015).Conclusions:Pre-LT multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) seems to be a very useful tool in the surgical risk assessment of LT candidates.
