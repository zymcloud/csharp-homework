A novel nanocrystals delivery system of parthenolide (PTL) was designed to combined application with sorafenib (Sora) for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy, attempting to not only improve the poor aqueous solubility of PTL, but also enhance the synergistic therapeutic effects with Sora. The PTL nanocrystals (PTL-NCs) were prepared by precipitation-high-pressure homogenization method. The formed PTL-NCs with rod morphology possessed size of 126.9 ± 2.31 nm, zeta potential of -11.18 ± 0.59 mV and drug loading of 31.11 ± 1.99%. Meanwhile, PTL in PTL-NCs exhibited excellent storage stability and sustained release behavior. The combination therapy of Sora and PTL-NCs (Sora/PTL-NCs) in vitro for HepG2 cells presented superior therapeutic effects over that of individual PTL and Sora on intracellular uptake, cell proliferation inhibition and migration inhibition. Meanwhile the strongest anti-tumor effect with 81.86% inhibition rate and minimized systemic toxicity of Sora/PTL-NCs in vivo were obtained on tumor-bearing mice compared with that of PTL (48.84%) and Sora (58.83%). Thus, these findings suggested that PTL-NCs as an effective delivery system for the synergistically used with Sora to gain an optimal response against HCC, for referenced in the industrialization of nanocrystals products for intravenous administration.
