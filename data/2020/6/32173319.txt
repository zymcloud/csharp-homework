Cantharidin (CTD), a natural Chinese medicine constituent extracted from mylabris, is a potent drug against hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the clinical application of CTD was limited because of its toxicity and low solubility. In this work, a novel CTD-loaded liposome modified with 3-succinyl-30-stearyl glycyrrhetinic acid (18-GA-Suc-CTD-Lip) was prepared to enhance liver-targeting efficiency and antitumor activity. 18-GA-Suc-CTD-Lip and CTD-Lip were successfully prepared by film dispersion method and totally characterized. The antitumor effects in vitro were evaluated by cell proliferation inhibition assay, transwell assay, cell cycle analysis, and an apoptosis test. Pharmacokinetic and biodistribution were all investigated to precisely reveal liver-targeting efficiency of 18-GA-Suc-CTD-Lip in vivo. The IC50 values of 18-GA-Suc-CTD-Lip in HepG2 (3.417 ± 0.165 nmol/L) and Huh-7 (4.478 ± 0.409 nmol/L) cells were much lower than that of CTD-Lip, indicating that antitumor effects of 18-GA-Suc-CTD-Lip were remarkable because of the modification of 18-GA-Suc. The maximum concentration in the liver of 18-GA-Suc-CTD-Lip (1.72 ± 0.14 μg/g) was more than twice CTD-Lip (0.75 ± 0.08 μg/g) at 30 min, illustrating that 18-GA-Suc-CTD-Lip possesses excellent liver-targeting efficiency. Conclusively, 18-GA-Suc-CTD-Lip could be a potential liver-targeting antitumor drug for hepatocellular carcinoma.
