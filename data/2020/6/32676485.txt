Background:Recently, several studies have demonstrated that caveolin-1 overexpression is involved in apoptosis resistance, angiogenesis, and invasiveness in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanisms underlying caveolin-1-mediated tumor progression remain unclear. Methodogy. Lentiviral vectors were used to construct caveolin-1 small interfering RNA- (siRNA-) expressing cells. Secreted VEGF levels in SMMC7721 cells were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). SMMC7721 cell proliferation, cycle, apoptosis, and invasiveness were detected by MTT, flow cytometry, Annexin V-FITC/PI, and invasion assay, respectively. Phospho-eNOS levels in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cocultured with SMMC7721 cell supernatants were analyzed by Western blot. Capillary-like tubule formation assay was performed to analyze endothelial tubular structure formation in HUVECs treated with supernatants from caveolin-1 siRNA-expressing SMMC7721 cells. SMMC7721 implantation and growth in nude mice were observed. Angiogenesis in vivo was analyzed by immunohistochemical angiogenesis assay.Results:Caveolin-1 siRNA-expressing SMMC7721 cells secreted reduced levels of VEGF. Caveolin-1 RNAi also caused an inhibition of SMMC7721 cell proliferation and cell cycle progression that was accompanied by increased apoptosis. Supernatants from caveolin-1 siRNA-expressing SMMC7721 cells inhibited cell cycle progression and decreased phospho-eNOS levels in HUVECs. Endothelial tubular structure formation in HUVECs treated with supernatants from caveolin-1 siRNA-expressing SMMC7721 cells was considerably reduced. Caveolin-1 siRNA-expressing SMMC7721 cells also showed reduced tumorigenicity and angiogenesis induction in vivo.Conclusion:Our results reveal a novel mechanism, whereby caveolin-1 positively regulates human HCC cell invasiveness by coordinating VEGF-induced angiogenesis.
