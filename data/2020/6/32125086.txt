Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is a malignant tumor originating from intrahepatic bile ducts. Surgical therapy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy are taken to treat this disease, but it is prone to recurrence and metastasis, with poor prognosis. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore new targets and molecular mechanisms for the development of cholangiocarcinoma cells. Clinical cholangiocarcinoma tissues from patients and four human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines were analyzed for microRNA-373 (miR-373) expression. For investigating whether miR-373 directly modulated unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1), dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed. In addition, CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, western blot, and immunofluorescence were applied to evaluate the proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy of cholangiocytic hepatocellular carcinoma cells. miR-373 downregulation was observed in clinical tissues and cell lines of cholangiocarcinoma. Overexpression of miR-373 reduced proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, and raised expression levels of pro-apoptosis proteins including BCL2 associated X (Bax), Caspase-3, and Caspase-9. Moreover, overexpression of miR-373 downregulated expression levels of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)-II, Beclin-1, and promoted P62 expression on mRNA and protein levels. After miR-373 knockdown, all indexes of apoptosis and autophagy mentioned above were reversed. Luciferase activity was decreased after cotransfection of miR-373 mimic and wild-type ULK1 vector. Also, miR-373 overexpression inhibited ULK1 expression. Importantly, overexpression of miR-373 weakened expressions of ULK1, LC3, Beclin-1, and Bcl-2, and enhanced expressions of P62, Bax, Caspase-3, and Caspase-9. miR-373 mimic treatment and subsequent ULK1 overexpression, induced reverse regulation in expressions of these proteins, compared with overexpression of miR-373 only. miR-373 targeted ULK1 to initiate inhibition of autophagy and subsequent promotion of apoptosis in cholangiocarcinoma cells.
