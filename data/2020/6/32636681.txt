Background:The dysregulation of microRNA (miRNAs) is broadly participated in cancer progression, resulting in sustained cell proliferation by directly targeting various targets. This study investigated the expression of miR-582 in GC and its association with liver metastasis.Methods:Firstly, differentially expressed miRNAs in gastric cancer (GC) tissues were predicted by microarray. Then, the relationship between miR-582 and clinical characteristics of GC patients was analyzed. By silencing of miR-582 in GC cells, the change in malignant biological behaviors of GC cells was detected. The upstream lncRNA, downstream targeting genes of miR-582 and the corresponding signaling pathway were predicted by online databases and verified by luciferase reporter assays, RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. Finally, the effects of miR-582 on the growth and metastasis of GC cells were detected by in vivo tumorigenesis and metastasis tests.Results:MiR-582 was highly expressed in GC tissues and related to the metastasis of patients with GC. Silencing of miR-582 expression blocked malignant biological behaviors of GC cells in vitro and in vivo. MiR-582 inhibited forkhead box protein O3 (FOXO3) to upregulate the PI3K/AKT/Snail signaling pathway in GC cells. Besides, GATA6-AS1 was found as an upstream lncRNA to modulate the expression of miR-582.Conclusion:MiR-582 induced by GATA6-AS1 silencing promotes the growth and metastasis of GC cells by targeting FOXO3 to induce the activation of the PI3K/AKT/Snail signaling pathway. MiR-582 could be a potential molecular therapy target for patients with GC.
