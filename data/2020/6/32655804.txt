Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the leading primary hepatic malignancy in children and likely emerges due to failure of hepatic progenitor cells to properly differentiate. The peroxiredoxin (PRDX) family is frequently linked to cancer. In our previous study, we demonstrated that expression of the only secreted family member, PRDX4, was correlated with hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this new study was to investigate PRDX4's role in HB. We collected 87 HB specimens and performed PRDX4 immunohistochemistry staining. Clinical analysis was conducted and the effect of PRDX4 overexpression on two HB cell lines (Huh6 and HepG2) was also examined. Clinical data revealed elevated PRDX4 expression in embryonal component was correlated with advanced stage (IV) and metastasis. In comparison, increased PRDX4 expression in fetal component was associated with well differentiation. In vitro experiments showed PRDX4 overexpression enhanced migration in embryonal-like HB cells (Huh6), which was accompanied by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). By contrast, PRDX4 overexpression inhibited proliferation, decreased stemness markers, and increased hepatic markers in fetal-like HB cells (HepG2), which indicated induction of tumor cell differentiation. In conclusion, PRDX4 promotes embryonal hepatoblastoma cell migration but induces fetal cell differentiation. It can be adopted as an important marker for HB prognosis and a potential treatment target.
