Survey is one of the crucial data retrieval methods in the literature. However, surveys often contain missing data and redundant features. Therefore, missing feature completion and feature selection have been widely used for knowledge extraction from surveys. We have a hypothesis to solve these two problems. To implement our hypothesis, a classification method is presented. Our proposed method consists of missing feature completion with a statistical moment (average) and feature selection using a novel swarm optimization method. Firstly, an average based supervised feature completion method is applied to Hepatocellular Carcinoma survey (HCC). The used HCC survey consists of 49 features. To select meaningful features, a chaotic Darcy optimization based feature selection method is presented and this method selects 31 most discriminative features of the completed HCC dataset. 0.9879 accuracy rate was obtained by using the proposed chaotic Darcy optimization-based HCC survival classification method.
