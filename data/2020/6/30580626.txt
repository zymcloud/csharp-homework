Novel Mannich base derivatives of glabridin were synthesized and their antiproliferative activity were performed along with our previously reported glabridin-chalcone hybrids molecules (GCHMs) against various human cell lines MDA-MB-231 (breast adenocarcinoma), HEK-293 (embryonic kidney cell line), K562 (leukemia), MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma), HeLa (cervix adenocarcinoma), HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma) and WRL-68 (hepatic carcinoma). The result showed that the glabridin significantly reduced cell proliferation with IC50 ranges from 3.67 to 58.30 µM against all the tested cell lines. The remarkable reduction in antiproliferative activity 2',4'-dimethoxyglabridin and GCHMs compounds with phenolic OH groups protected by methoxy (OCH3) groups suggested that the free OH groups are essential factor for the antiproliferative activity of glabridin and its derivatives. The Mannich base derivatives of glabridin showed moderate activity IC50 (2.20->95.78 µM). Furthermore, in silico target identification analysis revealed that AKT1, DECR1 and NOS1 are the potential targets for glabridin and their derivatives.
