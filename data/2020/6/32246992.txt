Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and their M2-type extremely promote tumor angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nogo-B is expressed in most tissues and participates in macrophage polarization. However, whether Nogo-B is involved in the polarization and the effects of TAMs has been unclear. The expression of Nogo-B in TAMs of HCC patients is significantly increased, which correlated with the poor prognosis of the patients with HCC. Coincidentally, HCC conditioned medium (HCM) facilitated Nogo-B expression and the M2 phenotype of macrophages. Nogo-B knockdown Nogo-B significantly suppressed the M2-type polarization of macrophages and inhibited HCC cells proliferation both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, interference of Nogo-B facilitates macrophage-mediated apoptosis of tumor cells. Nogo-B meaningfully enhanced IL4-stimulated the alternative activation of macrophages as well as expression of the transcriptional regulators Yes-associated protein (Yap)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (Taz). An inhibitor of Yap, Verteporfin, could block Nogo-B-Yap/Taz-mediated macrophages M2 polarization. Nogo-B expression in macrophages facilitates tumor-associated macrophages M2 polarization and protumoral effects of TAMs in HCC. Targeting Nogo-B/Yap/Taz in macrophages could provide a new therapeutic strategy in HCC therapy.
