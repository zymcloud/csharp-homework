Hepatic epithelioid angiomyolipoma (EAML) has malignant potential that can easily be misdiagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the treatment options of these conditions are different. This retrospective study investigated whether contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can differentiate EAML from HCC. We included 24 patients with pathologically confirmed EAML and 36 patients with HCC who underwent pre-operative conventional ultrasound and CEUS. The conventional ultrasound and CEUS features of the two groups were analyzed. Time intensity curves (TICs) were analyzed for all lesions using quantitative perfusion analysis software. This study found that significant differences existed between the EAML and HCC groups in terms of clinical features such as sex, age, symptoms, alpha-fetoprotein and history of hepatitis B virus infection (p
