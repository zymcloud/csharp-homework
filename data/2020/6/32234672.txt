Interleukin (IL)-22 is a cytokine up-regulated in inflammatory situations and known to exert various hepatic effects. The potential impact of IL-22 towards liver drug detoxifying proteins remains nevertheless unknown, but may be important to determine owing to the well-established alterations of liver detoxification occuring during inflammation. The present study was therefore designed to analyze the effects of IL-22 towards drug metabolizing enzyme and drug transporter expression and activity in cultured human hepatic cells. Exposure of differentiated hepatoma HepaRG cells or primary human hepatocytes to 10 ng/mL IL-22 was found to repress mRNA expression of cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 and of the sinusoidal sodium-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP); such IL-22 effects were concentration-dependent for CYP3A4 (IC50 = 1.7 ng/mL), CYP2B6 (IC50 = 0.9 ng/mL) and NTCP (IC50 = 1.8 ng/mL). Activity of CYP1A2 (phenacetin O-deethylation), CYP3A4 (midazolam hydroxylation) and CYP2B6 (bupropion hydroxylation), as well as that of NTCP (taurocholate uptake) were concomitantly decreased in IL-22-treated HepaRG cells; by contrast, activity of organic anion transporter polypeptides (OATPs) (estrone-3-sulfate uptake) and of organic cation transporter (OCT) 1 (tetra-ethylammonium uptake) remained unchanged. IL-22 was next found to activate the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 pathway, whose inhibition by the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib fully prevented the IL-22-mediated CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and NTCP repression in HepaRG cells. This JAK-dependent down-regulation of hepatic drug detoxifying proteins, notably of CYPs, by IL-22 may contribute to alteration of pharmacokinetics in patients suffering from acute and chronic inflammatory diseases and may be the source of drug-drug interactions.
