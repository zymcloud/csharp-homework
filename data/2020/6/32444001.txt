Introduction:The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that, during 1999-2008, people born in 1945-1965 (the baby boomer generation) represented approximately 75% of people infected with hepatitis C virus and 73% of hepatitis C virus-associated deaths and are at greatest risk for hepatocellular carcinoma and liver disease. In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended one-time hepatitis C virus screening for people born during 1945-1965. In addition, New York State enacted a Hepatitis C Virus Testing Law in 2014. This analysis assesses the impacts of the 2012 recommendation and 2014 New York State Testing Law on hepatitis C virus screening rates among New York City Medicaid-enrolled recipients born during 1945-1965.Methods:The eligible population was determined quarterly as the number of Medicaid recipients continuously enrolled for 12 months with neither a prior hepatitis C virus diagnosis nor antibody test since 2005. Quarterly screening rates during 2010-2017 were examined using interrupted time series analysis. Data were analyzed in 2018-2019.Results:In 2010-2017, the highest screening rate occurred in the quarter immediately after the law (33.64 per 1,000 Medicaid recipients). There was no change in screening rates after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation and a significant increase after the New York State Law, which was not sustained.Conclusions:Hepatitis C virus screening rates increased in the quarter after the 2014 New York State Hepatitis C Virus Testing Law became effective. Additional efforts are needed to screen baby boomers and people who were recently infected with hepatitis C virus related to opioid use.
