Objective:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer with a high mortality rate; the molecular mechanism involved in HCC remain unclear. We aimed to provide insight into HCC induced with HepG2 cells and identify genes and pathways associated with HCC, as well as potential therapeutic targets.Methods:Dataset GSE72581 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus, including samples from mice injected in liver parenchyma with HepG2 cells, and from mice injected with cells from patient tumor explants. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups of mice were analyzed. Then, gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses were performed. The MCODE plug-in in Cytoscape was applied to create a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs.Results:We identified 1,405 DEGs (479 upregulated and 926 downregulated genes), which were enriched in complement and coagulation cascades, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway, and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction. The top 4 modules and top 20 hub genes were identified from the PPI network, and associations with overall survival were determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis.Conclusion:This preclinical study provided data on molecular targets in HCC that could be useful in the clinical treatment of HCC.
