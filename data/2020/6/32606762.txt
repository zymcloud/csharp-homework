Purpose:Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in body fluids have been considered as promising novel biomarkers for tumor-related diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the expression level of lncRNA NONHSAT053785 in serum and its correlation with clinical characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:The droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used to measure the serum levels of NONHSAT053785 in 112 HCC patients, 96 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, and 99 healthy controls (HC). The correlation between NONHSAT053785 and clinical characteristics was analyzed by chi-square test and Spearman correlation test. The risk factors of intrahepatic metastasis (IM) were detected by univariate and multivariate analyses. Furthermore, the diagnostic value of NONHSAT053785 in HCC and its predictive ability in IM were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.Results:The level of NONHSAT053785 was significantly increased in the serum of HCC patients and was higher in HCC patients with IM as compared to those without. Additionally, the expression level of NONHSAT053785 was significantly related to IM, Child-Pugh classification, and peripheral blood indicators such as liver metabolic enzymes and positively correlated to IM, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging, and some peripheral blood indicators. Furthermore, the serum NONHSAT053785 was indicated as an independent predictor for IM in the elderly, non-smoking, drinking, and tumor size â‰¥5 cm subjects. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.801 (P <0.0001) for diagnosis of HCC and 0.678 (P =0.0015) for predicting IM.Conclusion:The increase in serum NONHSAT053785 levels was related to an increased risk of IM, and hence, may serve as a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of HCC and the prediction of IM.
