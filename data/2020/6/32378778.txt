Background:Single-incision laparoscopic liver resection (SILLR) is still challenging due to the unstable surgical view, the crowding instruments and its crossover. In this study, we present a new option of solo SILLR for various liver tumours in order to overcome those difficulties.Methods:Solo SILLR is indicated for liver tumours located in the left liver or in the superficial right liver. Data for 54 consecutive patients, who underwent solo SILLR between October 2015 and October 2018, were collected and analysed prospectively.Results:A total of 30 patients (55.5%) underwent non-anatomical resection. Left hemi-hepatectomy was performed in 11 patients (20.4%) and left lateral was performed in 13 patients (24.1%). The median operative time was 114 (range 30-335) min with median blood loss of 400 (50-750) mL with no need of blood transfusion and no intraoperative complications. The median length of hospital stay was 3 (range 1-19) days. There was one case of post-operative intra-abdominal fluid collection and one case of incisional hernia during the follow-up.Conclusion:Solo SILLR is more feasible and safer for liver tumours located in the superficial right liver or in the left one. Therefore, solo surgery can be an option in SILLR.
