Background:Forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1), acting as a transcriptional activator for liver-specific transcripts, plays a vital part in proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle.Methods:The mRNA expression of FOXA1 in 90 HCC tissues and matched adjacent non-tumor tissues was determined by qRT-PCR. The downstream and upstream regulators of FOXA1 were identified by bioinformatics analysis and experimental confirmation.Results:We found out that the expression of FOXA1 was obviously higher in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues than that in matched non-tumor tissues. Similarly, FOXA1 is also highly expressed in HCC cell lines as compared with normal human hepatic cell line L02. Clinical association analysis indicated that high expression of FOXA1 was prominently correlated with high HBV level, large tumor size, high venous infiltration, high Edmondson-Steiner grading, and advanced tumor-node-metastasis tumor stage. Furthermore, the in vitro tests showed that ectopic expression of FOXA1 promoted HepG2 cell proliferation and suppressed apoptosis. In contrast, the downregulation of FOXA1 inhibited cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis in Hep3B cells. To investigate the functional mechanism of FOXA1, anterior gradient 2 (AGR2), an executor in proliferation and apoptosis, was identified as the direct target gene of FOXA1. Meanwhile, we also found the expression of FOXA1 could be inhibited by miR-212-3p, which working as a tumor suppressor downregulated in HCC.Conclusion:We revealed that FOXA1 exerted its biological function by regulating AGR2 expression, and its ectopic expression may be blamed for low expression of miR-212-3p.
