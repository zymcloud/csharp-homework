This study aims to investigate the utility of digital protocols for Ki-67 immunohistochemistry quantitative analysis ("hot spot" method) in the setting of well-differentiated hepatocellular neoplasms. Resection cases of typical hepatic adenomas (HAs) (n = 40), atypical HAs (n = 9), and well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (WD HCCs) (n = 56) were selected. HAs were further classified by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against liver fatty acid binding protein, glutamine synthetase, B-catenin, hepatic serum amyloid A, and C-reactive protein. Ki-67 proliferative index by immunohistochemistry was evaluated in all cases by digital analysis using a modified neuroendocrine tumor "hot spot" protocol. The proliferative rate of HAs (typical, median 1.2% (range 0-7.4%) and atypical, median 1.0% (range 0.3-3%)) was significantly lower than that of WD HCCs (median 4.5%, range 0-49.8%) (P
