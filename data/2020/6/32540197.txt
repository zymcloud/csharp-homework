Rationale and objectives:To investigate the value of iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and least squares estimation (IDEAL IQ) and gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for evaluating Glypican-3 (GPC3) expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Seventy-six patients with histopathologic diagnosis of HCC were retrospectively included in this study. In all patients IDEAL IQ and Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI were performed preoperatively using a 3 T MRI system. For an identical slice through the liver of each patient a region of interest was drawn on the tumor in the hepatobiliary phase image and copied to the R2* map and fat fraction map produced by IDEAL IQ. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the region of interest values of R2*, fat fraction and uptake of Gd-EOB-DTPA values between patients with positive and negative GPC3 expression HCC. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to determine the diagnostic performances of each of the MRI parameters in evaluating GPC3 expression and histological grade in HCC.Results:R2* value was significantly higher in cases of positive than negative GPC3 expression HCCs (p 0.05). R2* value had higher areas under receiver operating characteristic (0.881), sensitivity (85.96%), and specificity (84.21%) compared to the fat fraction and uptake of Gd-EOB-DTPA.Conclusion:R2* value yielded from IDEAL IQ could reliably predict GPC3 expression in HCC prior to surgery.
