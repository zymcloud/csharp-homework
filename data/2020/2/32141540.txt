Objective:CircRNAs serve an essential role in regulating the development and progression of various tumors. The aim of this study was to examine the role and mechanism of circ_0009910 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:RT-qPCR was used to detect the expression of circ_0009910 and miR-335-5p in tissues and cell lines of HCC. The proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells were examined using 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU), colony formation, and Transwell assay, respectively. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to verify the interaction between miR-335-5p and circ_0009910 or ROCK1. Western blot was applied to detect the protein levels. Furthermore, the antitumor effect of circ_0009910 knockdown was examined by establishing xenograft tumor model of HCC in vivo.Results:Circ_0009910 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of circ_0009910 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HepG2 cells and suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Moreover, circ_0009910 directly targeted miR-335-5p, as well as for ROCK1 was a direct target gene of miR-335-5p. Mechanically, simultaneous over-expression of miR-335-5p and circ_0009910 or ROCK1 could restore the biological behaviors of HepG2 cells, which were inhibited by miR-335-5p.Conclusions:Circ_0009910-silenced suppressed the growth and metastasis of HCC cells through upregulating the inhibitory effect of miR-335-5p on ROCK1.
