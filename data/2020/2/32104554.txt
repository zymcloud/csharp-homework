Background:The survival of patients treated with monotherapy for hepatic malignancies is not ideal. A comprehensive program of cryoablation combined with radiotherapy for the treatment of hepatic malignancies results in less trauma to the patients. It may provide an option for the treatment of patients with advanced hepatic malignancies.Case summary:We reported 5 cases of advanced-stage hepatic malignancies treated in our hospital from 2017-2018, including 3 cases of primary hepatocellular carcinoma and 2 cases of metastatic hepatic carcinoma. They first received cryoablation therapy on their liver lesions. The procedure consisted of 2 freeze-thaw cycles, and for each session, the duration of freezing was 13-15 min, and the natural re-warming period was 2-8 min. Depending on the tumor size, the appropriate cryoprobes were selected to achieve complete tumor ablation to the greatest extent possible. After cryoablation surgery, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for liver lesions was performed, and the radiotherapy regimen was 5400 cGy/18f and 300 cGy/f. None of the 5 patients had adverse events above grade II, and their quality of life was significantly improved. Among them, 4 patients were free of disease progression in the liver lesions under local control, and their survival was prolonged; 3 patients are still alive.Conclusion:Our clinical practice demonstrated that cryoablation combined with IMRT could be implemented safely. The definitive efficacy for hepatic malignancies needs to be confirmed in larger-size sample prospective studies.
