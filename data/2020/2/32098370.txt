It has been reported that maternal nutrition determines the offspring's susceptibility to chronic diseases including cancer. Here, we investigated the effects of maternal diets differing in protein source on diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in adult rat offspring. Dams were fed a casein (CAS) diet or a low-isoflavone soy protein isolate (SPI) diet for two weeks before mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation. Offspring were weaned to and fed a chow diet throughout the study. From four weeks of age, hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) were induced by intraperitoneal injection of DEN once a week for 14 weeks. The SPI/DEN group exhibited higher mortality rate, tumor multiplicity, and HCC incidence compared with the CAS/DEN group. Accordingly, altered cholesterol metabolism and increases in liver damage and angiogenesis were observed in the SPI/DEN group. The SPI/DEN group had a significant induction of the nuclear factor-κB-mediated anti-apoptotic pathway, as measured by increased phosphorylation of IκB kinase β, which may lead to the survival of precancerous hepatocytes. In conclusion, maternal consumption of a low-isoflavone soy protein isolate diet accelerated chemically induced hepatocarcinogenesis in male rat offspring in the present study, suggesting that maternal dietary protein source may be involved in DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in adult offspring.
