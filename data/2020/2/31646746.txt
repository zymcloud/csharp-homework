Superficial surgical site infections (SSIs) are one of the most common postoperative complications of hepatectomy for liver cancer. The objective of this study is to clarify the risk factors and determine a clinical prediction score for SSIs after partial hepatectomy for malignant tumour. A total of 812 consecutive patients were enrolled who underwent partial hepatectomy for liver malignant tumour from January 2017 to December 2017. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify the risk factors for SSIs. Clinical prediction score was then constructed using coefficients of identified significant predictors. Risk stratification was then carried out by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Of all the 812 patients, SSIs were observed in 31 (3.82%) patients. A multivariate analysis identified four predictors as independent risk factors for SSIs, which were splenomegaly, perioperative blood transfusion, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and low postoperative serum albumin concentration (<35 g/L). Clinical prediction score ranged from 0 to 4.6 with its discrimination concordance (C) statistic of 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59, 0.81). Risk stratification classified these patients into low, moderate, and high risk in SSIs. This risk score system may credibly stratify the risk of SSIs with relatively high sensitivity and specificity. Splenomegaly, history of blood transfusion, ICU admission, and postoperative serum albumin concentration less than 35 g/L could be used to predict SSIs with acceptable discrimination. This clinical risk score system may be useful in prediction of SSIs after hepatectomy for malignant tumours.
