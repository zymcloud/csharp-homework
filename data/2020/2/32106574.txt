Variations in the interferon sensitivity-determining region (ISDR) within the NS5A region were related to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The aim of the study was to investigate a relationship between ISDR/PKR substitutions and their association with liver fibrosis or HCC development. A total of 316 patients infected with HCV and treated with DAAs were evaluated. HCV RNA was quantified and sequenced before treatment. The liver fibrosis stage was assessed by transient elastography and equalized to METAVIR scores. Multivariate analysis showed that ≥3 substitutions in ISDR and ≥6 in PKR-bd were significantly associated with advanced fibrosis. Advanced fibrosis was observed in patients with higher substitutions in ISDR and PKR-bd. A higher correlation between advanced fibrosis and a high frequency of ≥3 substitutions in ISDR and ≥6 in PKR-bd was observed in patients infected with genotype 2c. In addition, in a higher proportion of HCC patients, advanced fibrosis (40.4% vs. 88.2%; p < 0.001) and ≥6 substitutions in PKR-bd (15.4% vs. 41.2%; p = 0.01) was observed. In conclusion, a higher number of substitutions in ISDR and PKR-bd were associated with advanced liver fibrosis, suggesting a use of like predictors for progression in the liver damage. A significantly higher number of PKR-bd substitutions was observed in HCC patients; in particular, in patients infected with HCV genotype 2c.
