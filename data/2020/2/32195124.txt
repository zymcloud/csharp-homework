Usual location of metastasis are in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) the lung, liver, bone, adrenal and brain. Here we report on an unusual case of a 76-year-old male with a solitary sternal metastasis as an initial presentation of clear-cell RCC. The management of metastatic kidney cancer has been disrupted over the last decade by the emergence of new treatments and the progress of surgery and ablative techniques. the Carmena study suggests that sunitinib alone is not inferior to the NCR followed by sunitinib, the patient has therefore been transferred to oncology for medical treatment (targeted therapy).
