Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth world's largest malignant tumor, which seriously endangers human health. The commonly used treatment effects are not satisfactory and the mortality rate is still high. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective adjuvant treatment to improve patient survival. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) acts as the most common tumor marker used for HCC diagnosis. Studies have shown that alpha-fetoprotein can self-induce T cells in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and its immunogenic antigenic epitopes provide new ideas for the study of AFP vaccine. Presently, a variety of AFP vaccines have been developed, such as DC vaccine, DNA vaccine, and peptide vaccine, which have been successfully applied to HCC mouse model and phase I /II clinical trials, with evident results. This article discusses the molecular mechanism, categories and application prospects of AFP vaccine in HCC.
