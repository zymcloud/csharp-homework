Background:Generally, hepatitis C has been identified as one of the major health issues that about 3% of the world's population have been threatened and affected by it (about 170 million people), and also, it can be considered a factor in acute and chronic hepatitis.Methods:The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of HCV genotypes in Azerbaijan patients. In this study, sampling was done on the referred patients to the hospitals (Mahallati and Behbud Hospital). RNA was extracted after isolation of plasma, and then, after the synthesizing of cDNA, the sample was carried out to the laboratory for performing the real-time PCR in order to determine the genotypes.Results:The evaluation of HCV genotypes in positive plasma samples showed that dominant subsets were remarkable and the mean age of the patients was 37/3 Â± 11/8 (in the age range of 2-63). Among the 235 patients,139 of them (59%) were male. Statistically, the average number of women was more than men (T test, P Conclusion:The findings indicate that among Azerbaijan's patients with chronic hepatitis C, genotypes 1b (71.1%) and 3a (17%) were dominant.
