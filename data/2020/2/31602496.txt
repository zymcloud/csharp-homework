A systematic review was conducted to provide an overview of the efficacy and safety of 125I irradiation stent placement for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and main portal vein tumor thrombosis (MPVTT). Six studies with 406 patients were included in the final analysis. The median overall survival for patients treated with 125I irradiation stent placement was 10.3 months. The most common radiation-related adverse event was leukopenia. The stent-related adverse events consisted of fever, abdominal pain, hemorrhage, and anorexia. No stent or seed migration was reported. Overall, the use of an 125I irradiation stent has the potential to act as an alternative therapy for patients with HCC with MPVTT.
