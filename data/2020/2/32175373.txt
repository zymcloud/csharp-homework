Background:The administration of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) posttransplant has been implicated as an independent risk factor for the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation (LT). The new immunosuppressive agent sirolimus (SRL) acts as a primary immunosuppressant or antitumor agent. In this study we investigated the effect of sirolimus-based immunosuppression compared to CNIs (non-SRL) on the outcomes of LT candidates with HCC.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 204 HCC patients who underwent LT in our hospital between January 2, 2014 and December 10, 2017. The median of the follow-up duration of patients was 24.5 months. The patients were divided into a sirolimus (SRL) group (76 patients) and a non-sirolimus (non-SRL) group (128 patients). Patients exceeding the LT criteria were analyzed as subgroups. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) after tumor recurrence were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were used to compare OS between the SRL and non-SRL groups.Results:The SRL group achieved better OS compared to the non-SRL group, while there was no significant difference in DFS. Subgroup (Milan criteria-based or Hangzhou criteria-based) analyses revealed that patients exceeding, rather than meeting, the Milan or Hangzhou criteria benefited from SRL (exceeding the Milan criteria: P=0.002; exceeding the Hangzhou criteria: PConclusions:SRL can improve survival outcomes in LT patients with HCC exceeding the Hangzhou criteria.
