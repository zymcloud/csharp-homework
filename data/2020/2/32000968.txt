Introduction:We aimed to explore the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and to identify their side effects, when used in cancer patients. We also assessed the communication of the patients and families with the oncologist about this issue.Methods:A cross-sectional survey of 120 adult patients treated for cancer in our medical oncology department between January and April 2019, using an anonymous questionnaire to assess complementary and alternative medicine use.Results:One hundred twenty patients participated in the survey, among them 102 used CAM (85%). A majority of users were female patients (n=72, 70.6%), and mean age was 52.4 years±11.6. Patients had breast cancer in 48% of cases. Wild herbs were the most commonly used alternative therapy (67.7%), particularly Ephedra foeminea (Alanda) in 52% of cases. Patients' families incited them to use CAM in 64.7% of cases. Internet and social network (Facebook) were the major sources of information on CAM (79.4%), followed by family and friends (72.5%). Fourteen patients (13.7%) reported nausea and vomiting secondary to CAM use. We reported disruption of liver function in 9.8% of cases, and renal failure in 1.96%, with fatal issue in one patient using Ephedra. Nineteen patients (18.6%) informed their oncologist about the alternative therapy they received.Conclusion:The oncologist has to explore the use of alternative therapies with their patients. Communication about CAM should be a part of cancer care. It may protect patients from some dangerous side effects and improve efficacy of conventional therapy.
