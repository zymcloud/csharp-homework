Aim: To explore the expression of programmed death-1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), natural killer T (NKT) and hepatoma cells in coculture system, and the influence of abolishing PD-1 on antitumor efficiency. Materials & methods: CRISPR/Cas9 technology, flow cytometry, ELISA, CCK-8 assay and mouse models were performed to investigate the interactions between PD-1/PD-L1 expression on NKT and hepatoma cells, respectively. Results: The NKT and hepatoma cells mutually affected the expression of PD-1/PD-L1. The killing effect was positively correlated with NKT-mediated PD-L1 expression on hepatoma cells. Conclusion: Hepatoma cells in different genetic background responded differently to NKT-induced PD-L1 stimulation, and those cells with lower PD-L1 expression fail to PD-1 blocking intervention. Additionally, the killing effect was more time-efficient with PD-1 knockout than with monoclonal antibody blockade.
