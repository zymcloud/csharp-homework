BACKGROUND Postoperative pulmonary embolism following liver transplantations is still one of the most fatal complications, especially during the early postoperative phase. The use of a thrombolytic agent such as the recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rtPA) is considered a contraindication early after major abdominal surgery such as liver transplantation. However, thrombolysis after major surgery in the early postoperative period carries a substantial risk of surgical site hemorrhage. CASE REPORT A 55-year-old patient presented with a hepatic mass diagnosed as a combined cholangio/hepatocellular carcinoma. Following the criteria of the University of San Francisco, California (UCSF) for liver transplantation, the case was selected for liver transplantation. The patient received neoadjuvant therapy. After the liver transplantation, on the second postoperative day, an acute, severe dyspnea with sudden onset occurred on the surgical ward. A computed tomography angiography showed a drawn-out embolus, which sprawled into both pulmonary main arteries and occluded them subtotally. A thrombolysis with rtPA was started. Within the first 60 minutes of administration of rtPA, the circulation stabilized effectively, so that epinephrine could be tapered down to zero and the patient was promptly extubated. About 6 hours after administration of rtPA, a sudden and pronounced bleeding via one of the intraperitoneal drains occurred, hemoglobin concentration dropped from 9.7 g/dL to 6.4 g/dL. After immediate re-laparotomy, circulation and hemoglobin concentration were absolutely stable. CONCLUSIONS Even with anticipated high risk of bleeding, thrombolysis with rtPA can be used as a life-savings treatment in a case of pulmonary embolism after liver transplantation.
