We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization study to explore the associations of iron status with overall cancer and 22 site-specific cancers. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms for iron status were obtained from a genome-wide association study of 48,972 European-descent individuals. Summary-level data for breast and other cancers were obtained from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium and UK Biobank. Genetically predicted iron status was positively associated with liver cancer and inversely associated with brain cancer but not associated with overall cancer or the other 20 studied cancer sites at p < 0.05. The odds ratios of liver cancer were 2.45 (95% CI, 0.81, 7.45; p = 0.11), 2.11 (1.16, 3.83; p = 0.02), 10.89 (2.44, 48.59; p = 0.002) and 0.30 (0.17, 0.53; p = 2 Ã— 10-5) for one standard deviation increment of serum iron, transferrin saturation, ferritin and transferrin levels, respectively. For brain cancer, the corresponding odds ratios were 0.69 (0.48, 1.00; p = 0.05), 0.75 (0.59, 0.97; p = 0.03), 0.41 (0.20, 0.88; p = 0.02) and 1.49 (1.04, 2.14; p = 0.03). Genetically high iron status was positively associated with liver cancer and inversely associated with brain cancer.
