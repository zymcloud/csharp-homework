Objective:Solitary pulmonary nodules after liver transplantation are challenging clinical problems. Herein, we report the causes and clinical courses of resected solitary pulmonary nodules in patients who underwent liver transplantation.Methods:We retrospectively obtained medical records of 68 patients who underwent liver transplantation between March 2009 and June 2016. This study mainly focused on patients with solitary pulmonary nodules observed on computed tomography scans during follow-ups that were conducted until their deaths or February 2019.Results:Computed tomography scans revealed solitary pulmonary nodules in 7 of the 68 patients. Definitive diagnoses were obtained using video-assisted lung resection in all seven patients. None experienced major postoperative complications. The final pathologic diagnoses were primary lung cancer in three patients, pulmonary metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma in one patient, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in one patient, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder in one patient, and hemorrhagic infarction in one patient. The three patients with lung cancer were subsequently treated with standard curative resection.Conclusions:Solitary pulmonary nodules present in several serious but potentially curable diseases, such as early-stage lung cancer. Patients who present with solitary pulmonary nodules after liver transplantation should be evaluated by standard diagnostic procedures, including surgical biopsy if necessary.
