Aim: Synthesis of poly-L-lactic acid nanoparticles comprising of microtubule-inhibitor docetaxel and tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib (PLDS NPs) for hepatoma treatment. Materials & methods: PLDS NPs were prepared by the emulsion solvent evaporation method and the anticancer activity was evaluated in Huh7 hepatoma cells. Results: Real-time imaging of quantum dots incorporating poly-L-lactic acid nanoparticles showed a rapid internalization of the nanoparticles in Huh7 cells. PLDS NPs exerted stronger antiproliferative, apoptotic and antiangiogenic effects than free single drug counterparts. They strongly promoted microtubule bundling, multinucleation and increased mitotic index in Huh7 cells. They also inhibited the expression of pERK1/2, pAKT and cyclin D1. Conclusion: We developed a single-nanoscale platform for dual drug delivery and high-sensitivity quantum dots imaging for hepatoma treatment. [Formula: see text].
