Backgrounds/aims:We conducted this study to identify long-term outcomes following intraoperative radiofrequency ablation (IO-RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to reveal independent prognostic factors for survival.Methods:From December 1998 to February 2019, 183 patients underwent IO-RFA for HCC. These patients were divided into two groups according to whether RFA was done as a first-line (1-RFA group, n=106) or secondary-line (2-RFA group, n=77) treatment. Furthermore, we compared the survival outcomes between the 1-RFA and 2-RFA groups.Results:There were no significant differences in type of surgical approaches between the two groups (p=0.079). The number of tumors and largest tumor size were not significantly different between the two groups. Overall recurrence rate was 53%, and the 2-RFA group showed a higher recurrence rate (46.2% in 1-RFA group versus 62.3% in 2-RFA group; p=0.031). The 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates of all the patients were 75.2% and 27.9%, respectively. The OS and DFS rates were significantly higher in the 1-RFA group. The 5-year OS rates were 83.6% and 64.9% in the 1-RFA and 2-RFA groups, respectively (p=0.010), whereas the 5-year DFS rates were 32.2% and 21.6%, respectively (p=0.012). On multivariate analysis, HBV-LC, 2-RFA, recurrence, and postoperative complications were independent predictive factors for survival.Conclusions:Therapeutic outcomes of IO-RFA were comparable to those of surgical resection. Additionally, 1-RFA might be an alternative treatment for na√Øve HCC in patients with uncompensated liver function and severe comorbidities.
