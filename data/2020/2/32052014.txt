Background:The causal link of sustained virological response (SVR) with outcome has been challenged. With markedly improved SVR rates with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), the benefit of SVR would be expected to diminish if the association with outcome is not causal.Methods:Data were collected for patients starting treatment with interferon (IFN) or DAAs between June 2006 and December 2016. To control for disease severity, patients were IFN-eligible (IDEAL) based on criteria for the IDEAL peginterferon trial. Clinical events were decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation and all-cause mortality.Results:In 1078 IDEAL-eligible patients, 1306 treatments occurred; 52% IFN, 49% DAAs. Cirrhosis was present in 30% DAAs vs. 21% IFN (PConclusions:In IFN-eligible patients, SVR is more commonly achieved with DAAs and confers a similar clinical benefit as in those treated with IFN. The higher SVR rate and reduced event rate with DAAs compared to IFN, despite similar disease severity, confirms that SVR alters prognosis and is thus a surrogate endpoint leading to improved clinical outcomes.
