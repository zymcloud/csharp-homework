Objective:Based on the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) and platelet-albumin-bilirubin (PALBI) grade to assess the long-term outcomes of patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transarterial chemoembolization combined with cryoablation (TACE-CRA).Materials and methods:We studied 86 patients with HCC nodules (up to 3 HCCs with maximum diameters of 4.1-12.0 cm) who subsequently underwent TACE-CRA from July 2007 to August 2018. The overall survival (OS) was compared between groups classified by ALBI and PALBI grade. Baseline characteristics were collected to identify the risk factors for determination of poor OS after TACE-CRA. The prognostic performances of CTP class, ALBI and PALBI grade were compared.Results:After a median follow-up time of 33.8 months, 41 patients had died. The cumulative1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates were 74.5%, 38.0% and 29.3%, respectively. Stratified according to ALBI grade, the cumulative 3- and 5-year OS rates were 41.2% and 41.2% in grade 1, respectively, and 20.9% and 9.8% in grades 2-3, respectively (P < 0.001). Stratified according to PALBI grade, the cumulative 3- and 5-year OS rates were 41.2% and 37.5% in grade 1, respectively, and 36.3% and 21.2% in grades 2-3, respectively (P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis results showed that older age, and ALBI grade 2-3 were associated with overall mortality. ALBI grade demonstrated significantly greater area under the curve values than CTP class and PALBI in predicting 1-, 3- and 5-year OS.Conclusion:ALBI grade offers accurate prediction of long-term outcome for patients with HCC (diameter > 4 cm) after TACE-CRA.
