Background:Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is often associated with metabolic syndrome (type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance, and obesity). NAFLD is multi-factorial in pathogenesis with some genetic predisposition. The variant patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) is known to be an independent risk factor for hepatocellular cancer (HCC). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of PNPLA3 polymorphism as the risk factor for NAFLD.Methodology:Patients had histological, ultrasonographic, biopsy evidence of NAFLD (n=248) and 81 controls were studied for PNPLA3 polymorphism. PNPLA3 genotyping was done from peripheral blood DNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).Results:PNPLA3 genotyping of the groups NAFLD (CC [n = 76], CG [n = 83], GG [n = 89]) and control (CC [n= 42], CG [n = 22], GG [n = 17]) was determined. In the patient group, the G allele was 261 (52.63%) and the C allele was 235 (47.37%), whereas in the control group, the G allele was 56 (34.54%) and the C allele was 106 (65.43%). In our study, 53 out of 174 women had GG allele and 54 out of 155 men had GG allele.Conclusion:The findings suggest that there is a predominant relationship between men with PNPLA3 I148M variant with NAFLD in women. Patients with NAFLD carrying PNPLA3 rs738409 G>C variant are at higher risk of NAFLD.
