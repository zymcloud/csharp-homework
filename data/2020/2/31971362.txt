Nanomedicine uses nanotechnology-based strategies for precision tumor therapy, including passive and ligand-mediated active tumor targeting by nanocarriers. However, the possible biotoxicity of chemosynthetic nanovectors limits their clinical applications. A novel natural egg yolk lipid nanovector (EYLN) was developed for effective loading and delivery of therapeutic agents. Lipids were extracted from egg yolks and reassembled into nanosized particles. EYLNs' stability, cellular uptake, toxicity, and delivery capacity for therapeutic agents were evaluated in vitro. The systemic toxicity and biodistribution of EYLNs were analyzed in normal mice, and the therapeutic effects of doxorubicin (Dox)-loaded EYLNs were evaluated in mouse breast cancer and hepatoma models. EYLNs had a particle size of ∼40 nm and a surface ζ-potential of -45 mV and were effectively internalized by tumor cells, without showing toxicity and side effects in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, their excellent permeability and retention effect significantly enhanced the distribution of EYLNs at tumor sites, and EYLN-Dox effectively inhibited the tumor growth in both mouse models. Targeted modification with folic acid further promoted vector-mediated drug distribution in tumors. This study demonstrates that lipids with specific proportions in the egg yolk can be used to construct natural drug vectors, providing a new strategy for nano-oncology research.
