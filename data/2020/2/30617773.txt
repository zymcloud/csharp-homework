Background:The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing worldwide. Higher perioperative risks may be anticipated due to underlying steatohepatitis, while long-term outcomes after liver resection are unknown. We sought to investigate outcomes after liver resection for NAFLD-HCC versus hepatitis B virus (HBV)-HCC using propensity score matching (PSM).Methods:Consecutive patients who underwent liver resection for HCC between 2003 and 2014 were identified from a multicenter database. Patients with NAFLD-HCC were matched one-to-one to patients with HBV-HCC.Results:Among 1483 patients identified, 96 (6.5%) had NAFLD-HCC and 1387 (93.5%) had HBV-HCC. Patients with NAFLD-HCC were older (median age 57 vs. 50 years), more often overweight (50.0% vs. 37.5%), less often to have cirrhosis (30.2% vs. 72.5%) and liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh B: 4.2% vs. 10.7%), had larger tumor size (median 7.2 vs. 6.2 cm) yet had better tumor differentiation (27.1% vs. 17.6%) compared with patients with HBV-HCC (all P 0.05). No differences were noted in median OS and RFS among patient with NAFLD-HCC versus HBV-HCC before or after PSM.Conclusion:While patients with NAFLD-HCC had different clinical characteristics than patients with HBV-HCC, liver resection resulted in similar perioperative outcomes and comparable OS and RFS among patients with NAFLD-HCC and HBV-HCC.
