Background:Rash is one of the most common severe adverse events associated with use of vemurafenib for the treatment of melanoma, either as monotherapy or in combination with cobimetinib. The study aimed to identify pre-treatment patient characteristics predictive of developing severe rash with vemurafenib therapy.Methods:This was a secondary pooled analysis of individual patient data from the BRIM-2, BRIM-3 and coBRIM clinical trials, including all patients treated with vemurafenib alone and vemurafenib plus cobimetinib. Patient age, sex, performance status, body weight, body mass index, liver function markers and estimated glomerular filtration rate were assessed for association with development of severe (grade 3 or 4) rash using logistic regression.Results:Of 962 patients treated with vemurafenib, 150 (16%) patients experienced severe rash. Female sex was identified as a significant risk factor for severe rash development (P < 0.001), having a two-fold increased risk compared to males (22% vs 11%, odds ratio [OR] 2.17; 95% CI 1.52 to 3.09). Low body weight was also associated with increased risk of severe rash (P = 0.002), but this association was not significant after adjustment for sex. The association between sex and risk of severe rash was consistent across clinical trials and treatments (vemurafenib monotherapy, vemurafenib plus cobimetinib).Conclusion:Females had approximately two-fold increased risk of developing severe rash compared to males in clinical trials of vemurafenib alone or in combination with cobimetinib.
