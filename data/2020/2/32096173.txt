Objective:Recently, the vital role of circular RNAs is discovered in many diseases including tumor progression and metastasis. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most ordinary malignant tumors. The purpose of our study is to detect the potential function of hsa_circ_0011946 in HCC to offer new biomarkers and targets.Patients and methods:The level of hsa_circ_0011946 in HCC tissues and cell lines was monitored by Real Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). Pearson's Chi-square test was used to determine the association between hsa_circ_0011946 expression and several clinicopathological factors. Then, hsa_circ_0011946 was knocked down in HCC cells to uncover its function in metastasis of HCC. Cell migrated and invaded ability was measured through transwell assay, Matrigel assay and wound healing assay. Western blot assay was performed to analyze the effect of hsa_circ_0011946 on the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process.Results:In this research, the expression level of hsa_circ_0011946 was significantly increased in HCC tissues compared to that in adjacent samples. The expression of hsa_circ_0011946 was also increased in HCC cell lines. The hsa_circ_0011946 expression was associated with lymphatic metastasis in HCC patients. Knockdown of hsa_circ_0011946 led to the inhibition of cell migration and invasion in HCC. In addition, results of further experiments revealed that the EMT-related proteins were regulated via the knockdown of hsa_circ_0011946 in HCC.Conclusions:The hsa_circ_0011946 could enhance cell migration and invasion of HCC by inducing the EMT process.
