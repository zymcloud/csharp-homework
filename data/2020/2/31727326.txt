Background:The indocyanine green test is used widely to evaluate the risk of posthepatectomy liver failure for hepatocellular carcinoma. A more convenient and reliable scoring system is desired owing to limited accuracy and availability of the indocyanine green test. This study aimed to establish a new selection criterion for liver resection in HCC.Methods:We reviewed retrospectively 876 patients undergoing a partial hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma between 2007 and 2015 in 8 affiliated hospitals. Posthepatectomy liver failure grades B and C were regarded as posthepatectomy liver failure. We identified the risk factors for posthepatectomy liver failure and established a predictive model based on a formula for the probability of posthepatectomy liver failure. External validation was performed in an additional cohort of 250 patients.Results:Posthepatectomy liver failure occurred in 92 patients (11%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the prediction of posthepatectomy liver failure was 0.646 for the platelet count, 0.641 for albumin, 0.623 for the percentage of liver remnant, and 0.607 for the plasma disappearance rate of indocyanine green. Logistic regression analysis provided a formula for the probability of posthepatectomy liver failure consisting of platelet count, albumin, and liver remnant. We defined platelet count + 90 Ã— albumin as the ALPlat index and established an ALPlat-based criterion for operative resection that secured the same risk assumed by the indocyanine green-based criterion (Makuuchi's criterion). This criterion exhibited a greater sensitivity and specificity than the indocyanine green-based criterion in the validation cohort.Conclusion:The ALPlat criterion is a simple and useful method to assess liver function and to make therapeutic decisions in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
