Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is recognized as one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide. The disease's tendency to quickly metastasize precludes many patients from receiving curative therapy. The most common sites of distal metastases include the liver, lungs, bones, and brain. We report a case of ESCC metastasizing to the rectosigmoid region years after treatment with neoadjuvant chemoradiation and esophagectomy. To our knowledge, only a handful of cases of ESCC with colonic metastases have been previously documented.
