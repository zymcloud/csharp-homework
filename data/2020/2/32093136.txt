Chemical investigation of the ethyl acetate extract of Penicillium chrysogenum strain S003, a fungus isolated from Red Sea deep sediment, led to the isolation of a cerebroside molecular species LAMA (1) along with three other known compounds, ergosterol (2), epidioxyergosterol (3), and kojic acid (4). The structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated by interpretation of spectral data, including detailed 1D and 2D NMR (One and two dimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) and mass spectrometry. The cytotoxic activities of isolated compounds 1-4 against five human carcinoma cells were evaluated using sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Compounds 2 and 3 displayed promising cytotoxic profiles against lung cancer (A-549), prostate (DU-145), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), and hepatocellular (HepG2) cell lines, with IC50 values of 21.26, 19.3; 1.50, 6.10; 16.95, 13.6; and 2.89, 3.07 ÂµM, respectively, while they were inactive against HeLa cells. Compounds 1 and 4 showed weak cytotoxic profiles against all cell lines under investigation.
