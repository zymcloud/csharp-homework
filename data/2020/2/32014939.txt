Ewing sarcoma (ES) is an undifferentiated small round blue cell tumor most commonly originating in the bone of adolescents 10-20 years of age, although 30% are diagnosed in adults. The most important prognostic factor is the presence of metastatic disease. Results of the EURO-EWING 99 trial of ES patients showed that local treatment of not only the primary, but also of the sites of metastatic disease should be considered to improve event-free survival. The use of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has been extensively reported for tumors of lung, liver, pancreas, and spine. The use of SBRT in these sites is well-accepted. Here, we report a detailed case of SBRT to multisite metastatic ES. We demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of aggressive local control with multisite SBRT for the treatment of metastatic ES.
