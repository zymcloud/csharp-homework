The microbiome exerts essential functions in health and disease, modulating key processes in metabolism, inflammation and immunity. Recent evidence has revealed a key role of the microbiome in carcinogenesis as well as anti-cancer immune responses in mouse models and patients. Herein, we will review functions of the gut microbiome in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the third leading cause of worldwide cancer mortality. The majority of HCC develops in patients with chronic liver disease, caused by viral hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcohol-related fatty liver disease. In this review, we will discuss mechanisms by which the gut-liver axis promotes the development of HCC in mouse models and patients, including dysbiosis, the leaky gut and bacterial metabolites, with a particular focus on NAFLD as the fastest growing cause of HCC development. Moreover, we will review recent progress in harnessing the gut microbiome as a potential diagnostic tool and novel therapeutic target in patients with HCC, in particular in the setting of immunotherapy.
