Background:The various pathogenesis between Clear cell renal carcinoma (CCRCC) and Chromophobe renal carcinoma (CHRCC) contributes to the different tumor growth rate and metastasis. In this study, we explored the distinct proteomic profiles between these two cancers and found different expression of glycogen phosphorylases in two cancers.Methods:We explored novel targets by proteomics. Five CCRCC cases and five CHRCC cases were selected for tandem mass tag-labeling liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). Gene ontology and KEGG pathway were applied for bioinformatic analysis. Glycogen phosphorylases were detected by Western blotting.Results:CHRCC were younger, more commonly female, and had larger tumors compared to those with CCRCC. 101 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in CCRCC and 235 DEPs in CHRCC were detected by LC-MS. It was found that disruption of metabolic pathways, epithelial cell differentiation, and cell response were the common characters for two tumor types. Activation of cell-cell adhesion and oxidation-reduction process stimulate CCRCC growth and epithelial cell differentiation and transferrin transport was involved in CHRCC growth, We also found that oxidative phosphorylation is activated in CHRCC and inhibited in CCRCC. More importantly, we found and confirmed that upregulation of glycogen phosphorylase liver type in CCRCC and glycogen phosphorylase brain type in CHRCC mediated differential glycogenolysis in the two tumor types, which could serve as potential therapeutic targets.Conclusion:We found different expression of glycogen phosphorylases in CCRCC and CHRCC by quantitative proteomics, which provides potential therapeutic targets in the future.
