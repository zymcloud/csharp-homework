To get chelidonine derivatives with enhanced antiproliferative activity and selectivity, a series of nitric oxide donating derivatives (10a-f and 11a-j) were designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated. Compared with chelidonine, these compounds exhibited lower IC50 values against human hepatoma cells HepG2, breast cancer cells MCF-7, colon cancer cells HCT-116, as well as leukemia cells K562. Compound 11j displayed the strongest antiproliferative activity with IC50 values of 3.91, 6.90, 4.36 and 1.12 μM against the above four cells, respectively. Nevertheless, it showed an IC50 value >40 μM against human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which demonstrated high selectivity between normal and cancer blood cells. In further mechanism studies, 11j showed the capability to induce K562 cells apoptosis, S phase cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial membrane potential disorder. Besides, 11j was found to be effective in promoting the expression of proapoptotic protein Bad and suppressing the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL, catalase, survivin, claspin and clusterin.
