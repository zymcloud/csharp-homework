Increased extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells are two fundamental mediators of tumor progression, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Yet, the correlation between ECM stiffness and excessive aerobic glycolysis in promoting the development of HCC remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that stiffer ECM promotes HCC cell migration depending on their accelerated aerobic glycolysis. Our results also indicated that stiffer ECM-induced YAP activation plays a major role in promoting aerobic glycolysis of HCC cells. Moreover, we showed that JNK and p38 MAPK signaling are critical for mediating YAP activation in HCC cells. Together, our findings established that the MAPK-YAP signaling cascade that act as a mechanotransduction pathway is essential for promoting HCC cell aerobic glycolysis and migration in response to ECM stiffness.
