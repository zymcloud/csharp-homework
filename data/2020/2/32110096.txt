Introduction:The functions of DCST1-AS1 have been investigated in liver cancer, while its role in endometrial carcinoma (EC) remains hardly known. This study aimed to analyze the role of DCST1-AS1 in EC.Methods:Paired EC and non-tumor tissue samples were obtained from 62 EC patients. These patients were followed up for 5 years since their admission to record their survival conditions. HEC-1 cells were transfected with DCST1-AS1, Notch1 vectors, miRNA negative control or miR-92a-3p mimic. Luciferase activity was measured. QPCR and Western blot were applied to determine the RNA level and protein expression, respectively. The invasion and migration of HEC-1 cells were analyzed by Transwell assay.Results:We in this study found that DCST1-AS1 was upregulated in EC. Survival analysis revealed that high levels of DCST1-AS1 expression predicted poor survival of EC patients. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that miR-92a-3p may bind DCST1-AS1 and the interaction between them was further confirmed by dual-luciferase activity assay. However, overexpression of miR-92a-3p and DCST1-AS1 failed to affect the expression of each other. Moreover, DCST1-AS1 overexpression led to upregulated Notch1 and increased cancer cell invasion and migration rates. Overexpression of miR-92a-3p played an opposite role and attenuated the effects of DCST1-AS1 overexpression.Discussion:DCST1-AS1 is downregulated in EC and may sponge miR-92a-3p, thereby promoting cancer cell invasion and migration.
