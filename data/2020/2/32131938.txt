Objective To study the gene expression of cardiac mesenchymal cells in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)based on a whole-genome high-throughput sequencing dataset,screen differentially expressed genes,analyze the genetics signature of cardiac mesenchymal cells in T2DM patients by bioinformatics analysis,and explore the environmental chemicals related to the key differentially expressed genes. Methods The dataset GSE106177 was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.The dataset was pre-processed and analyzed by Network Analyst,Cytoscape 3.7.1,String11.0,CTD,and HMDD for screening for differentially expressed genes,enrichment analysis,establishment of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks,and screening for relevant environmental chemicals. Results The gene expression pattern of cardiac mesenchymal cells in T2DM patients was significantly different from that in the control group.There were 135 differentially expressed genes,of which 58 (42.96%) were up-regulated and 77 (57.04%) were down-regulated.The differentially expressed genes mainly participated in biological processes such as multicellular organism development,anatomical structure development,and system development and were mainly involved in hepatocellular carcinoma,Cushing's syndrome,and cholesterol metabolism.PPI network showed that UBC was the core protein node.The microRNA-Gene interaction network showed that seven microRNAs,represented by hsa-mir-8485,interacted with the differentially expressed genes.Key T2DM related genes such as UBC,DNER,and CNTN1 interacted with bisphenol A. Conclusions The gene expression profile of cardiac mesenchymal cells markedly changes in T2DM patients,during which UBC may play an important biological role.Bisphenol A exposure may also affect the development and normal function of cardiac cells in T2DM patients.
