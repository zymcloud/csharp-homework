At presentation, isolated metastasis from oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is rare. Liver is a relatively uncommon first site of failure, especially in the absence of other distant metastases, particularly without diagnosis of lung metastases. We report on a case of HPV-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with synchronous liver metastasis treated with radiation therapy. This condition, defined as "oligometastatic state," describes a subset of patients with limited volume metastatic disease in whom favorable outcomes were reported with the use of local ablative therapies on both the primary tumor and metastatic sites. As a definitive treatment, we offered the patient, ineligible for other therapeutic approaches, exclusive radiation treatment on the head and neck region and a stereotactic ablative approach targeted to the liver metastasis.
