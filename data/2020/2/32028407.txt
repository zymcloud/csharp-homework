Rationale:AA amyloidosis (AA) is caused by a wide variety of inflammatory states, but is infrequently associated with Castleman disease (CD). CD describes a heterogeneous group of hematologic disorders that share characteristic lymph node histopathology. CD can present with a solitary enlarged lymph node (unicentric CD, UCD) or with multicentric lymphadenopathy (MCD), constitutional symptoms, cytopenias, and multiple organ dysfunction due to an interleukin-6 driven cytokine storm.Patient concerns:We are reporting a case of a 26-year-old woman with no significant past medical history who presented with a 3-month history of fatigue and an unintentional 20-pound weight loss.Diagnosis:A CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed hepatosplenomegaly and a mesenteric mass. Congo Red staining from a liver biopsy showed apple-green birefringence and serum markers were suggestive of an inflammatory process. Post-excision examination of the resected mass revealed a reactive lymph node with follicular hyperplasia with kappa and lambda stains showing polyclonal plasmacytosis consistent with CD.Interventions:The patient underwent surgery to remove the affected lymph node.Outcomes:IL-6, anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis resolved or normalized 2 weeks after resection; creatinine normalized 9 months postsurgery. Twenty two months post-surgery her IFN-Î³ normalized, her fatigue resolved, her proteinuria was reduced by >90% and she had returned to her baseline weight.Lessons:Our case and literature review suggest that patients presenting with UCD or MCD along with organ failure should prompt consideration of concurrent AA amyloidosis.
