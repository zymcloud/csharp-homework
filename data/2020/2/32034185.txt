Phosphoproteins are the key indicators of signaling network pathway activation. Many disease treatment therapies are designed to inhibit these pathways and effective diagnostics are required to evaluate the efficacy of these treatments. Phosphoprotein IHC have been impractical for diagnostics due to inconsistent results occurring from technical limitations. We have designed and tested a novel cold transport device and rapid cold plus warm formalin fixation protocol using phosphoproteins IHC. We collected 50 liver tumors that were split into two experimental conditions: 2 + 2 rapid fixation (2 hours cold then 2 hour warm formalin) or 4 hour room-temperature formalin. We analyzed primary hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 10) and metastatic gastrointestinal tumors (n = 28) for phosphoprotein IHC markers pAKT, pERK, pSRC, pSTAT3, and pSMAD2 and compared them to slides obtained from the clinical blocks. Expression of pERK and pSRC, present in the metastatic colorectal carcinoma, were better preserved with the rapid processing protocol while pSTAT3 expression was detected in hepatocellular carcinoma. Differences in pSMAD2 expression were difficult to detect due to the ubiquitous nature of protein expression. There were only 3 cases expressing pAKT and all exhibited a dramatic loss of signal for the standard clinical workflow. The rapid cold preservation shows improvement in phosphoprotein preservation.
