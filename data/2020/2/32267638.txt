Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of fatty liver disease. NAFLD is defined as the presence of fatty liver disease observed in imaging or histopathological examinations when there is no secondary cause such as excessive alcohol use or use of certain medications. NAFLD encompasses a whole spectrum, from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis ('non-alcoholic steatohepatitis', NASH), fibrosis and - ultimately - cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Several factors play a role in the complex pathogenesis of NAFLD such as genetic predisposition, overweight, insulin resistance, inflammation, bile salts, gut microbiome and nutrition. Patients with NAFLD have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma. To date, no medicines have been authorised for the treatment of NAFLD. The cornerstone of NAFLD treatment is lifestyle adjustment aimed at weight reduction.
