Aim:To evaluate the efficacy of chemotherapy with itraconazole for advanced or recurrent gastric cancer.Patients and methods:Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative unresectable gastric cancer referred to our hospital were included. The regimen comprised 160 mg/m2 nab-paclitaxel i.v. and 100 mg/m2 oxaliplatin i.v. on day 1, 60 mg/m2 S-1 orally on days 1-3, and 400 mg itraconazole orally on days -2 to 2, repeated every 2 weeks for 6-8 cycles.Results:Twenty-three patients aged 40-80 years (median age=68 years) were enrolled, of whom 21 had stomach cancer and two gastroesophageal junction cancer. Regarding stage, two, one, and 20 patients had stage IIIA, IIIB, and IV, respectively. Among patients with liver metastases, 2/10 had simultaneous lung metastases. Nine patients had peritoneal dissemination, and five patients with stage IV disease developed recurrence after primary surgery followed by adjuvant S-1. The other 18 patients had no history of surgery or chemotherapy. The response rate was 70% (complete response in two; partial response in 14). Among 12 patients (67%) who underwent conversion surgery, R0 resection was conducted in eight, and no residual tumour was observed in two. For the population overall, the median overall survival was 24 months (95% confidence intervaI=21 months-not reached) and the 1-year overall survival rate was 95% (95% confidence intervaI=67-98%). Grade 3/4 neutropenia and grade 2 peripheral sensory neuropathy occurred in five (22%) and six (26%) patients, respectively, while no patient developed grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia.Conclusion:Chemotherapy with itraconazole is promising for patients with unresectable gastric cancer.
