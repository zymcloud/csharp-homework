The effectiveness of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is ascertained. However, some authors raised the issue of an increased incidence of de novo hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients treated with DAAs. Aim of the study was to evaluate the rate of HCC occurrence in a real-life cohort of patients who received anti-HCV treatment with DAAs.A prospective multicentre study was conducted. All adult patients with HCV infection who received treatment between March 2015 and December 2017 in 4 hospital of Campania region (South Italy) with at least 6 months of follow-up were enrolled.A total of 323 patients were included in the study. Most patients had HCV genotype 1b (61.8%). The overall SVR12 rate was 95.5%. Median time of observation was 10 months. The incidence rate of HCC was 0.2 per 100 person-months (crude incidence rate 3.4%, 95 confidence interval: 1.5%-5.3%). The median time for HCC occurrence was 11 months. HCC occurrence rate was significantly higher among patients who did not achieve SVR12 compared with patients who did (28.6% vs 2.8%, P
