In Japan, the method of treatment for hepatitis is well established due to the high rates of hepatitis C. However, the identification of patients with hepatitis who do not receive appropriate treatment poses a major problem. Some patients with this disease may need to consult with a dentist due to the development of extrahepatic manifestations, such as lichen planus, in the oral cavity. Alternatively, the dentist might discover patients with untreated hepatitis C and hepatitis B during routine dental examination. In such cases, the patient should be referred to a hepatologist for further examinations and treatment. Thus, dentists are required to act as 'gatekeepers of hepatitis'. Furthermore, Japanese dentists need to increase hepatitis B vaccine coverage for infection control. By acting as a 'care coordinator of hepatitis', the dentist will be able to contribute to the eradication of liver cancer in Japan, thereby eliminating the discrimination and prejudice against patients with hepatitis. Dentists need to have a deep understanding of liver disease from the viewpoints of both nosocomial infection control and treatment of oral diseases.
