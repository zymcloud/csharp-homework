Based on recent advances in morphological and molecular research, tissue-based diagnostics of liver tumors exhibit a substantial dynamic. New clinically relevant tumor subtypes have been defined and the diagnostic criteria have been improved; examples are the new morphomolecular classifications of hepatocellular carcinoma and adenoma as well as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Therefore, molecular pathological diagnostics are gaining relevance in the identification of tumor types and therapeutic stratification. These developments are reflected in the new World Health Organization (WHO) classification of hepatobiliary tumors and the respective clinical practice guidelines.
Cholangiocarcinoma, intrahepatic; Hepatocellular Adenoma; Hepatocellular Carcinoma; Liver Biopsy; Molecular Pathology.
