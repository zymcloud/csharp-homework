Objective:Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the important players in liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. They also act as critical mediators of immunosuppression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we hypothesized that HSCs promote HCC progression via C3.Methods:C3 in HSCs was knocked down using a shRNA retroviral plasmid. The conditioned medium from HSCs or shC3 HSCs (knockdown of C3 by shRNA in HSCs) was collected to detect their effects on bone marrow (BM) and T cells (including expansion and apoptosis) in vitro, and in an HCC in situ model in mice.Results:We found that HSCs promoted T-cell apoptosis and decreased their proliferation, inhibited dendritic cell (DC) maturation, and induced myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) expansion through the C3 pathway in vitro. In addition, the knockdown of C3 suppressed HSC-promoted HCC development in the orthotopic transplantation tumor model of HCC in mice.Conclusion:These findings provide more insights into the immunomodulatory roles of HSCs in HCC progression and indicate that modulation of the C3 pathway might be a novel therapeutic approach for liver cancer.
