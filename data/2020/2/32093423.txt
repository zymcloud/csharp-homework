Bersavine is the new bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid isolated from the Berberis vulgaris L.(Berberidaceae) plant. The results of cytotoxicity screening 48 h post-treatment showed thatbersavine considerably inhibits the proliferation and viability of leukemic (Jurkat, MOLT-4), colon(HT-29), cervix (HeLa) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cells with IC50 values ranging from 8.1 to 11 μM.The viability and proliferation of leukemic Jurkat and MOLT-4 cells were decreased after bersavinetreatment in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Bersavine manifested concentration-dependentantiproliferative activity in human lung, breast, ovarian and hepatocellular carcinoma cell linesusing a xCELLigence assay. Significantly higher percentages of MOLT-4 cells exposed to bersavineat 20 μM for 24 h were arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle using the flow cytometry method.The higher percentage of apoptotic cells was measured after 24 h of bersavine treatment. Theupregulation of p53 phosphorylated on Ser392 was detected during the progression of MOLT-4 cellapoptosis. Mechanistically, bersavine-induced apoptosis is an effect of increased activity ofcaspases, while reduced proliferation seems dependent on increased Chk1 Ser345 phosphorylationand decreased Rb Ser807/811 phosphorylation in human leukemic cells.
