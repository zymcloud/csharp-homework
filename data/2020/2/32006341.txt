Background and aim:Sodium valproate (SV), a novel class of histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitors commonly used as an antiepileptic drug. HDAC inhibitors are known to possess anticancer potentials. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic potential of SV in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2 cells) cell line.Methods:MTT assay was used to analyze cytotoxicity. Intracellular ROS and cytochrome c expression were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Morphology-related apoptosis was analyzed by dual staining with acridine orange/ethidium bromide. Caspase 3 protein expression was investigated by Western blotting analysis.Results:Sodium valproate treatments in HepG2 cells caused significant and dose-dependent cytotoxicity. Intracellular ROS was remarkably increased in the cells which are treated with SV and caused early and late apoptosis as evidenced by dual staining. SV-treated cells expressed cytochrome c and caspase 3 protein expression.Conclusion:These results suggest the cytotoxic potentials of SV in HepG2 cells. This study may give an important clue for the inclusion of SV as an adjuvant along with standard anticancer agents after necessary in vivo and clinical studies.
