The precise role of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells is unknown and EGFR inhibitors have not achieved positive clinical results. The rapid and drastic internalization of EGFR has been proved to successfully treat EGFR inhibitor-resistant patients in recent clinical trials. Here, the anti-tumor efficacy of a protein (rLZ-8) from Ganoderma lucidum was evaluated, it was demonstrated that rLZ-8 could bind to EGFR specifically, drastically enter into Hepatoma cells, abrogate endosomal recycling and induce HCC cell death. Surprisingly, we screened a monoclonal antibody which possesses competitive binding site with rLZ-8, it also trigger catastrophic EGFR internalization. This result suggests that it is necessary to investigate the interface of EGFR and rLZ-8 complex. An internalization related epitope (S222/K269) was identified on the dimerization arm of EGFR extracellular domain (ECD). These results suggest vulnerability of HCC cells to catastrophic EGFR internalization that can be targeted by a novel epitope and point to the possible exploitation in the design of anti-EGFR therapeutic biologics for HCC therapy.
