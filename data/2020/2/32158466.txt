Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent neoplasms worldwide, particularly in China. Immune-related genes (IRGs) and immune infiltrating lymphocytes play specific roles in tumor growth. Considering how important immunotherapy has become for HCC treatment in the past decade, our objective was to establish a prognostic model by screening survival-related IRGs in patients with HCC. Using edgeR, we identified differentially expressed IRGs (DEIRGs), DEmiRNAs, and DElncRNAs. Functional enrichment analysis of DEIRGs was performed to investigate the biological functions of IRGs via gene ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. Protein-protein interaction and competing endogenous RNA networks were established using Cytoscape. Survival-associated IRGs were selected via univariate COX regression analysis, a The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) prognostic model and GSE76427 validation model were developed using multivariate COX regression analysis test by AIC (Akaike Information Criterion). We identified 116 DEIRGs in patients with HCC; the "cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction" pathway was found to be the most enriched pathway. Via the prognostic model helped us classify patients into high- and low-risk score groups based on overall survival (OS); high risk score was associated with worse OS, and a positive correlation was observed between the prognostic model and immune cell infiltration. To summarize, we established a prognostic model using survival-related IRGs that provides sufficient information for prognosis prediction and immunotherapy of patients with HCC.
