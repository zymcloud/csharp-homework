Introduction:Chemotherapeutic treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has always been plagued by nonspecific and side effects. Plant extracts have potential anticancer capabilities with low cytotoxicity and few side effects, but their detailed mechanisms are still unclear, thus limiting their clinical applications.Methods:In this study, five plant extracts were chosen, their inhibition on HCC cell viability was compared by CCK-8 assay and sanguinarine (SAN) was selected. Then, wound healing assay, transwell assay, and apoptosis assay were carried out in Hep3B cells. Bioinformatics methods were performed and IGFBP-3 was predicted the targets of SAN in HCC. The mechanism of SAN regulating IGFBP-3 was explored using qRT-PCR, Western blotting, cell viability assay and apoptosis assay. Meanwhile, knockdown of IGFBP-3 were used by small interfering RNA (siRNA).Results:In five plant extracts, SAN inhibited the proliferation of HCC cell lines most considerably. In addition, apoptosis was promoted, and invasion and migration were inhibited in the Hep3B cell line by treatment with SAN at 2 Î¼M. Bioinformatics indicated that SAN could affect HCC apoptosis through the TP53/IGFBP-3 pathway, and further verification experiments showed that SAN upregulated the expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) in the Hep3B cell line; SAN also inhibited the expression of Bcl-2 and promoted the expression of BAX and caspase-3. After using siRNA to inhibit the expression of IGFBP-3, the effect of SAN was blocked.Conclusion:Our study further reveals a novel mechanism that IGFBP-3 is an important target of SAN, by upregulating expression of IGFBP-3, SAN promotes apoptosis in HCC.
