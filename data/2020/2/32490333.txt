Among the recent topics in the field of liver transplantation (LT), one of the significant therapeutic breakthroughs is the introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. With cure rates close to 100%, a better proportion of LT candidates and recipients can be cured of HCV infection by DAA therapies that are simple and well-tolerated. Other critical topics include the issue of indication of LT for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, which has been continuously studied. Several expanded criteria beyond the Milan criteria with acceptable results have been recently reported. The role of donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) in intractable rejection is also an important matter that has been studied. Although long recognized as an important factor in antibody-mediated rejection and even graft survival in renal transplantation, the impact of DSAs on graft and patient survival in LT remains to be elucidated. Including the issues described above, this article focuses on recent advances in LT, management to avoid recurrence of primary diseases, optimization of immunosuppressive treatment, and extended donor criteria.
