Objective:This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) using CalliSpheres beads loading with arsenic trioxide (ATO) (CBATO) in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Patients and methods:Eighty-six unresectable HCC patients about to receive TACE with CBATO or conventional TACE (cTACE) with ATO were consecutively enrolled and divided into CBATO group (N=38) or cTACE group (N=48), respectively. Treatment response at 3 months (M3) and 6 months (M6) after the first treatment, and the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. Also, the biochemical indexes were documented before treatment, at 7 days, M3, and M6 after the first treatment.Results:The 3-month complete response (CR), overall response rate (ORR), and the 6-month CR, ORR, as well as the disease control rate (DCR) were increased in CBATO group compared with the cTACE group. Also, the TACE with CBATO was an independent predicting factor for lower stable disease+ progressive disease (non-ORR). Besides, PFS and OS were longer in CBATO group compared with cTACE group. Referring to biochemical indexes (including liver function indexes, kidney function indexes, and blood routine indexes), no difference between the two groups was found. As for adverse events, the prevalence of nausea and vomiting was decreased, while the prevalence of other adverse events were similar in CBATO group compared to cTACE group.Conclusions:TACE with CBATO is more effective and equally tolerant compared with cTACE in treating unresectable HCC patients.
