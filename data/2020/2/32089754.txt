Aims:Persistent hepatic necroinflammatory damage almost always results in fibrosis/cirrhosis or even hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, the presence of active necroinflammation in the liver suggests that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients are in urgent need of treatment. Unfortunately, alanine transaminase (ALT), a routine indicator of liver inflammatory damage, showed a poor performance in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients. Thus, it will be valuable to find an alternative indicator to identify patients with hepatic necroinflammatory damage. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic value of serum Golgi protein 73 (GP73) for hepatic necroinflammatory damage in patients with NASH.Methods:The clinical data of 201 patients with NASH diagnosed by liver biopsy according to the Brunt staging system were collected retrospectively. The in situ expression of GP73 protein was measured by immunohistochemistry. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to calculate the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of serum GP73 for diagnosing hepatic necroinflammatory damage.Results:The serum GP73 levels of NASH patients increased with the aggravation of liver necroinflammation. The median levels significantly increased from 49.98 ng/ml (31.49, 75.05) for G0-1 to 76.61 ng/ml (48.68, 110.03) for G2 and to 116.44 ng/ml (103.41, 162.17) for G3 patients (G0-1 vs. G2, P < 0.0001; G2 vs. G2, P < 0.0001; G2.Conclusions:GP73 is a valuable alternative serum marker reflecting the severity of hepatic necroinflammation in NASH patients.
