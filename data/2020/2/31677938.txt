Background:Breast cancer liver metastases (BCLM) is considered a systemic disease with poorly defined selection criteria for surgery and little evidence for the appropriate timing of surgery.Methods:Postoperative outcomes of patients operated for BCLM were retrospectively reviewed and compared based on the timing of surgery, with the early surgery (ES) group treated â‰¤12 months after BCLM diagnosis, and late surgery (LS) group operated >12 months after diagnosis.Results:Seventy-two patients with BCLM underwent liver surgery, including 37 and 35 in the ES and LS groups, respectively. Demographic and preoperative characteristics were similar between the groups, except that multifocal liver disease was more frequent in the LS group (p = 0.008). The LS group had a morbidity rate of 38%, compared to 11% in the ES group (p = 0.015). No postoperative deaths occurred. In the whole cohort, median progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 19 and 50 months, respectively, and 1-, 3- and 5-year PFS and OS were 63%, 41%, 24% and 93%, 66%, 43%, respectively, with no significant difference observed between the ES and LS groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that breast cancer progesterone receptor negativity (HR = 3.34, p = 0.03) and a size of LM > 40 mm (HR = 3.11, p = 0.01) were significant negative prognostic factors for PFS. Only a size of LM > 40 mm (HR = 2.79, p = 0.008) was significantly associated with shorter OS.Conclusion:A prolonged preoperative observational period does not improve long-term outcomes after liver surgery in patients with resectable BCLM, suggesting that early management can safely be proposed to those patients, with good oncological outcomes.
