Introduction: The goal of immunosuppressive therapy post-transplantation in pediatric renal transplant recipients is to prevent acute and chronic rejection while minimizing drug side effects. Most therapies alter immune response mechanisms but are not immunologically specific, and a careful balance is required to find the dose that prevents rejection of the graft, while minimizing the risks of over-immunosuppression leading to infection and cancer.Areas covered: This review article focuses on immunosuppressive therapy in pediatric renal transplant recipients, but many aspects can be applied on pediatric recipients of other solid organ transplants such as liver and heart. The major maintenance immunosuppressive agents currently used in various combination regimens are tacrolimus, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, everolimus, sirolimus, and glucocorticoids.Expert opinion: Although data from adult renal transplantation trials are used to help guide management decisions in pediatric patients, immunosuppressive therapy in pediatric renal transplant recipients often must be modified because of the unique dosage requirements and clinical effects of these agents in children, including their impact on growth and development. The optimal immunosuppressive therapy post-transplant is not established. The goal remains to find the best combination of immunosuppressive agents that optimizes allograft survival by preventing acute rejection while limiting drug toxicities.
