Aptamers offer a significant promise to target various cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), for their high affinity and ability to reach the target site(s), non-immunogenicity, and low cost. The targeting ability to neoplastic hepatocytes by the aptamer, TLS 9a with phosphorothioate backbone modification (designated as L5), has not been explored yet. Hence, we investigated the comparative potential of L5 with some other previously reported liver cancer cell-specific aptamers, conjugated on the surface of drug-nanocarriers. Various in vitro studies such as cytotoxicity, in vitro cellular uptake, cell cycle analysis, and investigations related to apoptosis were performed. In vivo studies carried out here include macroscopic and microscopic hepatic alterations in chemically induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rats, upon experimental treatments. The outcome of the investigations revealed that L5-functionalized drug-nanocarrier (PTX-NPL5) had the highest apoptotic potential compared with the other aptamer-conjugated experimental formulations. Further, its maximum internalization by neoplastic hepatocytes and minimum internalization by normal hepatocytes indicate that it had the potential to preferentially target the neoplastic hepatocytes. Data of in vivo studies revealed that PTX-NPL5 reduced tumor incidences and tumor progress. Superior potency of PTX-NPL5 may be due to the maximum affinity of L5 towards neoplastic hepatocytes resulting in maximum permeation of drug-nanocarrier in them. An effective site-specific targeting of neoplastic hepatocytes can be achieved by L5 for preferential delivery of therapeutics. Further, investigations are needed to identify the target protein(s) on neoplastic hepatocytes responsible for ligand-receptor interaction of L5.
