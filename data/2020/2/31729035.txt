Objectives:In this study, the antiproliferative activity of 3 phenyl 4-(2-oxo-3-alkylimidazolidin-1-yl)benzenesulfonates (PAIB-SOs) was assessed in a time-dependent manner together with their hepatic stability and metabolism using human, mouse and rat liver microsomes.Methods:CEU-818, -820 and -913 were selected as promising hit compounds. Their antiproliferative activity on human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells was evaluated using escalating concentrations of drugs at 24, 36 and 48 h and the sulforhodamine B assay. Their hepatic stability was evaluated by HPLC-UV of extracts obtained from human, mouse and rat liver microsomes.Key findings:The antiproliferative activity of PAIB-SOs is concentration and time-dependent and requires between 24 and 36 h of contact with MCF-7 cells to detect a significant antiproliferative activity. PAIB-SOs stability in microsomes usually decreases following this order: human â‰ˆ (rat > mouse). The CEU-913 exhibits the longest half-life in rat and human liver microsomes while the CEU-820 exhibits the longest half-life in mouse liver microsomes.Conclusions:Our in vitro results suggest that PAIB-SOs should have a minimum contact time of 24 h with the tumour to trigger significant antitumoural activity. The activity of mouse liver microsomes towards PAIB-SOs is higher than rat microsomes and tends to be higher than human liver microsomes.
