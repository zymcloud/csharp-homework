Aim:Glutamine synthetase (GS) levels increase gradually with the development of hepatocellular carcinogenesis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical significance of GS and the underlying mechanism of GS promoting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) invasion.Methods:Serum concentration of GS and Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) in HCC patients, liver cirrhosis patients, and healthy individuals were detected. The GS-mRNA level and its prognostic value were explored in an independent HCC cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. GS expression in HCC tissue and matched para-tumor tissue was determined. The effect of GS on HCC invasion was assessed in vitro and in vivo.Results:The serum GS and AFP level in HCC patients was higher than that in healthy controls and liver cirrhosis patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for HCC diagnosis was 0.848 and 0.861 for GS and AFP, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of GS for diagnosis of AFP-negative HCC was 0.913. Combining GS with AFP achieved a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 82.5% and 93%, respectively. The GS level was higher in tumor tissues than that in para-tumor tissues. High GS expression was associated with poor prognosis of moderately differentiated HCC patients. In vitro, GS exerted an influence on HCC cell migration by mediating epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The lung and liver metastatic model of HCC further confirmed that GS expression affected the invasion of HCC cells in vivo.Conclusions:GS is a useful biomarker for HCC diagnosis, especially for AFP-negative patients. In addition, GS affects HCC metastasis through mediating epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
