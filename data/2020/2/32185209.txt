Aims:To analyze the main etiological factors and some clinical features of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at diagnosis and to compare them with those we described ten years ago. Materials and Methods. We compared two groups of patients with HCC, Group 1 consisting of 132 patients (82 M, 50 F) diagnosed in the 2003-2008 period and Group 2 including 119 patients (82 M, 37 F) diagnosed in the 2013-2018 period. For all patients, age, sex, viral markers, alcohol consumption, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, and the main liver function parameters were recorded. The diagnosis of HCC was based on AASLD, EASL guidelines. The staging was classified according to the "Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system" (BCLC).Results:Mean age was 69.0 ± 8 years in Group 1 and 71.0 ± 9 in Group 2 (P < 0.05). HCV subjects were significantly older in Group 2 (P < 0.05). HCV subjects were significantly older in Group 2 (P < 0.05). HCV subjects were significantly older in Group 2 (P < 0.05). HCV subjects were significantly older in Group 2 (P < 0.05). HCV subjects were significantly older in Group 2 (P < 0.05). HCV subjects were significantly older in Group 2 (P < 0.05). HCV subjects were significantly older in Group 2 (P < 0.05). HCV subjects were significantly older in Group 2 (.Conclusions:This study shows that over the last decade a number of features of patients with HCC in our region have changed, particularly age at onset, etiological factors, and staging of HCC.
