Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer. HCC is particularly aggressive and is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality. In recent decades, the epidemiological landscape of HCC has undergone significant changes. While chronic viral hepatitis and excessive alcohol consumption have long been identified as the main risk factors for HCC, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), paralleling the worldwide epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes, has become a growing cause of HCC in the US and Europe. Here, we review the recent advances in epidemiological, genetic, epigenetic and pathogenic mechanisms as well as experimental mouse models that have improved the understanding of NASH progression toward HCC. We also discuss the clinical management of patients with NASH-related HCC and possible therapeutic approaches.
