Current strategy for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) criteria dictates that patients with advanced-stage HCC are to only receive treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, they prolong overall survival just by slightly more than 6 months. In this article, we present a patient with HCC diagnosed at an advanced stage who received multidisciplinary treatment consisting of transarterial chemoembolization, hepatic resection, pulmonary resection, radiofrequency ablation, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and radiotherapy, and has survived for more than 2 years since diagnosis and counting.
