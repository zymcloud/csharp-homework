Introduction: To assess the efficacy of combined therapy involving bland transarterial embolization using gelatin sponge particles (bland GS-TAE) followed by transarterial chemoembolization using lipiodol mixed with anticancer agents and GS particles (Lip-TACE) to reduce the adverse events and increase the therapeutic effect of Lip-TACE in the treatment of huge (≥10 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Material and methods: Twenty-one consecutive patients with huge HCCs (≥10 cm in diameter) were enrolled in this study. First, bland GS-TAE was performed to reduce the tumor volume, and then Lip-TACE was performed to control the remaining tumor at intervals of around three weeks. Tumor response, survival, and adverse events of this combined therapy were assessed.Results: The tumor response was assessed three months after combined TACE, with complete response in 38.1% and partial response in 57.1% of cases. Severe adverse events were seen in two patients, acute cholecystitis and tumor rupture. The median survival time was 2.7 years, and the one-, two-, three-, and five-year overall survival rates were 76.2%, 66.7%, 42.9%, and 25.0%, respectively.Conclusion: Combined therapy involving bland GS-TAE followed by Lip-TACE can be performed safety and may improve survival in patients with huge HCCs.
