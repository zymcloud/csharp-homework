Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a young technology that can deliver a high dose of radiation to the target, utilizing either a single dose or a small number of fractions with a high degree of precision within the body. Various technical solutions co-exist nowadays, with particular features, possibilities and limitations. Health care authorities have currently validated SBRT in a very limited number of locations, but many indications are still under investigation. It is therefore challenging to accurately appreciate the SBRT therapeutic index, its place and its role within the anticancer therapeutic arsenal. The aim of the present review is to provide SBRT definitions, current indications, and summarize the future ways of research. There are three validated indications for SBRT: un-resecable T1-T2 non small cell lung cancer,
