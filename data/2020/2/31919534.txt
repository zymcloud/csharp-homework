The imaging of focal liver lesions is a common task in daily radiological routine. The objectives of diagnostic imaging are, in addition to lesion detection, the characterization of the lesion as well as the follow-up assessment after surgical or local treatment or under systemic therapy. This article presents the typical morphologies observed in computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of hepatocellular carcinomas and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas as the most important representatives of primary malignant liver tumors and juxtaposes them with benign primary liver lesions such as adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). In addition, relevant technical aspects of imaging are briefly summarized. Finally, the main and additional criteria of the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADSÂ®) classification, which are becoming increasingly established clinically for the evaluation of liver lesions in the cirrhotic liver, are presented.
Adenoma, liver cell; Carcinoma, hepatocellular; Cholangiocellular carcinoma, intrahepatic; Focal nodular hyperplasia; Liver cirrhosis.
