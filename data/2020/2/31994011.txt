MiR-23a-3p has been shown to promote liver cancer cell growth and metastasis and regulate that of chemosensitivity. Protocadherin17 (PCDH17) is a tumor suppressor gene and plays an essential part in cell cycle of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed at evaluating the effects of miR-23a-3p and PCDH17 on HCC cell cycle and underlining the mechanism. The level of miR-23a-3p was up-regulated, while PCDH17 level was down-regulated in HCC tissues compared to adjacent tissues. For the in vitro studies, high expression of miR-23a-3p down-regulated PCDH17 level; increased cell viability; promoted G1/S cell cycle transition; up-regulated cyclin D1, cyclin E, CDK2, CDK4, p-p27, and p-RB levels; and down-regulated the expression of p27. Dual luciferase reporter assay suggested PCDH17 was a target gene of miR-23a-3p. MiR-23a-3p inhibitor and PCDH17 siRNA led to an increase in cell viability and the number of cells in the S phase and up-regulated cyclin D1 and cyclin E levels, compared with miR-23a-3p inhibitor and NC siRNA group. For the in vivo experiments, high expression of miR-23a-3p promoted tumor growth and reduced PCDH17 level in the cytoplasm. These results indicated that high expression of miR-23a-3p might promote G1/S cell cycle transition by targeting PCDH17 in HCC cells. The miR-23a-3p could be considered as a molecular target for HCC detection.
