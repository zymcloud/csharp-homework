The goal of curative management of hepatocellular carcinoma is to provide the best chance of remission. However, recurrence rates for both local and distant relapse are high. Patient subgroups at higher risk of these events can be identified based on histological patterns that are closely linked to specific molecular subtypes. Patient outcome has improved with more effective therapeutic strategies thanks to technological advances in surgical techniques and percutaneous ablation. The main goal of controlling the cause of liver disease is to decrease distant/late recurrence and prevent deterioration of hepatic function. Ongoing trials testing the combination of neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant regimens with these procedures as well as routine tumour molecular analysis may modify therapeutic algorithms for hepatocellular carcinoma in the future.
