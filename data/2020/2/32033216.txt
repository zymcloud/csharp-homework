Around 350 million people are living with hepatitis B virus (HBV), which can lead to death due to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Various antiviral drugs/nucleot(s)ide analogues are currently used to reduce or arrest the replication of this virus. However, many studies have reported that nucleot(s)ide analogue-resistant HBV is circulating. Cellular signaling pathways could be one of the targets against the viral replication. Several studies reported that viral proteins interacted with mitochondrial proteins and localized in the mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell. And a recent study showed that mitochondrial turnover induced by thyroid hormones protected hepatocytes from hepatocarcinogenesis mediated by HBV. Strong downregulation of numerous cellular signaling pathways has also been reported to be accompanied by profound mitochondrial alteration, as confirmed by transcriptome profiling of HBV-specific CD8 T cells from chronic and acute HBV patients. In this review, we summarize the ongoing research into mitochondrial proteins and/or signaling involved with HBV proteins, which will continue to provide insight into the relationship between mitochondria and HBV and ultimately lead to advances in viral pathobiology and mitochondria-targeted antiviral therapy.
