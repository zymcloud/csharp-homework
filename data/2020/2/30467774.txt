Radiation therapy (RT) is an effective treatment modality for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but globally, it is underutilized. In Russia, practice patterns with regard to liver-directed radiation are unknown. Under the auspices of Russian Society of Clinical Oncology (RUSSCO), our team conducted an IRB-approved contouring workshop for Russian radiation oncologists. Pre- and post-workshop surveys were analyzed to determine baseline clinical experience and patterns of care for liver-directed RT among Russian providers. The effect of the contouring workshop on participants' knowledge was tested using mixed effects model. Forty pre-workshop and 24 post-workshop questionnaires were analyzable with a 100% response rate. Sixty percent of respondents had never evaluated a patient with HCC and only 8% (3 out of 40) reported treating an HCC patient with liver-directed RT. Nonetheless, 73% of respondents were comfortable offering liver-directed RT prior to the workshop. After the workshop, 85% of respondents felt comfortable treating a patient with HCC with liver-directed RT and 50% were comfortable recommending stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Measures of knowledge pertaining to evaluation of HCC patients and selection for appropriate liver-directed therapies were dramatically improved after the workshop. Liver-directed RT is not commonly used in Russia in the management of patients with HCC, and few centers are equipped for motion management. Our contouring workshop resulted in dramatically improved understanding of the evaluation and management of HCC patients. We recommend starting with a more protracted fractionated RT and building experience through attendance of additional educational activities, participation in multidisciplinary liver tumor boards, and prospective analysis of treatment toxicity and outcomes.
