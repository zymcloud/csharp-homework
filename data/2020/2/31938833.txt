Purpose:Despite the introduction of novel targeted therapies on patients with renal cell carcinoma, syn- and metachronous metastases (including hepatic lesions) are observed frequently and significantly influence patient survival. With introduction of targeted therapies as an effective alternative to surgery, therapeutical strategies in stage IV disease must be reevaluated.Methods:This is a retrospective analysis of 40 patients undergoing hepatic resection of histologically confirmed RCC metastases at our institution between April 1993 and April 2017.Results:The interval between nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma and hepatic metastasectomy was 44.0 months (3.3-278.5). Liver resections of different extents were performed, including multivisceral resections. The median follow-up was 37.8 months (0.5-286.5). Tumor recurrence after resection of hepatic metastases occurred in 19 patients resulting in a median disease-free survival of 16.2 months (0.7-265.1) and a median overall survival of 37.8 months (0.5-286.5). Multivariable analysis identified multivisceral resection as an independent risk factor for disease-free and overall survival (p = 0.043 and p = 0.001, respectively). A longer interval between nephrectomy and hepatic metastasectomy was identified as an independent significant protective factor for overall survival (p < 0.001). Patients undergoing metastasectomy after introduction of sunitinib in Europe in 2006 (n = 15) showed a significantly longer overall survival (45.2 (9.1-111.0) versus 27.5 (0.5-286.52) months in the preceding era; p = 0.038).Conclusion:Hepatic metastasectomy, including major and extended resections, on patients with metastasized renal cell carcinoma can be performed safely and may facilitate long-term survival. Due to significant morbidity and increased mortality, multivisceral resections must be weighed against other options, such as targeted therapy.
