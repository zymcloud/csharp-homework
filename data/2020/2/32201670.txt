Wnt1 is the first member of the Wnt family that was identified. It is phylogenetically conserved and essential for oncogenesis and multiple developmental processes. This study has summarized diseases and mutations related to Wnt1. Wnt1 is involved in various cancers, genetic type XV osteogenesis imperfecta, osteoporosis, and neurological diseases. The expression of Wnt1 in normal tissues and different types of cancers and the potential survival of cancer were analyzed using experiment-based bioinformatic analysis. Systematic analysis indicated that abnormal expression of Wnt1 is significantly associated with cancers, such as kidney renal carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. GeneMANIA and STRING predicted that 32 proteins were involved with Wnt1 in Wnt signaling pathways and sorting and secretion of Wnts. These interacting molecules significantly co-occurred according to cBioPortal analysis. Thirty-three genes with an alteration frequency of more than 50% were observed in several cancers like esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. Functional and experiment-based bioinformatics indicated that Wnt1 may act as a target of a potential biomarker for various types of human cancers. Wnt1 and other Wnt1-related proteins and signaling pathways may be ways to treat osteoporosis.
