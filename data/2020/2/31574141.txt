Background:To investigate serum Mac-2-binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) levels in predicting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and mortality at virological remission (VR, HBV DNA Methods:This retrospective cohort study included patients with CHB-related Child-Pugh A cirrhosis undergoing long-term antiviral therapy. Serum M2BPGi levels were quantified and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to identify risk predictors for HCC and death.Results:A total of 126 and 145 patients were included in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. The mean age was 56, and the mean M2BPGi level was 1.86 cut-off index (COI) in the derivation cohort. After adjustment for confounders, a higher M2BPGi level at VR significantly predicted HCC (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.58, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-2.10, P=0.002) and death (HR: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.02-4.62, P=0.044). The M2BPGi â‰¥3 COI significantly increased the risk of HCC and death in the derivation and validation cohorts. Serial M2BPGi levels declined significantly (P=0.0001) in non-HCC patients only, and remained significantly lower than those who developed HCC afterwards (P=0.039).Conclusions:Serum M2BPGi levels at antiviral therapy-induced VR predict HCC development and death in patients with CHB-related Child-Pugh A cirrhosis.
