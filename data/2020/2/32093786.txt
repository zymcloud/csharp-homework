Background:The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a radiomics nomogram for preoperative differentiating focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the non-cirrhotic liver.Methods:A total of 156 patients with FNH (n = 55) and HCC (n = 101) were divided into a training set (n = 119) and a validation set (n = 37). Radiomics features were extracted from triphasic contrast CT images. A radiomics signature was constructed with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm, and a radiomics score (Rad-score) was calculated. Clinical data and CT findings were assessed to build a clinical factors model. Combined with the Rad-score and independent clinical factors, a radiomics nomogram was constructed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Nomogram performance was assessed with respect to discrimination and clinical usefulness.Results:Four thousand two hundred twenty-seven features were extracted and reduced to 10 features as the most important discriminators to build the radiomics signature. The radiomics signature showed good discrimination in the training set (AUC [area under the curve], 0.964; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.934-0.995) and the validation set (AUC, 0.865; 95% CI, 0.725-1.000). Age, Hepatitis B virus infection, and enhancement pattern were the independent clinical factors. The radiomics nomogram, which incorporated the Rad-score and clinical factors, showed good discrimination in the training set (AUC, 0.979; 95% CI, 0.959-0.998) and the validation set (AUC, 0.917; 95% CI, 0.800-1.000), and showed better discrimination capability (P Conclusions:The CT-based radiomics nomogram, a noninvasive preoperative prediction tool that incorporates the Rad-score and clinical factors, shows favorable predictive efficacy for differentiating FNH from HCC in the non-cirrhotic liver, which might facilitate clinical decision-making process.
