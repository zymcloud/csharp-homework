Alcohol use disorder is associated with a wide array of hepatic pathologies ranging from steatosis to alcoholic-related cirrhosis (AC), alcoholic hepatitis (AH), or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Biomarkers are categorized into two main categories: biomarkers associated with alcohol consumption and biomarkers of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). No ideal biomarker has been identified to quantify the degree of hepatocyte death or severity of AH, even though numerous biomarkers have been associated with AH. This review provides information of some of the novel and latest biomarkers that are being investigated and have shown a substantial association with the degree and severity of liver injury and inflammation. Importantly, they can be measured noninvasively. In this manuscript, we consolidate the present understanding and prospects of these biomarkers; and their application in assessing the severity and progression of the alcoholic liver disease (ALD). We also review current and upcoming management options for AH.
