Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly malignant disease and has the worst prognosis and survival rate. TUBA1C is a microtubule component implicated in multiple cancers, however, the clinical significance and biological functions of TUBA1C in the progression of PDAC remain unexplored. Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) data were employed to detect the TUBA1C mRNA expression and the relation between TUBA1C expression and overall survival (OS) in PDAC. Then, bioinformatic analysis was employed to determine the potential pathway and genes related to TUBA1C. Human pancreatic cancer tissue and adjacent non-tumor tissues samples were detected by immunochemistry (IHC) staining, and the correlation between TUBA1C expression and the clinicopathological features were investigated. Meanwhile, TUBA1C expression in PDAC cell lines was evaluated by western blotting. Furthermore, functional assays including cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle, transwell assay, wound healing assay, and a xenograft tumor model were performed to determine the oncogenic role of TUBA1C in PDAC, respectively. Results: TUBA1C was overexpressed in the PDAC tissues and cells. IHC analysis showed that the TUBA1C overexpression was associated with short OS. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that TUBA1C overexpression was mainly associated with cell cycle regulation. The downregulation of TUBA1C significantly suppressed cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis and cycle arrest, and inhibited invasion and migration in PDAC cells. Furthermore, TUBA1C downregulation also inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Conclusion: These findings suggested that TUBA1C downregulation suppressed PDAC aggressiveness via cell cycle pathway and that TUBA1C may serve as a potential prognostic marker for PDAC therapy.
