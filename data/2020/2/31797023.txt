Purpose:To assess and compare the performance of liver surface nodularity (LSN) quantification using Gd-BOPTA-enhanced MRI and contrast-enhanced CT for the diagnosis of clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) in patients with cirrhosis.Methods:This retrospective study included 30 patients with compensated histologically proven cirrhosis who underwent hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), abdominal CT and Gd-BOPTA-MRI within a 60-day interval during pre-surgery workup for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between January 2016 and August 2018. LSN score was derived from CT portal venous phase (PVP), axial T2- and T1-weighted PVP and hepatobiliary phase (HBP). Accuracy for the detection of CSPH was evaluated for each set of images by ROC curve analysis. Intra-observer, inter-observer and inter-method reproducibilities were assessed by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV).Results:Thirty patients were analysed (23 men [77%], mean age 60 ± 11 years old), including 15 (50%) with CSPH. All CT- and MRI-derived LSN quantifications were correlated to HVPG (CT-PVP: r = 0.63, p = 0.001, AUROC = 0.908 ± 0.06; T1-w-PVP: r = 0.43, p = 0.028, AUROC = 0.876 ± 0.07; T1-w-HBP: r = 0.50, p = 0.012, AUROC = 0.823 ± 0.08; T2-w: r = 0.51, p = 0.007, AUROC = 0.801 ± 0.09). There was no significant difference in AUROC pairwise comparisons (p = 0.12-0.88). Patients with CSPH had higher LSN than those without (CT-PVP: 3.2 ± 0.6 vs 2.4 ± 0.5, p Conclusion:The diagnostic performance of MRI-based LSN for detecting CSPH is strong and similar to that of CT-based LSN.
