Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent cancers due to its frequency and high rate of mortality. Polyamine-vectorized anticancer drugs possess multiple biological properties. Of these drugs, 9F has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma. This current study aims to investigate the effects of 9F on CRC and determine its molecular mechanisms of action. Our findings demonstrate that 9F inhibits CRC cell growth by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and suppresses migration, invasion and angiogenesis in vitro, resulting in the inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Based on RNA-seq data, further bioinformatic analyses suggest that 9F exerts its anticancer activities through p53 signaling, which is responsible for the altered expression of key regulators of the cell cycle, apoptosis, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and angiogenesis. In addition, 9F is more effective than amonafide against CRC. These results show that 9F can be considered as a potential strategy for CRC treatment.
