Background and aim:Liver disease refers to a set of pathologies resulting from the interruption of liver function or the poor functioning of the liver. The estimation of morbidity and mortality due to liver disease and the context in which the disease develops are determining factors for public policies related to liver disease and its causes. The primary etiologies are cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, which are directly related to hepatitis B and C virus and alcohol consumption. Followed by hepatotoxic drug use, autoimmune hepatitis, cholestatic diseases, genetic abnormalities, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.Methods:A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of liver disease in Colombia between 2009 and 2016. Using the Data Warehouse-Cube of SISPRO as the primary source of the data, prevalence proportions were calculated and adjusted according to the Bennett Horiuchi method. The relationship with alcohol consumption and the index of unsatisfied basic needs based on estimates from 2005 were considered as sociodemographic variables.Results:The prevalence of liver disease differs with regard to the type of illness, sex and age of the patient, access to medical attention, and geographical location.Conclusions:As liver disease is a public health problem, it requires early intervention such as raising awareness and prevention strategies, along with postdiagnosis care channels for treatment, rehabilitation, and palliation. By implementing these strategies, public health will be positively impacted, health care resources will be optimized, and more productive years of life are available for the citizens of the country.
