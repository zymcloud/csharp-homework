Background:Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) is one of the major predictive factors for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The objective of this study was to establish a prognostic nomogram for identifying individual survival outcomes in patients with HCC and PVTT on conservative treatment based on specific factors.Methods:Two hundred and ten patients with HCC and PVTT on conservative treatment in Beijing Ditan Hospital between June 2008 and May 2017 were studied retrospectively as a derivation cohort. We built a nomogram based on independent risk factors for survival prediction. The concordance index (c-index) and a calibration curve were used to evaluate the predictive accuracy. During the study, 102 patients were included at the Putuo Hospital and Third People's Hospital of Changzhou as a validation cohort.Results:In the derivation cohort, the independent factors for overall survival were identified by multivariate analysis, namely, aspartate aminotransferase ≥119 IU/L, gamma-glutamyl transferase ≥115 IU/L, Child-Pugh class C liver function, creatinine ≥91 μmoI/L, α-fetoprotein ≥400 ng/ml, and largest tumor diameter ≥5 cm. The nomogram had a c-index of 0.737 (95% confidence interval, 0.692-0.782) and the calibration curves fitted well. The median survival time was 4.2 months in the derivation cohort, with an MST of 5 months for BCLC C stage and 1.8 months for BCLC D stage patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significant statistical differences in the 6-month overall survival rates of the primary and validation cohorts after the total scores were divided into three quartiles (low risk: 0-85; intermediate risk: 86-210; high risk: ≥211; p < 0.0001 in both cohorts).Conclusions:The nomogram can be a more accurate and individualized prediction for 6-month overall survival of patients with HCC and PVTT on conservative treatment, and it is possible to consider further active interventions for patients in the low-risk group (0-85 scores) to achieve the aim of prolonging survival.
