Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complex biological process and is often diagnosed at advanced stages with no effective treatment options. With advances in tumor biology and molecular genetic profiling, several different signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms have been identified as responsible for initiating and promoting HCC. Targeting these critical pathways, which include the receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, the Ras mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras/Raf/MAPK), the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway, the ubiquitin/proteasome degradation and the hedgehog signaling pathway has led to the identification of novel therapeutics for HCC treatment. In this review, we elaborated on our current understanding of the signaling pathways involved in the development and initiation of HCC and anticipate the potential targets for therapeutic drug development.
