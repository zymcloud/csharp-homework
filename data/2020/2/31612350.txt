Background:Liver resection is the most effective procedure for colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM); however, early recurrence is an important problem that affects the postoperative prognoses of patients with CRLM. We previously suggested a therapeutic algorithm for CRLM using fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and revealed the applicability of FDG-PET in predicting the prognosis after liver resection of CRLM. In this study, we assessed the correlation between FDG-PET and biological viability such as proliferation or metabolic activity.Methods:We retrospectively evaluated 61 patients who underwent hepatectomy for CRLM. We assessed hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 (PKM2), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), and Ki-67 expression via immunohistochemistry and evaluated the correlation between standardized uptake value (SUV) and these factors.Results:High HIF-1α, PKM2, and GLUT1 expression were positively correlated with high SUV expression (P = 0.0444, 0.0296, and 0.0245, respectively). Ki-67 and SUV were also positively correlated (P = 0.00164). HIF-1α expression and PKM2 expression were significantly correlated (P = 0.0430), and PKM2 expression and GLUT1 expression were extremely significantly correlated (P < 0.0001).Conclusion:SUV reflected tumor proliferation or metabolic factors in CRLM. FDG-PET could be a useful modality for assessing tumor viability and may provide useful information regarding the appropriate treatment strategy for CRLM.
