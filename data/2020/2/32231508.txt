Situs inversus totalis (SIT) is a rare congenital condition in which the usual position of the organs is reversed from left to right as a mirror image of the normal situation. Due to the abnormal transposition, this represents a technical challenge for the surgeon. In the present study, right hemihepatectomy via the anterior approach was performed for a 68-year-old hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient with SIT. SIT was diagnosed by chest X-ray and computed tomography. The tumors were located in segments VIII and VI of the liver, and there was no metastasis to the lymph nodes and distant organs. Hemihepatic vascular inflow occlusion was performed using the selective intra-Glissonian approach. The middle hepatic vein was preserved under the guidance with intraoperative ultrasonography. The present case suggests that right hemihepatectomy via the anterior approach may be a safe, feasible, and effective procedure for HCC patients with SIT.
