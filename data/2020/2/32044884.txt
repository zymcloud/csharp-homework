Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has the potential to progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Upregulation of sonic hedgehog (Shh) has been documented in development of NASH through sustained cell stress. At the same time, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), which is a central element in fibrogenic reactions in various diseases and sites, has been reported to be associated with hepatic inflammation and fibrotic reaction. To explore crosstalk between Shh and TGF-β1 in the development and progression of NASH, we investigated the expression of both these proteins in 135 human specimens of NASH, 35 fatty liver specimens, 35 specimens of alcoholic steatohepatitis with immunohistochemistry. Shh protein was expressed in the cytoplasm of ballooned hepatocytes with an ubiquitin-like pattern. In addition, a few scattered apoptotic hepatocytes in the inflammatory foci showed homogeneous cytoplasmic Shh expression. TGF-β1 protein was observed mainly in the activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) which were located in the inflammatory foci surrounding ballooned hepatocytes. Moreover, the mRNA levels of both Shh and TGF-β1 in the liver biopsy specimens from NASH patients was significantly increased compared with those in fatty liver patients. Statistically, there was a significant association of the expressions of Shh and TGF-β1 proteins in NASH (r=0.6, P
