As the first-line treatment, sorafenib has been used for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the chemoresistance commonly restricts to the clinical efficiency. In this study, we intend to investigate the genome-wide expression pattern of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in sorafenib-resistant HCC. Herein, we identified thousands of differentially expressed lncRNAs in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells by high-throughput sequencing compared to the parental. Besides, based on GO (Gene Ontology) term enrichment analysis, these differentially expressed lncRNAs are mainly related to binding and catalytic activity and biological regulation of metabolic processes in both the sorafenib-resistant Huh7 cells (Huh7-S) and sorafenib-resistant HepG2 cells (HepG2-S) compared to the parental cells. Moreover, when analyzed by KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway, the differentially expressed genes were significantly related to the tight junction. Among them, the expression of TCONS_00284048 and TCONS_00006019 was consistently up-regulated in sorafenib-resistant HCC cell lines, whereas when either was knocked down, the sensitivity of Huh7-S and HepG2-S cells to sorafenib was increased. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the lncRNA expression profile is significantly altered in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells as well as differentially expressed lncRNAs may play crucial functions on HCC sorafenib resistance and HCC progression.
