Hepatocellular carcinoma with bile duct invasion is rare, with a reported incidence of 3.4%. A 71-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma underwent radiofrequency ablation(RFA)(S6, S7, S8)and required readmission 22 months after the RFA for hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence detected by gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Enhanced abdominal computed tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed a tumor thrombus in a biliary branch and left adrenal gland metastases. We performed a right lobectomy and left adrenalectomy. The biliary thrombus was easily removed. Postoperative histopathological examination of the resected specimen showed a moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma invading the biliary tract and the absence of viable cells in the liver tumor. The patient has shown no recurrence 6 months after the hepatectomy.
