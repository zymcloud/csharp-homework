Introduction:Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) for tumors involving segment VII has been considered a contraindication. Herein, our proposed laparoscopic technique for segment VII lesions using a rubber band retraction method and flexible laparoscope is introduced.Methods:A combination of elastic rubber band retraction method and flexible laparoscope was applied to access segment VII lesion. The perioperative outcomes and pathologic results were compared between patients with segment VII lesions (group 1) and patients with tumors in other segments (group 2) to evaluate feasibility and safety of the proposed laparoscopic approach for segment VII lesions.Results:Among 167 patients who underwent LLR from May 2014 to October 2017, the study population included 17 patients with tumors in segment VII (group 1) and 66 patients with tumors in other segments (group 2). The demographics of the two groups were comparable. One open conversion occurred in group 2 due to bleeding. The mean tumor size was 2.6 ± 1.0 and 2.5 ± 1.5 cm (p = 0.392) and surgical margin was 1.2 ± 0.7 and 1.3 ± 1.2 cm (p = 0.344) in group 1 and group 2, respectively. The mean operation time was 151 ± 63 and 131 ± 57 min (p = 0.596) and estimated mean blood loss was 294 ± 281 and 306 ± 405 mL (p = 0.610), in group 1 and group 2, respectively. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 6.1 ± 1.5 and 6.4 ± 2.7 days (p = 0.064) in group 1 and group 2. Two postoperative complications in both groups and no postoperative mortality occurred.Conclusion:The combination technique of rubber band retraction and flexible laparoscopic camera allowed feasible and safe LLR for segment VII lesions that showed postoperative outcomes comparable to other segment lesions.
