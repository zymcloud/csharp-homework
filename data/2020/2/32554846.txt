Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development is a complex process with well-known risk factors, however the role of betatrophin/angiopoietin-like protein 8 and irisin has been poorly investigated thus far. The aim of this study is to measure betatrophin and irisin serum levels in HCC, cirrhotic patients and controls, assess their relationship with cancer etiology and grade, metabolic abnormalities and liver dysfunction severity. Serum betatrophin and irisin concentrations were measured with commercially available ELISA kits in 69 cirrhotic patients with HCC, 24 patients with non-viral cirrhosis and 20 healthy volunteers. The severity of liver disfunction was assessed according to Child-Pugh (C-P) score, while HCC grade according to the Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) staging system. Serum betatrophin concentration was significantly higher (33.7 ± 13.4 versus 12.3 ± 2.0 ng/ml; P
