Background: Serine protease inhibitor Kazal type I (SPINK1) is highly expressed and promotes tumor progress in different cancers. This study aimed to evaluate SPINK1's prognostic value and its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progress.Methods: We use tissue micro-arrays containing 273 tumor and paired para-tumor tissues to evaluate SPINK1's prognostic value in HCC. CCK8 cell proliferation assay, wound healing assays, transwell migration and invasion assays were performed to explore the effect of SPINIK1 on HCC cells. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were used to verify the prognosis value of SPINK1 in HCC and explore the underlying mechanisms.Results: SPINK1 expression was significantly higher in tumor tissues than paired para-tumor tissues (P < 0.001). Higher SPINK1 expression in tumor was significantly associated with portal vein tumor thrombus formation (P = 0.019) and shorter overall survival (P = 0.029). SPINK1 expression in tumor tissue was an independent predictor for overall survival. SPINK1 increased proliferation (P < 0.001), enhanced migration and invasion ability of HCC cell lines (P < 0.001). GSEA revealed that glycine, serine, threonine and bile acid metabolism may be the underlying mechanism of SPINK1 in HCC.Conclusions: In conclusion, high SPINK1 expression is associated with poor prognosis of HCC. SPINK1 promotes proliferation, migration and invasion ability of HCC cells.
