Normalization procedures for the qRT-PCR analysis of miRNA in biological samples are recommended to reduce the variability caused by pre-analytical factors. Since there is no universal standardized normalization strategy for miRNA qRT-PCR studies, we conducted a throughout study to evaluate a panel of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) as reference gene candidate for biomarker studies in serum samples of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Five sncRNAs (miR-1280, miR-1275, SNORD-116, SNORD-68, and U6) were chosen as candidate of reference genes. This study included 122 patients with HCC and was organized into a "pilot phase" consisting of 20 serum samples of HCC patients, and a "validation phase" of 102 patients. Expression level of these candidates were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Assessment of gene stability was performed using four different integrative platforms (geNorm NormFinder, Bestkeeper, and the Delta Ct method). To determine the gene stability during the follow-up of the patient, we extend the analysis of the validation cohort at T1 (1 month after treatment) and T2 (6 month after treatment). MiR-1280 was identified as the most stably expressed reference gene in both pilot and validation phase also during the follow-up. MiR-1280 appears a reliable reference gene candidate in biomarker studies.
