Rationale and objectives:To evaluate the results of 18F-FDG PET/MRI in relation to the histopathologic subtypes and histologic grades of mass-forming primary intrahepatic neoplasms.Materials and methods:We retrospectively evaluated 18F-FDG positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) results for 39 patients with histopathologically confirmed primary hepatic neoplasms, 15 with mass-forming intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and 24 with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and standardized uptake value (SUV) were analyzed in relation to the histopathologic diagnosis and histologic grade, including calculating the sensitivity and specificity of the imaging findings.Results:The median SUV of ICC (6.0 [interquartile range, 5-10]) was significantly higher than that of HCC (4.0 [2.62-6.50]) (p = 0.002). An area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.649-0.932) had a sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 67% at the best cut-off SUV of 4.41 to differentiate between ICC and HCC. ADC values did not differ significantly between HCCs and ICCs (p = 0.283). Both SUV and ADC values differed significantly between low-grade (well- and moderately differentiated) and high-grade (poorly differentiated) HCCs. Combining ADC and SUV further improved differentiation of low- from high-grade HCCs to a significant level (0.929). The SUV did not differ significantly between ICC histologic grades (p = 0.280), while the ADC differed significantly only between well and poorly differentiated ICCs (p = 0.004).Conclusion:Assessing primary hepatic neoplasms with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET/MRI may help to predict tumor grade and differentiate between types of intrahepatic neoplasms.
