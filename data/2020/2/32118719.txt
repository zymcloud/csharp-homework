Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer. Pathologic distinction between HCC and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and metastatic adenocarcinoma can be challenging and sometimes requires immunohistochemical panels. Recently, arginase-1 (ARG-1) has been introduced for differentiation of these tumors.Methods:We will search Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure through August 1, 2019, comprehensive collection studies about the diagnostic value of ARG-1 for HCC. Two reviewers will screen literature according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, extract data, and assess the quality of included studies. Review Manager 5.3 and STATA 15.0 will be used to conduct the meta-analysis.Results:The review will provide a high-quality synthesis of current evidence of the diagnostic value of liver cancer. The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.Conclusion:We hope that the results of this study will provide significant evidence to assess the value of ARG-1 in differential diagnosis of HCC, ICC, and metastatic carcinoma of liver.
