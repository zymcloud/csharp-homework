Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a worldwide health concern because of a continued increase in cases globally; furthermore, the prognosis for patients with HCC remains poor. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been established as the standard of care for the intermediate stage of HCC; however, no therapeutic agents are available to reduce the high rate of recurrence.Objective:This study aims to evaluate the safety of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-derived peptides for patients with HCC post-TACE.Methods:This will be an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the safety of AFP-derived peptides (AFP 357 and AFP 403), which contain histocompatibility antigen-A24-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes from tumor antigens expressed in HCC and is recognized at a high rate by lymphocytes in patients with HCC. Protocol treatment will consist of six courses of the subcutaneous administration of 3 mg each of AFP 357 and AFP 403. A total of 14 patients will be included in this study, the first 6 as a main analysis target group and an additional 8 as an extended cohort from three institutions in Japan. The primary endpoint will be the occurrence of serious adverse events (safety profile). The secondary endpoints will include time to progression, overall survival, completion rate, and adverse events (efficacy profile).Results:We have recruited 14 patients with HCC as of December 2019. The final follow-up will be completed by March 2020.Conclusions:In this study, we will evaluate the safety profile of AFP-derived peptides for patients with HCC post-TACE. We believe that this study will provide useful information and will help to design a subsequent phase II trial based on the results.Trial registration:Japan Registry of Clinical Trials jRCTs041180155; https://jrct.niph.go.jp/latest-detail/jRCTs041180155.International registered report identifier (irrid):DERR1-10.2196/17082.
