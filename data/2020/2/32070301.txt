Background:Microvascular invasion (MVI) is an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, there is still a lack of preoperative markers to predict MVI in HCC. This study intends to explore the potential application value of the gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) to lymphocyte count ratio (GLR) in predicting MVI in HCC and provide guidance for clinical diagnosis and treatment.Methods:From March 2010 to December 2015, 230 HCC patients who underwent surgical treatment in the Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University were selected. Clinicopathological parameters between the MVI group (n = 115) and the non-MVI group (n = 115) were comparatively analyzed. The GLR was used as the potential risk factor for HCC with MVI, and its optimal cut-off value was estimated by using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the survival of HCC patients, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to establish independent predictors affecting postoperative HCC patients.Results:The GLR levels in the MVI group and non-MVI group were 84.83 ± 61.84 and 38.42 ± 33.52 (p 5 cm, HCC combined with MVI and GLR > 56.0 were independent risk factors for poor prognosis in HCC patients. In addition, compared with the non-MVI group, patients in the MVI group had shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).Conclusion:GLR could be a predictive biomarker of HCC after operation and a potential predictor of HCC combined with MVI.
