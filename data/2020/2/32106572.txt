Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) threatens human health, so it is imperative that we find ways to prevent or treat it. In recent years, the study of polysaccharides has shown that they have different kinds of bioactivities. Among them are many biological effects that have been attributed to polysaccharide precursors. D-Isofloridoside (DIF) is one of the polysaccharide precursors from the marine red alga Laurencia undulata. This study evaluated the effect of DIF on alcohol-induced oxidative stress in human hepatoma cells (HepG2). As a result, DIF attenuated alcohol-induced cytotoxicity, reduced the amount of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and effectively reduced alcohol-induced DNA damage in HepG2 cells. In addition, a western blot showed that, after DIF treatment, the expression levels of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and B-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2) increased, while the expression levels of Î³-glutamyl transferase (GGT), BCL2-associated X (bax), cleaved caspase-3, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase ) signal transduction proteins reduced. This showed that DIF may protect cells by reducing the amount of intracellular ROS and inhibiting intracellular oxidative stress and apoptotic processes. Finally, molecular docking demonstrated that DIF can bind to SOD, GGT, B-cell lymphoma-2, and bax proteins. These results indicated that DIF can protect HepG2 cells from alcohol-induced oxidative stress damage, making it an effective potential ingredient in functional foods.
