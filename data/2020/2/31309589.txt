Background and aims:Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are increasingly observed together in clinical practice, and development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) represents another leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Our aims were to determine whether biopsy-proven NASH impacts clinical outcomes in CHB patients and assess prognostic risk factors.Approach and results:CHB patients attending two tertiary centers in North America and Europe over 13 years with available clinical and biopsy data were included. Patients were categorized as no-NASH or probable/definite NASH based on standardized histological assessment. Clinical events (death, decompensation, transplant, and hepatoma) were evaluated, and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to analyze the incidence of events. There were 1,089 CHB patients, classified as no-NASH (n = 904, 83%) or NASH (n = 185, 17%), with 52 (6%) versus 27 (15%) experiencing outcome events during follow-up, respectively. In the multivariable analysis adjusting for age, sex, hepatitis B e antigen serostatus, and diabetes, the presence of NASH and concomitant advanced fibrosis (AF) was significantly associated with clinical outcomes (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 4.8 [2.6-9.0], P Conclusions:In our large combined tertiary center cohort, patients with concomitant NASH and CHB had more AF and shorter time to development of liver-related outcomes or death compared to patients with CHB alone. Among patients with AF, superimposed NASH predicted poorer clinical outcomes.
