Shikonin is a natural naphthoquinone component with antioxidant and anti-tumor function and has been used for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. According to the previous study, many herbs can regulate cancer cell progression by targeting specific microRNA (miRNA) (Liu, 2016). However, the underlying pathological mechanism of shikonin in HCC therapy is still unclear. The detection of cell growth and death rate were performed by hemacytometry and trypan blue staining, respectively. The expression of miR-106b and SMAD7 messenger RNA (mRNA) in HCC cells was evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration ability were measured by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry, and transwell assay. The expression of proteins E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, SMAD7, TGF-β1, p-SMAD3, SMAD3, and GAPDH was examined by western blot. The interaction between SMAD7 and miR-106b was assessed by luciferase reporter system. Shikonin inhibited Huh7 and HepG2 cell growth in a dose-dependent manner while induced cell death in a time-dependent manner. In addition, the expression of miR-106b was reduced after shikonin treatment. Moreover, miR-106b attenuated the suppressive effects of shikonin on HCC cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). SMAD7 was predicted as a target of miR-106b and the prediction was confirmed by luciferase reporter system. Additionally, we observed that SMAD7 reversed the promotive effects of miR-106b on HCC cell progression and EMT. The subsequent western blot assay revealed that shikonin could modulate SMAD7/TGF-β signaling pathway by targeting miR-106b. In conclusion, Shikonin suppresses cell progression and EMT and accelerates cell death of HCC cells via modulating miR-106b/SMAD7/TGF-β signaling pathway, suggesting shikonin could be an effective agent for HCC treatment.
