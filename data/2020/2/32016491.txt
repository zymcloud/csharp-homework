The most frequent primary hepatic malignancies are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (intrahepatic cholangiocellular adenocarcinoma [iCCA]). For HCC in cirrhosis, liver transplantation offers the advantage of a complete hepatectomy radically removing all tumorous tissue along with the surrounding cirrhotic parenchyma, which is otherwise associated with a very high risk of recurrence. For HCC in non-cirrhotic livers and iCCA, liver resection is the treatment of choice. Nowadays, even extended resections can be performed with low mortality in experienced centers. Surgical therapy is more and more embedded into multimodal treatment concepts and decision making should be interdisciplinary as for other gastrointestinal tumors.
