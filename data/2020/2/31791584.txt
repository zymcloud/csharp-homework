Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been proven to play essential roles in different cancers, including HCC. The current study was mainly focused on the role of miR-1470 in HCC progression.Methods:Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect the expression levels of miR-1470 and Aristaless-like homeobox-4 (ALX4). The CCK-8 and EdU assays were used to examine cell proliferation. Flow cytometric analysis was used to elucidate the cell cycle and cell apoptosis. A xenograft tumor assay was carried out to verify the effect of miR-1470 on tumor formation in vivo.Results:According to the qRT-PCR assay, miR-1470 was proven to be overexpressed in HCC. As shown by the CCK-8 assay, EdU assay and flow cytometric analysis, miR-1470 overexpression promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis. ALX4 was proven via a dual luciferase reporter assay to be a downstream target gene of miR-1470. ALX4 was downregulated in HCC. The results of a rescue assay revealed that miR-1470 had an oncogenic role in HCC by regulating ALX4.Conclusion:miR-1470 exhibits an oncogenic role in HCC by targeting ALX4. The data from our study may provide novel insight for the identification of new biomarkers and treatment strategies for HCC.
