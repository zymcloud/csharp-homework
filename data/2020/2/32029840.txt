The prognostic factors of patients who undergo radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not fully elucidated. We aimed to investigate the role of liver stiffness (LS) and spleen stiffness (SS) measured by acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography in determining the prognoses of patients with HCC after RFA. We prospectively enrolled 173 patients with HCC who underwent ARFI elastography for measurement of LS and SS on the same day of RFA. Overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS) after adjusting for competing mortality, and presence of hepatic decompensation were investigated. Patients with LS > 1.5 m/s had significantly shorter OS and RFS than their counterparts. Anti-viral treatment (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.396, p = 0.015) and LS > 1.5 m/s (HR 4.105, p = 0.028) correlated with OS by a multivariate analysis. Besides, serum alpha fetoprotein >10 ng/mL and LS > 1.5 m/s independently predicted poorer RFS. On the other hand, anti-viral treatment (HR: 0.315, p = 0.010), creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL (HR: 9.447, p = 0.006), and SS > 2.7 m/s (HR: 2.869, p = 0.044) predicted a higher risk of hepatic decompensation. In conclusion, LS but not SS measured by ARFI elastography predicted tumor recurrence and OS in RFA-treated HCC; whereas, SS predicted development of hepatic decompensation in these patients.
