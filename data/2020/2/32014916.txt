Background/aim:The hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have relationship to cancer progression. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of HSCs and the role of IL-6/Stat3 pathway on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression.Materials and methods:HCCs were co-cultured with HSCs. The viability and migration ability of cancer cells were detected. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker (E-cadherin), stem cell marker (CD44) and p-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) of cancer cells were evaluated. Finally, interleukin-6 (IL-6) neutralization was performed.Results:Co-culture of HCCs with HSCs increased cancer cell viability and migration ability. EMT and stemness of cancer cells increased with HSCs. Following IL-6 neutralization, phospho-STAT3 activation, cancer cell viability and migration, as well as EMT, and stemness of cancer cells decreased.Conclusion:HSCs promoted HCC progression through the IL-6/STAT3 pathway.
