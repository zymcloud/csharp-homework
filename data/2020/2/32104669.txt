Locoregional therapies (LRTs) including radiofrequency ablation, surgical resection, and TACE, play a pivotal role in the treatment of early stage/locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Besides their direct effect on tumor cells, LRTs also play an essential role in the immunomodulation of the tumor microenvironment which is of interest in the current era of cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we describe the HCC immune microenvironment and how it is affected by LRTs as described in multiple pre-clinical and clinical studies and provide the rationale for combining LRTs with immunotherapy.
