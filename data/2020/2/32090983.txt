BACKGROUND Angiogenic factor with G patch and FHA domains 1 (AGGF1) is a novel identified initiator of angiogenesis through promoting the proliferation of endothelial cells. The continuous angiogenesis plays a key role in the growth, invasion, and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while the diagnostic and prognostic roles of AGGF1 for HCC need to be further studied. MATERIAL AND METHODS The mRNA sequencing datasets and clinical features of HCC patients were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. The relationship between clinical features and AGGF1 expression was analyzed by Wilcoxon test. Further validation explorations were carried out using online database Oncomine. The diagnostic receiver operating characteristic curves of AGGF1 and alpha-fetoprotein were compared to examine the diagnostic efficacy of AGGF1. Survival analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were performed to explore the prediction value and potential mechanism of AGGF1 dysregulation in HCC. RESULTS Comprehensive overexpression of AGGF1 was observed in HCC, correlating with poor overall survival. Upregulated level of AGGF1 was statistically associated with poor differentiated histological grade, advanced cancer stage and T classification. AGGF1 was a more effective diagnostic marker than alpha-fetoprotein in HCC. Several important pathways related to HCC including pathway in cancer and P53 signaling pathway were differentially enriched in the high AGGF1 expression phenotype. CONCLUSIONS AGGF1 was a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker for poor clinical outcomes in HCC patients. Moreover, vital pathways regulated by AGGF1 in HCC may include regulation of autophagy, Wnt signaling pathway, pathway in cancer, cell cycle, and P53 signaling pathway.
