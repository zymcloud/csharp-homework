Objective:To establish nomogram based on inflammatory indices for differentiating intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A cohort of 422 patients with HCC or ICC hospitalized at Xiangya Hospital between January 2014 and December 2018 was included in the study. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify the independent differential factors. Through combining these independent differential factors, a nomogram was established for differential diagnosis between ICC and HCC. The accuracy of nomogram was evaluated by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The results were validated using a prospective study on 98 consecutive patients operated on from January 2019 to November 2019 at the same institution.Results:Sex (OR = 9.001, 95% CI: 3.268-24.792, P Conclusion:A nomogram was established for the differential diagnosis between ICC and HCC preoperatively, and better therapeutic choice would be made if it was applied in clinical practice.
