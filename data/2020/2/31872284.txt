NOD1 is an innate immune sensor playing an important role in fighting against infection. However, its role in cancer is far from being clarified, and whether NOD1 plays a role in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has never been reported. Here, we found that NOD1 expression was significantly decreased in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and overexpression of NOD1 significantly inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo. In vitro experiments demonstrated that NOD1 inhibited proliferation of HCC cells by directly targeting proto-oncogene SRC and inducing cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. Further investigation showed that NOD1 exerted its antitumor effect by inhibiting SRC activation and further suppressing SRC/MAPK axis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Moreover, NOD1 dramatically enhanced the response of HCC cells to chemotherapy via inhibition of SRC-MAPK axis both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these data indicated that NOD1 suppressed proliferation and enhanced response to sorafenib or 5-FU treatment through inhibiting SRC-MAPK axis in hepatocellular carcinoma. KEY MESSAGES: NOD1 significantly inhibited tumorigenesis of HCC in cellular and animal models. NOD1 inhibited proliferation of HCC cells by inducing cell cycle arrest. NOD1 exerted its antitumor effect on HCC by directly interacting with SRC and inhibiting SRC-MAPK axis. NOD1 significantly enhanced the chemosensitivity of HCC cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.
