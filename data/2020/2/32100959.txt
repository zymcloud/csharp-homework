Hydrazinocurcumin (HZC), a synthetic derivative of curcumin (CUR), has been documented to show anticancer potential in impeding tumor growth in several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the function and underlying mechanisms of HZC on HCC cells, which may involve the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. HZC was first purified and identified. HepG2 cells were then subjected to treatment with HZC or CUR of different concentrations and p38 MAPK signaling inhibitor (SB203580) to verify their effects on HCC cell apoptosis and proliferation. Furthermore, the functional relevance between HZC and the p38 MAPK pathway in HCC was examined. It was observed that 40 Î¼M HZC exhibited the best pro-apoptosis effect in HCC cells. HZC was found to inhibit HCC cell proliferation and promote apoptosis, the effect of which was stronger than 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). More importantly, the anti-oncogenic effect of HZC and 5-FU was implicated with activation of the p38 MAPK pathway. In vivo experimental results showed that HZC inhibited tumor growth more effectively than 5-FU through the p38 MAPK pathway. These results provide evidence that HZC exerted anti-oncogenic and pro-apoptosis effects in HCC cells through activation of the p38 MAPK pathway.
