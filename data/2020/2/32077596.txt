Liver tumours are very common and malignant tumours represent a major cause of cancer-related death. Imaging plays an important role at many different stages of the care pathway. This review discusses new aspects and new roles for imaging and for MRI, in particular. MRI is already the best tool for the characterization and staging of benign and malignant liver tumours and it could also become a useful screening tool, especially for hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver imaging will be increasingly quantitative in the future, integrating new approaches such as those of artificial intelligence.
