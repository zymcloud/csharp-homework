Chemoresistance mediated by insulin resistance (IR) in HCC has already been validated. However, the underlying mechanism, especially the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) was unelucidated. In this study, miRNA microarrays and bioinformatics methods were employed to determine the dysregulation of miRNA by IR in HCC cells, and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was applied to valid the miRNA array data. Of all the 2006 miRNAs screened, 32 miRNAs were found up or down regulated between the HepG2/IR cells and its parental cells. Further literature mining revealed that some of these miRNAs may function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors that contribute to tumor progression, recurrence, and metastasis which eventually lead to chemotherapeutic resistance. Interestingly, bioinformatics analysis by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment pathway indicating that function of the predicted target genes of these dysregulated miRNAs were significantly enriched in the processes related with biosynthesis, catabolism, modification etc., and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) mapping showed that the biological regulatory mechanisms were integrated in cancer-related pathways. Moreover, we also constructed a network which connected the differentially expressed miRNAs to target genes, GO enrichments and KEGG pathways to reveal the hub miRNAs, genes and pathways. Collectively, our present study demonstrated the possible miRNAs and predicted target genes involving in the pathophysiology of insulin resistant HCC, providing novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of multidrug resistance in the insulin resistant HepG2 cells.
