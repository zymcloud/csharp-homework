This work aimed to characterize the phenolic composition and in vitro antioxidant and antiproliferative properties of lyophilized camu-camu (Myrciaria dubia) seed extract (LCE), and to assess the effects of LCE on the antioxidant and sensory traits of yogurt. The LCE contained 46.3% (wt/wt) total phenolic content; the main compounds quantified were vescalagin, castalagin, gallic acid, procyanidin A2, and (-)-epicatechin. The LCE had antioxidant activity, as measured by different chemical assays (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, Folin-Ciocalteu reducing capacity, total reducing capacity, ferric reducing antioxidant power, and Cu2+ chelating capacity), and inhibited the cell proliferation of HepG2 cells (human hepatoma carcinoma; IC50 = 1,116 µg/mL) and Caco-2 cells (human colorectal adenocarcinoma epithelial cells; IC50 = 608.5 µg/mL). In addition, LCE inhibited the in vitro activity of α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme, and protected DNA from peroxyl radical-induced scission. When added to yogurts, different concentrations of LCE (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 g/100 g) increased the chemical antioxidant and reducing capacities. The camu-camu yogurt containing LCE at 0.25 g/100 g had an acceptance index of 84%, showing that camu-camu seed extract may be a potential ingredient for addition to yogurts.
