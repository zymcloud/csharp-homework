Bronchobiliary fistula is a rare disease defined as an abnormal connection between the biliary tract and the bronchial tree. We report the successful surgical repair of bronchobiliary fistula. A 78-year-old man underwent surgery and several rounds of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation as treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma. He presented with greenish sputum and chronic cough for several months, and his symptoms did not resolve after endoscopic treatment. We performed lobectomy of the right lower lobe and omentopexy for bronchobiliary fistula under laparotomy and thoracotomy. The bronchobiliary fistula was successfully closed, and the bilious sputum disappeared after surgery.
