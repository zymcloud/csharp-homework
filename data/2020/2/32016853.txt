The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing worldwide. Globally, it is currently the most common liver disease and is estimated to affect up to 25% of the population. In the first stage, NAFLD is characterized by simple hepatic steatosis (NAFL, nonalcoholic fatty liver) that might progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. In this review, we discuss the global burden of NAFLD, together with future perspectives on how this epidemic could be restrained. There is also an urgent need for the development of new medical strategies for NAFLD patients. We aim to present the beneficial effects of life-style modifications that should be advised to both non-obese and obese NAFLD patients. Since there are currently no medications directly used for the treatment of more advanced NAFLD stages, the central part of this review summarizes ongoing and recently completed clinical trials testing promising drugs for NASH resolution. The marketing of new therapeutic agents would greatly increase the odds of reducing the global burden of NAFLD.
