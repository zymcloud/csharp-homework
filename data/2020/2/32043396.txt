Objectives:The purpose of this paper was to synthesize 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole Schiff base derivative and to evaluate its antitumor activity.Methods:2,4,6-Tris (4-formylphenoxy)-1,3,5-triazine was synthesized by nucleophilic substitution with reaction of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde with cyanuric chloride. Then, the intermediate was reacted with 1,2,4-triazole to form 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole Schiff base derivative by reduction and ammonification of aldehydes. The 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole Schiff base derivative was characterized by infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and elemental analyses. Finally, the anticancer effect of 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole Schiff base derivative was evaluated by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay on a lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549) and a human hepatoma cell line (Bel7402).Results:The product synthesized in this study was confirmed to be 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole Schiff base derivative, and it significantly suppressed the proliferation of cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner.Conclusions:We successfully prepared 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole Schiff base derivative and verified its antitumor activity.
