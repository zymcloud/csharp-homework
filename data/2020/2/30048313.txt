Objective:The aim of the present study was to evaluate the value of anatomical resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with microportal vascular invasion (vp1) between 2000 and 2010.Background:Vascular invasion has been reported as a prognostic factor of liver resection for HCC. Anatomical resection for HCC has resulted in optimum outcomes of eradicating intrahepatic micrometastases through the portal vein, but opposite results have also been reported.Methods:A clinical chart review was performed for 546 patients with HCC with vp1. We retrospectively evaluated the recurrence-free survival (RFS) between anatomical (AR) and nonanatomical resection (NAR). The site of recurrence was also compared between these groups. The influence of AR on the overall survival (OS) and RFS rates was analyzed in patients selected by propensity score matching, and the prognostic factors were identified.Results:A total of 546 patients were enrolled, including 422 in the AR group and 124 in the NAR group. There was no difference in the 5-year OS and RFS rates between the 2 groups. Local recurrence was significantly more frequent in the NAR group than in the AR group. In a multivariate analysis, hepatitis C virus, serum protein induced by vitamin K absence II of 380 mAU/mL or more, tumor diameter of 5 cm or more, and age of 70 years or older were significant predictors of a poor RFS after liver resection. There were no significant differences in the OS or RFS between the AR and NAR groups by a propensity score-matched analysis.Conclusions:Although local recurrence around the resection site was suppressed by AR, AR for HCC with vp1 did not influence the RFS or OS rates after hepatectomy in the modern era.
