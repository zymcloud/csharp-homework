Despite significant research efforts, only a few treatment approaches have been developed for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies) have exhibited potential therapeutic effects for advanced HCC. With the development of gene-editing technologies, gene-sequencing technologies, big data strategies, and artificial intelligence algorithms, engineered immune cell infusion and personalized cancer vaccine therapy have emerged as important directions for anti-HCC treatment. Combining different immunotherapies or combining immunotherapies with conventional therapeutic approaches may provide synergistic effects and facilitate the development of personalized medicine. In this study, we provide an overview of the liver immunoanatomy, the potential immune mechanisms of HCC, and current (pre)clinical developments in this field.
