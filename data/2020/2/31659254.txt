Discerning oncogenic drivers from passengers remain a major effort in understanding of the essence of the initiation and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is the most common primary liver malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Here we report that ZNF774, a novel zinc-finger protein, inhibits the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells. Molecular characterization of this protein indicated that ZNF774 acts as a transcription repressor, and interrogation of ZNF774 interactome by affinity purification-coupled mass spectrometry revealed that ZNF774 is physically associated with the Mi-2/nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex in cells. Genome-wide identification of the transcriptional targets of the ZNF774/NuRD complex by ChIP-seq indicated that ZNF774 represses a cohort of genes including NOTCH2 that are critically involved in the growth and mobility of HCC. We demonstrated that the ZNF774/NuRD complex inhibits the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells in vitro and suppresses HCC growth and metastasis in vivo. Importantly, the expression of ZNF774 is significantly downregulated in HCC, and low ZNF774 expression strongly correlated with high NOTCH2 expression, advanced pathological stages, and poor overall survival of the patients. Together, these results uncover a key role for the ZNF774/NuRD-NOTCH2 axis in hepatocarcinogenesis.
