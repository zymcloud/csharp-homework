Pharmacological treatments for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are still unsatisfactory. Fibrosis is the most significant predictor of mortality and many anti-fibrotic agents are under evaluation. Herein, we assessed in vitro the effects of the FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) and the dual FXR/TGR5 agonist INT-767 in a well-established co-culture NASH model. Co-cultures of human hepatoma and hepatic stellate (HSCs) cells were exposed to free fatty acids (FFAs) alone or in combination with OCA or INT-767. mRNA expression of HSCs activation markers and FXR engagement were evaluated at 24, 96 and 144 hours. Collagen deposition and metalloproteinase 2 and 9 (MMP2-9) activity were compared to tropifexor and selonsertib. FFAs induced collagen deposition and MMP2-9 activity reduction. Co-treatment with OCA or INT-767 did not affect ACTA2 and COL1A1 expression, but significantly reduced FXR and induced SHP expression, as expected. OCA induced a dose-dependent reduction of collagen and induced MMP2-9 activity. Similarly, INT-767 induced collagen reduction at 96 h and a slight increase in MMP2-9. Tropifexor and Selonsertib were also effective in collagen reduction but showed no modulation of MMP2-9. All tested compounds reduced collagen deposition. OCA exerted a more potent and long-lasting effect, mainly related to modulation of collagen turn-over and MMP2-9 activity.
