Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) with yttrium-90 microspheres is a palliative locoregional treatment, minimally invasive for liver tumors. The neoadjuvant aim of this treatment is still controversial, however, selected cases with lesions initially considered unresectable have been enframed as candidates for curative therapy after hepatic transarterial radioembolization. We report three cases in which the hepatic transarterial radioembolization was used as neoadjuvant therapy in an effective way, allowing posterior potentially curative therapies.
