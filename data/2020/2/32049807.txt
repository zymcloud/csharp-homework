Previous work suggests that the long noncoding RNA HCC associated long non-coding RNA (HANR) is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression, but its significance in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains to be determined. Therefore, in this study we assessed the prognostic and diagnostic value of HANR in patients suffering from CRC.The HANR expression in 165 pairs of CRC cancer and adjacent non-cancerous prostate tissues was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. Student t test was conducted for intergroup comparison. Pearson correlation test was used for correlation analysis. Survival curves were carried out by the Kaplan-Meier method and evaluated using the log-rank test. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard risk regression model was performed to screen the independent factor affected the prognosis of CRC patients.In this study, levels of HANR were significantly higher in CRC tumor samples relative to adjacent normal tissue samples (P
