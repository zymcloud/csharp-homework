Lenvatinib is a first-line standard treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with better anti-tumor effects than sorafenib, as shown by greater inhibition of the kinases of fibroblast growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor. This report describes a patient with advanced HCC who experienced perforation of the small intestine 1 month after starting the treatment with lenvatinib. This patient likely had partial necrosis of a metastasis to the small intestine before starting lenvatinib treatment, with subsequent ischemic changes leading to perforation of the small intestine. Although metastasis of HCC to the small intestine is rare, patients with these metastases should be regarded as being at risk for perforation during lenvatinib treatment.
