Management of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is still considered a challenge in clinical practice. Patients must be carefully evaluated before starting therapy. This includes virology and laboratory assessments, an estimation of fibrosis by invasive and/or noninvasive methods, and an estimation of the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) with a high barrier to resistance (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF], entecavir [ETV] and tenofovir alafenamide [TAF]) are the most frequently used treatments because of their good long-term efficacy and tolerability. None of these options has been shown to be more effective than the other, but certain factors should be considered when selecting the best therapy for specific populations. Most patients achieve a virological and biochemical response to these agents, with a low rate of emerging resistance during long-term treatment. However, the rate of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss is low and in most cases NAs therapy is lifelong. Safety concerns for long-term NA use have become a priority in the management of CHB, in particular, the risk of impaired kidney function and bone marrow density loss described with TDF regimens. The risk of HCC is not completely eliminated by NAs. Thus, patients at higher risk should be identified and provided with appropriate surveillance.
