Although targeted agents are recommended as the first-line treatments for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC), systemic chemotherapy or hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) are still being used in Asian countries. Beside economic considerations, it was found that targeted drugs could not significantly prolong overall survival in aHCC patients with distant metastasis. In addition, chemotherapy could achieve complete response in a small proportion of patients. Here, we aimed to investigate whether combination of three previously identified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) predictors (GALNT14-rs9679162, WWOX-rs13338697, and rs6025211) could guide our choice between systemic chemotherapy, HAIC, and targeted agents in aHCC patients. A cohort of 237 real-world aHCC patients (171 receiving systemic chemotherapy followed by various anticancer treatments including sorafenib; 66 receiving HAIC) were included for outcome analysis. By combining the three SNP markers with or without addition of two clinical criteria (tumor diameter 10.5 months). In conclusion, pre-test for the 3-SNP signature in aHCC patients could identify potential systemic chemotherapy or HAIC responders. Chemotherapy non-responders still benefited from subsequent sorafenib treatment. Accordingly, we propose a roadmap for aHCC patients when chemotherapy or HAIC is to be used.
