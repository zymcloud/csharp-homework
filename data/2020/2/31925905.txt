Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a global epidemic disease that may progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The role of the liver-bile acid-microbiota axis in CHB remains unclear. The aims of this study are to elucidate the alteration of the gut microbiota and its functions in bile acid homeostasis in CHB patients with different degrees of fibrosis. In the present study, we evaluated serum and faecal bile acid profiles in healthy controls and CHB patients with biopsy-proven diagnosis: patients had stage 0-1 fibrosis were classified as mild CHB and patients had stage 2-4 fibrosis were classified as moderate/advanced CHB. The levels of serum total bile acids (BAs) and primary BAs were increased in CHB patients with moderate/advanced fibrosis, whereas faecal total and secondary BAs levels were significantly lower. Analyses of gut microbiota exhibited a trend of decreased abundance in bacteria genera responsible for BA metabolism in CHB patients with moderate/advanced fibrosis. CHB is associated with altered bile acid pool which is linked with the dysregulated gut microbiota. The higher level of FGF-19 may act in a negative feedback loop for maintaining the bile acid homeostasis.
