Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the dominant pathological type of primary liver cancer and no effective methods are available for its treatment. Erianin is a natural product extracted from Dendrobium, which possesses multiple pharmacological activities, including antioxidative and antitumor activity.Objective:To evaluate the anti-HCC activities of erianin and explore its underlying mechanism.Methods:MTT assay and Crystal Violet staining assay were used to select the non-toxic concentrations for the subsequent experiments. The colony formation assay and PCNA fluorescent staining were used to investigate the antiproliferative effects of erianin on human SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells. Wound healing and transwell test were used to analyze cell migration and invasion. Caspase3 and Tunel staining were used to detect apoptosis. Western blot was used to examine the expression levels of proteins associated with invasion and key proteins in the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt), p38 and ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.Results:Erianin inhibited HCC cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Decreased migration rate and invaded cells were observed with erianin supplement. The expression of invasion-associated proteins in the erianin group was also down-regulated. Besides, more apoptotic cells were observed after erianin treatment. For the molecular mechanism, erianin inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, ERK and P38 in the PI3K/Akt and ERK/P38 pathway.Conclusion:We demonstrated, for the first time, that erianin inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion and induced the apoptosis of HCC through PI3K/Akt, p38 and ERK MAPK signaling pathway, indicating that erianin is a promising agent for the HCC treatment.
