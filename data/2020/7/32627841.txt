A 45-year-old woman underwent uncomplicated orthotopic LT from a deceased donor for decompensated liver cirrhosis from hepatitis C [Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) 16]. Although virologic clearance was achieved 18 months prior, the patient had three hospitalisations for West-Haven grade III HE that were precipitated by infection, despite long-term lactulose and rifaximin. The patient was listed for LT for the indication of recurrent HE and was prioritised due to the incidental finding of a 14mm right renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The RCC was unresectable due to portal hypertension and technically unsuitable for cryoablation, therefore partial nephrectomy was planned post-LT. Pre-LT abdominal computed tomography (CT) confirmed the presence of a large (25mm diameter) SPSS, however embolization on the waitlist was not warranted as the patient had no further hospitalisations for HE.
