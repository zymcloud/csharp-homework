Background:Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) is an important molecule of the insulin signal transduction pathway and has been associated with the occurrence and development of many tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our study was designed to determine the expression and significance of IRS-1 in human HCC.Methods:Two hundred and forty specimens were drawn from 140 patients, including 100 HCC tissues and 100 paracancerous (PC) tissues from 100 HCC patients, 20 liver cirrhosis (LC) tissues from 20 LC patients, and 20 chronic hepatitis (CH) tissues from 20 CH patients. Baseline and pathological characteristics were included, and the expression of IRS-1 was examined by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Binary logistic regression model calculation was used for multivariate analysis.Results:The total positive rates of IRS-1 expression were 41.0%, 17.0%, 15.0%, and 10.0% in HCC, PC, LC and CH tissues, respectively. IRS-1-positive signals were brown in color and located in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Compared with PC, LC, and CH tissues, a significantly increased expression was observed in human HCC tissues (P < 0.001, P = 0.028, and P = 0.008). Eight of the total 240 specimens had the strong immunostaining of IRS-1 expression, and all of them were HCC tissues. After control of the age, gender, and HBV and HCV infection, IRS-1 expression was independently associated with the diagnosis of HCC (OR 6.60, 95% CI 2.243-19.425, P = 0.001).Conclusions:Positive expression of IRS-1 in HCC was increased significantly and may play an important role in the occurrence and development of human HCC.
