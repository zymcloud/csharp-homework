Hepatitis B virus (HBV) cannot be eliminated completely from infected hepatocytes because of the presence of intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). As chronic hepatitis B (CHB) can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it is important to manage CHB to prevent HCC development in high-risk patients with high viral replicative activity or advanced fibrosis. Serum biomarkers are noninvasive and valuable for the management of CHB. Hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) correlates with serum HBV DNA and intrahepatic cccDNA. In CHB patients with undetectable serum HBV DNA or loss of HBsAg, HBcrAg still can be detected and the decrease in HBcrAg levels is significantly associated with hopeful outcomes. Therefore, HBcrAg can predict HCC occurrence or recurrence. Measurement of the Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) has been introduced for the evaluation of liver fibrosis. Because elevated M2BPGi in CHB is related to liver fibrosis and the prediction of HCC development, monitoring its progression is essential. Because alpha fetoprotein (AFP) has insufficient sensitivity and specificity for early-stage HCC, a combination of AFP plus protein induced by vitamin K absence factor II, or AFP plus Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of alpha-fetoprotein might improve the diagnosis of HCC development. Additionally, Dickkopf-1 and circulating immunoglobulin G antibodies are the novel markers to diagnose HCC or assess HCC prognosis. This review provides an overview of novel HBV biomarkers used for the management of intrahepatic viral replicative activity, liver fibrosis, and HCC development.
