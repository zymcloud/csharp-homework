Aims:Intestinal mucositis is the most common side effect of 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) treatment in cancer patients. Previous research suggested that andrographolide (Andro) attenuated the intestinal injury in colitis or diarrhea in mice. The present study was aimed at investigating the protective effect of Andro against 5-Fu induced intestinal mucositis and the underlying mechanism.Main methods:BALB/C mice were injected 5-Fu at a dose of 100 mg/kg for 5 days to induce intestinal mucositis. Andro at different doses (25, 50, 100 mg/kg/day) was administered. Weight loss, diarrhea score, cellular apoptosis and proliferation were evaluated. Apoptosis related proteins were detected by Western blotting. Then, NCM460 cells were used to explore the possible mechanism in vitro. The effect of Andro on the anti-tumor efficacy of 5-Fu was investigated in H22 tumor-bearing mice.Key findings:Andro significantly ameliorated the 5-Fu induced weight loss and diarrhea. The apoptosis of intestinal cells was also attenuated by Andro treatment both in vivo and in vitro. Besides, Andro markedly down-regulated the 5-Fu-induced protein expression of caspase8/3, Bax and the phosphorylation of p38. Moreover, 5-Fu significantly reduced the viability of NCM460 cells, which was restored by the Andro pretreatment. Furthermore, asiatic acid, an agonist of p38 MAPK, reversed the anti-apoptotic effect of Andro in NCM460 cells. Andro did not weaken the anti-H22 tumor effect of 5-Fu in vivo.Significance:We have demonstrated that p38 MAPK inhibition mediates anti-apoptotic effects of Andro against 5-Fu induced intestinal mucositis, suggesting that Andro may benefit the patients undergoing 5-Fu based chemotherapy.
