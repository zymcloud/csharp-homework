Background:Sorafenib has been shown to improve survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, full dose can be difficult to tolerate. The aim of this study was to determine whether sorafenib starting dose and mean dose intensity affect survival.Methods:Patients treated with sorafenib for HCC from January 2008 to July 2016 in several Canadian provinces were included and retrospectively analyzed. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) of patients starting on sorafenib full dose compared to reduced dose. Secondary analysis compared OS with different mean dose-intensity groups. Survival outcomes were assessed with Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models. A propensity score analysis was performed to account for treatment bias and confounding.Results:Of 681 patients included, sorafenib was started at full dose in 289 patients (42%). Median survival for starting full and reduced dose was 9.4 months and 8.9 months (P = .15) respectively. After propensity score matching and adjusting for potential confounders there was still no difference in survival (HR 0.8, 95% CI, 0.61-1.06, P = .12). Almost half of the patients (45%) received a dose intensity 75%, 50%-75%, and Conclusions:Starting HCC patients on a reduced dose of sorafenib compared to full dose may not compromise survival. Mean dose-intensity of sorafenib may also not affect survival.
