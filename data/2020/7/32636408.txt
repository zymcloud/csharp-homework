Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are often aberrantly expressed in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). We hypothesize that lncRNAs modulate HCC prognoses through differential deregulation of key lncRNAs affecting important gene network in key cancer pathways associated with pertinent clinical phenotype. Here, we present a novel approach integrating lncRNA-mRNA expression profiles with clinical characteristics to identify lncRNA signatures in clinically-relevant co-expression lncRNA-mRNA networks residing in pertinent cancer pathways. Notably one network, associated with poorer prognosis, comprises five up-regulated lncRNAs significantly correlated (|Pearson Correlation Coefficient|â‰¥ 0.9) with 91 up-regulated genes in the cell-cycle and Rho-GTPase pathways. All 5 lncRNAs and 85/91 (93.4%) of the correlated genes were significantly associated with higher tumor-grade while 3/5 lncRNAs were also associated with no tumor capsule. Interestingly, 2/5 lncRNAs that are correlated with numerous genes in this oncogenic network were experimentally shown to up-regulate genes involved in cell-cycle and transcriptional regulation. Another network comprising 4 down-regulated lncRNAs and 8 down-regulated metallothionein-family genes are significantly associated with tumor invasion. The identification of these key lncRNAs signatures that deregulate important network of genes in key cancer pathways associated with pertinent clinical phenotype may facilitate the design of novel therapeutic strategies targeting these 'master' regulators for better patient outcome.
