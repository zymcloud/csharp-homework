Background & aims:Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a subtype of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that can lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, is characterized by hepatic inflammation. Despite evolving therapies aimed to ameliorate inflammation in NASH, the transcriptional changes that lead to inflammation progression in NAFLD remain poorly understood. The aim of this pilot study was to define transcriptional changes in early, non-fibrotic NAFLD using two independent biopsy-proven NAFLD cohorts.Methods:We extracted RNA from liver tissue of 40 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD based on NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) (23 patients with NAS ≤3, 17 with NAS ≥5) and 21 healthy controls, and we compared changes in expression of 594 genes involved in innate immune function. Using plasma from an independent cohort of 67 patients with NAFLD and 15 healthy controls, we validated the gene changes observed using a multiplex protein assay.Results:Compared to healthy controls, NAFLD patients with NAS ≥5 had differential expression of 211 genes, while those with NAS ≤3 had differential expression of only 14 genes. Notably, osteopontin (SPP1) (3.74-fold in NAS ≤3, 8.28-fold in NAS ≥5) and CXCL10 (2.27-fold in NAS ≤3, 8.28-fold in NAS ≥5) gene expression were significantly upregulated with histologic progression of NAFLD. Plasma osteopontin (SPP1) and CXCL10 are significantly increased in the presence of NAFLD, regardless of histologic grade. In addition, the plasma levels of these two proteins distinguish clearly between the presence or absence of NAFLD (AUC>0.90).Conclusions:Osteopontin (SPP1) and CXCL10 are upregulated early in non-fibrotic NAFLD and may serve as valuable non-invasive biomarkers.
