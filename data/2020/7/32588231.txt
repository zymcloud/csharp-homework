Alizarin has been reported to have an antigenotoxic activity along with an inhibitory effect on the tumor cell growth of human colon carcinoma cells. Alizarin was biotransformed into an O-methoxide derivative using O-methyltransferase from Streptomyces avermitilis MA4680 (SaOMT2) to enhance its bioefficacy. The biotransformed product was extracted, purified, and characterized using various chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses, and confirmed to be an alizarin 2-O-methoxide. The antiproliferative activity of the compound against gastric cancer cells (AGS), uterine cervical cancer (Hela), liver cancer (HepG2), and normal cell lines was investigated. Alizarin 2-O-methoxide showed an inhibitory effect on all three cancer-cell lines at very low concentrations, from 0.078 ÂµM, with no cytotoxicity against 267B1 (human prostate epithelial) and MRC-5 (normal human fetal lung fibroblast).
