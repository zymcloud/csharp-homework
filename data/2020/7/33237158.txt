Background:Majority of patients with large size HCC (>10 cm) are not offered surgery as per Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) criteria and hence, their outcomes are not well studied, especially from India, owing to a lower incidence.Aim:To analyze outcomes of surgery for large HCCs.Methods:This retrospective observational study included all patients who underwent surgery for large HCC from January 2007 to December 2017. The entire perioperative and follow up data was collected and analyzed.Results:Nineteen patients were included. Ten were non-cirrhotic; 16 were BCLC grade A; one BCLC grade B; and two were BCLC C. Two cirrhotic and three non-cirrhotic underwent preoperative sequential trans-arterial chemoembolization and portal vein embolization. Right hepatectomy was the most commonly done procedure. The postoperative 30-day mortality rate was 5% (1/19). Wound infection and postoperative ascites was seen in seven patients each. Postoperative liver failure was seen in five. Two cirrhotic and two non-cirrhotic patients had postoperative bile leak. The hospital stay was 11.9Â±5.4 days (median 12 days). Vascular invasion was present in four cirrhotic and five non-cirrhotic patients. The median follow-up was 32 months. Five patients died in the follow-up period. Seven had recurrence and median recurrence free survival was 18 months. The cumulative recurrence free survival was 88% and 54%, whereas the cumulative overall survival was 94% and 73% at one and three years respectively. Both were better in non-cirrhotic; however, the difference was not statistically significant. The recurrence free survival was better in patients without vascular invasion and the difference was statistically significant (p=0.011).Conclusion:Large HCC is not a contraindication for surgery. Vascular invasion if present, adversely affects survival. Proper case selection can provide the most favorable survival with minimal morbidity.
