The development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has been a turning point in chronic hepatitis C treatment. With an efficacy rate on viral eradication close to 100% and an excellent safety profile, they have replaced interferon-based treatments as first-line therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV). Following the encouraging results observed during the first years with these treatments, new publications suggested an unexpectedly high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients previously treated with DAAs as well as a higher HCC recurrence rate in them. The possible interaction between DAAs and HCC and its impact on HCC incidence and recurrence still remains controversial. The aim of the present work is to review the current state of the matter by analyzing studies that evaluate the association between chronic hepatitis C treatment with DAAs and the development of HCC either de novo or as a recurrence. Following this, clinical practice recommendations are done.
