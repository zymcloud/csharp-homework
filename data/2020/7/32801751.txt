Background:The pregnane X receptor (PXR) not only plays an important role in cellular metabolism processes but also induces the resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells to molecularly targeted drugs by mediating their metabolism and clearance by these cells. Endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1 (EPAS-1) acts as a coactivator to regulate the transcription factor activity of PXR. In the present study, a microRNA that potentially targets EPAS-1, namely miR-3609, was identified using the miRDB tool.Methods:The expression of miR-3609 and EPAS-1 was examined by qPCR. Lentiviral particles containing the full-length sequences of miR-3609 (pri-miR-3609) were prepared. The antitumor effect of antitumor agents was examined by the in vitro and in vivo assays.Results:The expression of miR-3609 was negatively correlated with that of EPAS-1 in both HCC clinical specimens and paired non-tumor specimens, and the effect of miR-3609 on the expression of EPAS-1 was confirmed by Western blot experiments. Overexpression of miR-3609 decreased the expression of EPAS-1 and, in turn, repressed the activation of the PXR pathway. miR-3609 decreased the transcription factor activation of PXR, repressed its recruitment to its target gene promoter regions, and decreased the expression of its target genes CYP3A4 and P-GP. In addition, miR-3609 decelerated the metabolism and clearance of sorafenib in HCC cells and enhanced the antitumor effect of sorafenib in HCC cells.Conclusion:Therefore, the results indicate that miR-3609 decreases the expression of EPAS-1 and enhances the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib.
