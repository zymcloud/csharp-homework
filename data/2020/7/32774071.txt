Background:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) have shown promising local benefits for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). S-1, a composite preparation of a 5-fluorouracil prodrug, has proven to be a convenient oral chemotherapeutic agent with definite efficacy against advanced HCC.Aim:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE followed by HAIC with or without oral S-1 for treating advanced HCC.Methods:In this single-center, open-label, prospective, randomized controlled trial, 117 participants with advanced HCC were randomized to receive TACE followed by oxaliplatin-based HAIC either with (TACE/HAIC + S-1, n = 56) or without (TACE/HAIC, n = 61) oral S-1 between December 2013 and September 2017. Two participants were excluded from final analysis for withdrawing consent. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) and secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate, disease control rate and safety.Results:In total, 115 participants (100 males and 15 females; mean age, 57.7 years Â± 11.9) were analyzed. The median PFS and OS were 5.0 mo (0.4-58.6 mo) (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.82 to 6.18) vs 4.4 mo (1.1-54.4 mo) (95%CI: 2.54 to 6.26; P = 0.585) and 8.4 mo (0.4-58.6 mo) (95%CI: 6.88 to 9.92) vs 8.3 mo (1.4-54.4 m) (95%CI: 5.71 to 10.96; P = 0.985) in the TACE/HAIC + S-1 and TACE/HAIC groups, respectively. The objective response rate and disease control rate were 30.9% vs 18.4% and 72.7% vs 56.7% in the TACE/HAIC + S-1 and TACE/HAIC groups, respectively. Grade 3/4 adverse events had a similar frequency in both treatment groups.Conclusion:No improvements in tumor response rates, PFS or OS were observed with the addition of S-1 to TACE/HAIC in advanced HCC. Both treatment regimens had a similar safety profile.
