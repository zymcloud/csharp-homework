Background/aims:The utility of serum pepsinogen (sPG) I and the sPGI/II ratio as biomarkers for screening individuals with gastric cancer (GC) has not been established in Korea. The aim of this study was to define the role of sPG, especially sPGII, in GC screening.Methods:This study enrolled 2,940 subjects, including patients with GC (n=1,124) or gastric dysplasia (n=353) and controls (n=1,463). Tests to determine sPG levels and Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection status were performed. Area under the curve and receiver operating characteristic curve were calculated to identify the optimal cutoff values for sPG. The usefulness of sPG levels for the detection of GC and gastric dysplasia was validated by multivariate logistic regression.Results:The sPGI/II ratio was associated with the risk of gastric dysplasia and advanced-stage intestinal-type GC (IGC). In contrast, sPGII was associated with the risk of early-stage diffuse-type GC (DGC). Significantly higher risk was indicated by an sPGI/II ratio <3 for gastric dysplasia and advanced-stage IGC and by sPGII levels ≥20 µg/L for early-stage DGC. Positive HP status showed a stronger association with DGC than with IGC. When sPGII level and HP status were combined, the prevalence of DGC was higher in the ≥20 µg/L sPGII and HP-positive group. Age younger than 40 years was strongly related to early-stage DGC, especially in females (odds ratio, 21.00; p=0.006).Conclusions:sPGII ≥20 ng/mL and positive HP status suggest a risk of early-stage DGC, particularly in young adult females in South Korea.
