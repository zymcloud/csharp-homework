Objectives: Immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and SSc related interstitial lung diseases (SSc-ILD) include cyclophosphamide (CYC), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), azathioprine (AZA) and methotrexate (MTX). The objectives were to compare and rank these therapies in term of forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco) % predicted and adverse events (AEs).Methods: We present pooled estimates of mean difference (MD) and odds rates (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) among different therapies. We also ranked these agents with surface under the cumulative ranking probability (SUCRA).Results: CYC plus AZA had the highest SUCRA probability (70%) on reducing risk of the deterioration of FVC compared with CYC, observation (OBS), MMF and AZA. While for the prevention of the deterioration of DLco, MMF showed the highest SUCRA probability (76%) compared with others. Moreover, AZA showed the lowest probability (32%) for AEs among active interventions.Conclusions: CYC plus AZA was the preferred immunosuppressive strategies compared to others on preventing the deterioration of FVC. MMF resulted with the highest probability as the best in preventing the deterioration of DLco. Monotherapy of AZA was less pulmonary function benefit but related less AEs.
