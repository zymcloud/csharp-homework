Purposes:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. Recent researches have demonstrated that m6A methylation regulators play a key role in various cancers, such as gastric cancer and colon adenocarcinoma. Several m6A methylation regulators are reported to predict the prognosis of HCC. Therefore, there is a need to further identify the predictive value of m6A methylation regulators in HCC.Methods:We utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to obtain the gene expression profile of m6A RNA methylation regulators and clinical information for patients with HCC. Besides, we identified two clusters of HCC with various clinical factors by consensus clustering analysis. Then the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and the Cox regression analysis were applied to construct a prognostic signature.Results:Except for ZC3H13 and METTL14, a majority of the thirteen m6A RNA methylation regulators were significantly overexpressed in HCC specimens. HCC patients were classified into two groups (cluster 1 and cluster 2). The cluster 1 was with a significantly worse prognosis than cluster 2, and most of the 13 known m6A RNA methylation regulators were upregulated in cluster 1. Besides, we developed a prognostic signature consisting of YTHDF2, YTHDF1, METTL3, KIAA1429, and ZC3H13, which could successfully differentiate high-risk patients. More importantly, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the signature-based risk score was an independent prognostic factor for patients with HCC.Conclusions:Our study showed these five m6A RNA methylation regulators can be used as practical and reliable prognostic tools of HCC, which might have potential value for therapeutic strategies.
