Background and aims:The features of non-viral, nonalcohol hepatocellular carcinoma (NBNC-HCC) remain elusive. The aim of this study was to investigate this clinical characteristics and overall survival of NBNC-HCC compared to hepatitis B- (HBV-HCC) and hepatitis C-related (HCV-HCC) HCC.Methods:We analyzed the etiologies, fibrosis stages, clinical data, and outcomes of newly diagnosed patients with HCC.Results:A total of 1777 HCC patients were recruited, including 332 patients with NBNC-HCC, 682 patients with HBV-HCC, 680 patients with HCV-HCC, and 83 patients with HBV/HCV HCC. Patients with NBNC-HCC were older (69.9 Â± 11.9 years). Patients with NBNC-HCC exhibited a higher prevalence of diabetes (43.9%) compared to the HBV-HCC (27.1%, p Conclusions:Patients with NBNC-HCC have a higher risk of diabetes than patients with HCC of viral etiologies. Although patients with NBNC-HCC exhibited a milder fibrosis stage, their more advanced HCC stages and worse overall survival should be taken into consideration in clinical care.
