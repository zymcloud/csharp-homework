Background:To evaluate the clinical diagnostic efficacy of the combination of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of AFP/total AFP (AFP-L3%) for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A comprehensive and systemic literature search was executed in Web of Science, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library websites. Then, the related articles were reviewed and the quality of included studies was evaluated with the QUADAS tool. Further, serum samples were collected from 49 HCC patients, 52 cirrhosis patients, 47 hepatitis patients, and 48 healthy controls and these samples were tested for AFP and AFP-L3% levels.Results:A total of 16 eligible articles were included in our meta-analysis. The overall sensitivity (SEN) of AFP + AFP-L3% was higher than that of AFP or AFP-L3 alone; the overall specificity (SPE) of AFP + AFP-L3% was lower than that of AFP or AFP-L3 alone. In the original study, the related statistics were, respectively, SEN = 0.592 and SPE = 0.918 for AFP; SEN = 0.367 and SPE = 1.000 for AFP-L3%; and SEN = 0.592 and SPE = 0.918 for the combination.Conclusion:The results of meta-analysis indicate there is a beneficial effect of using the unity of AFP and AFP-L3% for HCC diagnosing. However, in the original study, just for the results of sensitivity and specificity, there is no significant difference between AFP alone and AFP + AFP-L3%.
