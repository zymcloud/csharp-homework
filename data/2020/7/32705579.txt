Multidisciplinary tumour clinics represent the modern state-of-the-art cancer care. However, liver tumour clinics are resource exhaustive and establishing them in resource restricted scenarios is a challenge. We present core concepts in establishing a multidisciplinary tumour clinic, followed by our 5-year experience of multidisciplinary liver tumour clinic from Tata Memorial Hospital Mumbai, India, which represents one of the largest hepatobiliary oncology units in the country. This study provides a roadmap for setting up a multidisciplinary liver tumour clinic and explains the stepwise real-time working of the clinic. The account will act as a blueprint for the establishment of such clinics in the country and abroad.
