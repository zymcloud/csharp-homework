In this study, a transferrin/folic acid double-targeting graphene oxide drug delivery system loaded with doxorubicin was designed. Graphene oxide was prepared by ultrasound improved Hummers method and was modified with Pluronic F68, folic acid, and transferrin to decrease its toxicity and to allow dual-targeting. The results show that the double target drug delivery system (TFGP*DOX) has good and controllable drug delivery performance with no toxicity. Moreover, TFGP*DOX has a better inhibitory effect on SMMC-7721 cells than does a single target drug delivery system (FGP*DOX). The results of drug release analysis and cell inhibition studies showed that TFGP*DOX has a good sustained release function that can reduce the drug release rate in blood circulation over time and improve the local drug concentration in or near a targeted tumor. Therefore, the drug loading system (TFGP*DOX) has potential application value in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
