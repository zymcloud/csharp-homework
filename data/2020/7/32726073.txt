Background:Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an important, inherited cause of chronic liver disease. Marked variation in fibrosis stages in patients with homozygous deficiency and those factors that determine whether heterozygous carriers develop liver fibrosis, remain unexplained. Murine studies implicate polymerized alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) within hepatocytes as pathogenic.Aims and methods:The relationship between the quantity of polymerized AAT within hepatocytes (polymer load), stage of hepatic fibrosis and liver-related clinical outcomes (death, evolution to hepatocellular carcinoma, or need for liver transplantation) were investigated using liver tissue from 92 patients at first presentation with either homozygous or heterozygous AATD. Further tissue-based studies were undertaken to determine if polymerized AAT was associated with failure of cell cycle progression, accelerated aging or hepatocyte senescence by immunohistochemical analysis.Results:The AAT polymer load correlated closely with hepatic fibrosis stage and long-term clinical outcome, independent of homozygous or heterozygous status. AAT polymers within hepatocytes correlated closely with failure of cell cycle progression assessed using cell cycle phase markers, accelerated aging manifest as shortened telomeres and other markers consistent with hepatocyte senescence manifest as the presence of nuclear p21 expression and enlarged nuclei. The proportion of p21 positive hepatocytes or hepatocytes with enlarged nuclei correlated with hepatic fibrosis stage and the long-term clinical outcome.Conclusion:These data suggest that accumulation of AAT polymers within hepatocytes drives senescence. Quantitation of both the AAT polymer load or hepatocyte senescence markers correlated with hepatic fibrosis stage and the long-term clinical outcome. Either or both could be considered markers of disease severity and treatment response in clinical trials.
