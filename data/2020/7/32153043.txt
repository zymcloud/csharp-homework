Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the third most frequent cause of cancer-related death. The IRX5 transcription factor plays a different role in multiple cancers and contributes to the development of many tumours. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of IRX5 in HCC. In this study, we found that IRX5 was abnormally upregulated in HCC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. IRX5 promoted HCC cell proliferation and upregulated the expression of cyclin D1 and knockdown of IRX5 suppressed tumorigenicity in vivo. Furthermore, knockdown of IRX5 increased p53 and Bax expression and decreased Bcl-2 expression. Thus, IRX5 suppressed apoptosis in HCC cells by inhibiting the p53 signalling pathway, indicating its role as a treatment target for HCC.
