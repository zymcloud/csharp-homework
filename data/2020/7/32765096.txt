Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a tumor that exhibits glucometabolic reprogramming, with a high incidence and poor prognosis. Usually, HCC is not discovered until an advanced stage. Sorafenib is almost the only drug that is effective at treating advanced HCC, and promising metabolism-related therapeutic targets of HCC are urgently needed. The "Warburg effect" illustrates that tumor cells tend to choose aerobic glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which is closely related to the features of the tumor microenvironment (TME). The HCC microenvironment consists of hypoxia, acidosis and immune suppression, and contributes to tumor glycolysis. In turn, the glycolysis of the tumor aggravates hypoxia, acidosis and immune suppression, and leads to tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion and metastasis. In 2017, a mechanism underlying the effects of gluconeogenesis on inhibiting glycolysis and blockading HCC progression was proposed. Treating HCC by increasing gluconeogenesis has attracted increasing attention from scientists, but few articles have summarized it. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms associated with the TME, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis and the current treatments for HCC. We believe that a treatment combination of sorafenib with TME improvement and/or anti-Warburg therapies will set the trend of advanced HCC therapy in the future.
