Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a more common malignancy than the majority of cancers and ranks second in the world's top causes of cancer-related mortality. The objective of the study was to investigate and explain how circularRNA-9119 (circ9119) regulated the properties of HCC cell lines. Cancer cells isolated from HCC patients and HCC cell lines showed clearly upregulated expression of circ9119 and Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) with decreased levels of miR-26a compared to healthy controls and normal hepatic cells. To determine the function of circ9119, circ9119 was silenced in HCC cells, resulting in significantly less proliferation of HCC cells and increasing apoptosis. Circ9119 silencing also resulted in the upregulation of miR-26a. Bioinformatics prediction and dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that circ9119 targeted miR-26a. Further studies revealed that miR-26a had the opposite effect on circ9119; the inhibition of miR-26a antagonized circ9119 silencing, leading to reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, while the ectopic overexpression of miR-26a impaired cell growth. Additionally, we found that the JAK1 3'-UTR was targeted by miR-26a; a decrease in the levels of JAK1 protein and mRNA followed transfection of a miR-26a mimic. Administration of the JAK1 inhibitor, baricitinib, caused the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and revealed an effect similar to that of circ9119 silencing on cell proliferation and apoptosis. These results showed that circ9119 could modulate apoptosis, and broadly, cell proliferation by competitively binding miR-26a, which targeted JAK1-STAT3, in HCC cell lines. This study is a novel description of circ9119 regulation of HCC.
