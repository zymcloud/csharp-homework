Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)is a major type of primary liver cancer. It is one of the major causes of cancer-related death in the world,because of its high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. Surgical resection is currently the major treatment measure for early-and middle-stage patients. Because most patients have already missed the opportunity for surgery when the disease is confirmed, conservative chemotherapy (drug treatment)is still an important method of comprehen-sive treatment for patients with middle-and late-stage liver cancer. However, the presence of multidrugs resistance(MDR)in patients with HCC severely reduces the treatment effect and becomes an important obstacle to the success of chemothera-py. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)is an important biomarker for the diagnosis of HCC. The expression levels of serum AFP in many patients with HCC increase, and the persistently increased AFP level is a risk factor for HCC progression. Many stud-ies have indicated that AFP functions as an immune suppressor, and AFP can promotes malignant transformation during HCC development and might be involved in the process of MDR in patients with liver cancer. This review describes the drug resistance mechanisms during drug treatment of HCC,and reviews the relationship between the mechanism of AFP in the development and progression of HCC andHCC drug resistance.
