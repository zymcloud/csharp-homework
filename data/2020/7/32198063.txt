Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a crucial medical problem. Precise and concise prognostic models are urgently needed because of the intricate gene variations among liver cancer cells. We conducted this study to identify a prognostic gene signature with biological significance. We applied two algorithms to generate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HCC and normal specimens in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort (training set included) and performed enrichment analyses to expound on their biological significance. A protein-protein interactions network was established based on the STRING online tool. We then used Cytoscape to screen hub genes in crucial modules. A multigene signature was constructed by Cox regression analysis of hub genes to stratify the prognoses of HCC patients in the training set. The prognostic value of the multigene signature was externally validated in two other sets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE14520 and GSE76427), and its role in recurrence prediction was also investigated. A total of 2000 DEGs were obtained, including 1542 upregulated genes and 458 downregulated genes. Subsequently, we constructed a 14-gene signature on the basis of 56 hub genes, which was a good predictor of overall survival. The prognostic signature could be replicated in GSE14520 and GSE76427. Moreover, the 14-gene signature could be applied for recurrence prediction in the training set and GSE14520. In summary, the 14-gene signature extracted from hub genes was involved in some of the HCC-related signalling pathways; it not only served as a predictive signature for HCC outcome but could also be used to predict HCC recurrence.
