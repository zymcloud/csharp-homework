Aims:Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a novel gasotransmitter can be endogenously produced in liver by cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE). The dysfunctions of CSE/H2S system have been linked to various liver diseases. Acetyl-CoA is the key intermediate from the metabolism of lipid. This study examined the roles of H2S in hepatic acetyl-CoA and lipid metabolism.Materials and methods:Both in vitro cell model and in vivo animal model of lipid accumulation were used in this study. Western blotting and real-time PCR were used for analysis of protein and mRNA expression. Acetyl-CoA was analyzed by a coupled enzyme assay, and lipid accumulation was observed with Oil Red O staining.Key findings:Incubation of human liver carcinoma (HepG2) cells with a mixture of free fatty acids (FFAs) or high glucose reduced CSE expression and H2S production, promoted intracellular accumulation of acetyl-CoA and lipid. Supply of exogenous NaHS or cysteine reduced acetyl-CoA contents and lipid accumulation, while blockage of CSE activity promoted intracellular lipid accumulation. Furthermore, H2S blocked FFAs-induced transcriptions of de novo lipogenesis, inflammation, and fibrosis-related genes. In vivo, knockout of CSE gene stimulated more hepatic acetyl-CoA and lipid accumulation in mice induced by high-fat choline-deficient diet. The expressions of lipogenesis, inflammation, and fibrosis-related genes were significantly higher in liver tissues from CSE knockout mice when compared with wild-type mice.Significance:CSE/H2S system is indispensable for maintaining the homeostasis of acetyl-CoA and lipid accumulation and protecting from the development of inflammation and fibrosis in liver under excessive caloric ingestion.
