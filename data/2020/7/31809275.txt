We report an elderly man with hepatocellular carcinoma who developed a rash after undergoing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). On examination, there was a reticulated macular pigmentation over the chest and upper abdomen. Skin biopsy revealed foreign material that occluded the small dermal cutaneous vessels. These structures were perfectly spherical, homogeneously eosinophilic, and were also nonrefractile. They had a maximum diameter of 40 Î¼m, consistent with the size of the microspheres used in TACE. TACE is a palliative measure used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma in patients who are not surgical candidates. Vaso-occlusive manifestations of the skin are rare occurrences, with only 8 reported cases. Seven cases attributed this to nontarget embolization of the hepatic falciform artery and 1 case postulated that collateral supply of the targeted area allowed for hematogenous migration of the occluding beads via the microcirculation. Pertaining to treatment, all patients were treated with oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents to good effect, with 1 patient receiving additional laser treatment and another having local steroid injections. Prognosis is excellent, because the skin lesions tend to resolve within a year. Several methods have been suggested to prevent these vaso-occlusive skin complications, including prophylactic application of ice or placing the tip of the microcatheter distal to the origin of the hepatic falciform artery and falciform artery.
