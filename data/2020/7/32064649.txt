A potential role of dietary lipids in the management of hepatic glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) has been proposed, but no consensus on management guidelines exists. The aim of this study was to describe current experiences with dietary lipid manipulations in hepatic GSD patients. An international study was set up to identify published and unpublished cases describing hepatic GSD patients with a dietary lipid manipulation. A literature search was performed according to the Cochrane Collaboration methodology through PubMed and EMBASE (up to December 2018). All delegates who attended the dietetics session at the IGSD2017, Groningen were invited to share unpublished cases. Due to multiple biases, only data on GSDIII were presented. A total of 28 cases with GSDIII and a dietary lipid manipulation were identified. Main indications were cardiomyopathy and/or myopathy. A high fat diet was the most common dietary lipid manipulation. A decline in creatine kinase concentrations (n = 19, P
