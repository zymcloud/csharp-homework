Transarterial embolization/transarterial chemoembolization (TAE/TACE) is the acceptable palliative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), mainly through ischemic necrosis induced by arterial embolization. However, how HCC cells survive under such ischemic hypoxic condition remains unclear, which can be exploited to potentiate TAE/TACE treatment. We hypothesized that targeting mitophagy can increase HCC cell apoptosis during hypoxia. HCC cells were subjected to hypoxia and then mitophagy was quantified. The role of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) in hypoxia-induced HCC mitophagy was determined. Moreover, the synergistic effect of hypoxia and DRP1 inhibitor on HCC apoptosis was assessed in vitro and in vivo. Clinical association between DRP1 expression and outcome for HCC patients was validated. HCC cells that survived hypoxia showed significantly increased DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission and mitophagy compared with cells in normoxia. Hypoxia induced mitophagy in surviving HCC cells by enhancing DRP1 expression and its translocation into the mitochondria and excessive mitochondrial fission into fragments. Blocking the DRP1 heightened the possibility of hypoxic cytotoxicity to HCC cells due to impaired mitophagy and increased the mitochondrial apoptosis, which involved decreased in mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial release of apoptosis-inducing factor and cytochrome c. Additionally, DRP1 inhibitor Mdivi-1 suppressed the in vivo growth of hypoxia-exposed HCC cells. High expression of DRP1 was significantly associated with shorter survival in HCC patients. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that blocking DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission and mitophagy increases the incidence of mitochondrial apoptosis of HCC cells during hypoxia, suggesting the new approach of targeting mitophagy to potentiate TAE/TACE.
