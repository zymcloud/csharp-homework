Objective:This study was conducted in order to assess the diagnostic accuracy of LI-RADS v2018 ancillary features (AFs) favoring malignancy applied to LR-3 and LR-4 observations on gadoxetate-enhanced MRI.Methods:In this retrospective dual-institution study, we included consecutive patients at high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) imaged with gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI between 2009 and 2014 fulfilling the following criteria: (i) at least one LR-3 or LR-4 observation ≥ 10 mm; (ii) nonrim arterial phase hyperenhancement; and (iii) confirmation of benignity or malignancy by pathology or imaging follow-up. We compared the distribution of AFs between HCCs and benign observations and the diagnostic performance for the diagnosis of HCC using univariate and multivariate analyses. Significance was set at p value Results:Two hundred five observations were selected in 155 patients (108 M, 47 F) including 167 (81.5%) LR-3 and 38 (18.5%) LR-4. There were 126 (61.5%) HCCs and 79 (28.5%) benign lesions. A significantly larger number of AFs favoring malignancy were found in LR-3 and LR-4 lesions that progressed to HCC compared to benign lesions (p Conclusions:Among all AFs, HBP hypointensity yields the highest sensitivity for the diagnosis of HCC.Key points:• LR-3 and LR-4 observations diagnosed as HCC have a significantly higher number of ancillary features favoring malignancy compared to observations proven to be benign. • The presence of three or more ancillary features favoring malignancy has a high specificity (96.2%) for the diagnosis of HCC. • Among all ancillary features favoring malignancy, hepatobiliary phase hypointensity yields the highest sensitivity, but also the lowest specificity for the diagnosis of HCC.
