UBE2L3 is a ubiquitin-conjugating protein belonging to the E2 family that consists of 153 amino acid residues. In this study, we found that UBE2L3 was generally upregulated in clinical HCC samples compared to non-tumour samples and that there was a strong association between high UBE2L3 expression and tumour size, clinical grade and prognosis in HCC patients. UBE2L3 depletion inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of HCC cells. At the molecular level, we observed that UBE2L3 depletion enhanced the protein stability of GSK3β, thus promoting the expression and activation of GSK3β. Subsequently, activated GSK3β phosphorylated p65 and promoted its nuclear translocation to increase the expression of target genes, including PUMA, Bax, Bim, Bad, and Bid. In vivo, knockout of UBE2L3 in HCC cells inhibited tumour growth in orthotopic liver injection nude mouse models. Moreover, inhibition of p65 or GSK3β significantly restored the effects induced by UBE2L3 knockout in HCC. Together, this study reveals the stimulatory effect of UBE2L3 on HCC cell proliferation, suggesting that UBE2L3 may be an important pro-tumorigenic factor in liver carcinogenesis and a potential therapeutic target of HCC.
