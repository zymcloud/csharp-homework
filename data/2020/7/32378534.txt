Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (CHC) is a relatively rare tumor with an incidence range of 1.0-4.7%. CHC is defined as a tumor containing unequivocal, intimately mixed components of both hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The recent development of biochemical methodologies and cancer stem cell theory have paved the way for a clearer understanding of the histogenesis of CHC. The latest edited WHO classification published in 2010 adopted the concept of stem cell/hepatic progenitor cells in the pathological classification of CHC. Although this classification includes novel and unique concepts of histogenesis and facilitates the recognition of CHC, there are several problems with it in practice. To reduce confusion, an international group of hepatic pathologists, radiologists, surgeons, and clinicians formulated a nomenclature for CHC and issued a consensus article in 2018. In this review article, we discuss the problems with the latest WHO classification and introduce recent topics concerning CHC from pathologic and genetic points of view.
