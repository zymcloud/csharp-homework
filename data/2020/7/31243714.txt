Introduction:Although a positive surgical margin is a known prognostic factor for recurrence, the optimal surgical margin width in the context of an R0 resection for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still debated. The aim of the current study was to examine the impact of wide (> 1 cm) versus narrow (Methods:Between 1998 and 2017, patients with T1 HCC who underwent R0 hepatectomy for stage T1 HCC were identified using an international multi-institutional database. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was estimated, and recurrence patterns were examined based on whether patients had a wide versus narrow resection margins.Results:Among 404 patients, median patient age was 66 years (IQR: 58-73). Most patients (n = 326, 80.7%) had surgical margin 1 cm margin. The majority of patients had early recurrences ( 1 cm: 85.7%, p = 0.141); recurrence site was mostly intrahepatic ( 1 cm: 61.9%, p = 0.169). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS among patients with margin 1 cm, respectively (p = 0.02). Among patients undergoing anatomic resection, resection margin did not impact RFS (3-year RFS: 1 cm: 58.9%, p = 0.169), whereas in the non-anatomic resection group, margin width > 1 cm was associated with a better 3-year RFS compared to margin 1 cm remained protective against recurrence (HR = 0.50, 95%CI 0.28-0.89), whereas Child-Pugh B (HR = 2.13, 95%CI 1.09-4.15), AFP > 20 ng/mL (HR = 1.71, 95%CI 1.18-2.48), and presence of microscopic lymphovascular invasion (HR = 1.48, 95%CI 1.01-2.18) were associated with a higher hazard of recurrence.Conclusion:Resection margins > 1 cm predicted better RFS among patients undergoing R0 hepatectomy for T1 HCC, especially small (
