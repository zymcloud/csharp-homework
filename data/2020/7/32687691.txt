Background:Primary gastric melanoma (PGM) is a rare malignant tumour of the stomach with poor prognosis. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the available literature on this entity and to highlight its biological behaviour and preferred treatment approach.Methods:PubMed and Cochrane bibliographical databases were independently searched (last search: 2 February 2020) by two investigators for articles reporting on PGM in the adult population.Results:Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria and concerned collectively 25 patients (18 males and seven females) with an age of 63.4 ± 8.97 years (mean ± standard deviation). Main symptoms included abdominal pain (64%), weight loss (48%) and hematemesis or melena (32%). The most frequent tumour location was the body of the stomach (54.2%). All tumours were surgically resected and the majority of the patients had a partial gastrectomy (52%). Median recurrence time was 5 months and 12% of patients reached 5-year survival landmark.Conclusion:PGM is a rare disease characterized by an aggressive malignant behaviour. Its differential diagnosis from a metastatic lesion is crucial. A prompt diagnosis and therapeutic approach are needed. Further studies are required to elucidate the optimal management of this clinical entity.
