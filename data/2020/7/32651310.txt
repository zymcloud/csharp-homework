Objective:IL-17 is considered to be a cancer-promoting gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we explored the effect of IL-17 in predicting the therapeutic effect of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with apartinib in patients with HCC in this study.Methods:Established of IL-17 knockdown SK-Hep1 cells for studying the effects of IL-17 expression on the invasion and migration of human HCC cells in vitro by transwell assay and tumor angiogenesis in nude mouse. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of IL-17, E-cadherin, Vimentin and CD34 protein in 175 cases of human HCC tumor tissues. Kaplan-Meier was used to analyze the prognostic significance of TACE combined with apatinib treatment in HCC patients.Results:n SK-Hep1 cells, IL-17 knockdown could increase E-cadherin protein expression, reduce vimentin protein expression, inhibit cell invasion and migration in vitro, and inhibit angiogenesis of tumor and decrease plasma VEGF level in nude mouse. In tumor tissues of HCC patients, IL-17 protein expression was negatively correlated with E-cadherin protein expression (r = -0.622, P Conclusion:IL-17 had a pivotal role in the invasion and angiogenesis of HCC and contribute to the selection of patients who may benefit from adjuvant TACE combined with apatinib.
