Background:For lack of accurate early diagnosis and prognostic assessment, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) becomes severe challenge with the fourth cancer-related mortality. Recently, non-coding RNA (ncRNA) was identified to make functions in progression of various tumors. Among that, a novel ncRNA, small nucleolar RNA C/D box 31 (SNORD31) was suggested in previous study to function as potential tumor suppressing role. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the expression patterns and clinical significance of SNORD31 in HCC.Methods:SNORD31 expression was calculated in HCC cell lines as well as clinical specimens by RT-PCR. HCC patients were subdivided into high and low SNORD31 expression groups and their clinical characteristics were compared. Besides, the association between SNORD31 expression and postoperative prognosis was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis.Results:Compared with corresponding normal reference, expression levels of SNORD31 were significantly down-regulated in both HCC cell lines and clinical specimens (PConclusions:The ncRNA SNORD31 was proved to be commonly down-regulated in HCC and was independently associated with multiple malignant characteristics and long-term prognosis of HCC patients, which implied that SNORD31 possessed potential as a novel HCC biomarker.
