Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a known carcinogen found in contaminated food and designated by the World Health Organization as a class I carcinogenic substance. AFB1 presents with carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and mutagenicity, and the liver is the human organ most susceptible to AFB1. Zinc (Zn), which is one of the essential nutrient elements that could protect the cells from biological toxins, heavy metals, hydrogen peroxide, metal chelators and radiation, is assessed in this study for its potential to alleviate AFB1-induced cytotoxicity. Samples were divided into three groups, namely CK, AFB1, and AFB1+Zn. Protein expressions were analyzed by two-way electrophoresis combined with flight mass spectrometry, with 41 differentially expressed proteins identified in the results, mainly related to oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, DNA damage, and energy metabolism. Zn was found to regulate the expression of peroxidases (peroxiredoxin-1, peroxiredoxin-5, peroxiredoxin-6) to relieve AFB1-induced oxidative stress. Moreover, Zn could decrease the expression of pro-apoptotic genes (cleaved-caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax) and increase the expression of anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl) to alleviate the cell apoptosis induced by AFB1. In addition, AFB1 reduced intracellular ATP levels, whereas Zn supplementation boosted ATP levels and maintained homeostasis and a steady state of cellular energy metabolism by modulating AMPK-ACC phosphorylation levels, while many zinc finger proteins changed after AFB1 treatment. These results, therefore, indicate that Zn could alleviate AFB1-induced cytotoxicity by changing the expressions of zinc finger proteins in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2 cells).
