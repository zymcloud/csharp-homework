Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with hepatocyte injury, excessive oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation in fatty liver, and can progress to more severe liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, currently there are no effective therapies for NASH. Marine carotenoid, fucoxanthin (Fx), abundant in brown seaweeds, has variable biological properties, such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-obesity. However, the effect of Fx on the development of NASH has not been explored. We investigated the protective effects of Fx in diet-induced NASH model mice fed choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined high fat diet (CDAHFD). Fx administration significantly attenuated liver weight gain and hepatic fat accumulation, resulting in the alleviation of hepatic injury. Furthermore, the Fx-fed mice, not only exhibited reduced hepatic lipid oxidation, but also decreased mRNA expression levels of inflammation and infiltration-related genes compared to that of the CDAHFD-fed mice. Moreover, fucoxanthinol and amarouciaxanthin A, two Fx metabolites exerted anti-inflammatory effects in the liver via inhibiting the chemokine production in hepatocytes. In case of fibrosis, one of the features of advanced NASH, the expression of fibrogenic factors including activated-hepatic stellate cell marker was significantly decreased in the liver of Fx-fed mice. Thus, the present study elucidated that dietary Fx not only inhibited hepatic oxidative stress and inflammation but also prevented early phase of fibrosis in the diet-induced NASH model mice.
