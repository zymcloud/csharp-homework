Aim: We investigated the effect of the combination of heat shock protein 90α (HSP90α), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods & results: A total of 409 patients with HCC, 101 patients with benign liver disorder and 78 healthy individuals were retrospectively analyzed. HSP90α level was higher in HCC patients than in controls. The expression of HSP90α showed a positive correlation with tumor stage, differentiation, lymph node metastasis and tumor thrombus formation. The combination of HSP90α, AFP and TK1 improved the diagnostic sensitivity (89.24%) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.919). Conclusion: The detection of HSP90α, AFP and TK1 is more efficient than a single tumor marker for the diagnosis of HCC.
