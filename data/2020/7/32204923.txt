Background:Posthepatectomy decompensation remains a frequent and poor outcome after hepatectomy, but its prediction is still inaccurate. Liver stiffness measurement can predict posthepatectomy decompensation, but there is a so-called "gray zone" that requires another predictor. Because splenomegaly is an objective sign of portal hypertension, we hypothesized that spleen volumetry could improve the identification of patients at risk.Methods:Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent hepatectomy in our tertiary center between August 2014 and December 2017 were reviewed. The primary endpoint was to determine if the spleen volumetry and liver stiffness measurement were independent predictors of posthepatectomy decompensation, and secondarily, to determine if they were synergistic through a theoretic predictive model.Results:One hundred and seven patients were included. The median follow-up time was 3 months (3-5). Postoperative 90-day mortality was 4.7%. By multivariate analysis, liver stiffness measurement and spleen volumetry predicted posthepatectomy decompensation. The liver stiffness measurement had a cutoff point of 11.6 kPa (area under receiver operating curve = 0.71 confidence interval 95% 0.71-0.88, sensitivity: 89%, specificity: 47%). The spleen volumetry cutoff point was 381.1 cm3 (area under receiver operating curve = 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.77-0.93, sensitivity: 55%, specificity: 91%). The spleen volumetry improved prediction of posthepatectomy decompensation, because use of the spleen volumetry increased sensitivity (from 62% to 97%) and the negative predictive value (from 96% to 100%) along with a negligible decrease in specificity (from 96.7 to 93.4) and positive predictive value (from 64% to 59%) (P = .003).Conclusion:Spleen volumetry (>380 cm3) and liver stiffness measurement (>12 kPa) are non-invasive, independent, and synergistic tools that appear to be able to predict posthepatectomy decompensation. The importance of this finding is that these measurements may help to anticipate posthepatectomy decompensation and may possibly be used to direct alternative treatments to resection.
