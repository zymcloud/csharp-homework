Liver metastases remain a major cause of death from gastrointestinal tract cancers and other malignancies, such as breast and lung carcinomas. Understanding the underlying biology is essential for the design of effective therapies. We previously identified the chemokine CCL7 and its receptor CCR3 as critical mediators of invasion and metastasis in lung and colon carcinoma cells. Here we show that the CCL7/CCR3 axis regulates a late stage in invadopodia genesis namely, the targeting of MMP-9 to the invadopodia complex, thereby promoting invadopodia maturation and collagen degradation. We show that this process could be blocked by overexpression of a dominant negative RhoA in highly invasive cells, while a constitutively active RhoA upregulated invadopodia maturation in CCL7-silenced and poorly invasive and metastatic cells and also enhanced their metastatic potential in vivo, collectively, implicating RhoA activation in signaling downstream of CCL7. Blockade of the ERK or PI3K pathways by chemical inhibitors also inhibited invadopodia formation, but affected the initiation stage of invadopodia genesis. Our data implicate CCL7/CCR3 signaling in invadopodia maturation and suggest that chemokine signaling acts in concert with extracellular matrix-initiated signals to promote invasion and liver metastasis.
