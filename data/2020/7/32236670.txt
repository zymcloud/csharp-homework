Background:The number of elderly patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is progressively increasing. The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of conventional transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in elderly HCC patients compared with younger adults.Methods:A consecutive cohort of unresectable HCC patients treated with TACE as a first-line treatment was retrospectively analyzed. Patients were categorized into "elderly" (â‰¥ 70 years, 80 patients) and "younger" (Results:cTACE was well tolerated in both groups. The cumulative risk of both liver-related death and progression-free survival after cTACE was comparable between "elderly" and "younger" (death: 73.8% vs 69.4%, P = 0.505; progression-free survival: 48.2% vs 44.8%, P = 0.0668). Propensity model matched 61 patients in each group for gender and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging. Even after matching, the cumulative risk of liver-related death and of progression-free survival did not differ between the two groups. At multivariate analysis, Child-Pugh class, tumor gross pathology and alpha-fetoprotein were independently associated with the liver-related mortality risk.Conclusions:This study confirms that TACE is well tolerated and effective in patients aged 70 years or more with unresectable HCC as it is for their younger counterparts ( 31 ng/ml).
