Background:To analyze the clinical and infectious characteristics of new coronavirus pneumonia with diagnosed and suspected cases in the Second Hospital of WISCO(Wuhan Iron and Steel Company) of Qingshan District, Wuhan City, and further enhance the understanding of new coronavirus pneumonia.Methods:According to the fifth and sixth editions of the new coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, we carried out the case analysis and infectious disease investigation and research on the confirmed and suspected cases of new coronavirus pneumonia admitted to the second-floor ward of the hospital from January 28th, 2020, to February 26th, 2020.Results:From January 28th, 2020 to February 26th, 2020, 83 patients were admitted, 40 were cured, and 7 died. Before February 13th, 69 patients were admitted, including 22 confirmed patients and 47 suspected patients. After February 13th, the data of newly hospitalized suspected patients decreased to 2 people. The average time from onset to diagnosis was 5.38 days. About 57.1% of the confirmed patients were isolated at home before admission, and 53.2% of the suspected patients were isolated by hospital observation before admission. The proportion of fever and other clinical symptoms was 81.8%, 65.5% of the patients had the fastest heart rate of 90-120 rpm, and 11 of the patients had severe/critical illness, accounting for 20%. The count of leukocytes, neutrophils, and C-reactive proteins (CRPs) in severe patients was higher than those in light patients (P<0.05), and the count of lymphocytes was lower than that in mild patients (P=0.016).Conclusions:The novel coronavirus pneumonia in Qingshan District of Wuhan in February was diagnosed promptly, controlled,and treated effectively. The combination of traditional Chinese and western medicine in the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia might help patients.
