Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor with frequent intrahepatic metastases; extrahepatic metastases are not rare but less frequent compared to intrahepatic ones. The most frequent sites of extrahepatic metastases are the lungs, followed by the lymph nodes, bones, and adrenal glands. Case report covering gastrointestinal (GI) tract involvement from HCC is limited.Case presentation:A 60-year-old man was referred to us in May 2019 with a diagnosis of sigmoid colon tumor. The patient had a history of HCC and had received two stages of open resections for the primary and the abdominal metastasis successively and many times of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). The sigmoid colon tumor received Hartmann procedure after abdominal enhanced computerized tomography (CT) scan and colonoscopy, while postoperative pathology and immunohistochemistry identified it as extrahepatic colonic metastasis from HCC.Conclusions:The ratio of extrahepatic metastasis to the digestive tract was very low, and the majority was upper gastrointestinal involvement because of direct invasion or intraperitoneal implantation. TACE may be the risk factor of retrograde hematogenous metastasis to the downstream colon.
