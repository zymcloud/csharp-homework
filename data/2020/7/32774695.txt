Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has an extremely poor prognosis and is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Immune checkpoint suppression has become the most effective treatment option for liver cancer. The strategies used for immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting cancer therapies have been affected by some significant successes, including blocking the advanced-stage malignant tumor by death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand (PDL-1), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA4) pathways. T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domains (TIGIT) is an immune checkpoint that participates in tumor immune surveillance. Mainly expressed on T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and other antigen-presenting cells (APCs), it diminishes cytokine production and exhibits strong suppressive properties. TIGIT achieves a more active antitumor immune response and highlights a pivotal role for cancer immunotherapy. Preclinical studies have found inhibitory effects using a targeted approach. Monotherapy targeting TIGIT or in combination with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of patients with advanced solid malignancies have demonstrated improved antitumor immune responses. Due to the high tumor heterogeneity of liver cancer, immune checkpoint suppression therapy still needs further exploration. Therefore, we provide insights into the characteristics of TIGIT and the immune system in HCC.
