Background:We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Highly Upregulated in Liver Cancer (HULC) and microRNA-372 (miR-372) as biochemical markers in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and HCV-infected patients.Methods:The present study was conducted on 100 Egyptian individuals divided into 3 groups, 40 patients with HCC and HCV infection, 40 patients only HCV-infected, and 20 individuals as normal controls. They were subject to full history taking, full clinical and laboratory examination, and assessment of HULC and miR-372 levels by real-time PCR.Results:A statistically significant difference was found with pConclusion:HULC could be considered as a potential non-invasive marker for detection and early diagnosis of HCC. Also, it may play an important role in the early prophylaxis and control measures to reduce the incidence of HCC. However, miR-372 cannot be considered as a reliable marker as HULC for early detection of HCC especially in HCV patients.
