Background:Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is a non-invasive ablative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This report aimed to address the limited availability of long-term outcomes after SBRT for HCC from North America.Methods:Localized HCC patients without vascular invasion, who were ineligible for other liver-directed therapies and treated with SBRT at the University of Toronto or University of Michigan, were pooled to determine overall survival (OS), cumulative recurrence rates, and ≥ grade-3 toxicity. Multivariable analysis determined factors affecting OS and local recurrence rates.Results:In 297 patients with 436 HCCs (42% > 3 cm), one-, three- and five-year OS was 77·3%, 39·0% and 24·1%, respectively. On Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, liver transplant after SBRT, Child-Pugh A liver function, alpha-fetoprotein ≤ 10 ng/ml, and Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group performance status 0 significantly improved OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0·06, 95% confidence interval [CI- 0·02-0·25; pConclusions:SBRT confers high local control and long-term survival in a substantial proportion of HCC patients unsuitable for, or refractory to standard loco-regional treatments. Liver transplant should be considered if appropriate downsizing occurs after SBRT.
