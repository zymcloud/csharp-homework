Background & aims:The quality of surgical care of patients with HCC is associated with improved long-term prognosis and may also be influenced by the type of surgical approach. The present study aimed at evaluating the role of the laparoscopic approach on quality of surgical care and long-term prognosis in optimal HCC surgical candidates.Methods:All consecutive patients undergoing open (OLR) or laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) for early-stage HCC in cirrhosis (METAVIR F4) at 5 French expert hepato-pancreatico-biliary centres between 2010 and 2018 were enrolled. Quality of surgical care was defined by textbook outcome (TO), a combination of 6 criteria representing ideal hospitalisation. Factors associated with TO were determined on multivariate analysis. Comparison between LLR and OLR was performed after propensity score matching (PSM). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). Statistical cure was modelled using a non-mixture model.Results:Overall, 425 patients were included. Median follow-up was 42.0 months. LLR was performed in 267 (62.8%) patients. TO was achieved in 140 (32.9%) patients. LLR was independently associated with TO (odds ratio [OR] 2.81; 95% CI 1.29-6.12; p = 0.009). After PSM, LLR patients cumulated higher number of TO criteria than OLR patients (5 vs. 4; p = 0.012). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year DFS of LLR patients with and without TO were 82.3%, 64.4%, and 62.5%, and 76.9%, 51.4%, and 30.2%, respectively (p = 0.003). On multivariable Cox regression, TO was independently associated with improved DFS (hazard ratio 0.34; p = 0.001). The cure fraction of the whole population was 24.4%. Patients achieving TO had increased cure fraction than patients not achieving TO (32.6% vs. 18.1%).Conclusions:Quality of surgical care improves the prognosis of patients with early-stage HCC and is promoted by the laparoscopic approach.Lay summary:The overall quality of surgical care, as measured by TO, plays a pivotal role in the prognosis and, in particular, on the probability of statistical cure of patients with resectable early-stage HCC occurring in cirrhosis. By influencing TO, laparoscopy has an indirect impact on the probability of cure and long-term management of these patients. This study strongly supports the promising curative role of mini-invasive treatments for early-stage HCC, such as low-difficulty LLR.
