Multiphoton fluorescence lifetime microscopy has revolutionized studies of pathophysiological and xenobiotic dynamics, enabling the spatial and temporal quantification of these processes in intact organs in vivo. We have previously used multiphoton fluorescence lifetime microscopy to characterise the morphology and amplitude weighted mean fluorescence lifetime of the endogenous fluorescent metabolic cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) of mouse livers in vivo following induction of various disease states. Here, we extend the characterisation of liver disease models by using nonlinear regression to estimate the unbound, bound fluorescence lifetimes for NAD(P)H, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), along with metabolic ratios and examine the impact of using multiple segmentation methods. We found that NAD(P)H amplitude ratio, and fluorescence lifetime redox ratio can be used as discriminators of diseased liver from normal liver. The redox ratio provided a sensitive measure of the changes in hepatic fibrosis and biliary fibrosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma was associated with an increase in spatial heterogeneity and redox ratio coupled with a decrease in mean fluorescence lifetime. We conclude that multiphoton fluorescence lifetime microscopy parameters and metabolic ratios provided insights into the in vivo redox state of diseased compared to normal liver that were not apparent from a global, mean fluorescence lifetime measurement alone.
