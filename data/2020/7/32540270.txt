Introduction:Hepatitis B is a major preventable cause of morbidity and mortality from chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to evaluate the performance and outcomes of the Korean Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Programme (PHBPP) and to investigate the impact of the current post-exposure immunoprophylaxis protocol.Methods:A retrospective cohort study was performed based on electronic data registry of infants born to hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected mothers between July 2002 and 2013.Results:During the study period, 159,983 Korean infants were registered with the PHBPP, with an overall programme coverage of 92.8%. Despite receiving timely post-exposure immunoprophylaxis, 8.6% of infants born to mothers aged Conclusions:A substantial number of infants have been prevented from hepatitis B since the PHBPP was launched in the Republic of Korea. Continued efforts to promote the programme, an integrated approach to maximising its coverage, a risk-stratified strategy, and innovations in logistics could further reduce perinatal HBV transmission.
