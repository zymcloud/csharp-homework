At present, most studies on the relationship between hepatitis B virus (HBV) and IL-33/ST2 axis focus on clinical detection, but the underlying molecular mechanisms of HBx and IL-33/ST2 axis regulation and Th cell function regulation have not been explored. In this study, serum samples of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and HBV-related liver cancer (HBV-HCC), and healthy controls, as well as the supernatant solutions of HL7702-WT, HL7702-NC, and HL7702-HBx cells were collected to detect the content of soluble ST2 (sST2). The contents of Th1 cytokines (TNF-α and TNF-γ) and Th2 cytokines (IL-6 and IL-10) in the supernatant of different co-culture groups were detected. The effects of GATA2 on ST2 promoter transcription were investigated by upregulation or interference with GATA2 expression, dual-luciferase reporting, and ChIP experiments. The combined detection of sST2 and FIB-4 was beneficial to the non-invasive diagnosis of liver fibrosis. HBx promotes sST2 expression in liver cells, upregulates Th2 cell function, and inhibits Th1 cell function through IL-33/ST2 axis. HBx interacts with GATA2 to influence the activity of ST2 promoter. Serum sST2 detection is an invaluable indicator for the assessment of the progress of HBV infectious diseases, and the IL-33/ST2 axis plays an important role in changing the cellular immune function caused by HBV infection.
