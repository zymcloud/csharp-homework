Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most malignant cancers with high morbidity and mortality. Nowadays, AFP-negative hepatocellular carcinoma (AFP-NHCC) has been found in many HCC patients and AFP analysis can't be used to screen HCC in these cases. In this study, we have examined the expression patterns of pre-albumin (PA), fibrinogen, D-Dimer and their clinical significance in AFP-NHCC. We recruited 214 AFP-NHCC patients and 210 controls in the study. PA, fibrinogen and D-Dimer levels were detected by turbidimetry, clauss and immunoturbidimetry methods, respectively. Serum PA levels were significantly lower in AFP-NHCC (84.5 ± 24.7 mg/L) than that in the controls (240.6 ± 59.4 mg/L, P
