Aberrant metabolisms have been hypothesized to precede the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), therefore, we investigated biomarkers associated with subsequent HCC in peripheral bloods using metabolomic technologies. A cohort of 475 HCC-naïve liver cirrhotic patients were recruited and prospectively followed. A total of 39 patients developed HCC in the follow-up period. Baseline plasma metabolites were explored using untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance. Candidates were then quantified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography. A series of univairiate and multivariate analysis showed that Phenylalanine (Phe) and Glutamine (Gln) levels are associated with time to HCC, independent of viological etiologies and age. A HCC risk score R was then constructed using the polynomial combination of age, Phe and Gln in the units of micromolar (μM):[Formula: see text] R correlates with the time to HCC significantly (Hazard ratio [HR] = 2.368, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.760-3.187, P
