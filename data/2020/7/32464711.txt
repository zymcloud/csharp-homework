Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) are benign liver tumours that may be complicated by haemorrhage or malignant transformation to hepatocellular carcinoma. Epidemiological data are fairly outdated, but it is likely to assume that the incidence has increased over the past decades as HCA are more often incidentally found due to the more widespread use of imaging techniques and the increased incidence of obesity. Various molecular subgroups have been described. Each of these molecular subgroups are defined by specific gene mutations and pathway activations. Additionally, they are all related to specific risk factors and show a various biological behaviour. These molecular subgroups may be identified using immunohistochemistry and molecular characterization. Contrast-enhanced MRI is the recommended imaging modality to analyse patients with suspected hepatocellular adenoma allowing to determine the subtype in up to 80%. Surgical resection remains to be the golden standard in treating HCA, although resection is deemed unnecessary in a large number of cases, as studies have shown that the majority of HCA will regress over time without complications such as haemorrhage or malignant transformation occurring. It is preferable to treat patients with suspected HCA in high volume centres with combined expertise of liver surgeons, hepatologists, radiologists and (molecular) pathologists.
