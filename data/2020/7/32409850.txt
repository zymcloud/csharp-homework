The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) continues to increase worldwide, presently affecting 25% of the adult population, and is associated with an elevated risk of total and liver-specific mortality. NAFLD is a chronic disease and results from a combination of genetic, environmental and predominantly lifestyle-related causes. Therefore, NAFLD, similarly to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and many different types of cancer, can be considered a noncommunicable disease. Consequently, lifestyle intervention, particularly if associated with a large amount of weight loss, is considered highly effective and safe to treat NAFLD. For patients with advanced-stage NAFLD or that cannot lose weight, metabolically-based pharmacotherapy is effective to improve liver histology and cardiometabolic risk profile. If a moderate or advanced stage of liver fibrosis is present, additional antifibrotic therapy is necessary to halt the progression of the disease.
