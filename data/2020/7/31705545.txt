Background and aims:In some states, liver transplantation (LT) for alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is covered by Medicaid only with documentation of abstinence and/or alcohol rehabilitation. Different Medicaid policies may affect the distribution of LT for ALD, particularly post-2011, as centers have adopted early (i.e., specific abstinence period not required) LT practices.Approach and results:We surveyed Medicaid policies in all states actively performing LT and linked state policies to prospectively collected national registry data on LT recipients from 2002 to 2017 with ALD as the primary listing diagnosis. We categorized Medicaid policies for states as "restrictive" (requiring documentation of a specific abstinence period and/or rehabilitation) versus "unrestrictive" (deferring to center eligibility policies). Difference-of-differences analysis, comparing 2002-2011 versus 2012-2017, evaluated whether restrictive policies were associated with decreased proportion of LTs paid by Medicaid among patients with ALD post-2011. We performed sensitivity analyses to account for any differences by diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatitis C virus, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or Medicare insurance. We also performed a sensitivity analysis to account for any difference by prevalence of ALD among restrictive versus unrestrictive states. Of 10,836 LT recipients in 2002-2017, 7,091 were from 24 states in the restrictive group and 3,745 from 14 states in the unrestrictive group. The adjusted proportion (95% confidence interval) of LTs paid by Medicaid among restrictive versus unrestrictive states between 2002 and 2011 was 17.6% (15.4%-19.8%) versus 18.9% (15.4%-22.3%) (P = 0.54) and between 2012 and 2017, 17.2% (14.7%-19.7%) versus 23.2% (19.8%-26.6%) (P = 0.005). In difference-of-differences analysis, restrictive (versus unrestrictive) policies were associated with a 4.7% (0.8%-8.6%) (P = 0.02) absolute lower adjusted proportion of LTs for ALD paid by Medicaid post-2011.Conclusions:Restrictive Medicaid policies are present in most states with active LT centers and are associated with lower proportions of LTs for ALD paid by Medicaid post-2011 compared to states with unrestrictive Medicaid policies. Reevaluation of Medicaid alcohol use policies may be warranted, to align more closely with contemporary center-level practices.
