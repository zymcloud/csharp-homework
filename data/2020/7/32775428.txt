Knockdown of Annexin A7 (ANXA7) or C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibits the proliferation, migration, invasion, and lymphatic adhesion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, suggesting that ANXA7 and JNK signaling pathways contribute to HCC growth and lymph node metastasis (LNM). While the intervening molecular pathways are largely unknown, emerging evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in ANXA7 and JNK signaling. To identify potential therapeutic targets for HCC, we screened for lncRNAs differentially expressed among Hca-P cells stably expressing shRNA-ANXA7, shRNA-JNK, or control-shRNA. RNA sequencing identified 216 lncRNAs differentially expressed between shRNA-ANXA7 and control-shRNA cells, of which 101 were downregulated and 115 upregulated, as well as 436 lncRNAs differentially expressed between shRNA-JNK and control-shRNA cells, of which 236 were downregulated and 200 upregulated. Fifty-six lncRNAs were differentially expressed under both ANXA7 and JNK knockdown. We selected 4 of these for verification based on putative involvement in cancer regulation according to GO and KEEG analyses of target genes. Knockdown of ANXA7 or JNK suppressed expression of NONMMUT012084.2, NONMMUT024756.2, and ENSMUST00000130486, and enhanced expression of ENSMUST00000197932. These lncRNAs are intriguing candidate targets for mechanistic analysis of HCC progression and therapeutic intervention.
