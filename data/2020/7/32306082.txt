Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) is used in traditional Chinese medicine as a herbal supplement for improving memory. Exposure of B6C3F1/N mice to GBE in a 2-year National Toxicology Program (NTP) bioassay resulted in a dose-dependent increase in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). To identify key microRNAs that modulate GBE-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, we compared the global miRNA expression profiles in GBE-exposed HCC (GBE-HCC) and spontaneous HCC (SPNT-HCC) with age-matched vehicle control normal livers (CNTL) from B6C3F1/N mice. The number of differentially altered miRNAs in GBE-HCC and SPNT-HCC was 74 (52 up and 22 down) and 33 (15 up and 18 down), respectively. Among the uniquely differentially altered miRNAs in GBE-HCC, miR-31 and one of its predicted targets, Cdk1 were selected for functional validation. A potential miRNA response element (MRE) in the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR) of Cdk1 mRNA was revealed by in silico analysis and confirmed by luciferase assays. In mouse hepatoma cell line HEPA-1 cells, we demonstrated an inverse correlation between miR-31 and CDK1 protein levels, but no change in Cdk1 mRNA levels, suggesting a post-transcriptional effect. Additionally, a set of miRNAs (miRs-411, 300, 127, 134, 409-3p, and 433-3p) that were altered in the GBE-HCCs were also altered in non-tumor liver samples from the 90-day GBE-exposed group compared to the vehicle control group, suggesting that some of these miRNAs could serve as potential biomarkers for GBE exposure or hepatocellular carcinogenesis. These data increase our understanding of miRNA-mediated epigenetic regulation of GBE-mediated hepatocellular carcinogenesis in B6C3F1/N mice.
