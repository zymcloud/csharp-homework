Background:Hepatitis B and C viruses are leading causes of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR-7) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of HCC linked to hepatitis B. We hypothesised a role of leukocyte TLR-7 mRNA in hepatitis C related liver cirrhosis and HCC, using alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and liver function tests as comparators.Methods:We recruited 102 patients with HCV-related HCC, 97 with HCV-related liver cirrhosis and 60 healthy controls. Quantification of TLR-7 mRNA was performed using real-time PCR, AFP and routine LFTs by standard techniques.Results:TLR-7 mRNA levels were significantly lower in HCC patients compared to cirrhotic patients and lower again in healthy controls (p P < 0.01), but for AFP was 0.57 (95% CI 0.48-0.65, P = 0.09). We derived an index score using age, AST and TLR-7 mRNA for the diagnosis of HCC. The ROCC/AUC for the index was superior to all three root indices in the prediction of HCC. The index linked significantly with the Tokyo and Vienna liver cancer staging systems, but not with those of the CLIP and Okuda systems, in distinguishing HCC from liver cirrhosis.Conclusion:The combination of TLR-7 mRNA levels with age and AST improves the performance of TLR-7 in HCC diagnosis, out-performs alpha-fetoprotein and predicts early HCC.
