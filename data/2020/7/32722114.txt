Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most common and lethal human cancers worldwide. Despite curative resection, high recurrence of HCC remains a big threat, leading to poor patient outcomes. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) pre-S mutants, which harbor deletions over pre-S1 and pre-S2 gene segments of large surface proteins, have been implicated in HCC recurrence. Therefore, a reliable approach for detection of pre-S mutants is urgently needed for predicting HCC recurrence to improve patient survival. In this study, we used a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based platform for quantitative detection of pre-S mutants in the plasma of HBV-related HCC patients and evaluated their prognostic values in HCC recurrence. We demonstrated that the presence of deletions spanning the pre-S2 gene segment and the high percentage of pre-S2 plus pre-S1 + pre-S2 deletions, either alone or in combination, was significantly and independently associated with poor recurrence-free survival and had greater prognostic performance than other clinicopathological and viral factors in predicting HCC recurrence. Our data suggest that the NGS-based quantitative detection of pre-S mutants in plasma represents a promising approach for identifying patients at high risk for HBV-related HCC recurrence after surgical resection in a noninvasive manner.
