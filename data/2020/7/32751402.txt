Hydrophobic and amphiphilic derivatives of the biocompatible and biodegradable poly(dimethylmalic acid) (PdiMeMLA), varying by the nature of the lateral chains and the length of each block, respectively, have been synthesized by anionic ring-opening polymerization (aROP) of the corresponding monomers using an initiator/base system, which allowed for very good control over the (co)polymers' characteristics (molar masses, dispersity, nature of end-chains). Hydrophobic and core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) were then prepared by nanoprecipitation of hydrophobic homopolymers and amphiphilic block copolymers, respectively. Negatively charged NPs, showing hydrodynamic diameters (Dh) between 50 and 130 nm and narrow size distributions (0.08 < PDI < 0.22) depending on the (co)polymers nature, were obtained and characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), zetametry, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Finally, the cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of the obtained NPs were evaluated in vitro using the hepatoma HepaRG cell line. Our results showed that both cytotoxicity and cellular uptake were influenced by the nature of the (co)polymer constituting the NPs.
