Various surgical methods impact the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) differently. However, clinical guidelines remain inconsistent and the relative importance of predictors of survival outcomes requires further evaluation. The present study aimed to rank the importance of predictive factors that impact the survival outcomes of patients with HCC and to compare the prognosis associated with different surgical methods based on data obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. To achieve these aims, the present study used a random forest (RF) model to detect important predictive factors associated with survival outcomes in patients with HCC. Cox regression analysis was used to compare different surgery methods. The variables included in the Cox regression model were selected based on the Gini index calculated by the RF model. Using the RF model, the present study demonstrated that surgery method, tumor size and age were the first, second and third most important factors associated with HCC prognosis, respectively. Overall, patients who underwent local tumor destruction [(hazard ratio (HR)=0.48; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.45-0.51; P
