Purpose of review:Ablation techniques are now well-established treatment options available for the management of primary and secondary hepatic malignancies. Currently available ablative techniques include radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), cryoablation, and irreversible electroporation (IRE). Along with advances in navigational devices and targeting technologies, ablation combined with other therapies may be the next therapeutic option in thermal ablation. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the current status of ablative technologies in interventional and medical oncology for management of liver malignancies.Recent findings:With the use of combination techniques (i.e., ablation and transarterial embolization procedures), thermal ablation is now moving toward treating tumors larger than 3 cm in size or tumors with macrovascular invasion. Ongoing trials are examining the optimum timing of combination therapies. Thermal ablation combined with hepatic resection may increase the number of patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma to the liver who qualify for curative surgery. Combination therapies of thermal ablation and transarterial embolization allow for promising treatment responses for larger HCC. Surgery combined with thermal ablation can potentially increase the number of patients with metastatic colon cancer to the liver who qualify for curative surgery.
