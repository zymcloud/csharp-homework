Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent primary liver cancer but has shown limited success to date in the treatment of advanced stage. Recruitment of T cells for cancer treatment is a rapidly growing strategy in immunotherapy such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells and bispecific antibodies. However, unwanted aggregations, structural instability or short serum half-life are major challenges of bispecific antibodies. Here, we developed a new format of T cell-redirecting antibody that is bispecific for membrane proteoglycans GPC3 of HCC and the T-cell-specific antigen CD3, which demonstrated to be favorable stability and productivity. Cross-linking of T cells with GPC3 positive tumor cells by the anti-GPC3/CD3 bispecific antibody-mediated potent GPC3-dependent and concentration-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro. Administration of the bispecific antibody with different concentrations in murine xenograft models of human HCC significantly inhibited tumor growth. In addition, no effects on tumor growth were observed in the absence of human effector cells or the bispecific antibody. Taken together, the anti-GPC3/CD3 bispecific antibody might be a potential therapeutic treatment for HCC.
