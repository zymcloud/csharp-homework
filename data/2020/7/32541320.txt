Purpose of review:Sarcomas are a diverse group of rare solid tumors with limited treatment options for patients with advanced, inoperable disease. Cabozantinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently approved for advanced renal cell, hepatocellular, and medullary thyroid carcinoma. Cabozantinib has potent activity against a variety of kinases, including MET, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, and AXL, that are associated with sarcoma growth and development. Here we review the preclinical findings and clinical development of cabozantinib in the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), osteosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma.Recent findings:In vitro, cabozantinib has shown relevant activity in inhibiting the growth and viability of soft tissue sarcoma, GIST, osteosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma tumor cell lines. Cabozantinib also promoted the regression of GIST in various murine xenografts, including imatinib-resistant models. More than 10 prospective trials with cabozantinib that included patients with sarcomas have been completed or are currently ongoing. Clinical activity with cabozantinib has been recently reported in phase 2 clinical trials for patients with GIST and for patients with osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma.Summary:Cabozantinib has shown promising activity for the treatment of various sarcomas, supporting further evaluation in this setting.
