Objective:To study the impact of LT experience on the outcome of CLR for locally advanced hepatobiliary malignancy SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:: Despite evolution in LT knowledge and surgical techniques in the past decades, there is yet data to evaluate the significance of LT experience in performing CLR.Methods:Postoperative outcome after CLR between 1995 and 2019 were reviewed and correlated with LT experience in a single center with both LT and CLR service. CLR was defined as hepatectomy with vasculobiliary reconstruction, or multivisceral resection, central bisectionectomy (S4/5/8), or associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy. Spearman rank correlation and receiver operating characteristic analysis were used to define the association between CLR-related outcomes and LT experience.Results:With cumulative single-center experience of 1452 LT, 222 CLR were performed during the study period [hepatectomy with biliary (27.0%), or vascular (21.2%) reconstruction, with multivisceral resections (9.9%), with associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (18.5%)] mainly for hepatocellular carcinoma (53.2%), and hilar cholangiocarcinoma (14%). Median tumor size was 7.0 cm. Other features include macrovascular invasion (23.4%), and juxta-visceral invasion (14%). Major postoperative complication rate was 25.2% and mortality rate was 6.3%. CLR-complication rate was inversely associated with LT experience (R = -0.88, P Conclusion:LT experience was complimentary to CLR for locally advanced hepatobiliary malignancy with improved postoperative outcome.
