Background and aims:Advances in cancer treatment have improved survival; however, local recurrence and metastatic disease-the principal causes of cancer mortality-have limited the ability to achieve durable remissions. Local recurrences arise from latent tumor cells that survive therapy and are often not detectable by conventional clinical imaging techniques. Local recurrence after transarterial embolization (TAE) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) provides a compelling clinical correlate of this phenomenon. In response to TAE-induced ischemia, HCC cells adapt their growth program to effect a latent phenotype that precedes local recurrence.Approach and results:In this study, we characterized and leveraged the metabolic reprogramming demonstrated by latent HCC cells in response to TAE-induced ischemia to enable their detection in vivo using dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) of 13 carbon-labeled substrates. Under TAE-induced ischemia, latent HCC cells demonstrated reduced metabolism and developed a dependence on glycolytic flux to lactate. Despite the hypometabolic state of these cells, DNP-MRSI of 1-13 C-pyruvate and its downstream metabolites, 1-13 C-lactate and 1-13 C-alanine, predicted histological viability.Conclusions:These studies provide a paradigm for imaging latent, treatment-refractory cancer cells, suggesting that DNP-MRSI provides a technology for this application.
