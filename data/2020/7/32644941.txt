In this study, we constructed a new survival model using mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi) for prognostic prediction in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) of HCC transcriptome data (374 HCC and 50 normal liver tissue samples) from the TCGA database revealed 7498 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that clustered into seven gene modules. LASSO regression analysis of the top two gene modules identified ANGPT2, EMCN, GLDN, USHBP1 and ZNF532 as the top five mRNAsi-related genes. We constructed our survival model with these five genes and tested its performance using 243 HCC and 202 normal liver samples from the ICGC database. Kaplan-Meier survival curve and receive operating characteristic curve analyses showed that the survival model accurately predicted the prognosis and survival of high- and low-risk HCC patients with high sensitivity and specificity. The expression of these five genes was significantly higher in the HCC tissues from the TCGA, ICGC, and GEO datasets (GSE25097 and GSE14520) than in normal liver tissues. These findings demonstrate that a new survival model derived from five strongly correlating mRNAsi-related genes provides highly accurate prognoses for HCC patients.
