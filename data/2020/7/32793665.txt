Background:Radiomics can be used to determine the prognosis of liver cancer, but it might vary among cancer types. This study aimed to explore the clinicopathological features, radiomics, and survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), mass-type cholangiocarcinoma (MCC), and combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (CHCC).Methods:This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with primary liver cancer operated at the department of hepatobiliary surgery of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from 07/2013 to 11/2015. All patients underwent preoperative liver enhanced MRI scans and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The radiomics characteristics of DWI and the enhanced equilibrium phase (EP) images were extracted. The mRMR (minimum redundancy maximum relevance) was applied to filter the parameters.Results:There were 44 patients with MCC, 59 with HCC, and 33 with CHCC. Macrovascular invasion, tumor diameter, positive ferritin preoperatively, positive AFP preoperatively, positive CEA preoperatively, Correlation, Inverse Difference Moment, and Cluster Prominence in model A (DWI and clinicopathological parameters) were independently associated with overall survival (OS) (PConclusions:Clinicopathological and radiomics features are independently associated with the OS of patients with primary liver cancer.
