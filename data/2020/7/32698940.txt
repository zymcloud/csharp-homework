The present study aimed to investigate the effect of miR-186 on proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this work, miR-186 was down-regulated in HCC tissues and cells, and low miR-186 level help predict the occurrence of vascular invasion and poor prognosis in patients with HCC. MiR-186 over-expression inhibited cell proliferation and tumor growth of nude mice, repressed migration and invasion abilities, and enhanced apoptosis in HCC cells. MiR-186 also retarded progression of EMT. MiR-186 directly bound to the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR) of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) to inhibit its expression. Over-expression of CDK6 markedly reversed inhibitory effects of miR-186 on proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of HCC cells. Conversely, inhibition of CDK6 exerted synergic effect on biological functions of miR-186. In conclusion, miR-186 represses proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT, and induces apoptosis through targeting CDK6 in HCC, which may provide a new therapeutic target for HCC.
