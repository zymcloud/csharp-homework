The discharge of huge amount of chemicals from industries into the environment has led to toxicity towards different living species. Therefore, risk assessment of these chemicals is essential. In order to comply with the ethical issues, in this present work, we have developed quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for cytotoxicity against GFS (goldfish scale) tissue (Crassius auratus) and enzymatic activity against PLHC-1 cell line (topminnow hepatoma cell line) (Poeciliopsis lucida). The final models were developed by means of PLS (Partial Least Squares) regression method applying only ETA (extended topochemical atom) descriptors. The results obtained from various validation parameters (obtained from the both datasets) suggested that the developed models are statistically robust and predictive. From the insights obtained from the models developed from the Neutral Red dye (NR) dataset, it can be concluded that presence of bulky atoms, unsaturation, branching and hetero atoms (most importantly N, Cl) enhance the cytotoxicity towards the Goldfish scale tissue. On the other hand, in case of the Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) dataset, presence of higher electronegative atoms (O, Cl), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with more number of rings and absence of polar groups and hydrogen bond acceptors enhance enzymatic activity of the PLHC-1 cell line.
