Purpose:To evaluate whether antitumor immunity is enhanced by combining radiofrequency (RF) ablation and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) therapy and to evaluate its effect on untreated tumors.Materials and methods:First, 40 mice with tumors established in the bilateral flanks were randomly divided into 4 groups: the control group, the RF ablation-alone group, the anti-CTLA-4-alone group, and the RF ablation + anti-CTLA-4 group. In each group, 8 mice were used for untreated tumor evaluation and survival observation, and another 2 mice were killed for histopathologic study. Then, a rechallenge test was performed in another 32 mice to determine whether systemic antitumor immunity was established.Results:Although the volume of the untreated tumors continued to increase until the end of the observation in all groups, tumor growth rates in the RF ablation + anti-CTLA-4 group were significantly smaller than tumor growth rates in the other 3 groups (all P Conclusions:This study demonstrated that RF ablation-induced systemic antitumor immunity was enhanced by the combined use of anti-CTLA-4 therapy in a multi-subcutaneous murine hepatoma model.
