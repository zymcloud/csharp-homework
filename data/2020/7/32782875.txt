Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) has been shown to reduce ischemic reperfusion injury for patients undergoing hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastasis. We present a case of a 69-year-old male who underwent right hepatectomy for a multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma of the right liver and concomitant liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh stage A). We performed portal vein embolization prior to surgery and intraoperative RIPC of the iliac vessels. The postoperative course after major hepatectomy went uneventful.
