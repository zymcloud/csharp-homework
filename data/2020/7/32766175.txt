Background:Inflammation-based prognostic scores including systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) have prognostic value in various cancers. We investigated the prognostic value of SII, PLR and NLR in patients who underwent liver transplantation (LT) for HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We retrospectively analyzed the records of 189 patients who underwent LT for HBV-related HCC. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the optimal SII, PLR and NLR cut-off value. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) following LT were calculated. The Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards model were used to evaluate the prognostic value of SII, PLR and NLR.Results:The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were significantly lower in the high SII group (74.1%, 34.2%, and 32.3%, respectively) than in the low SII group (78.5%, 66.9%, and 59.9%, respectively; p = 0.000). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS rates were, respectively, 75.9%, 59.7%, and 49.4% in the high SII group and 93.3%, 80.2%, and 73.7% in the low SII group (p = 0.000). Finally, OS curves were plotted by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the Log rank test. High PLR and NLR scores were also associated with poor OS (p = 0.000 and p = 0.003) and poor RFS (p = 0.000 and p = 0.000). The multivariate analysis demonstrated that AFP ≥400 ng/mL, high MELD score, largest tumor size ≥5cm, SII ≥449.61, NLR ≥5.29, and PLR ≥98.52 were independent prognostic factors for OS.Conclusion:High SII, PLR and NLR are significantly poor prognostic factors for overall survival and recurrence-free survival in patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma after liver transplantation.
