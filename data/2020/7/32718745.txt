The Ultrasound Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (US LI-RADS), introduced in 2017 by the American College of Radiology, standardizes the technique, interpretation, and reporting of screening and surveillance ultrasounds intended to detect hepatocellular carcinoma in high-risk patients. These include patients with cirrhosis of any cause as well as subsets of patients with chronic hepatitis B viral infection. The US LI-RADS scheme is composed of an ultrasound category and a visualization score: ultrasound categories define the exam as negative, subthreshold, or positive and direct next steps in management; visualization scores denote the expected sensitivity of the exam, based on adequacy of liver visualization with ultrasound. Since its introduction, multiple institutions across the United States have implemented US LI-RADS. This review includes a background of hepatocellular carcinoma and US LI-RADS, definition of screening/surveillance population, recommendations and tips for technique, interpretation, and reporting, and preliminary outcomes analysis.
