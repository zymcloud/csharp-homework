A 43 -year-old woman presented to the hospital with a right breast tumor. She had been treated for human immunodeficiency virus(HIV)infection for 5 years. After being diagnosed with right breast cancer, she underwent total mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy, which indicated T2N1M0 triple-negative breast cancer. She received doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide( AC)followed by docetaxel(AC-T)as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. However, 14 months after the adjuvant chemotherapy finished, distant metastasis occurred in the brain, lung, and mediastinum lymph nodes. Treatment for relapse was initiated, with whole brain radiotherapy followed by paclitaxel plus bevacizumab combination therapy(PB); however, new metastatic lesions were found in the bone, liver, and mediastinum lymph node after 2 courses of PB. Given the risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, a BRCAgene test was performed when the patient received radiotherapy for left recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis caused by mediastinal lymph nodes; this showed a result positive for a deleterious mutation in BRCA1. Thus, treatment with olaparib, a poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase(PARP)inhibitor, was started. Metastatic lesions, including barky growth, in the liver metastasis were well controlled, as confirmed by CT imaging 4 months after the start of olaparib.
