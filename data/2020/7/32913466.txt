Cell division cycle associated (CDCA) gene family plays an important role in cells. However, some researchers revealed that overexpression of CDCAs might contribute to the tumor progression in several cancers. Here, we analyzed the role of this gene family in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We used several web tools and found that most of CDCAs were highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to the paracancer tissues in HCC. We then used RT-qPCR to confirm our results. The results showed that CDCA2, CDCA3, CDCA5 and CDCA8 were up-regulated in HCC. We also found that these genes were associated with poor overall survival and relapse free survival except CDCA7. The functional analysis showed that this gene family might take part in many processes, including cell division, apoptosis, DNA damage and DNA repair, which might contribute to the tumor progression. The KEGG pathway analysis showed that these genes participated in several important pathways such as PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and hippo signaling pathway. In conclusion, our findings suggested that CDCA2, CDCA3, CDCA4, CDCA5, and CDCA8 might have potential diagnostic and prognostic values for hepatocellular carcinoma.
