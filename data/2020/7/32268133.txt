The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver diseases ranging from liver inflammation to advanced liver diseases like cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCV infection is restricted to the liver, and more specifically to hepatocytes, which represent around 80% of liver cells. The mechanism of HCV entry in human hepatocytes has been extensively investigated since the discovery of the virus 30 years ago. The entry mechanism is a multi-step process relying on several host factors including heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), tetraspanin CD81, Scavenger Receptor class B type I (SR-BI), Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1). Moreover, in order to establish a persistent infection, HCV entry is dependent on the presence of tight junction (TJ) proteins Claudin-1 (CLDN1) and Occludin (OCLN). In the liver, tight junction proteins play a role in architecture and homeostasis including sealing the apical pole of adjacent cells to form bile canaliculi and separating the basolateral domain drained by sinusoidal blood flow. In this review, we will highlight the role of liver tight junction proteins in HCV infection, and we will discuss the potential targeted therapeutic approaches to improve virus eradication.
