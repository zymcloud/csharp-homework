Despite numerous advances in cancer treatment, the global prevalence and cancer-related mortality remain high. Understanding tumor initiation and progression mechanisms are critical as it will lead to the development of interventions for improving the prognosis of cancer patients. The roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cancer have attracted immense research interest. Growing evidence indicates that lncRNA regulator of reprogramming (linc-ROR), a well-studied RNA, regulates the progression of various cancers, such as lung cancer (LC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), breast cancer (BC), colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic cancer (PC), papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). linc-ROR promotes the proliferation, invasion, migration and chemoresistance of cancer cells. Herein, we reviewed current literature on the modulatory functions and mechanisms of linc-ROR in cancer development. We highlight new linc-ROR-related therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment.
