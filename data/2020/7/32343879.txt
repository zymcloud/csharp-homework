Cervical cancer (CC) is the most common gynecological malignancy, with high incidence and mortality rates in China. The microRNA miR-485-5p has previously been reported to serve as a negative regulator of tumorigenesis in breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, and miR-485-5p has been observed to be differentially expressed between CC and normal control tissue. Here, we confirmed that miR-485-5p expression is lower in CC than in adjacent normal tissue and proceeded to investigate the effects of miR-485 on tumor behavior in CC cell lines. We report that miR-485-5p transcription is decreased in HPV-infected CC tissue, and levels of miR-485 in clinical samples are positively correlated with the 5-year overall survival rate. The Transwell assay showed that miR-485-5p inhibited cell invasion and migration but had no influence on apoptosis and cell proliferation. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrated that miR-485-5p partially abrogated cell migration and proliferation by targeting FLOT-1 mRNA. Transfection of HPV-infected cervical carcinoma cells with an adenovirus vector encoding human FLOT-1 partially diminished the inhibitory effects of miR-485 on cell invasion. Taken, together, these data demonstrated that miR-485-5p suppresses the invasion of cancer cells by targeting FLOT-1 in HPV-infected cervical carcinoma cells.
