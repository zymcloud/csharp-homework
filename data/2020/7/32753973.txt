Background:With an increase in life expectancy and improvement of surgical safety, more elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), even with large tumors, are now considered for hepatectomy. This study aimed to clarify the impact of age on short- and long-term outcomes after major hepatectomy (≥3 segments) for large HCC (≥5 cm).Patients and methods:Using a multicenter database, patients who underwent curative-intent major hepatectomy for large HCC between 2006 and 2016 were identified. Postoperative morbidity and mortality, overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were compared between the elderly (≥65 years) and younger (Results:Of 830 patients, 92 (11.1%) and 738 (88.9%) were elderly and younger patients, respectively. There were no significant differences in postoperative 30-day mortality and morbidity between the two groups (5.4% vs 2.6% and 43.5% vs 38.3%, both P>0.05). The 5-year OS and RFS rates in elderly patients were also comparable to younger patients (35.0% vs 33.2% and 20.0% vs 20.8%, both P>0.05). In the entire cohort, multivariable Cox-regression analyses identified that old age was not independently associated with OS and RFS. However, in the elderly cohort, preoperative alpha-fetoprotein level >400 μg/L, multiple tumors, macrovascular invasion and microvascular invasion were independently associated with decreased OS and RFS.Conclusion:Carefully selected elderly patients benefited from major hepatectomy for large HCC as much as younger patients, and their long-term prognosis was determined by preoperative alpha-fetoprotein level, tumor number and presence of macro- or micro-vascular invasion.
