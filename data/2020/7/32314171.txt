Background and purpose:Imaging-based diagnostic systems play important roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of recently updated imaging criteria for HCCs ≤ 3.0 cm on gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Methods:493 nodules (399 HCCs, 24 other malignancies, 70 benign) 1.0-3.0 cm from 400 patients, including 322 male (mean age 59.3 ± 9.4 years) and 78 female (mean age 61.2 ± 9.0 years), at risk for HCC who underwent gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI between July 2015 and December 2016 were retrospectively evaluated. Final diagnosis was determined histopathologically or clinically. The sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing HCC of the latest versions of four imaging criteria [Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS), European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL), Korean Liver Cancer Association-National Cancer Center (KLCA-NCC)] were compared using generalized estimating equations.Results:In 331 only pathologically diagnosed nodules, the sensitivities of both the APASL (86.8%) and KLCA-NCC criteria (85.4%) were significantly higher than the sensitivities of the EASL (71.8%) and LR-5 (71.1%) criteria (p Conclusion:Of the four international imaging criteria, LI-RADS and EASL showed high specificity but suboptimal sensitivity for diagnosing HCCs ≤ 3 cm. However, APASL and KLCA-NCC had a higher sensitivity but a lower specificity than LI-RADS and EASL.
