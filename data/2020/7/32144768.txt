Background and purpose:The development of endometriotic lesions is crucially dependent on the formation of new blood vessels. In the present study, we analysed whether this process is regulated by erythropoietin-producing hepatoma receptor B4 (EphB4) signalling.Experimental approach:We first assessed the anti-angiogenic action of the EphB4 inhibitor NVP-BHG712 in different in vitro angiogenesis assays. Then, endometriotic lesions were surgically induced in the dorsal skinfold chamber and peritoneal cavity of NVP-BHG712- or vehicle-treated BALB/c mice. This allowed to study the effect of EphB4 inhibition on their vascularisation and growth by means of intravital fluorescence microscopy, high-resolution ultrasound imaging, histology and immunohistochemistry.Key results:Non-cytotoxic doses of NVP-BHG712 suppressed the migration, tube formation and sprouting activity of both human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) and mouse aortic rings. Accordingly, we also detected a lower blood vessel density in NVP-BHG712-treated endometriotic lesions. This was associated with a reduced lesion growth due to a significantly lower number of proliferating stromal cells when compared to vehicle-treated controls.Conclusions and implications:Inhibition of EphB4 signalling suppresses the vascularisation and growth of endometriotic lesions. Hence, EphB4 represents a promising pharmacological target for the treatment of endometriosis.
