Background:Despite the large-scale clinical application of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody, reduction in its clinical response rate has become a gradual problem. As such, use of PD-L1 monoclonal antibody in combination with other anticarcinoma drugs has been the main strategy in improving its efficacy. Interleukin 10 (IL10) is a recognized inflammatory and immunosuppressive factor. Previous studies have suggested that there is a link between PD-L1 and IL10.Objective:This study was aimed at clarifying the relationship between PD-L1 and IL10 in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and whether IL10 enhances the efficacy of PD-L1 inhibitor.Methods:Expression levels of PD-L1 and IL10 in carcinoma and adjacent tissues were tested by immunochemistry, Western blotting, and RT-PCR. Survival duration and follow-up data of each patient were recorded. LIHC cell lines Bel7405 and MHCC 97-H were used for in vitro experiments. Exogenous IL10 and anti-IL10 were added to cell supernatant. Expression level of PD-L1 in the LIHC cell lines was determined using Western blotting and ELISA. CCK8 and transwell assays were adopted to examine the effect of PD-L1 combined with IL10 on proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of LIHC cells.Results:The survival period of patients with low expression of IL10 was longer than that of patients with high expression (P = 0.01). Overexpression of PD-L1 increased the IL10 and Met levels in LIHC tissues and cell lines. IL10 downregulated the expression level of PD-L1 and enhanced the efficacy of crizotinib via the Met signaling pathway in the LIHC cells.Conclusions:A combination of IL10 and PD-L1 inhibitor holds great promise as an effective treatment for LIHC.
