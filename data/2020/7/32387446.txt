Objectives:The outcomes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection vary substantially among affected individuals, providing evidence of the role of host genetic background in the susceptibility to HBV persistence and the dynamics of liver injury progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the interleukin 10 gene (IL10) were genotyped by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in 857 patients with chronic HBV infection (CHB), 48 patients with resolved HBV infection, and 100 healthy volunteers. Associations of the selected polymorphisms with susceptibility to chronic HBV infection, liver injury progression, and outcomes were investigated.Results:IL10 -819T (rs1800871), -592A (rs1800872), and +504T (rs3024490) alleles were associated with treatment-induced hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance. Additionally, IL10 ATAC haplotype increased the chance of HBsAg loss and was significantly more frequent in patients with less liver injury. Moreover rs1800871TT, rs1518110TT, rs1800872AA, and rs3024490TT genotypes were identified as predictors of a lower FIB-4 score (Conclusions:This study indicates that polymorphisms within the promoter region and intronic sequences of IL10 are associated with chronicity of hepatitis B and with HBV-induced liver damage.
