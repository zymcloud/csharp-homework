The promoter methylation mode of microribonucleic acid (miRNA) plays a crucial role in the process of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to screen and verify the miRNA methylation sites associated with the overall survival (OS) and clinical characteristics of HCC patients. Methylation-related data were from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). R software was utilized to screen the methylation sites. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm was utilized to develop the miRNA promoter methylation models. Then, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was performed with 146 HCC tissues to verify the accuracy of the vascular infiltration-related model. Additionally, we verified the functions of vascular infiltration-related miRNA by utilizing cells transfected with miR-199a-3p mimic. The model for predicting OS of HCC patients contained eight methylation sites. The Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested that the model could divide HCC patients into high- and low-risk groups (P
