The present study aimed to screen the immune-related genes (IRGs) in patients with liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and construct a synthetic index for indicating the prognostic outcomes. The bioinformatic analysis was performed on the data of 374 cancer tissues and 50 normal tissues, which were downloaded from TCGA database. We observed that 17 differentially expressed IRGs were significantly associated with survival in LIHC patients. These LIHC-specific IRGs were validated with function analysis and molecular characteristics. Cox analysis was applied for constructing a RiskScore for predicting the survival. The RiskScore involved six IRGs and corresponding coefficients, which was calculated with the following formula: RiskScore = [Expression level of FABP5 *(0.064)] + [Expression level of TRAF3 * (0.198)] + [Expression level of CSPG5 * (0.416)] + [Expression level of IL17D * (0.197)] + [Expression level of STC2 * (0.036)] + [Expression level of BRD8 * (0.140)]. The RiskScore was positively associated with the poor survival, which was verified with the dataset from ICGC database. Further analysis revealed that the RiskScore was independent of any other clinical feature, while it was linked with the infiltration levels of six types of immune cells. Our study reported the survival-associated IRGs in LIHC and then constructed IRGs-based RiskScore as prognostic indicator for screening patients with high risk of short survival. Both the screened IRGs and IRGs-based RiskScore were clinically significant, which may be informative for promoting the individualized immunotherapy against LIHC.
