Background and objective:Evidences point out promising anticancer activities of Dihydropyrimidinones (DHPM) and organoselenium compounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic and antiproliferative potential of DHPM-derived selenoesters (Se-DHPM), as well as their molecular mechanisms of action.Methods:Se-DHPM cytotoxicity was evaluated against cancer lines (HeLa, HepG2, HRT-18 and MCF-7) and normal cells (McCoy). HepG2 clonogenic assay allowed verifying antiproliferative effect. The propidium iodide/orange acridine fluorescence readings showed the type of cell death induced after treatments (72h). Molecular simulations with B-DNA and 49H showed docked positions (AutoDock Vina) and trajectories/energies (GROMACS). In vitro molecular interactions used CTDNA and 49H applying UV-Vis absorbance and fluorescence. Comet assay evaluated DNA fragmentation of HepG2 cells. Flow cytometry analysis verified HepG2 cell cycle effects. Levels of proteins (β-actin, p53, BAX, HIF-1α, γH2AX, PARP1, cyclin A, CDK-2 and pRB) were quantified by immunoblotting.Results:Among Se-DHPM, 49H was selectively cytotoxic to HepG2 cells, reduced cell proliferation and increased BAX (80%) and p53 (66%) causing apoptosis. Molecular assays revealed 49H inserted in CT-DNA molecule causing hypochromic effect. Docking simulations showed H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions, which kept the ligand partially inserted into DNA minor groove. 49H increased the DNA damage (1.5 fold) and γH2AX level (153%). Besides, treatments reduced PARP-1 (60%) and reduced pRB phosphorylation (21%) as well decreased cyclin A (46%) arresting cell cycle at G1 phase.Conclusions:Together all data obtained confirmed the hypothesis of disruptive interactions between Se-DHPM and DNA thereby highlighting its potential as a new anticancer drug.
