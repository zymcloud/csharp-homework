Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver malignancy with one of the highest mortality rates among solid cancers. It develops almost exclusively in the background of chronic liver inflammation, which can be caused by viral hepatitis, chronic alcohol consumption or an unhealthy diet. Chronic inflammation deregulates the innate and adaptive immune responses that contribute to the proliferation, survival and migration of tumor cells. The continuous communication between the tumor and its microenvironment components serves as the overriding force of the tumor against the body's defenses. The importance of this crosstalk between the tumor microenvironment and immune cells in the process of hepatocarcinogenesis has been shown, and therapeutic strategies modulating this communication have improved the outcomes of patients with liver cancer. To target this communication, an RNA interference (RNAi)-based approach can be used, an innovative and promising strategy that can disrupt the crosstalk at the transcriptomic level. Moreover, RNAi offers the advantage of specificity in comparison to the treatments currently used for HCC in clinics. In this review, we will provide the recent data pertaining to the modulation of a tumor and its microenvironment by using RNAi and its potential for therapeutic intervention in HCC.
