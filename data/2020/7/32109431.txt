Autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process, is the most important pathogenic events in the development and progression of liver diseases. Deregulation of Nrf2 is proposed to play a key pathogenic role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Under certain pathophysiological conditions, such as oxidative stress, impaired autophagy is accompanied by the Nrf2 activation that leads to the detrimental effects favoring the proliferation and survival of HCC. Elucidating its role and potential mechanism is essential for understanding tumorigenesis and the development of effective clinical application. Nrf2 is participated in HCC proliferation, migration and invasion through autophagy pathways. These includes the negatively regulated-Nrf2 by Keap1 that participates in HCC tumorigenesis via regulating ROS production, in which autophagy may contribute to oxidant metabolic reprogramming of HCC cells. Post-transcriptional modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination of Nrf2, can be positively or negatively induced by multiple transcription factors. Nrf2 exhibits chemoresistance through its binding sites in the promoter region of the target genes. Nrf2 may be a valuable potential biomarker and therapeutic strategy for diagnostics, prognostics and treatment of HCC.
