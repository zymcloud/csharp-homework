Background:The most common reason for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment failure is recurrence and metastasis. AGGF1 (a promoting gene of tumor metastasis), vasculogenic mimicry (VM, new blood supply formation in malignant tumors), and Twist1 (an evolutionarily conserved basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor) are all valuable factors for metastasis and prognosis in diverse common human cancers. However, the correlation of AGGF1, Twist1, and VM in HCC is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed the correlations among these factors as well as their correlation with clinicopathologic data and survival in HCC.Methods:Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was used to detect the expression of AGGF1 and Twist1 in 111 archival surgical specimens of human HCC. Furthermore, clinical data were collected.Results:Levels of VM, AGGF1 and Twist1 were significantly higher in HCC tissues than in normal hepatic tissues. Levels of VM, AGGF1, and Twist1 were positively associated with AFP, HBsAg, size, capsular invasion, Child-Pugh classification level, and tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, and negatively associated with patients' overall survival (OS). In multivariate analysis, high levels of VM, AGGF1, Twist1, AFP, Child-Pugh classification level, as well as TNM stage were independently correlated with lower OS in patients with HCC.Conclusion:VM and the expression of AGGF1 and Twist1 may represent promising metastatic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as therapeutic targets for HCC.
