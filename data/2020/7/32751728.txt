We aimed to create an animal model for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with a short time, a high survival rate, as well as a high incidence of HCC in both males and females than previously reported. The Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) model has an age-related effect. A single dose of DEN treatment is not enough in young mice up to 50 weeks. The same pattern is shown in an adult with multiple-dose trials whether or not there is some promotion agent. In this study, two-week old C57BL6 mice were given a total of eight doses of DEN, initially 20mg/kg body weight, and then 30mg/kg in the third week, followed by 50mg/kg for the last six weeks. The first group is DEN treatment only and the other two groups received thioacetamide (TAA) treatment for four or eight weeks after one week of rest from the last DEN treatment. An autopsy was performed after 24 weeks of the initial dose of DEN in each group. The cellular arrangement of HCC in the entire group was well-differentiated carcinoma and tumor presence with no significant impact on the survival of mice. Increased levels of the biochemical markers in serum, loss of tissue architecture, hepatocyte death, and proliferation were highly activated in all tumor-induced groups. This finding demonstrates an improved strategy to generate an animal model with a high occurrence of tumors combined with cirrhosis in a short time regardless of sex for researchers who want to investigate liver cancer-related.
