PD-1 checkpoint inhibition has shown promising results in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, inducing objective responses in approximately 20% of the treated patients. The role of other co-inhibitory molecules and their individual contribution to T cell dysfunction in liver cancer, however, remain largely elusive. Here we perform for the first time a comprehensive mRNA profiling of CD8 T cells in a murine model of autochthonous liver cancer by comparing the transcriptome of naive, functional effector and exhausted, tumor-specific CD8 T cells. Subsequently we functionally validate the role of newly identified genes in T cell exhaustion. Our results reveal a unique transcriptome signature of exhausted T cells and demonstrate that upregulation of the inhibitory immune receptor TIGIT represents a hallmark in the process of T cell exhaustion in liver cancer. Compared to PD-1, expression of TIGIT more reliably identified exhausted CD8 T cells at different stages of their differentiation. In combination with PD-1 inhibition, targeting of TIGIT with antagonistic antibodies resulted in synergistic inhibition of liver cancer growth in immunocompetent mice. Finally, we demonstrate expression of TIGIT on tumor infiltrating CD8 T cells in tissue samples of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and identify two subsets of patients based on differential expression of TIGIT on tumor-specific T cells. Our transcriptome analysis provides a valuable resource for the identification of key pathways involved in T cell exhaustion in patients with liver cancer and identifies TIGIT as a potential target in checkpoint combination therapies.
