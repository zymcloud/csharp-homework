The utility of the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) concept has been largely recognized by scientists, however, the AOP generation is still mainly done manually by screening through evidence and extracting probable associations. To accelerate this process and increase the reliability, we have developed an semi-automated workflow for AOP hypothesis generation. In brief, association mining methods were applied to high-throughput screening, gene expression, in vivo and disease data present in ToxCast and Comparative Toxicogenomics Database. This was supplemented by pathway mapping using Reactome to fill in gaps and identify events occurring at the cellular/tissue levels. Furthermore, in vivo data from TG-Gates was integrated to finally derive a gene, pathway, biochemical, histopathological and disease network from which specific disease sub-networks can be queried. To test the workflow, non-genotoxic-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was selected as a case study. The implementation resulted in the identification of several non-genotoxic-specific HCC-connected genes belonging to cell proliferation, endoplasmic reticulum stress and early apoptosis. Biochemical findings revealed non-genotoxic-specific alkaline phosphatase increase. The explored non-genotoxic-specific histopathology was associated with early stages of hepatic steatosis, transforming into cirrhosis. This work illustrates the utility of computationally predicted constructs in supporting development by using pre-existing knowledge in a fast and unbiased manner.
