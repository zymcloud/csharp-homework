miRNAs play an indispensable role in human carcinogenesis. Dysregulated miR-1180-3p has been observed in several types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study intends to correlate the expression level of miR-1180-3p with clinical features and overall survival in HCC patients. The expression and clinical significance of miR-1180-3p, selected from GEO and TCGA databases, were verified using an RT-qPCR method. The target genes of miR-1180-3p were obtained using 3 miRNA target gene prediction databases, and their functions were analyzed using the online tool WebGestalt. miR-1180-3p expression was significantly upregulated in 88 HCC tissues compared with non-tumor liver tissues (0.004 ± 0.009 vs. 0.002 ± 0.002, t = - 2.099, P = 0.038). Additionally, we found that the expression levels of miR-1180-3p were significantly correlated with tumor number (χ2 = 9.157, P = 0.006) and MVI (χ2 = 11.354, P = 0.003). Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with high miR-1180 expression had a shorter overall survival than those with low miR-1180-3p expression (P = 0.002). Furthermore, multivariate Cox analyses indicated that miR-1180-3p expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (HR = 13.36, 95% CI 1.16, 153.69, P = 0.038). In addition, a total of 733 target genes of miR-1180-3p were found from three prediction databases. The GO analyses demonstrated that the target genes were closely related to the proliferation and malignancy of tumors. The KEGG analysis showed that target genes were enriched in several key cancer-related signaling pathways, including the Pathways in cancer, the Ras signaling pathway, and the MAPK signaling pathway. In conclusion, we demonstrate that miR-1180-3p is upregulated in HCC and is associated with a poor prognosis. Thus, miR-1180-3p might be useful as a prognostic marker for HCC.
