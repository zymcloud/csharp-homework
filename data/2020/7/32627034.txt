Sorafenib is the first‑line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Since many HCC patients experience drug resistance, there is an urgent need to discover more effective therapeutic strategies to overcome drug resistance. Long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in tumor drug resistance. However, research on the role of lncRNA H19 in sorafenib resistance in HCC is quite limited. In the present study, CCK‑8 assay, RT‑qPCR, EdU staining, immunofluorescence staining, and western blot analysis were used to detect the effect of lncRNA H19 on sorafenib resistance of HCC cells. H19 expression was found to be negatively related to sorafenib sensitivity in HCC cells. Knockdown of lncRNA H19 elevated sorafenib sensitivity by suppressing epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC cells. H19 upregulated miR‑675 expression. miR‑675 inhibitor decreased the cell viability in sorafenib‑treated HCC cells, while miR‑675 overexpression had the opposite effect on the treated cells. When the cells were pretreated with miR‑675 mimic, H19 siRNA did not alter the effect of miR‑675 on sorafenib sensitivity. In conclusion, our study provides new clues for further clinical treatment of sorafenib‑resistant liver cancer patients.
