Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the major causes of cancer-related death worldwide. High Akt activation and aberrant β-catenin expression contribute to HCC cell proliferation, stem cell generation, and metastasis. Several signaling pathway-specific inhibitors are in clinical trials and display different efficacies against HCC. In this study, we observed that a β-catenin inhibitor (FH535) displays antiproliferative effect on transformed human hepatocytes (THH). A combination treatment of these cells with FH535 and Akt inhibitor (AZD5363) exerted a stronger effect on cell death. Treatment of THH with AZD5363 and FH535 inhibited cell-cycle progression, enhanced autophagy marker protein expression, and autophagy-associated death, while FH535 treatment alone induced apoptosis. The use of chloroquine or z-VAD further verified these observations. Autophagy flux was evident from lowering marker proteins LAMP2, LAPTM4B, and autophagic protein expression by confocal microscopy using mCherry-EGFP-LC3 reporter construct. A combination treatment with AZD5363 and FH535 enhanced p53 expression, by modulating MDM2 activation; however, AZD5363 treatment alone restricted p53 to the nucleus by inhibiting dynamin-related protein activation. Nuclear p53 plays a crucial role for activation of autophagy by regulating the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 pathway. Hep3B cells with null p53 did not modulate autophagy-dependent death from combination treatment. Together, our results strongly suggested that a combination treatment of Akt and β-catenin inhibitors exhibits efficient therapeutic potential for HCC.
