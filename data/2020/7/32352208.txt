Mixed hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-CC) is a biphenotypic liver cancer thought to have unfavorable tumor biology and a poor prognosis. Surgical outcomes of HCC-CC remain unclear. We aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes of HCC-CC. We analyzed a series of patients undergoing resection for HCC-CC (n = 47), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; n = 468), and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC; n = 108) at a single Western center between 2001 and 2015. Patients with HCC-CC were matched to patients with HCC and ICC on important clinical factors including tumor characteristics (size, vascular invasion, and differentiation) and underlying cirrhosis. Patients with HCC-CC had rates of viral hepatitis comparable to patients with HCC (78.7% versus 80.0%), and 42.5% had underlying cirrhosis. When matched on tumor size, HCC-CC was more poorly differentiated than HCC (68.3% versus 27.3%; P
