Minichromosome maintenance complex component 6 (MCM6) is involved in tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Because its effect on different populations remains unclear, this study investigated the impact of MCM6 on HCC in Southern Chinese Zhuang population. In addition to assessing the global mRNA levels of MCM6 based on The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA) and The Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO), associations between MCM6 mRNA levels and clinicopathological features were analyzed. High MCM6 levels were associated with high alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (>20 ng/mL in serum) (P 5 cm) (P = 0.038) and advanced clinical stage (III + IV) (p = 0.023). Bioinformatic enrichment analysis of MCM6 and its interacting proteins (CDT1,WEE1,TRIM28 and MKI67) suggested that in addition to being involved in the cell cycle process, these complexes could also be involved in protein binding, pre-replication complex assemble, and nucleus metabolism. Based on the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network with module screen, the interactions between MCM6 and its potential interacting proteins were further studied through protein docking with hot spot analysis. Additionally, the results of the algorithms combining the ROC of MCM6 and its interacting proteins showed that combination biomarker analysis has better HCC diagnosis ability than the single MCM6 test. The combination of MCM6 and TRIM28 was more suitable for the Guangxi Zhuang population. Overall, our study suggests that MCM6 plays an important role in the growth of HCC. MCM6 could be an optimal biomarker for diagnosing HCC and a potential molecular target for HCC therapy in the Zhuang population.
