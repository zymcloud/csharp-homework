Recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation (LT) is a significant clinical problem associated with poor surgical outcomes. This study aims to summarize the current evidence on risk prediction models of HCC recurrence after LT. PubMed and EMBASE were searched to May 25, 2019, for relevant articles. Studies originally designed to develop or validate a risk prediction model for HCC recurrence after LT were included. Two independent authors summarized the study characteristics and evaluated the risk of bias and applicability concerns in the included studies. From 26 included studies, 18 original risk prediction models were determined, but only five models were externally validated. The average number of predictors involved in the construction of risk models was three. The most frequently employed predictors were alpha-fetoprotein, tumor size, vascular invasion, tumor number, tumor differentiation, and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio. Most studies showed good discriminatory performance (AUC >0.75). The overall quality of the included studies was generally low. Most of the original models lacked the highly recommended external and prospective validation in diverse populations. The AFP model was the well-validated preoperative risk model that can stratify patients into high- and low-risk groups.
