Background and aim:Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a very common liver disease which has been associated with a number of the extrahepatic manifestations (EHMs) and healthcare expenditures. Our aim was to assess the presence and impact of these EHMs of NAFLD on mortality and healthcare expenditures.Methods:Medicare beneficiaries (2005-2016) were included. ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes were used to identify patients with NAFLD and EHMs which included cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension (HTN), diabetes (DM), hyperlipidemia (HL), non-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cancers, and others. Temporal trends among different groups were analyzed by join point regression model. Independent predictors of outcomes were evaluated in multiple generalized linear or logistic regression models.Results:Among 30,908,679 Medicare beneficiaries (5% sample of Medicare data from 2005-2016), 1,980,950 (6.4%) had NAFLD diagnosis. From 2005 to 2016, the prevalence of NAFLD in the Medicare population increased at an average annual increase of 3.1%. The most common diseases associated with NAFLD were DM (86.3%), followed by HTN (85.2%), HL (79.8%), and CVD (35.8%). One-year mortality rate in NAFLD patients increased from 3.55 to 6.33 per 1000 from 2005 to 2016. One-year mortality was independently associated with diagnosis of HCC, cirrhosis, DM (outpatient), depression, dementia, lung disease, renal failure, thyroid disorder (inpatient), neurological disorder as well as non-HCC cancers.Conclusion:NAFLD is associated with a number of EHMs that increases its mortality and increased healthcare expenditure.
