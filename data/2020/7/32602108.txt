A 69-year-old man was referred to the hematology department for the evaluation of pancytopenia. He had been treated with radiation and epirubicin for hepatocellular carcinoma, and with docetaxel and pembrolizumab for lung adenocarcinoma. Bone marrow smears exhibited markedly increased promyelocytes, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) study demonstrated chimeric fusion genes of PML-RARA. He was diagnosed with therapy-related acute promyelocytic leukemia (t-APL) and treated with all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). After 30 days of ATRA treatment, complete hematological response was achieved. To the best of our knowledge, this case represents the first description of successfully treated t-APL diagnosed after treatment with pembrolizumab.
