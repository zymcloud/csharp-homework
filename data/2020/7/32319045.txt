Background:PURPOSE: The study compared the incidence and predictors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within and beyond year 5 of entecavir (ETV) therapy.Methods:The study enrolled 1397 CHB patients who were naïve to nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) treatment and had received ETV monotherapy for more than 12 months.Results:The cumulative incidences of HCC at 3, 5, and 10 years of ETV treatment were 4%, 9.1%, and 15.8%, respectively. In the entire cohort, the annual incidence rates of HCC were 2.28% within the first 5 years and 1.34% within 5-10 years of therapy. The incidences of HCC did not differ significantly within and beyond 5 years of ETV therapy (p = 0.53), including patients with cirrhosis (p = 0.85) and without cirrhosis (p = 0.47). At year 5 of treatment, the multivariate analysis showed that the fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were independent risk factors for HCC development beyond year 5. The 10-year cumulative incidences of HCC beyond year 5 in the high-risk group (FIB-4 > 2.20 and AFP > 3.21 ng/mL) and low-risk group (FIB-4 ≤ 2.20 and AFP ≤ 3.21 ng/mL) were 48.7% and 0%, respectively. APA-B score at 12 months and year 5 had a higher C-index for the prediction of HCC beyond year 5 than the PAGE-B at baseline and year 5 (p = 0.003 and p = 0.039, respectively) CONCLUSIONS: The HCC incidence tended to decrease but did not change significantly within and beyond 5 years of ETV therapy. The FIB-4 index and AFP levels at year 5 were predictive of HCC development beyond year 5 of ETV therapy.
