Background/aim:Few studies have studied micro hepatic vein invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We explored the correlation between hepatic vein invasion and hepatitis B/C virus infection.Patients and methods:Between April 2000 and February 2018, 869 patients underwent liver resection for HCC at a single center. The patients were divided into two groups: those with micro hepatic vein invasion (VV+) and those without (VV-). The clinical data, overall survival (OS) and correlations with the presence of hepatitis B and C viruses were investigated.Results:There were 817 VV- patients and 43 VV+ patients. OS was 66.2 months for VV- patients and 9.9 months for VV+ patients (p=0.0010). VV+ patients had significantly higher levels of serum HBV DNA (p=0.016).Conclusion:HCC patients with micro hepatic vein invasion showed significantly shorter OS. A higher level of HBV DNA appears to be a risk factor for micro hepatic vein invasion.
