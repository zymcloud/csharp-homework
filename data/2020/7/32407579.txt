Objective:In this prospective cohort study, we aimed to evaluate the association between dietary habits and the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive carriers in Qidong, an hepatitis B virus (HBV)-epidemic area in China.Methods:A total of 3199 HBsAg carriers aged 30-70 years in a prospective cohort in Qidong, China from 2007 to 2011 were included in the study. At baseline, all participants self-reported their dietary habits in a questionnaire interview. A follow-up check-up was performed every 6 months to identify HCC cases until November 2017. Cox's regression analysis and an interaction analysis were performed to estimate the relative risks of HCC in terms of baseline diet.Results:Among 3199 HBsAg-positive participants, 270 developed HCC (143.86/100 000 person-years [PYs]). Compared with participants who rarely consume garlic, the risk of HCC in those who consumed it ≥ once per week decreased along with the increase in frequency (HR = 1.00, 0.90 and 0.62 in those who consumed it rarely vs those who consumed it 1-6 times per week and ≥ 7 times per week, respectively). This study found a synergistic effect between garlic and tea consumption on the risk of HCC (P = 0.039 for a multiplicative interaction).Conclusions:HBsAg carriers should improve their diet. Regular consumption of garlic and tea drinking may reduce the HCC incidence in HBsAg carriers.
