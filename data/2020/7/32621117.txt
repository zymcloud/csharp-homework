The erythropoietin-producing human hepatocellular (Eph) receptors are transmembrane glycoprotein members of the tyrosine kinase receptors family. The Ephs may bind to various ephrin ligands resulting in the phosphorylation of their tyrosine kinase domain and the activation of the Eph receptor. In this review we focus on EphA3, one receptor of the 14 different Ephs, as it carries out both redundant and restricted functions in the germline development of mammals and in the maintenance of various adult tissues. The loss of EphA3 regulation is correlated with various human malignancies, the most notable being cancer. This receptor is overexpressed and/or mutated in multiple tumors, and is also associated with poor prognosis and decreased survival in patients. Here we highlight the role of EphA3 in normal and malignant tissues that are specific to cancer; these include hematologic disorders, gastric cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer. Moreover, various anticancer agents against EphA3 have been developed to either inhibit its kinase domain activity or to function as agonists. Thus, we examine the most potent small molecule drugs and mAb-based therapeutics against EphA3 that are currently in pre-clinical or clinical stages.
