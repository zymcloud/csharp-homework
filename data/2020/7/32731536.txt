Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and its related liver diseases are important health problems worldwide, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. For the past 4-5 decades, Taiwan's government and scientists have cooperated together to control this virus infection and its related liver diseases. These efforts and achievements have made progress toward the elimination of HBV. Taiwan's government initiated the Viral Hepatitis Control Program (VHCP) in the1970s, and then launched the national vaccination program in 1984. This universal vaccination program effectively decreased the rate of hepatitis B carriage and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the younger generation. Since 2003, approved anti-HBV treatments were reimbursed nationwide. This reimbursement program resulted in a higher uptake of anti-HBV treatments, which contributed to a decrease in liver-related disease progression and subsequently reduced attributable mortality in Taiwan. This experience can be shared by countries in other parts of the world regarding the control of chronic viral hepatitis B.
