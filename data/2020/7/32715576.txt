We describe a patient with liver metastases from colorectal cancer treated with chemotherapy and hepatic resection, who developed unresectable multifocal liver recurrence and who received liver transplantation using a novel planned technique: heterotopic transplantation of segment 2-3 in the splenic fossa with splenectomy and delayed hepatectomy after regeneration of the transplanted graft. We transplanted a segmental liver graft after in-situ splitting without any impact on the waiting list, as it was previously rejected for pediatric and adult transplantation. The volume of the graft was insufficient to provide liver function to the recipient, so we performed this novel operation. The graft was anastomosed to the splenic vessels after splenectomy, and the native liver portal flow was modulated to enhance graft regeneration, leaving the native recipient liver intact. The volume of the graft doubled during the next 2 weeks and the native liver was removed. After 8 months, the patient lives with a functioning liver in the splenic fossa and without abdominal tumor recurrence. This is the first case reported of a segmental graft transplanted replacing the spleen and modulating the portal flow to favor graft growth, with delayed native hepatectomy.
