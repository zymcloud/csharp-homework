Background:Biological procedures for the synthesis of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) are eco-friendly, cost-effective, and easily scalable as compared to chemical and physical methods.Methods:In the present study, a simple fungus based synthesis method was used for copper nanoparticles. After morphological and molecular characterization of fungal strains, Aspergillus niger strain STA9 was used for CuNPs synthesis. Particles synthesized by fungi were characterized by UV-visible spectrophotometer, FTIR, and Zetasizer. The MTT anti-cancer, anti-diabetic and antibacterial assays of CuNPs were performed.Results:The CuNPs were produced at optimized conditions with a size of 500 nm, Z-average 398.2 nm, and 0.246 poly dispersion index. These particles were quantified at 480 nm and FTIR confirmed the existence of OH and -C=C- functional groups. MTT assay revealed that CuNPs have a significant cytotoxic effect against human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (Huh-7) with 3.09 Î¼g/ml IC50 value. Alpha-glucosidase inhibition showed that CuNPs have a moderate antidiabetic effect. The agar well antibacterial effect indicated 19, 21, 16, 20, and 17 mm zone of inhibition against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis respectively.Conclusion:Such biomedical applications of CuNPs reveal the importance of a targeted drug delivery system.
