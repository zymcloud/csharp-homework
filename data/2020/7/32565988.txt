Proline-rich protein 11 (PRR11) together with its upstream adjacent gene, spindle and kinetochore associated 2 (SKA2), represent a classic, head-to-head gene pair. The role of the PRR11 and SKA2 gene pair has been described in various types of cancer, including breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and ovarian carcinoma. However, its role in esophageal carcinoma (ESCC) remains unclear. The mRNA expression levels of PRR11 and SKA2 were examined in ESCC surgical specimens. In addition, the role of PRR11 and SKA2 in the proliferation and migratory and invasive capacities of EC9706 and EC109 cell lines was examined. The results from the present study demonstrated that PRR11 and SKA2 expression levels were upregulated in ESCC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, PRRl1 and SKA2 knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation and migratory and invasive capacities of ESCC cells. Conversely, PRRl1 and SKA2 overexpression significantly promoted the proliferation and migratory and invasive capacities of ESCC cell lines via activation of the AKT signaling pathway and certain markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, including Snail and N-cadherin. The results from the present study suggested that the PRR11 and SKA2 gene pair may represent a potential target in the diagnosis and treatment of ESCC.
