The present study describes the serum biochemical alterations and histopathological abnormalities in the liver tissue of dogs with liver disease. A survey of hepatic lesions was conducted using ultrasound-guided percutaneous needle biopsies. The hematologic and biochemical changes in dogs with liver lesions were recorded. Chronic hepatitis was the most common liver histopathologic finding (37.9%). Other common findings included liver fibrosis (19.5%), vacuolar hepatopathy (10.3%), cholangiohepatitis (9.2%), hepatocellular carcinoma (4.6%), cholangitis (3.4%), cholangiocarcinoma (2.3%), and congestive hepatopathy (2.3%). Greater than 2-fold elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was a useful indicator, with a sensitivity of 40% to 65% for diagnosing all liver pathologies. Greater than 2-fold elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) without significant elevation of ALT was useful for diagnosing liver diseases affected by inflammatory or regressive changes (sensitivity of 40% to 50%). Elevation of ALT, ALP, or a combination of ALT and ALP had a high sensitivity of up to 90% for identifying dogs with liver pathology. Hepatic injury and cholestasis enzymes should be interpreted together with patient history, clinical signs, and liver ultrasonographic appearance before performing a liver biopsy.
