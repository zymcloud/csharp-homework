Purpose:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors. Inflammatory and hematological parameters such as neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) provided useful information especially in the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of malignancies. In this study, we planned to demonstrate the efficacy of NLR and PLR levels in the evaluation of the prognosis of patients with HCC in our clinic.Material and methods:This study was planned as a prospective observational cohort study. The study included 105 patients with HCC on the base of cirrhosis. Our study group was classified according to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC), Okuda staging system, and Milan criteria at the time of admission.Results:The mean age of all cases was 60.6 ± 12.4 years, and 77 (73.3%) of the patients were male. The mean life expectancy of all patients was 7.7 ± 4.3 months. During 1-year follow-up, 61 (58.1%) HCC patients died. The mean survival of the patients who died was 4.6 ± 3.0 months. In our study, patients with NLR > 2.7, patients with PLR > 100.29, BCLC advanced stage, and Okuda advanced stage, and patients who did not meet the Milan criteria had shorter survival duration. NLR > 2.7, BCLC advanced stage, and Child C were determined as independent risk factors affecting mortality.Conclusion:There was a strong correlation between NLR-PLR levels and mortality. PLR and NLR levels can be used in conjunction with other staging systems to regulate, monitor, and predict the survival of HCC patients.
