Background:It has been shown that local ablative procedures enable downsizing, reduce drop-out from the waiting list and improve prognosis after liver transplantation. It is still unclear whether a response to the local ablative therapy is due to a favorable tumor biology or if a real benefit in tumor stabilization exists, particularly in complete pathological response.Method:Data of 163 HCC patients who underwent liver transplantation were extracted from our prospectively maintained registry. We analyzed the tumor load, pre-transplant α-fetoprotein levels, child stage aside the application and success of local ablative therapies as bridging procedures before transplantation.Results:87 patients received multiple and/or combined local therapies. In 20 cases, this resulted in a complete remission of the tumor as observed in the explant histology. The other 76 patients underwent no bridging procedure. The observed 5- and 10-year survival rates for patients with bridging were 67% and 47% and without bridging 56% and 46%, respectively. Tumor-related 10-year survival showed a statistically significant difference between both groups (81% versus 59%). In the multivariate analyses bridging, number of lesions and α-fetoprotein level showed an independent statistically significant influence on tumor-related survival in these patients.Conclusions:Successful local ablative therapy before liver transplantation is an independent statistically significant factor in long-term tumor-related survival for patients with HCC in cirrhosis and reduces tumor recurrences.
