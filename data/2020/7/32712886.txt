Background:Optimal choice of surgical procedure for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains inconclusive. This study seeks to investigate the oncological superiority of anatomic resection (AR) of the tumor-bearing portal territory and potential mechanism of survival benefit for patients undergoing AR.Patients and methods:In 203 patients who underwent curative resection for primary solitary HCC measuring â‰¤ 5 cm in diameter, which was resectable either by AR or limited resection (non-AR), long-term outcomes were compared with propensity score adjustment. Advantages of AR in local tumor control and postprogression survival were then evaluated by a multivariate analysis and a Markov model.Results:The AR group showed better recurrence-free survival [hazard ratio (HR), 0.51; 95% CI, 0.28-0.91; P = 0.023), time-to-interventional failure (TIF) (HR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01-0.60; P = 0.014), and overall survival (HR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.01-0.79, P = 0.029) than the non-AR group. Competing-risks regression revealed that AR significantly decreases local recurrence (HR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.02-0.97; P = 0.047) and is correlated with smaller number and size of recurrent lesions, both of which were predictors for better TIF and postprogression survival. A Markov model demonstrated that annual transition rate from the early recurrence stage (i.e., curative-intent treatment indicated) to the intermediate stage (i.e., only palliative-intent treatment indicated) was significantly lower (9.0% versus 35.6%, P = 0.027) when AR was completed at the initial hepatectomy.Conclusions:AR is oncologically advantageous for patients with primary solitary HCC. Initial choice of surgical procedure may have significant influence on the pattern of recurrence and postprogression clinical course that may affect overall survival of patients with HCC.
