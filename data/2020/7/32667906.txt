BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) plus transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with tumor size ranging from 3.0 to 10.0 cm. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed data on 201 patients with medium-to-large HCC. According to treatment procedure, the patients were divided into the TACE group (n=124) and the TACE+RFA group (n=77). We recorded data on patient safety, subcapsular hepatic hematoma, large amount of ascites, liver abscess, gallbladder injury, and local skin infection. The overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in the 2 groups were analyzed and compared between groups. RESULTS The median PFS was 4.00 months (3.00-5.00 months) in the TACE group and 9.13 months (6.64-11.62 months) in the TACE+RFA group (P1) (HR: 1.867, 95% CI: 1.156-3.013, P=0.011), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level >200 ng/ml (HR: 2.426, 95% CI: 1.533-3.839, P40 U/L (HR: 1.946, 95% CI: 1.196-3.166, P=0.007) were independent prognostic factors for overall survival. CONCLUSIONS Combination therapy of TACE with RFA is a safe and effective treatment for patients with medium-to-large HCC, with the long-term beneficial effect of retarding tumor progression and improving PFS and OS.
