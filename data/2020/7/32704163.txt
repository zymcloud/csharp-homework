MYO18B has been proposed to contribute to the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the signals that govern MYO18B transcription are not known. Here we show that, a network of C19MC miRNA-520G, IFN-γ, CEBPB and p53 transcriptional-defects promote MYO18B mRNA expression in HCCs. IFN-γ by itself suppresses MYO18B transcription, but promotes it when miRNA-520G is stably overexpressed. Similarly, CEBPB-liver-enriched activator protein (LAP) isoform overexpression suppresses MYO18B transcription but promotes transcription when the cells are treated with IFN-γ. Furthermore, miR-520G together with mutant-p53 promotes MYO18B transcription. Conversely, bFGF suppresses MYO18B mRNA irrespective of CEBPB, miR-520G overexpression or IFN-γ treatment. Finally high MYO18B expression reflects poor prognosis while high MYL5 or MYO1B expression reflects better survival of HCC patients. Thus, we identified a network of positive and negative regulators of MYO18B mRNA expression which reflects the survival of HCC patients.
