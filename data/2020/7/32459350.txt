Functional crosstalk between histone modifications and chromatin remodeling has emerged as a key regulatory mode of transcriptional control during cell fate decisions, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we discover an HRP2-DPF3a-BAF epigenetic pathway that coordinates methylated histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me) and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling to regulate chromatin dynamics and gene transcription during myogenic differentiation. Using siRNA screening targeting epigenetic modifiers, we identify hepatoma-derived growth factor-related protein 2 (HRP2) as a key regulator of myogenesis. Knockout of HRP2 in mice leads to impaired muscle regeneration. Mechanistically, through its HIV integrase binding domain (IBD), HRP2 associates with the BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin remodeling complex by interacting directly with the BAF45c (DPF3a) subunit. Through its Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro (PWWP) domain, HRP2 preferentially binds to H3K36me2. Consistent with the biochemical studies, ChIP-seq analyses show that HRP2 colocalizes with DPF3a across the genome and that the recruitment of HRP2/DPF3a to chromatin is dependent on H3K36me2. Integrative transcriptomic and cistromic analyses, coupled with ATAC-seq, reveal that HRP2 and DPF3a activate myogenic genes by increasing chromatin accessibility through recruitment of BRG1, the ATPase subunit of the BAF complex. Taken together, these results illuminate a key role for the HRP2-DPF3a-BAF complex in the epigenetic coordination of gene transcription during myogenic differentiation.
