Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver cancer and featured with prominent disparity in incidence and mortality rate between male and female. It remains unclear whether alterations of phospholipids (PL) in hepatic tissues contribute to the pathogenesis, progression, and disparity of HCC.Methods:Using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), PL profiles including 320 individual phospholipid species in 13 PL classes were determined in paired samples from HCC and adjacent benign hepatic tissues (BHT).Results:(1) Concentrations of PLs in most of individual species, in subgroups and in total were decreased in HCC than in BHT in all studied population; (2) the number of individual PL species significantly different between HCC and BHT, and the number of PLs in six subgroups and in total decreased in HCC were more in male population than in female population; (3) panels of PL parameters (more in male population than in female population) were identified as biomarkers in differentiation of HCC from BHT, and in the prediction of pathological grade and clinical stage of HCC with high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.Conclusion:It is concluded that alterations of PLs in hepatic tissues play important roles in pathogenesis, progression, and gender disparity of HCC.
