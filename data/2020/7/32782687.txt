Objective:To explore the pathological features of combined primary hepatic adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The clinicopathological data of one case of cASC-HCC was collected, and the features were analyzed through a literature review.Results:The male patient was 59 years old and had suffered from inconsistent, upper abdominal pain without any obvious cause for one year. MRI and B-Mode ultrasound images of the upper abdomen showed abnormal signals in the posterior segment of the right lobe of the liver, measuring 12.2 Ã— 7.7 cm. A right hepatectomy was performed. A gross examination revealed an irregular, gray-white infiltrating growing mass, with a partially grayish-yellow area. The histological morphology and immunohistochemical results showed that the tumor was composed of ASC in the gray-white area, accounting for about 80%, and HCC in the grayish yellow area, accounting for about 20%.Conclusion:cASC-HCC is a rare, malignant tumor with high rates of recurrence and metastasis. It mainly occurs in the right lobe of the liver, especially in older men with a history of hepatitis or intrahepatic cholangiolithiasis. Surgery is the main treatment method.
Primary hepatic adenosquamous carcinoma; cholangiocarcinoma; hepato-cholangiocarcinoma; hepatocellular carcinoma; hepatolithiasis.
