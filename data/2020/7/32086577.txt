Objective:To assess the value of qualitative and quantitative MRI radiomics features for noninvasive prediction of immuno-oncologic characteristics and outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:This retrospective, IRB-approved study included 48 patients with HCC (M/F 35/13, mean age 60y) who underwent hepatic resection or transplant within 4 months of abdominal MRI. Qualitative imaging traits, quantitative nontexture related and texture features were assessed in index lesions on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted images. The association of imaging features with immunoprofiling and genomics features was assessed using binary logistic regression and correlation analyses. Binary logistic regression analysis was also employed to analyse the association of radiomics, histopathologic and genomics features with radiological early recurrence of HCC at 12 months.Results:Qualitative (r = - 0.41-0.40, p Conclusions:MRI radiomics features may serve as noninvasive predictors of HCC immuno-oncological characteristics and tumour recurrence and may aid in treatment stratification of HCC patients. These results need prospective validation.Key points:• MRI radiomics features showed significant associations with immunophenotyping and genomics characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma. • Radiomics features, including tumour size, showed significant associations with early hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after resection.
