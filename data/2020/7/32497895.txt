Purpose:To investigate the efficacy and safety of hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of oxaliplatin plus raltitrexed in patients with intermediate stage and advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:In this phase II, single-arm clinical trial, we enrolled patients aged 18-70 years with intermediate stage and advanced stage HCC, which included patients with HCC at Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B who experienced transcatheter arterial chemoembolization failure/refractoriness, and those with BCLC stage C with portal vein invasion. We performed HAI with oxaliplatin and raltitrexed. Treatment was repeated every 3 weeks and was discontinued either because of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity levels, or refusal of further treatment. We used Simon's two-stage design. The primary end-point was the objective response rate in accordance with the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours.Results:Fifty-one patients were screened between January 5, 2018 and August 7, 2019. Of these, 39 patients (34 men and 5 women; median age, 53 years) were enrolled and included in the intention-to-treat population. Objective response was achieved in 18 (51.4%) of 35 patients in the per-protocol population and in 18 (46.2%) of 39 patients in the intention-to-treat population. Treatment-related grade IV adverse events or deaths were not reported, and the observed grade III adverse events were elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels (5 [12.8%]), elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (1 [2.6%]), leukopenia (1 [2.6%]), thrombocytopaenia (1 [2.6%]) and abdominal infection (1 [2.6%]).Conclusion:HAI of oxaliplatin plus raltitrexed showed promising efficacy and acceptable toxicity levels in patients with intermediate and advanced stage HCC, and further evaluation is warranted.
