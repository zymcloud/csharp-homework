Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver tumor, and its incidence has been on the rise worldwide. It is a common cause of cancer-related death. HCC carries a poor prognosis and is challenging to manage, especially when diagnosed in advanced stages. We present a rare case of HCC in liver cirrhosis secondary to viral hepatitis C (HCV) infection, presenting with large tumor thrombus extending to the right atrium treated with lenvatinib.
