Purpose:To compare the efficacy and safety of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) to transarterial chemoembolization/embolization (TACE/TAE) for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with major portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT).Materials and methods:Forty-six patients with advanced HCC with major PVTT who underwent HAIC or TACE/TAE between April 2013 and April 2017 were included. In the HAIC group (n = 22), oxaliplatin (35-40 mg/m2 for 2 h) and 5-fluorouracil (600-800 mg/m2 for 22 h) on days 1-3 every 4 weeks were administered for a maximum of six serial courses. In the TACE/TAE group (n = 24), an emulsion of epirubicin (40-60 mg) and lipiodol was administered followed by particles (cTACE), or particles alone embolization (TAE). Overall survival (OS), tumor response according to mRECIST, progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse events were investigated.Results:Median OS was 20.8 months in the HAIC group versus 4.0 months in the TACE/TAE group (P Conclusion:HAIC may significantly improve OS and provide better tumor control with mild side effects and preserved liver function in patients with advanced HCC with major PVTT compared to TACE/TAE treatment.
