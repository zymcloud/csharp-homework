Background:Woodchucks (Marmota monax) are a well-accepted animal model for the investigation of spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). As HCC tumors obtain nutrient blood supply exclusively from the hepatic artery, hepatic artery infusion (HAI) has been applied to HCC. However, there is a scarcity of experimental animal models to standardize drug regimens and examine novel agents. The purpose of this study was to establish an HAI model in woodchucks.Materials and methods:HAI ports were placed in the gastroduodenal artery (GDA) of 11 woodchucks. The ports were infused with either a vehicle (dextrose 5% in water) or an experimental drug, CBL0137, once a week for 3 wk. Technical success rates, anatomical variation, morbidity and mortality, and tumor responses between groups were analyzed.Results:The GDA access was feasible and reproducible in all woodchucks (11/11). The average operation time was 95 Â± 20 min with no increase in the levels of liver enzymes detected from either infusate. The most common morbidity of CBL0137 therapy was anorexia after surgery. One woodchuck died due to hemorrhage at the gallbladder removal site from hepatic coagulopathy. Significantly higher CBL0137 concentrations were measured in the liver compared with blood after each HAI. Tumor growth was suppressed after multiple CBL0137 HAI treatments which corresponded to greater T cell infiltration and increased tumor cell apoptosis.Conclusions:HAI via GDA was a feasible and reproducible approach with low morbidity and mortality in woodchucks. The described techniques serve as a reliable platform for the identification and characterization of therapeutics for HCC.
