Background:Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a widely used biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) early detection. However, low sensitivity and false negativity of AFP raise the requirement of more effective early diagnostic approaches for HCC.Methods:We employed a three-phase strategy to identify serum autoantibody (AAb) signature for HCC early diagnosis using protein array-based approach. A total of 1253 serum samples from HCC, liver cirrhosis, and healthy controls were prospectively collected from three liver cancer centers in China. The Human Proteome Microarray, comprising 21,154 unique proteins, was first applied to identify AAb candidates in discovery phase (n = 100) and to further fabricate HCC-focused arrays. Then, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was used to discover AAbs for HCC detection in a test phase (n = 576) and a validation phase (n = 577), respectively.Results:Using HCC-focused array, we identified and validated a novel 7-AAb panel containing CIAPIN1, EGFR, MAS1, SLC44A3, ASAH1, UBL7, and ZNF428 for effective HCC detection. The ANN model of this panel showed improvement of sensitivity (61.6-77.7%) compared to AFP (cutoff 400 ng/mL, 28.4-30.7%). Notably, it was able to detect AFP-negative HCC with AUC values of 0.841-0.948. For early-stage HCC (BCLC 0/A) detection, it outperformed AFP (cutoff 400 ng/mL) with approximately 10% increase in AUC.Conclusions:The 7-AAb panel provides potentially clinical value for non-invasive early detection of HCC, and brings new clues on understanding the immune response against hepatocarcinogenesis.
