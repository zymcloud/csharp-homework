Hepatocyte cell death is a key process in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, the factors responsible for and mechanisms underlying NASH-related cell death have not yet been elucidated in detail. We herein investigated the effects of intracellular glyceraldehyde (GA)-derived advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), named toxic AGEs (TAGE), on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of NASH. Cell death related to intracellular TAGE accumulation was eliminated in the hepatocyte carcinoma cell line HepG2 by the antioxidant effects of N-acetyl-L-cysteine. The intracellular accumulation of TAGE increased ROS production and the expression of Nrf2, including its downstream gene. These results suggest that ROS are produced in association with the accumulation of TAGE and are a direct trigger for cell death. We also investigated the factors responsible for these increases in ROS. Catalase activity did not decrease with the accumulation of TAGE, while mitochondrial membrane depolarization was enhanced in cells treated with GA. These results indicate that TAGE play an important role in mitochondrial abnormalities and increases in ROS production, both of which are characteristic features of NASH. The suppression of TAGE accumulation has potential as a new therapeutic target in the progression of NASH.
