Purpose:The extensive drug resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become a major cause of chemotherapy failure. A deeper understanding of the drug resistance mechanism of tumor cells is very significant for improving the clinical prognosis of patients with HCC.Experimental design:In this study, proteomic studies on the composition of 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) resistant Bel/5Fu cell line and its parent Bel7402 cell line by using an ionic liquid assisted proteins extraction method with the advantage of extracting plasma membrane proteins to a wider extent are performed. Then the expression level and function of differentially expressed plasma membrane proteins are verified.Results:In total, 25 plasma membrane proteins are shown differentially expressed in Bel/5Fu compared with Bel7402. Western blot analysis results further confirmed that the EPHX1 PLIN2 RAB27B SLC4A2 are upregulated in Bel/5Fu cells in accordance with the proteomics data. Moreover, cell viability assay and clonogenic survival assay results demonstrated that EPHX1 is closely related to the chemoresistance of Bel/5Fu to 5-Fu.Conclusions and clinical relevance:Plasma membrane protein EPHX1 is closely related to the chemotherapy resistance of Bel/5Fu cells and can be used as a new drug target to improve the clinical prognosis of patients with HCC.
