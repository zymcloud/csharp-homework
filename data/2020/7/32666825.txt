In this study chemical profiling of Jasminum azoricum L. (J. azoricum) using HPLC-PDA/MS/MS and evaluation of its in-vitro cytotoxicity towards the human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), human colorectal cancer cell (HCT-116) and human hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh-7) cell lines. The viability % was determined by the neutral red uptake assay. The study led to the identification of 37 secondary metabolite; major nine compounds were subjected to virtual docking to determine their role in tumour growth inhibition by controlling apoptosis and cancer cell proliferation using the 3D crystal structure of MST3 ligand protein. Two compounds; sambacoside A and molihauside C, showed high-affinity values of (-9.91, -9.57) kcal/mol against MST3 protein. In silico prediction of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) was performed and revealed no mutagenicity, no tumorigenicity and non-irritant actions of both compounds, so J. azoricum could be used as a beneficial source for cytotoxic compounds.
