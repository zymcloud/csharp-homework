Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and pancreatic cancer (PC) belong to the most lethal malignancies worldwide. Despite advances in surgical techniques and perioperative multidisciplinary management, the prognosis of both carcinoma entities remains poor mainly because of rapid tumor progression and early dissemination with diagnosis in advanced tumor stages with poor sensitivity to current therapy regimens. Both highly heterogeneous visceral carcinomas exhibit unique somatic alterations, but share common driver genes and mutations as well. Recently, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) could be identified as a liquid biopsy tool with huge potential as non-invasive biomarker in early diagnosis and prognosis. CtDNA released from necrotic or apoptotic cells of primary tumors, metastasis, and circulating tumor cells can reveal genetic and epigenetic alterations with tumor-specific and individual mutation and methylation profiles. In this article, we focus on clinical impact of ctDNA as potential biomarker in patients with HCC and PC.
