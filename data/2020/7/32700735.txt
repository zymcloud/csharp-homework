Objective:Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are widely involved in the carcinogenesis and development of cancers. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic performance of lncRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:After the inclusion and exclusion process, relevant information was extracted. Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated, and data synthesis was conducted by employing a bivariate random-effects model.Results:In total, 20 eligible studies were enrolled. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-0.90) and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.82-0.92), respectively. The pooled positive likelihood ratio, pooled negative likelihood ratio, and pooled diagnostic odds ratio were 7.1 (95% CI, 4.9-10.2), 0.16 (95% CI, 0.11-0.23), and 44 (95% CI, 25-79), respectively. The results of the linear regression method and visual inspection of the Deeks funnel plot did not indicate significant publication bias.Conclusion:Our meta-analysis suggested that lncRNAs have high diagnostic performance for HCC and have the potential for clinical application.
