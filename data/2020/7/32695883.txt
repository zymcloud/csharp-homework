Plasma levels of soluble factors early during hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) were evaluated in relation to radiation liver injury, tumor response, and risk of early death. No significant differences were found in baseline plasma levels of AFP, CXCL1, and HGF amongst HCC patients with different Child Pugh scores. Higher levels of sTNFRII (P < 0.001), and lower levels of sCD40L (P < 0.001) and CXCL1 (P = 0.01) following one to two fractions of SBRT were noted in patients who developed liver toxicity vs. those who did not. High circulating levels of AFP (HR 2.16, P = 0.04), sTNFRII (HR 2.27, P = 0.01), and sIL-6R (HR 1.99, P = 0.03) early during SBRT were associated with increased risk of death 3 months post treatment. Plasma levels of the studied factors early during SBRT were not associated with tumor response. A pro-inflammatory systemic environment is associated with development of liver toxicity and increased risk of early death following SBRT.
