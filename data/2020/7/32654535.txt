Objective:Here, we aimed to compare early hepatectomy (EH) with delayed hepatectomy (DH) as a treatment for spontaneously ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Several databases were systematically searched for eligible studies that compared DH with EH for spontaneously ruptured HCC treatment. Studies that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed systematically, and the reported data were aggregated statistically, using the RevMan v5.3 software.Results:Seven studies were included, with a total of 385 patients, comprising of 224 EH cases and 161 DH cases. Compared with the EH group, incidence of intraoperative bleeding [mean difference (MD), 353.93; 95% CI, 230.04-447.83; P < 0.00001], volume of intraoperative blood transfusion (MD, 420.61; 95% CI, 354.40-486.81, P < 0.00001), and 30-day mortality rate (OR, 14.94; 95% CI, 1.76-126.66; P = 0.01) were significantly lower in the DH group. Furthermore, the 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were significantly higher in the DH group [1-year：hazard ratio (HR), 1.76; 95% CI, 1.06-2.94; P = 0.03; 2-year：HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.02-2.25; P = 0.04; 3-year: HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.06-2.21; P = 0.02]. There was no difference between the groups in the 5-year survival rate (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.92-2.11; P = 0.11).Conclusion:For resectable spontaneously ruptured HCC, DH could reduce intraoperative bleeding, intraoperative blood transfusion volume, and 30-day mortality rate and increase the 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates, endowing the patients with greater short- and long-term benefits during and following the surgery.
