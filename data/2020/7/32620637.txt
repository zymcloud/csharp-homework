Background/aim:To examine the factors influencing the introduction of the second-line chemotherapy and discuss the selection of first-line agent for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:We retrospectively studied 154 patients with HCC who received sorafenib therapy.Results:A total of 109 (70.8%) patients, maintained Child-Pugh grade A and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS) ≤1 upon sorafenib discontinuation. Multivariate analysis revealed that the up-to-seven criteria status in the hepatic lesion [p=0.019; odds ratio=OR, 2.685], albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade (p=0.002; OR=3.589), and macroscopic vascular invasion (MVI) (p=0.008; OR=2.972) were significant factors at sorafenib initiation that influenced the maintenance of Child-Pugh grade A and ECOG-PS ≤1 upon therapy discontinuation.Conclusion:Not only ALBI grade and MVI, but also up-to-seven criteria status in the hepatic lesion influence the introduction of second-line therapy, and could affect the selection of the first-line therapy.
