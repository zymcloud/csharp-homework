Background:Currently, there are no recognized or validated biomarkers to identify hepatocellular carcinoma patients (HCC) likely to benefit from anti-PD-1 therapy. We evaluated the relationship between neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and survival outcomes, pretreatment and after three doses (posttreatment) of nivolumab in HCC patients.Methods:Medical records of HCC patients treated with nivolumab between June 2016 and July 2018 were reviewed. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test were used to calculate and compare overall survival between NLR Results:A total of 103 patients were identified. Median age was 66 (29-89) years. Median treatment duration was 26 (2-149) weeks. Sixty-four (62%) patients had Child-Pugh class A (CP-A) liver function. Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage was B in 20 (19%) and C in 83 (81%) patients. CP-A patients who achieved a partial or complete response had significantly lower posttreatment NLR and PLR (P Conclusions:This study suggests a strong predictive role of these inflammatory cell ratios in the posttreatment setting in HCC patients treated with anti anti-PD-1 therapy and should be evaluated in a larger cohort.
