Objective(s):Increasing evidence indicates that vitamin D status is linked to severity of liver cirrhosis and patients' survival. However, the potential role of vitamin D-related immunomodulation in hepatic decompensation and patients' mortality in relation to vitamin D deficiency remains unknown. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the association between vitamin D status and vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) levels with serum cytokine and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and to examine their role on disease severity and cirrhotics' mortality.Methods:One hundred consecutive Caucasian patients with liver cirrhosis were enrolled in the study. 25(OH)D, VDBP, and LBP concentrations were assessed by ELISA. Cytokine tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-1Î², IL-8, IL-10, and IL-12 levels were determined by Cytometric Bead Array.Results:25(OH)D levels were inversely correlated with CP score, MELD, IL-6, and CP stage and VDBP levels with CP score, MELD, IL-6, IL-8, LBP, and CP stage. Cirrhotics with 25(OH)D deficiency and severe deficiency had significantly higher CP score, increased IL-6 levels and lower VDBP levels. In the multivariate analysis, the independent prognostic factors associated with patients' survival were CP stage B [hazard ratio = 6.75; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32, 34.43; P = 0.022], CP stage C (hazard ratio = 7.39; 95% CI 1.41, 38.81; P = 0.018), the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma (hazard ratio = 4.50; 95% CI 1.54, 13.13; P = 0.006) and 25(OH)D levels (hazard ratio = 0.87; 95% CI 0.80, 0.95; P = 0.002).Conclusion:The results show that vitamin D status and VDBP levels are associated with liver cirrhosis severity and patients' mortality, possibly through a proinflammatory immune response.
