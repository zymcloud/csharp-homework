The present review is a summary of the recent literature concerning Bnip3 expression, function, and regulation, along with its implications in mitochondrial dysfunction, disorders of mitophagy homeostasis, and development of diseases of secondary mitochondrial dysfunction. As a member of the Bcl-2 family of cell death-regulating factors, Bnip3 mediates mPTP opening, mitochondrial potential, oxidative stress, calcium overload, mitochondrial respiratory collapse, and ATP shortage of mitochondria from multiple cells. Recent studies have discovered that Bnip3 regulates mitochondrial dysfunction, mitochondrial fragmentation, mitophagy, cell apoptosis, and the development of lipid disorder diseases via numerous cellular signaling pathways. In addition, Bnip3 promotes the development of cardiac hypertrophy by mediating inflammatory response or the related signaling pathways of cardiomyocytes and is also responsible for raising abnormal mitophagy and apoptosis progression through multiple molecular signaling pathways, inducing the pathogenesis and progress of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Different molecules regulate Bnip3 expression at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and unbalance of mitophagy in hepatocytes, which promotes the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Thus, Bnip3 plays an important role in mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy homeostasis and has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for diseases of secondary mitochondrial dysfunction.
