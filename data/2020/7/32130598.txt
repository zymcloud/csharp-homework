Humanity faces great challenges, such as the rise of bacterial antibiotic resistance and cancer incidence. Thus, the discovery of novel therapeutics from underexplored environments, such as marine habitats, is fundamental. In this study, twelve strains from the phylum Firmicutes and thirty-four strains from the phylum Proteobacteria, isolated from marine sponges of the Erylus genus, collected in Portuguese waters, were tested for bioactivities and the secondary metabolites were characterised. Bioactivity screenings comprised antimicrobial, anti-fungal, anti-parasitic and anti-cancer assays. Selected bioactive extracts were further analysed for already described molecules through high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Several bioactivities were observed against the fungus Aspergillusfumigatus, the bacteria (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli), the human liver cancer cell line HepG2 and the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Medium scale-up volume extracts confirmed anti-fungal activity by strains Proteus mirabilis #118_13 and Proteus sp. (JX006497) strain #118_20. Anti-parasitic activity was also confirmed in Enterococcus faecalis strain #118_3. Moreover, P. mirabilis #118_13 showed bioactivity in human melanoma cell line A2058 and the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. The dereplication of bioactive extracts showed the existence of a variety of secondary metabolites, with some unidentifiable molecules. This work shows that bacterial communities of sponges are indeed good candidates for drug discovery and, as far as we know, we describe anti-parasitic activity of a strain of E. faecalis and the presence of diketopiperazines in Proteus genus for the first time.
