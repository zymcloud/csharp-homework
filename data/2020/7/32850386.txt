MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small RNAs that can function as gene regulators and are involved in tumorigenesis. We review the commonly dysregulated miRNAs in liver tumor tissues and plasma/serum of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. The frequently reported up-regulated miRNAs in liver tumor tissues include miR-18a, miR-21, miR-221, miR-222, and miR-224, whereas down-regulated miRNAs include miR-26a, miR-101, miR-122, miR-125b, miR-145, miR-199a, miR-199b, miR-200a, and miR-223. For a subset of these miRNAs (up-regulated miR-222 and miR-224, down-regulated miR-26a and miR-125b), the pattern of dysregulated circulating miRNAs in plasma/serum is mirrored in tumor tissue based on multiple independent studies. Dysregulated miRNAs target oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. Normalization of dysregulated miRNAs by up- or down-regulation has been shown to inhibit HCC cell proliferation or sensitize liver cancer cells to chemotherapeutic treatment. miRNAs hold as yet unrealized potential as biomarkers for early detection of HCC and as precision therapeutic targets, but further studies in diverse populations and across all stages of HCC are needed.
