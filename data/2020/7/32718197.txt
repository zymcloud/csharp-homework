Fucoidan is sulfated polysaccharide of brown seaweed. It offers various pharmacological actions like anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and anti-tumor activities. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of targeting microRNA-143 and inflammatory pathway by Fucoidan on experimentally induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in rats. HCC is experimentally induced in Sprague Dawley by thioacetamide. Rats were treated with 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg Fucoidan. Hepatic sections were stained with hematoxylin/esosin for investigation of cell integrity. Moreover, hepatic sections were immunohistochemically stained with antibodies for ki67, TNF-α, and IL-1β. Finally, hepatic tissues were investigated for expression of miR-143, NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-1β. We found that treating HCC with Fucoidan significantly reduced HCC-induced elevation in oxidative stress. Moreover, Fucoidan reduced HCC-induced in expression of miR-143, NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-1β. Finally, Fucoidan attenuated pseudohepatic lobules, broad fibrous septa and vacuolar to ballooning degeneration associated with reduction of immunostaining of ki67, TNF-α, and IL-1β. Fucoidan elevated the survival of HCC rats and reduced their serum AFP. In addition, Fucoidan treatment revealed reduction in the expression of miR-143 associated with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in HCC rats.
