Background:The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) on the prognosis of patients undergoing liver resection (LR) for primary liver malignancies (PLC).Methods:The recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients undergoing LR with and without PVTT for three primary liver malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and hepato-cholangio carcinoma (CHC) were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis.Results:In total, 3775 patients with PLC who underwent LR were included in this study. The incidence of PVTT in patients undergoing LR with HCC, IHC and CHC were 46%, 20%, and 17%, respectively. The median RFS and OS were significantly better for patients with HCC as compared to ICC or CHC (16 vs 11 vs 13 months; 21 vs 16 vs 18 months, respectively; P Conclusion:Although the prognosis of patients with PLC varied by histological subtype, once PVTT occurred, survival outcomes after LR were similarly poor across all three subgroups.
