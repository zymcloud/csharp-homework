Background:Deemed as a member of malignant tumors, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been characterized as a lethal disease with high morbidity and mortality. It has been widely accepted that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a big part in the complicated biologic processes of cancer.Aim of the study:The purpose of the study is to figure out the role and molecular regulation mechanism of ST8SIA6-AS1 in HCC.Methods:The role of ST8SIA6-AS1 in HCC was validated by RT-qPCR, colony formation, ki-67 detection, TUNEL, JC-1 detection, wound healing and transwell-invasion assays, furthermore, the binding ability between ST8SIA6-AS1/HOXB6 and miR-5195-3p were confirmed by RNA pull down and luciferase reporter assays. Besides, the regulatory mechanism of ST8SIA6-AS1 to HOXB6/miR-5195-3p was measured by RT-qPCR and western blot assays.Results:We measured that ST8SIA6-AS1 was highly expressed in HCC cell lines. Then knockdown of it suppressed cell proliferation, migration and migration but activated cell apoptosis in HCC. Furthermore, ST8SIA6-AS1 could bind with miR-5195-3p and negatively regulated its expression in HCC. Subsequently, it confirmed that HOXB6 was target gene of miR-5195-3p and positively modulated by ST8SIA6-AS1 in HCC. Finally, we verified that miR-5195-3p deficiency or HOXB6 upregulation countervailed the repressing effects of ST8SIA6-AS1 depletion on HCC progression.Conclusions:To sum up, ST8SIA6-AS1 promotes HCC progression by absorbing miR-5195-3p to regulate HOXB6, which might provide some worthy suggestions to research the development process of HCC.
