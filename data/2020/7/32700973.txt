Acacia etbaica is wild plant growing in the desert of Egypt, and it has folkloric medicinal uses. Phytochemical investigation of Acacia etbaica extracts led to the isolation and identification of seven compounds. Among these compounds are three new simple phenolics: Resacetophenone-6-methyl [1], Resorcinol [2], Resorcinol-O- Î² -Glucoside [3]; phenolic ester; and other four known compounds: Methylparaben [4]; two chromones, Noreugenin [5], Eugenin [6]; and one cyclitol: pinitol [7]. Compounds [1-3] isolated and identified for the first time from natural origin. In contrast, compounds [4-6] isolated for the first time from the family Fabaceae. The biological investigation was conducted on plant extracts and showed that the methylene chloride extract had a strong efficacy against Bacillus subtilis and good activity against Candida albicans. In contrast, the n-butanol extract showed extreme cytotoxic activity against Mammary gland breast cancer (MCF-7), and strong activity against Hepatocellular carcinoma (HEPG-2), and Colorectal carcinoma (HCT-116) cell lines.
