Left untreated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The observed failure of clinical trials in NASH may suggest that current model systems do not fully recapitulate human disease, and/or hallmark pathological features of NASH may not be driven by the same pathway in every animal model let alone in each patient. Identification of a model-agnostic disease-associated node can spur the development of effective drugs for the treatment of liver disease. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase1 (GPAT1) plays a pivotal role in lipid accumulation by shunting fats away from oxidation. In the present study, hepatic GPAT1 expression was evaluated in three etiologically different models of NAFLD. Compared to the sham cohort, hepatic GPAT1 mRNA levels were elevated by âˆ¼5-fold in steatosis and NASH with fibrosis with immunofluorescent staining revealing increased GPAT1 in the fatty liver. A significant and direct correlation (r = 0.88) was observed between hepatic GPAT1 mRNA expression and severity of the liver disease. Picrosirius red staining revealed a logarithmic relation between hepatic GPAT1 mRNA expression and scar. These data suggest that hepatic GPAT1 is an early disease-associated model-agnostic node in NAFLD and form the basis for the development of a potentially successful therapeutic against NASH.
