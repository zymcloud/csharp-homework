Genetic heterogeneity is a well-recognized feature of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The coexistence of multiple genetic alterations in the same HCC nodule contributes to explain why gene-targeted therapy has largely failed. Targeting of early genetic alterations could theoretically be a more effective therapeutic strategy preventing HCC. However, the failure of most targeted therapies has raised much perplexity regarding the role of genetic alterations in driving cancer as the main paradigm. Here, we discuss the methodological and conceptual limitations of targeting genetic alterations and their products that may explain the limited success of the novel mechanism-based drugs in the treatment of HCC. In light of these limitations and despite the era of the so-called "precision medicine," prevention and early diagnosis of conditions predisposing to HCC remain the gold standard approach to prevent the development of this type of cancer. Finally, a paradigm shift to a more systemic approach to cancer is required to find optimal therapeutic solutions to treat this disease.
