Increasing evidences suggest that insufficient radiofrequency ablation (IRFA) can paradoxically promote tumor invasion and metastatic processes, whereas the effects of moderate hyperthermia on cancer progression are not well illustrated. Our study found that IRFA can increase the in vitro migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells via induction of Snail, a master regulator of EMT events. Among measured miRNAs, IRFA can decrease the expression of miR-148a-5p in HCC cells. Whereas overexpression of miR-148a-5p can reverse IRFA-induced migration of HCC cells and upregulation of Snail, mechanistically overexpression of miR-148a-5p can directly target and decrease the expression of protein kinase ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), which can increase protein stability of Snail. Collectively, our data suggest that IRFA can regulate the miR-148a-5p/ATM/Snail axis to trigger migration of HCC cells.
