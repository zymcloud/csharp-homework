Aim:Combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CCA) is a very rare subtype of primary liver carcinoma; therefore, its clinicopathological characteristics have not yet been elucidated in detail. The aim of the study was to reveal the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic factors of cHCC-CCA after hepatic resection (HR) METHODS: A total of 124 patients who underwent curative HR for cHCC-CCA between 2000 and 2016 were enrolled in this multi-institutional study conducted by the Kyushu Study Group of Liver Surgery. Clinicopathological analysis was performed from the viewpoint of patient prognosis.Results:A total of 62 patients (50%) had early recurrence within 1.5 years after HR, including 36 patients (58%) with extrahepatic recurrence. In contrast, just four patients (3%) had late recurrence occurring >3 years after HR. The independent predictors of early recurrence were as follows: des-gamma carboxyprothrombin >40 mAU/mL (odds ratio 26.2, P = 0.0117), carbohydrate antigen 19-9>37 IU/l (odds ratio 18.0, P = 0.0200), and poorly differentiated HCC or CCA (odds ratio 11.2, P = 0.0259).Conclusions:Half of the patients with cHCC-CCA had early recurrence after HR. Preoperative elevation of des-gamma carboxyprothrombin or carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and the existence of poorly differentiated components of HCC or CCA in resected specimens are predictors of its early recurrence.
