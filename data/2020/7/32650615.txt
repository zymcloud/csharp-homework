MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) has been identified as a marker of various liver injuries, including hepatitis- virus-infection-, alcoholic-, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-induced liver fibrosis. Here, we report that the extracellular miR-122 from hepatic cells can be delivered to hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) to modulate their proliferation and gene expression. Our published Argonaute crosslinking immunoprecipitation (Ago-CLIP) data identified several pro-fibrotic genes, including Ctgf, as miR-122 targets in mice livers. However, treating Ctgf as a therapeutic target failed to rescue the fibrosis developed in the miR-122 knockout livers. Alternatively, we compared the published datasets of human cirrhotic livers and miR-122 KO livers, which revealed upregulation of BCL2, suggesting its potential role in regulating fibrosis. Notably, ectopic miR-122 expression inhibited BCL2 expression in human HSC (LX-2) cells). Publicly available ChIP-seq data in human hepatocellular cancer (HepG2) cells and mice livers suggested miR-122 could regulate BCL2 expression indirectly through c-MYC, which was confirmed by siRNA-mediated depletion of c-MYC in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. Importantly, Venetoclax, a potent BCL2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of leukemia, showed promising anti-fibrotic effects in miR-122 knockout mice. Collectively, our data demonstrate that miR-122 suppresses liver fibrosis and implicates anti-fibrotic potential of Venetoclax.
