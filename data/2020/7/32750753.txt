Background:Microvascular invasion (MVI) is a significant sign of the invasive property and a strong predictor of poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a life-threatening malignancy. However, recurrence-associated and post-surgical long-term prognosis-associated factors in HCC with MVI remain unknown.Objectives:To address the abovementioned issues, based on a Chinese patient cohort with HCC after curative hepatic resection.Material and methods:The patient cohort consisted of 62 consecutive patients with HCC and MVI who underwent curative hepatic resection. The associations between clinicopathologic variables and recurrence, as well as patient overall/disease-free survival, were uniand multivariately evaluated.Results:Univariate Ï‡2 test identified hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity, high Edmondson-Steiner grade and male gender as risk factors of recurrence, whereas Edmondson-Steiner grade and HBsAg positivity were significant or marginally significant in the multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis. Subsequently, univariate log-rank test showed that Edmondson-Steiner grade, HBsAg positivity and Child-Pugh grade were associated with overall and/or disease-free survival. Among them, the independent prognostic impact of Edmondson-Steiner grade and HBsAg positivity for both overall and disease-free survival were proven in the multivariate Cox regression analysis.Conclusions:Our data suggested that Edmondson-Steiner grade and HBsAg positivity might serve as useful indicators of recurrence and pessimistic prognosis in HCC with MVI.
