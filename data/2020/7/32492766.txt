Cytoglobin (Cygb), a stellate cell-specific globin, has recently drawn attention due to its association with liver fibrosis. In the livers of both humans and rodents, Cygb is expressed only in stellate cells and can be utilized as a marker to distinguish stellate cells from hepatic fibroblast-derived myofibroblasts. Loss of Cygb accelerates liver fibrosis and cancer development in mouse models of chronic liver injury including diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocellular carcinoma, bile duct ligation-induced cholestasis, thioacetamide-induced hepatic fibrosis, and choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. This review focuses on the history of research into the role of reactive oxygen species and nitrogen species in liver fibrosis and discusses the current perception of Cygb as a novel radical scavenger with an emphasis on its role in hepatic stellate cell activation and fibrosis.
