Background:In Egypt, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is approximately 4.7% of chronic liver disease patients due to (HCV) infection. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays an important role in hepatocyte regeneration. A functional polymorphism in EGF 61A>G was identified; itwas associated with higher risk of HCC.Objectives:to investigate the correlation between the epidermal growth factor (EGF) polymorphism and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in hepatitis C viral (HCV) cirrhotic patients as well as its relation to EGF protein expression in HCC tissue.Patients and methods:this casecontrol study was conducted on 75 HCV cirrhotic patients including 50 HCC patients (25 withresectable HCC and 25 with advanced unresectable HCC) and 25 healthy persons were included. EGF genotype was detected by restriction fragment length polymorphism. EGF expression in HCC tissue biopsiesfrom patientswhounderwent surgical resection was done by immunohistochemical examination.Results:The GG genotype was associated with significant increased risk of HCC compared to AA genotypes (P=0.031) in cirrhotic group. The G allele had a highly significant risk of HCC compared to allele Ain recessive model GG vs. AG+AA (P=0.036) rather than in the dominant model GG +AG vs. AA (P=0.66). There was significant increased expression of EGF in tumour tissues in patients with GG genotype compared to AG genotype and AA genotype p= 0.019.Conclusion:EGF gene polymorphism (GG genotype) had a significant risk of HCC development in cirrhotic patients. This is confirmed by increased EGF expression in liver tumor tissue from HCC patients..
