Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified recently as pivotal regulators in the development and progression of cancers, generally by acting as competing endogenous RNAs of microRNAs (miRNAs) to regulate gene expression. The dysregulation of circRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has attracted much attention, but the precise role of circRNAs in HCC remains largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential role of circular RNA PVT1 (circPVT1), a newly identified cancer-related circRNA, in HCC. Herein, we found that circPVT1 expression was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of circPVT1 significantly reduced the growth and colony formation, and increased cell apoptosis, of HCC cells. Our results further identified circPVT1 as a sponge for miR-3666. Knockdown of circPVT1 significantly increased miR-3666 expression in HCC cells. Moreover, miR-3666 expression was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues and was inversely correlated with circPVT1 expression. In addition, the overexpression of miR-3666 inhibited the growth of HCC cells by targeting Sirtuin 7 (SIRT7). Notably, miR-3666 inhibition or SIRT7 overexpression partially reversed the circPVT1 knockdown-mediated inhibitory effect on HCC cell growth. Overall, these results demonstrate that downregulation of circPVT1 represses HCC cell growth by upregulating miR-3666 to inhibit SIRT7, suggesting circPVT1 as a potential therapeutic target for HCC. Our study highlights the involvement of circPVT1/miR-3666/SIRT7 in regulating HCC cell growth.
