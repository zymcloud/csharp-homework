Ferroptosis is an iron- and lipotoxicity-dependent form of regulated cell death (RCD). It is morphologically and biochemically distinct from characteristics of other cell death. This modality has been intensively investigated in recent years due to its involvement in a wide array of pathologies, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and acute kidney injury. Dysregulation of ferroptosis has also been linked to various liver diseases and its modification may provide a hopeful and attractive therapeutic concept. Indeed, targeting ferroptosis may prevent the pathophysiological progression of several liver diseases, such as hemochromatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and ethanol-induced liver injury. On the contrary, enhancing ferroptosis may promote sorafenib-induced ferroptosis and pave the way for combination therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) and system xc- have been identified as key players to mediate ferroptosis pathway. More recently diverse signaling pathways have also been observed. The connection between ferroptosis and other forms of RCD is intricate and compelling, where discoveries in this field advance our understanding of cell survival and fate. In this review, we summarize the central molecular machinery of ferroptosis, describe the role of ferroptosis in non-cancer hepatic disease conditions and discuss the potential to manipulate ferroptosis as a therapeutic strategy.
