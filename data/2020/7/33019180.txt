Compared to European-Americans (EAs), the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is higher in African-Americans (AAs) and is associated with more advanced tumor stage at diagnosis and lower survival rates. The increasing burden makes discovery of novel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarkers distinguishing HCC from underlying cirrhosis a significant focus. In this study, we analyzed tissue and serum samples from 40 HCC cases and 25 patients with liver cirrhosis to identify candidate biomarkers that distinguish HCC from cirrhotic patients in a race specific manner. Through integrative analysis of transcriptomic and metabolomic data, we investigated candidate metabolite biomarkers that are specific to AAs and EAs. The results from this demonstrate the utility of integrating transcriptomic and metabolomic data to prioritize clinically and biologically relevant metabolite biomarkers that can increase understanding of molecular mechanisms driving HCC in different racial groups.
