Background/aim:The Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) is a prognostic indicator for several cancers; however, the association between the GNRI and colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) remains unknown.Patients and methods:Eighty patients who underwent hepatectomy for synchronous CRLM were divided into two groups based on the GNRI.Results:The preoperative CA19-9 levels were significantly higher in the low (GNRI â‰¤98; n=30) than the normal GNRI group (GNRI >98; n=50). Patients in the low GNRI group had poorer outcomes than those in the normal GNRI group. A low GNRI was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival and overall survival. Among 50 patients who experienced recurrence, only 16 of 22 patients (72.7%) in the low GNRI group could receive intensive treatment and 27 of 28 patients (96.4%) in the normal GNRI group.Conclusion:The GNRI is a simplified prognostic factor for patients with CRLM.
