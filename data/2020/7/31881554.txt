Background and aim:The prognosis of cirrhotic patients with hepatic edema is poor. Although several short-term predictors of tolvaptan (novel diuretic agent) treatment for such patients have been reported, the factors related to long-term survival are still unclear.Methods:Among 459 patients with hepatic edema enrolled in a retrospective, multicenter collaborative study, we analyzed 407 patients who received tolvaptan.Results:Patients consisted of 266 men and 141 women, with the median age of 68 years (range, 28-93 years). The frequency of short-term responders to tolvaptan was 59.7% (243/407). In the Cox regression analysis, short-term response to tolvaptan, low average dosages of furosemide and spironolactone during tolvaptan treatment, Child-Pugh classification A and B, and absence of hepatocellular carcinoma were independent factors contributed to 1-year survival. The 1-year and long-term cumulative survival rates in short-term responders were significantly higher than those in non-responders (P = 0.011 and 0.010, respectively). Using a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the optimal cut-off values of average daily dosages of furosemide and spironolactone for predicting 1-year survival were 19 and 23 mg/day, respectively. The long-term cumulative survival rates in patients who received a mean dosage of spironolactone Conclusions:The present study suggests that the short-term response to tolvaptan and low dosages of conventional diuretics during tolvaptan treatment might improve the 1-year and long-term survival rates in cirrhotic patients with hepatic edema.
