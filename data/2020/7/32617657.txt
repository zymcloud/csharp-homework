Background:The recent development of 3D vision in laparoscopic and robotic surgical systems raises the question of whether these two procedures are equivalent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the surgical and long-term oncological outcomes of 3D laparoscopic (3D-LLR) and robotic liver resection (RLR) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The data for operative time, morbidity, margins, and survival were reviewed for 3D-LLR and compared with RLR.Results:From 2011 to 2017, 93 patients with HCC, including 58 (62%) with cirrhosis, underwent 3D-LLR [49 (53%)] or RLR [44 (47%)]. No difference was observed in operative time (269 vs. 252 min; p = 0.52), overall (27% vs. RLR: 16%; p = 0.49) and severe morbidity (4% vs. 2%; p = 0.77) or in the surgical margin width (9 vs. 11 mm; p = 0.30) between the 3D-LLR and RLR groups. The 3-year overall and recurrence-free survival rates after 3D-LLR and RLR were 82% and 24% and 91% (p = 0.16) and 48% (p = 0.18), respectively.Conclusions:The 3D-LLR and RLR systems provide comparable surgical margins with similar short- and long-term oncological outcomes.
