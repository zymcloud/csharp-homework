Metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma of the sternum is rare and a few cases of surgical resection have been reported. Anterior chest wall reconstruction after radical resection of the sternum and ribs aims to protect the heart and lung from external damage and herniation and restore physiologic stability of the chest wall during respiration. A variety of reconstruction techniques using various materials have been reported, but so far there are no definitive guidelines for the reconstruction of chest wall defects. Recently, we encountered a rare case of metastatic cancer of the sternum from hepatocellular carcinoma in which radical resection of the sternum and ribs, and anterior chest wall reconstruction with acellular dermal matrix and titanium plates were performed.
