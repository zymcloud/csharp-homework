A patient with history of hepatocellular carcinoma was found multiple pulmonary metastases. Staged treatments were combined into a single operation session in the hybrid theatre, encompassing bronchoscopic microwave ablation of central right upper lobe lesions, and uniportal surgical wedge resections of peripheral right middle lobe lesions. All lung metastases were successfully treated with adequate margin clearance. Microwave ablation under the guidance of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy in the hybrid theatre is a novel contribution to the multimodal operative management of multiple pulmonary neoplasms. It is a unique choice for patients with multilobar, subcentimeter metastases, and with concerns about lung function preservation.
