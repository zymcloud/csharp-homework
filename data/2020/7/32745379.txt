Background:The prognostic value and non-invasive predictors of splenomegaly in cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative resection remain unknown.Objectives:To investigate the prognostic value and non-invasive predictors of splenomegaly in cirrhotic patients with HCC after curative resection.Material and methods:The medical records of 78 patients with HCC and liver cirrhosis who underwent curative resection were retrospectively reviewed. The influence of spleen size, measured with clinically routine ultrasonography (USG), on overall and disease-free survival was evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. The efficiency of some frequently used blood-derived liver function parameters and non-invasive fibrosis markers to predict splenomegaly was also assessed.Results:It was shown that tumor size >5 cm, the presence of microvascular invasion, tumor-node metastasis (TNM) stage III-IVA of the tumor, spleen size >11.45 cm, and age â‰¤52 years were associated with poor overall survival and/or disease-free survival in univariate analyses (all p Conclusions:Splenomegaly, which can be predicted by some non-invasive variables, serves as a strong determinant for postresectional prognoses of cirrhotic patients with HCC.
