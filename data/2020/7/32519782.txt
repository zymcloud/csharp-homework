Background:We conducted a prospective study using gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-EOB-MRI) to determine whether sustained virological response (SVR) by direct-acting anti-viral (DAA) drugs suppresses hepatocarcinogenesis in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.Aim:To use serial Gd-EOB-MRI to assess the impact of DAAs on hepatocarcinogenesis.Methods:Between February 2008 and December 2018, 1083 consecutive patients with HCV infection underwent Gd-EOB-MRI. Of these, 719 patients were enrolled, including 210 patients in the 'Non-DAA group', who did not receive DAAs before the introduction of DAAs, and 509 patients in the 'DAA group', who achieved SVR after the introduction of DDAs. Factors associated with hepatocarcinogenesis were analysed by a Cox proportional hazard model. In addition, hepatocarcinogenesis was classified into two types, 'multistep' and 'de novo', on the basis of Gd-EOB-MRI findings. Factors associated with each type were analysed by Fine and Gray proportional hazards models.Results:Hepatocarcinogenesis was observed in 67 of 719 (9.3%) patients. Factors associated with hepatocarcinogenesis were male gender, albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade 2 or 3, Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP-L3) â‰¥5%, the presence of nonhypervascular hypointense nodules (NHHNs) and Non-DAA group. Of 67 patients, multistep hepatocarcinogenesis occurred in 58 patients (86.6%) and de novo hepatocarcinogenesis occurred in nine patients (13.4%). Factors associated with multistep hepatocarcinogenesis were male gender and Non-DAA group.Conclusion:The eradication of HCV by DAA therapy reduces multistep hepatocarcinogenesis.
