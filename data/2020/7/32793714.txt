Background:This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI-based radiomics features for prediction of overall survival (OS) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after surgical resection.Methods:This prospective study approved by the Institutional Review Board enrolled 120 patients with pathologically confirmed HCC. Radiomics signatures (rad-scores) were built from radiomics features in 3 different regions of interest (ROIs) with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) cox regression analysis. Preoperative clinical characteristics and semantic imaging features potentially associated with patient survival were evaluated to develop a clinic-radiological model. The radiomics features and clinic-radiological predictors were integrated into a joint model using multivariable Cox regression analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests were performed to compare the discriminative performance and evaluated on the validation cohort.Results:The radiomics signatures showed a significant association with patient survival in both cohorts (all PConclusions:Radiomics features along with clinic-radiological predictors can efficiently aid in preoperative HCC prognosis prediction after surgical resection and enable a step forward precise medicine.
