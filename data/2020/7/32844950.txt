Hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with hepatitis C in the absence of cirrhosis is uncommon. We demonstrate the importance of morphofunctional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a hepatospecific contrast agent by describing an asymptomatic female patient with HCV, who presented with a nodule detected on ultrasound. She underwent inconclusive computed tomography, presenting no signs of chronic liver disease. MRI with hepatospecific contrast providing functional information combined with the superior tissue contrast inherent to this method stands out for its greater accuracy with the possibility of not resorting to invasive diagnostic methods. With increasing experience and the dissemination of this new diagnostic modality in the medical field, its use and other potential benefits of morphofunctional MRI with hepatospecific contrast agents may be established, benefiting patients with challenging focal liver lesions.
