Background and aims:The enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) score comprises serum markers of fibrogenesis and matrix remodelling and was developed to detect liver fibrosis, however, it may also be useful for the non-invasive detection of portal hypertension (PHT).Methods:ELF score and its single components (TIMP1/PIIINP/HA) were analysed in 201 patients with advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD; ie hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) â‰¥6 mm Hg). Patients with pre-/post-hepatic PHT, hepatocellular carcinoma beyond Milan criteria, and history of TIPS implantation or liver transplantation were excluded.Results:ELF and its single components correlated with HVPG in the overall cohort: ELF: r = .443, TIMP1: r = .368, PIIINP:r = .332, and HA:r = .419 (all P Conclusion:The ELF score correlates with HVPG at values
