Aim: This study aimed to investigate the expression of microRNA-505 (miR-505) and explore its clinical significance, biological function and mechanisms in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Expression of miR-505 was measured in 128 paired HCC tissues and five cell lines by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). MTT assay, Transwell migration, invasion assays and apoptosis assay were performed to explore the functional role of miR-505. The target gene of miR-505 was assessed using the bioinformatics assay and the related signaling pathway was confirmed using western blot. Results: Expression of miR-505 in HCC serum and tissues were downregulated. The overexpression of miR-505 in HCC cells inhibited cell proliferation and metastasis, as well as enhanced cell apoptosis by directly downregulating heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M (HNRNPM). The activity of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was suppressed by the overexpression of miR-505 but was promoted by the upregulation of HNRNPM. Conclusion: The results suggest that the regulation of miR-505/HNRNPM may be a novel strategy to improve the targeted therapy of HCC.
