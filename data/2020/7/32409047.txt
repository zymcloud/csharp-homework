The purpose of current study was green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from seeds and wild Silybum plants in comparison with their respective extracts followed by characterization and biological potency. The biologically synthesized AgNPs were subjected to characterization using techniques like XRD, FTIR, TEM, HPLC and SPE. Highly crystalline and stable NPs were obtained using Silybum wild plant (NP1) and seeds (NP3) with size range between 18.12 and 13.20 nm respectively. The synthesized NPs and their respective extracts revealed a vast range of biological applications showing antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic and anti-aging potencies. The highest antioxidant activity (478.23 ± 1.9 μM, 176.91 ± 1.3 μM, 83.5 ± 1.6% μgAAE/mg, 156.32 ± 0.6 μgAAE/mg) for ABTS, FRAP, FRSA, TRP respectively was shown by seed extract (NP4) followed by highest value of (117.35 ± 0.9 μgAAE/mg) for TAC by wild extract (NP2). The highest antifungal activity (13 mm ± 0.76) against Candida albicans was shown by NP3 while antibacterial activity of (6 mm against Klebsiella pneumonia) was shown by NP3 and NP4. The highest anti-inflammatory activity (38.56 ± 1.29 against COX1) was shown by NP2. Similarly, the high value of (48.89 ± 1.34 against Pentosidine-Like AGEs) was shown by NP4. Also, the high anti-diabetic activity (38.74 ± 1.09 against α-amylase) was shown by NP4. The extracts and the synthesized NPs have shown activity against hepato-cellular carcinoma (HepG2) human cells. The HPLC analysis revealed that the highest value of silymarin component (silybin B 2289 mg/g DW) was found for NP4. Silydianin is responsible for capping. Among the green synthesized AgNPs and the extracts used, the effect of NP4 was most promising for further use.
