We report a case of metastatic small cell carcinoma presenting as a rectal mass in an 80-year-old male with a history of change in bowel movement and rectal pain for six months. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was done, which showed a large rectal mass with many liver metastases. He had a diagnostic colonoscopy, which showed a large obstructing rectal mass, and the biopsy result came back as small cell carcinoma. He underwent palliative diverting colostomy without complications. Initially, there was a plan to treat the patient with systemic chemotherapy with etoposide and carboplatin, but given the acute kidney injury, there was a delay in treatment. After the first cycle of chemotherapy, the patient had severe nausea and vomiting. After a discussion with the patient and his family, he decided on hospice care and passed away in a few weeks.
