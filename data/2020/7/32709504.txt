Background:The efficacy of cellular immunotherapy in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was controversial. This study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of combining cellular immunotherapy with that of incurable treatment alone.Methods:The Ovid Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Pubmed were systematically searched due to January 8th 2020. The keywords include "immunotherapy", "HCC" and study type. Treatment response was evaluated and progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated using hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).Results:A total of 19 studies with 1275 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The median complete response rate (CR) was 19% in combining cellular immunotherapy comparing to 9% in the control group (RR=0.55, P=0.003). No significant difference was found in partial response and stable disease (RR=1.06 and 0.78, P>0.05, respectively). The progression disease rate was higher in the non-cellular immunotherapy group (31%) compared to the cellular immunotherapy group (RR=2.20, P=0.002). Patients treating with cellular immunotherapy had a better OS and PFS compared to those without cellular immunotherapy (HR=0.52 and 0.63, PConclusion:Our results suggested that combining use of cellular immunotherapy in advanced HCC could increase the complete response rate, and thereafter extend the progression-free and overall survival rate. Subgroup analysis suggested that combining use of CIK and DC or using CIK alone could provide the benefit in survival outcome.
