To identify the regulatory role of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in the development of liver disease, we generated a mouse model with hepatocyte-specific deletion of Ppp2r1a gene (encoding PP2A Aα subunit). Homozygote (HO) mice and matched wild-type (WT) littermates were investigated at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months-of-age, respectively. Pathological examination showed that PP2A Aα deficiency in hepatocytes resulted in progressive liver fibrosis phenotype from 9 months-of-age. No hepatocyte death was observed in HO mice. However, perturbation of pathways including epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR1), amino acid metabolism, translation factors, as well as leptin and adiponectin led to pronounced hepatic fibrosis. In vitro studies demonstrated the involvement of specific B subunit complexes in the regulation of EGFR1 signaling pathway and a cross-talk between defected hepatocytes and stimulation of interstitial hyperplasia. It is noteworthy that HO mice failed to develop hepatocellular carcinoma for as long as 22 months-of-age. We further demonstrate that PP2A Aβ containing holoenzymes played a critical role in preventing hepatocyte apoptosis and antagonizing tumorigenesis through specific pathways upon Aα loss. Furthermore, PP2A Aα and Aβ were functionally distinct, and the Aβ isoform failed to substitute for Aα in the development of inflammation and liver fibrosis. In conclusion, these observations identify novel pathways that contribute to the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis and provide new putative therapeutic targets for its treatment.
