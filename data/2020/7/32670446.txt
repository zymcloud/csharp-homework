Many patients with hepatocellular carcinoma cannot be treated surgically because of the advanced stage of the tumor and/or coexisting cirrhosis. Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) represents an alternative therapeutic approach for some of these patients. However, it is not a curative measure, and an additional therapy is required to eradicate the residual disease. In this communication, we report a case of 55-year-old man with giant hepatocellular carcinoma located in the right lobe of the liver that was successfully treated with TAE. TAE completely devascularized the tumor in one session. Despite of postembolization antibiotic therapy, complete tumor necrosis led to abscess formation. After 57 days of abscess drainage, necrotic tumor tissue was completely evacuated from the drained cavity; no viable tumor tissue was identified by computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging scan on a 5 year follow-up. TAE procedure can be suggested as a modulator of antitumor immune response, by exposing tumor antigens after necrosis leading to inflammation. In addition to necrosis caused by TAE, an antimicrobial acute inflammatory reaction in the treated area led to the complete destruction of the giant tumor.
