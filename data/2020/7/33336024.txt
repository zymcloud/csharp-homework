Hepatoma is a serious liver cancer with high morbidity and mortality. Eldecalcitol (ED-71), a vitamin D analog, is extensively used as anti-cancer agent in vitro. Hepatocellular carcinoma cell, SMMC-7721 cell lines were used in this study. Transwell assay, cell apoptosis and cell cycle detection assays were investigated after treatment with ED-71 and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as control. Sizes of tumors were measured after ED-71 treatment in a mouse model. E-cadherin and Akt gene expressions were detected by real-time PCR (RT-PCR). The results showed that cell invasion and migration were decreased markedly after ED-71 treatment compared to control group. Cell cycle detection showed that the G2 stage was 13.18% and total S-stage was 41.16% in the ED-71 group and G2 stage: 22.88%, total S-stage: 27.34% in the control group. Cell apoptosis rate was promoted in the ED-71 group. Size of the tumors reduced more after the ED-71 treatment than the PBS treatment in mice. ED-71 markedly inhibited the expression of Akt and E-cadherin, either detected by immunohistochemistry or RT-PCR. ED-71 treatment can inhibit the hepatoma agent proliferation by increasing the E-cadherin expression and decreasing Akt expression. Therefore, these findings provide novel evidence that ED-71 can be used as an anti-hepatoma agent.
