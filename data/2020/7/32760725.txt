Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a dismal long-term outcome. We aimed to construct a multi-gene model for prognosis prediction to inform HCC management. The cancer-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using RNA-seq data of paired tumor and normal tissue. A prognostic signature was built by LASSO regression analysis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to further understand the underlying molecular mechanisms. A 10-gene signature was constructed to stratify the TCGA and ICGC cohorts into high- and low-risk groups where prognosis was significantly worse in the high-risk group across cohorts (P < 0.001 for all). The 10-gene signature outperformed all previously reported models for both C-index and the AUCs for 1-, 3-, 5-year survival prediction (C-index, 0.84 vs 0.67 to 0.73; AUCs for 1-, 3- and 5-year OS, 0.84 vs 0.68 to 0.79, 0.81 to 0.68 to 0.80, and 0.85 vs 0.67 to 0.78, respectively). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed risk group and tumor stage to be independent predictors of survival in HCC. A nomogram incorporating tumor stage and signature-based risk group showed better performance for 1- and 3-year survival than for 5-year survival. GSEA revealed enrichment of pathways related to cell cycle regulation among high-risk samples and metabolic processes in the low-risk group. Our 10-gene model is robust for prognosis prediction and may help inform clinical management of HCC.
