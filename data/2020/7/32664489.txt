We sought to investigate the clinical profile(s) associated with the discontinuation of lenvatinib (LEN) due to severe adverse events (DLSAE) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This retrospective study enrolled 177 patients with HCC treated with LEN. Independent factors associated with DLSAE were advanced age, albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade 2, fatigue grade ≥ 3, and appetite loss ≥ 2. The overall survival (OS) in the group that did not require DLSAE was significantly longer compared to the group that did require DLSAE (median survival time (MST): not reached vs. 12.8 months, p < 0.001). Moreover, advanced age was the most important variable for DLSAE in a decision tree analysis. Hypertension and hand-foot-skin-reaction (HFSR) were also significantly associated with longer survival, and the occurrence of hypertension was the earliest predictor for improved prognosis, while appetite loss and development of grade ≥ 3 fatigue were predictive of a poor prognosis. We concluded that the appearance of hypertension has potential as an early surrogate marker to predict improved prognosis. Moreover, careful management to avoid discontinuation of treatment leads to longer survival in patients receiving LEN.
