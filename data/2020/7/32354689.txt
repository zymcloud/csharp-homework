Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a silent killer that leads to rapid progression of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). High prevalence of HCV infection has been reported in Taiwan, especially in high-risk populations including people who inject drugs (PWID) and patients requiring dialysis. Besides, certain populations merit special considerations due to suboptimal outcome, potential drug-drug interaction, or possible side effect. Therefore, in the second part of this 2-part consensus, the Taiwan Association for the Study of the Liver (TASL) proposes the treatment recommendations for the special population in order to serve as guidance to optimizing the outcome in the direct-acting antiviral (DAA) era. Special populations include patients with acute or recent HCV infection, previous DAA failure, chronic kidney disease, decompensated cirrhosis, HCC, liver and other solid organ transplantations, receiving an HCV viremic organ, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HCV dual infection, HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection, active tuberculosis infection, PWID, bleeding disorders and hemoglobinopathies, children and adolescents, and pregnancy. Moreover, future perspectives regarding the management of hepatitis C are also discussed and summarized in this consensus statement.
