Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies with high invasion and metastasis capacities. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) were evidenced to take part in the progression of multifarious cancers, including HCC. However, the role of circ_0091579 in HCC progression has not been fully described. This study aimed to explore the function of circ_0091579 and its potential regulatory mechanism in the progression of HCC. Materials and Methods: The expression of circ_0091579, microRNA-490-5p (miR-490-5p), and cancer susceptibility candidate 3 (CASC3) in HCC tissues and cells was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The circular characteristic and stability of circ_0091579 were verified by RNase R digestion and actinomycin D reaction assays. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay and Transwell assay, respectively. The level of glycolysis was evaluated by glucose consumption and lactate production. The levels of proteins were examined by Western blot. The interaction between miR-490-5p and circ_0091579 or CASC3 was certified by Dual-luciferase reporter assay. Results: circ_0091579 and CASC3 were upregulated, while miR-490-5p was downregulated in HCC tissues and cells. Silencing of either circ_0091579 or CASC3 suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and glycolysis in HCC cells. Moreover, miR-490-5p was verified to directly bind to circ_0091579 and CASC3. Circ_0091579 upregulated CASC3 by sponging miR-490-5p in HCC cells to promote cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. Conclusion: circ_0091579 promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and glycolysis partially through miR-490-5p/CASC3 axis in HCC cells.
