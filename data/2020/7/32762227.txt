Background:The purpose of this study is to evaluate the expression of tumor-specific growth factor (TSGF) and microRNA-214 (miR-214) in the serum of patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC) and their predictive values for the curative effect of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:A retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 87 PHC patients were treated with TACE. According to the curative effect 1 month after TACE, PHC patients were divided into disease control group (n=56) and disease progression group (n=31). The expression levels of TSGF and miR-214 were detected by qRT-PCR before or after treatment with TACE in disease control group and disease progression group. The predictive value of TSGF and miR-214 for the efficacy of TACE were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve was drawn according to the critical value of ROC. The effect of pretreatment levels of TSGF and miR-214 was analyzed on the three-year survival rate of patients.Results:After TACE treatment, the mRNA expressive of serum TSGF were increased in progression group, while the levels of miR-214 were decreased compared with control group (PConclusions:Serum TSGF and miR-214 could be used as potential biomarkers for PHC diagnosis and prognosis.
