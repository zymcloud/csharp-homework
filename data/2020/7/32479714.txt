Objectives:Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for non-B, non-C hepatocellular carcinoma (NBNC-HCC); however, the number of diabetes mellitus patients is too large to examine tumor occurrence with periodic imaging modalities. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop a novel strategy for early detection of NBNC-HCC in diabetes mellitus patients.Patients and methods:Ninety-three diabetes mellitus patients who had a single NBNC-HCC tumor less than 2 cm in diameter were selected from 6789 HCC patients. As controls, 172 tumor-free diabetes mellitus patients were enrolled. Characteristics were compared between groups. Furthermore, the efficacy of FIB4A, a new integrated score with FIB4 and alpha-fetoprotein, was analyzed as a marker for the early diagnosis of NBNC-HCC.Results:Age, percentage of males, alcohol consumption, total bilirubin, transaminases, Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase, FIB4 index, alpha-fetoprotein, and des-gamma-carboxy-prothrombin were higher in NBNC-HCC patients, whereas albumin and platelet counts were higher in the diabetes mellitus control group. Among these factors, the FIB4 index showed the highest odds ratio [OR: 20.0, 95% confidence interval (CI): 9.60-41.7] followed by alpha-fetoprotein (OR: 12.8, 95% CI: 6.53-25.4). A newly developed score, FIB4A, showed the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.959) among the factors examined. The sensitivity was 86.2% at a Youden index cutoff (3.5) and it increased to 95.4%, while keeping high specificity (70.9%) when a cutoff of 2.5 was used.Conclusion:FIB4A is a potential marker for early detection of NBNC-HCC in patients with diabetes mellitus. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings.
