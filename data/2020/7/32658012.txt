Background:Liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are common diseases in developing countries. HCC is a serious consequence of liver cirrhosis.Methods:A total of 1095 decompensated hepatic cirrhotic patients admitted to our hospital were enrolled from September 2014 to August 2019. We described the components of cirrhotic etiology. We evaluated the impact of alcohol consumption on the incidence of HCC in patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis and hepatitis C cirrhosis.Results:Among all cirrhotic patients admitted, the constituent ratios of hepatitis B cirrhosis and alcohol cirrhosis were 31.32% and 30.32%, respectively. The HCC incidence was higher in patients with hepatitis cirrhosis than in those with alcohol cirrhosis (24.2% in hepatitis B, 17.5% in hepatitis C and 3.92% in alcohol, P Conclusion:Hepatitis B and alcohol were major etiologies for cirrhotic patients. Alcohol consumption increased the incidence of HCC in patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis but not in patients with hepatitis C cirrhosis.
