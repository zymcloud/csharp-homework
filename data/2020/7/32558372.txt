Accurate diagnosis of cancer stage is inevitable for the following prognosis in patients struggling with these lesions to promote their health and survival rate. Previous studies on survival rate statistics show, in some cases, failure in cancer stage surveys in which metastasis or recurrence of the disease was not accurately prognosed. Morphology study of cancer cells advances the understanding about cancer behavior and its progression, in which, in our previous study on invasive cancer cells, fewer formations of cytoskeleton components compared to their counterparts was observed. Here it is shown that carcinomas with an occult propensity of metastasis depict a number of poorly differentiated cells with decreased amounts of cytoskeleton components in a near-well differentiated population. Force spectroscopy in conjunction with fluorescence microscopy of lung cancer, liver hepatoma, and melanoma provides a general view of these cells' architecture, leading to the conclusion that the scarce abnormal-shaped cells with low formation of structural filaments convey the high risk of metastatic potential of the tumor. The results demonstrate that force spectroscopy complements conventional diagnostic approaches by an accurate cytoskeleton assessment and can improve the following prognosis in epithelial cancers with occult metastasis risk.
