Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered to be the main cause of tumor recurrence, metastasis, and an unfavorable prognosis. Energy metabolism is closely associated with cell stemness. However, how the stemness of liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) is regulated by metabolic/oxidative stress remains poorly understood. In this study, we compare the metabolic differences between LCSCs and the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HCCLM3, and explore the relationship between metabolism and LCSC stemness. We found that LCSCs from the hepatocellular carcinoma cell HCCLM3 exhibited more robust glucose metabolism than HCCLM3, including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and pyruvate produced by glycolysis entering mitochondria for OXPHOS. Moreover, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) enhanced the LCSC stemness by upregulating OXPHOS. In contrast, Mdivi-1 reduced the levels of OXPHOS and weakened the stemness by inhibiting mitochondrial fission. Together, our findings clarify the relationship between energy metabolism and LCSC stemness and may provide theoretical guidance and potential therapeutic approaches for liver cancer.
