Background:The prognosis of young and older patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial. We aim to compare the clinicopathological features and prognosis of young (age ≤40 years) versus older patients (aged >40 years) with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC after curative resection.Methods:A total of 4504 patients with HBV-related HCC who underwent curative resection were included in this study and divided into young group (n=699) and older group (n=3805). Subgroup analyses were conducted to compare. Independent risk factors were identified by Cox regression analysis.Results:Young patients had better ALBI grade, lower rates of liver cirrhosis, higher rates of elevated serum AFP levels, larger tumor size, higher rates of microvascular invasion and macrovascular invasion, higher rates of Edmondson grade III-IV, lower rates of tumor capsular, more advanced AJCC TNM stages and more advanced BCLC stages than older patients (All pConclusion:Young patients had better liver function, more aggressive tumor characteristics, and worse prognosis than older patients. A tumor size of ≥5 cm and macrovascular invasion were associated with poor OS and RFS in young patients. If tumors could be detected at the early stage by more frequent surveillance, long-term survival can be expected in the young patients.
