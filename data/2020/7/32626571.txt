Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most malignant tumor types and has a high incidence and mortality. Many miRNAs play important roles in the development of HCC. Identification of these miRNAs and their targets is increasingly urgent for a better understandingof miRNA function in both physiological and pathological contexts. Many studies have shown that the expression of let-7 is often downregulated in the process of tumorigenesis, suggesting that let-7 may participate in this process as an oncogene.Methods:Immunochemistry staining was used to observe the expression of let-7b in HCC tissues. A CCK-8 assay was employed to detect the role of let-7b in the proliferation of HCC cells. The cell cycle of HCC cells was examined by flow cytometry. BALB/c nu/nu mice were used to detect the tumorigenesis potential of HCC cells; western blot and real-time PCR were employed to observe the expression of p21 in HCC cells.Results:In our previous studies investigating HCC tissue samples obtained from the national tissue samples bank of liver cancer in Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, we found one abnormal expression of miRNA (let-7b), which was significantly downregulated in HCC tissue. In the current work, we studied the relationship between let-7b and HCC to potentially provide invaluable information for developing novel therapeutic strategies for treating HCC. Based on our findings, let-7b expression was absent in HCC tumors, and its lower expression was associated with poor prognosis of HCC. In further experiments, we found that let-7b inhibited HCC cell proliferation through upregulation of p21.Conclusion:The results of our study suggested that let-7b might inhibit the proliferation of HCC cells by upregulating p21.
