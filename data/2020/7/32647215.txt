Immunotherapy is a novel treatment approach for cancers; however, its therapeutic effects are impeded by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). This study aimed to determine how MDSCs are expanded in cancer hosts. MDSCs were positive for Gr-1 and CD11b. Hepa1-6 hepatoma cells, EL4 lymphoma cells, and mice bearing Hepa1-6 hepatoma or lymphoma were examined. Following the inoculation of Hepa1-6 cells into the flanks of mice, a linear correlation was evident between the frequency of MDSCs in the spleen and tumor sizes. MDSC numbers diminished gradually and returned to the normal level within 3 weeks if the tumors were excised. To identify the cytokines produced by tumor cells that allowed expansion of MDSCs, cytokines in Hepa1-6 cell culture medium and murine serum were examined using a cytokine array. Stem cell factor (SCF) was implicated as the relevant cytokine. When recombinant SCF was added to the spleen cell culture medium, MDSC expansion could occur. In the presence of c-kit blockade, this effect of SCF was partially reversed. In conclusion, MDSCs can be expanded in tumor cells in a process that involves SCF released by tumor cells.
