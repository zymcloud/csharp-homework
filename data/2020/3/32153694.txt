Ablative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma is standard of care in selected settings and is endorsed by international societal guidelines. Centrally located hepatocellular carcinoma are difficult to treat due to their proximity to vasculature and central bile ducts. Irreversible electroporation is a nonthermal ablation modality that has been shown to preserve the extracellular matrix and is less likely to damage structures such as bile ducts and is not susceptible to vascular heat sink. Successful irreversible electroporation requires the parallel placement of probes which can be prevented by ribs or the sternum. This case report describes the use of the coaxial bone biopsy system to enable transchondral access and facilitate parallel placement of probes during irreversible electroporation IRE for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
