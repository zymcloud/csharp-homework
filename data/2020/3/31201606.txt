Purpose:As a novel immune-nutritional biomarker, the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score has been reported to predict outcomes in cancer patients. We aimed to elucidate the prognostic value of preoperative CONUT score and construct a CONUT score-based nomogram to predict individual survival of patients with hepatitis B viral (HBV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative hepatectomy.Methods:Preoperative CONUT score was retrospectively calculated in 380 HBV-associated HCC patients undergoing radical resection between 2006 and 2012. Patients were assigned to two groups: CONUT-low ( Results:The CONUT score exhibited a higher area under the curve value than the other immune-nutritional parameters. The CONUT-high group had significant poorer OS and recurrence-free survival compared with CONUT-low group (P Conclusions:Preoperative CONUT score is an effective independent predictor of OS in patients with resected HBV-related HCC. This novel nomogram based on CONUT may provide accurate and individualized survival prediction for HCC patients undergoing surgical resection.
