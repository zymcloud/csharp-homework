Objective: To observe the safety and efficacy of lenvatinib for the treatment of medium-advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: A total of 36 patients with medium-advanced hepatocellular carcinoma from the First Medical Center of the Chinese PLA General Hospital were retrospectively analyzed from January 2018 to May 2019. All patients had shown tumor progression after at least 2 sessions of TACE. The patients were consisted of 30 males and 6 females with age range of 35 to 76 (54±10) years. Patients received orally administered lenvatinib at a dose of 12 mg once daily for patients ≥ 60 kg and 8 mg once daily for patients<60 kg. According to modified RECIST criteria the tumor response, disease control rate, overall survival and progression free survival were evaluated once every 6-8 weeks. The adverse events were recorded. Results: No patient was in complete response, 2 cases (5.7%) in partial response, and 5 cases (14.3%) in stable disease, respectively. Disease control rate was 20.0% (7/35), the overall survival was 11.5 months, and the progression free survival was 5.3 months. The overall incidence of adverse events was 66.7% (24/36). The most frequent adverse events were hypertension, proteinuria, hand-foot skin reaction and abdominal distension. Conclusion: Lenvatinib can extend the overall survival in a percentage of medium-advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients who were unresectable and refractory to TACE. Although the incidence of adverse events is high, most of them are mild and reversible.
