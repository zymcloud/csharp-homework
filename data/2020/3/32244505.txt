Clinically, there is an urgent need to identify new therapeutic strategies for selectively treating cancer cells. One of the directions in this research is the development of biocompatible therapeutics that selectively target cancer cells. Here, we show that novel aminated graphene oxide (haGO-NH2) nanoparticles demonstrate increased toxicity towards human hepatocellular cancer cells compared to pristine graphene oxide(GO). The applied novel strategy for amination leads to a decrease in the size of haGO-NH2 and their zeta potential, thus, assuring easier penetration through the cell membrane. After characterization of the biological activities of pristine and aminated GO, we have demonstrated strong cytotoxicity of haGO-NH2 toward hepatic cancer cells - HepG2 cell line, in a dose-dependent manner. We have presented evidence that the cytotoxic effects of haGO-NH2 on hepatic cancer cells were due to cell membrane damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Intrinsically, our current study provides new rationale for exploiting aminated graphene oxide as an anticancer therapeutic.
