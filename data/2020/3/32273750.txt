Purpose:To identify risk factors for pain after transarterial chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:In this retrospective study, a total of 118 consecutive patients who underwent DEB-TACE between June 2016 and May 2019 with post-TACE pain were included. The patients were divided into three groups based on the severity of post-TACE pain according to the distribution of pain Visual Analogue Scale/Score (VAS). Potential risk factors for post-TACE pain were primarily analyzed using the chi-square test, one-way analysis of variance, or Kruskal-Wallis test (if appropriate). For multivariate analysis, an ordinal logistic regression model was utilized. Variables with PResults:The univariate analysis showed that elderly patients or patients with portal venous tumor thrombus (PVTT) were more likely to have severe post-TACE pain than young patients or those without PVTT (P=0.028 and Conclusion:Nonsuperselective chemoembolization and PVTT are independent risk factors for pain after DEB-TACE. Therefore, these factors should be taken into full consideration for the relief of pain.
