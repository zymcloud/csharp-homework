Background: Irisin/fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) has important effects on breast cancer and liver cancer, however, its role in osteosarcoma is poorly understood. This study explored the effects of irisin/FNDC5 in osteosarcoma cells, aiming to provide a direction for treating osteosarcoma. Material and Methods: The expression levels of irisin/FNDC5 in serums and tissues of osteosarcoma patients and the expression characteristics of FNDC5 in osteosarcoma cell lines were measured. The effects of irisin, at different concentrations (0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 ng/mL), and FNDC5 on the viability, migration, and invasion of U2OS cells were analyzed. The target gene regulating FNDC5 was predicted, and its effects on irisin/FNDC5 and osteosarcoma cells were further explored. Results: The authors found that irisin/FNDC5 was significantly downregulated in the serums and tissues of osteosarcoma patients, and FNDC5 was also lowly expressed in osteosarcoma cell lines, especially in U2OS cells. Irisin/FNDC5 could not only inhibit the viability of U2OS cell in a concentration- and time-dependent manner but could also suppress cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, miR-214-3p inhibited the expression of irisin/FNDC5, and promoted the migration, invasion, and epithelial/mesenchymal transition (EMT) of U2OS cell through targeting FNDC5. Conclusions: Irisin/FNDC5 could inhibit the viability, migration, invasion, and EMT of osteosarcoma cells, and miR-214-3p could target FNDC5 to release its antitumor effects. Thus, irisin/FNDC5 and miR-214-3p might become a new direction for the treatment of osteosarcoma patients in the future.
