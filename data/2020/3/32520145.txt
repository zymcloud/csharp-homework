Objective:Malignant liver tumors are the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 75-85% of these. Most patients are diagnosed at incurable stages. Palliative care is the appropriate treatment course in these circumstances (chemoembolization and sorafenib). There are few national studies on sorafenib. The objective is to evaluate survival predictors of HCC patients treated with sorafenib and evaluate the compliance of its indication in relation to BCLC recommendations.Methods:A total of 88 patients with an indication of sorafenib from 2010 to 2017 at the ISCMSP were retrospectively analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyzes were performed in the search for predictors of survival.Results:The mean age was 61.2 years, 70.5% were men, most were classified as Child-Pugh A (69.3%), and BCLC C (94.3%). Cirrhosis was present in 84.6% and portal hypertension in 55.7%. Hepatitis C virus was the most common etiology (40.9%). Sixty-nine (78.4%) patients received the medication, with the average duration of treatment being 9.7 months. The mean overall survival was 16.8 months. Significant differences were observed in the multivariate analysis: ECOG PS (p = 0.024): Child-Pugh (p = 0.013), time of medication use (p Conclusion:Absence of portal thrombosis, Child-Pugh A, longer time of medication use, ECOG PS 0, and absence of suspension due to clinical worsening were predictors of better overall survival in the study. The drug's indication complies with BCLC guidelines in 94% of patients.
