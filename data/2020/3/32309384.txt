Background:To evaluate the feasibility of predicting tumor recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after curative hepatectomy by detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) through droplet digital PCR (ddPCR).Methods:HCC patients receiving surgical treatment were enrolled and peripheral blood samples before and after hepatectomy were collected. Four hotspot mutants, TP53-rs28934571 (c.747G>T), TRET-rs1242535815 (c.1-124C>T), CTNNB1-rs121913412 (c.121A>G) and CTNNB1-rs121913407 (c.133T>C) were selected to detect ctDNA and the mutant allele frequency (MAF) was calculated accordingly. The matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were used for Sanger sequencing. The clinicopathologic information of the patients was retrospectively analyzed and the predictive abilities for postoperative recurrence of different clinicopathologic parameters and ctDNA were compared.Results:Eighty-one patients were enrolled and 70.4% (57/81) of them had detectable ctDNA before hepatectomy. Positive preoperative ctDNA status was related to larger tumor size (P=0.001), multiple tumor lesions (P=0.001), microvascular invasion (MVI) (PConclusions:Digital droplets PCR assessment of specific gene combination through ctDNA possesses potential prognostic value in HCC patients undergoing surgical treatment.
