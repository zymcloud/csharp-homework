Background:Many patients are not candidates for liver transplant for non-tumor-related reasons including medical comorbidities and non-adherence. The prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are not liver transplant candidates in the era of locoregional therapy (LRT) including y90 is not well defined.Aims:This study seeks to evaluate outcomes and the natural history of early-stage HCC in patients who were denied liver transplant listing due to non-tumor reasons and instead were treated with LRT.Methods:A retrospective evaluation was performed for all patients who completed liver transplant evaluation with their tumor within Milan criteria but were denied due to non-tumor reasons and were treated with LRT at a single tertiary referral center.Results:The 61 patients included had a favorable overall survival, with a median survival 60.3 months (86.9% at 1 year and 52.7% at 5 years). Patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis (n = 34) had significantly longer overall survival compared to those with Child-Pugh B/C cirrhosis (median survival of 70.3 months versus 26.1 months, p = 0.005). Survival in patients with Child-Pugh A at 1, 3, and 5 years was 97%, 80%, and 73%, respectively, compared to 74%, 41%, and 31% in patients with Child-Pugh B/C.Conclusions:In a small single-center cohort, patients with HCC who were denied liver transplant due to non-tumor reasons and underwent LRT and had Child-Pugh A cirrhosis had survival approaching the national average for patients who undergo liver transplantation. Patients with Child-Pugh B/C cirrhosis had significantly worse outcomes than those with Child-Pugh A.
