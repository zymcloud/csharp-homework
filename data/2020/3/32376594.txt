Virtual resection of liver structures guided by three-dimensional visualization technology (3DVT) has been extensively used in China. This technique provides a safe and effective method for accurate diagnosis of liver tumors and has important applications in preoperative evaluation, surgical planning and intraoperative guidance of liver cancer surgeries. The technical advantages and clinical significance of 3DVT in the diagnosis and treatment of complex liver tumors have been recognized. In order to standardize the application of 3DVT in the precision diagnosis and treatment of complex liver tumors, this guideline provides explanations and recommendations in the following aspects: (1) the establishment of homogenization processing and quality control system of 3D reconstruction; (2) the establishment of 3D reconstructed models of abdominal organs and lesions; (3) the individualized classification and quantitative analysis of blood vessels based on 3DVT; (4) 3DVT-based classification and grading of hepatic vessels in complex hepatic tumors; (5) evaluation system for surgery evaluation after reconstruction of the 3D visualization model; (6) application of 3D printing in complex hepatectomy; (7) virtual reality technology; (8) ICG fluorescence imaging; (9) multi-modal images for real-time navigation; (10) three-dimensional visualization to guide the preoperative surgical planning of precision hepatectomy; (11) application of 3DVT guidance in other therapeutic methods of hepatocellular carcinoma; (12) application of 3DVT in follow-up evaluation of the patients after liver cancer surgeries. 3DVT for visualization of the liver structures has important clinical values for accurate preoperative evaluation, preoperative planning and surgical navigation of complex liver tumors, and it facilitates precision surgeries to improve the outcomes and promote postoperative recovery of the patients.
