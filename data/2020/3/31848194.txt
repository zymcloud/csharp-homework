Natural killer (NK) cells are enriched within the liver. Apart from conventional NK (cNK) cells, recent studies identified a liver-resident NK (LrNK) subset, which constitutes about half of hepatic NK cells and exhibits distinct developmental, phenotypic, and functional features. However, it remains unclear whether and how LrNK cells, as well as cNK cells, participate in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) individually. Here, we report that both LrNK and cNK cells are significantly decreased in HCC. The T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (Tim-3) was significantly upregulated in both tumor-infiltrating LrNK and cNK cells and suppressed their cytokine secretion and cytotoxic activity. Mechanistically, phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) engagement promoted phosphorylation of Tim-3, which then competed with PI3K p110 to bind p85, inhibiting downstream Akt/mTORC1 signaling and resulting in malfunctioning of both NK-cell subsets. Tim-3 blockade retarded HCC growth in a NK-cell-dependent manner. These studies for the first time report the presence and dysfunction of LrNK cells in HCC and show that Tim-3-mediated PI3K/mTORC1 interference is responsible for the dysfunction of both tumor-infiltrating cNK and LrNK cells, providing a new strategy for immune checkpoint-based targeting. SIGNIFICANCE: Tim-3 enhances hepatocellular carcinoma growth by blocking natural killer cell function.
