Thirteen new withanolide aglycones, baimantuoluolines L-X (1-13) and one new withanolide glycoside, baimantuoluoside J (14) were isolated from Datura metel L. flowers. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by the detailed analysis of 1D and 2D NMR techniques and mass spectrometry, together with the closely related literatures. Meanwhile, all isolated compounds were evaluated for their immunosuppressive activities against mice splenocyte proliferation and antiproliferative activities against human gastric adenocarcinoma cells (SGC-7901), human hepatoma (HepG2), and human breast cancer (MCF-7) in vitro. It was found that compounds 1-14 showed obvious immunosupressive effects and some of them have moderated antiproliferative activities.
