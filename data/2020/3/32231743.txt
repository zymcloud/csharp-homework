Background: For high morbidity rate but lack of early accurate screening, hepatocellular cancer (HCC) manifests as the fourth leading cause of cancer related death worldwide. Accumulating evidence demonstrated that a series of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) have strong association with pathogenesis and clinical evaluation of HCC. LINC01554, one kind of lncRNA, has been found specifically enriched in liver tissue. However, the relationship between LINC01554 expression and HCC tumorigenesis remains unclear. Methods: The relative LINC01554 expression was measured in HCC tissues of 138 patients and several HCC cell lines using quantitative real-time PCR. Patients were grouped according to individual LINC01554 expression. Then, the potential association between LINC01554 expression in HCC tissues and clinical characteristics as well as prognostic information of patients was evaluated. Results: Compared to correspongding adjacent liver tissues, the LINC01554 expression in HCC was significantly down-regulated (P=0.001). And its expression levels in HCC cell lines were also remarkably lower than that in normal human hepatocyte cell line (P<0.001). Besides, the expression level of LINC01554 was significantly related to tumor size, multiple lesions, TNM stages, tumor recurrence rate as well as long-term survival in HCC patients (P<0.05). Conclusion: The research revealed that LINC01554 was down-regulated in HCC and it could be used for the accurate diagnosis and prognostic prediction of HCC patients.
