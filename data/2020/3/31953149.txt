Background:Biomarkers in non-colorectal gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) are still limited.Methods:Data were prospectively collected from a discovery cohort (n = 53) and a validation cohort (n = 107) in patients with non-colorectal GI cancer receiving ICB, as well as a chemotherapy-only cohort (n = 171). System inflammatory markers and derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) were determined as biomarkers by univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:A higher level of dNLR (cutoff = 3) was associated with shorter overall survival (OS) in discovery and validation cohorts. In pooled cohort, disease control rate (DCR) (28% vs. 48.1%) was associated with dNLR (p = .017). In univariate analysis, original tumor site, tumor histopathology, number of metastases, and dNLR were correlated with OS. In multivariate analysis, higher dNLR level was correlated with reduced OS (10.43 months vs. 4.20 months, p < .001). In chemotherapy-only cohort, dNLR was also correlated with DCR and OS.Conclusion:Higher dNLR level was correlated with worse outcomes, suggesting that dNLR may help risk-group stratification and assist disease management strategies as a prognostic biomarker for non-colorectal GI patients receiving ICB.
