The study aimed to compare the tumor response to and complications of doxorubicin-eluting CalliSphere bead-transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) using small- and medium-sized beads in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent multiple rounds of oncology therapies. Sixty patients with intermediate stage HCC who had previously received multiple oncology therapies underwent DEB-TACE with CalliSpheres of 100-300 μm (small bead group, n = 34) or 300-500 μm (medium bead group, n = 26) in diameter between October 2016 and December 2018. Adverse events and the response rate of the index tumor based on the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors at 3 months post-TACE were compared between the groups. The rates of complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease were 35.4%, 29.4%, 17.6%, and 17.6%, respectively, for the small bead group and 33.1%, 23.1%, 20.8%, and 23.0%, respectively, for the medium bead group, showing no significant between-group differences (P > 0.05). Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 grade 3/4 adverse events were reported in 8 patients in the small bead group and in no patients in the medium bead group, showing a significant group difference (P
