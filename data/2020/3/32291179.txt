Background:HMex-3A, an RNA-binding protein, was found to be associated with tumorigenesis. However, the roles of hMex-3A in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression remained unclear.Methods:The different expression of hMex-3A between HCC tissues and non-tumor tissues were evaluated using The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Thereafter, the hMex-3A expression was evaluated in HCC tissues using Western blotting and qRT-PCR. Immunohistochemistry was performed to investigate the association between hMex-3A level and clinicopathological features including prognosis in HCC patients. In addition, we used si-hMex-3A to knockdown hMex-3A in HCC cells to test Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, cell migration and invasion.Results:The hMex-3A expression was significantly elevated in HCC tissues. Analysis of the clinicopathological parameters suggested that hMex-3A expression was significantly associated with pathological grade (P = 0.019) and TNM stage (P = 0.001) in HCC. Moreover, univariate and multivariate Cox-regression analyses revealed that high hMex-3A expression (HR=1.491, 95% CI: 1.107-2.007; P = 0.009) was an independent risk factor for overall survival in HCC patients. Finally, we confirmed that si-hMex-3A could significantly inhibit HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro.Conclusions:HMex-3A may contribute to the progression of HCC and might be used as a novel therapeutic target and prognostic marker in HCC.
