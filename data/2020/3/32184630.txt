Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. LINC00460, a novel long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), was recently confirmed as an oncogene in various cancers. However, the biological function and underlying mechanism of LINC00460 in HCC is largely obscure.Methods:Fifty pairs of tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissues from HCC patients, as well as six HCC cell lines and a normal human hepatic epithelial cell line were subjected to qRT-PCR assay to evaluate the expression levels of LINC00460. CCK-8 assays were used to detect the proliferation of HCC cells. Transwell assay was used to measure the migration and invasion abilities of HCC cells. RNA pull-down and luciferase assays were performed to verify the direct interaction between LINC00460 and miR-342-3p. A xenograft model of HCC was established to validate the in vivo function of LINC00460 in HCC progression.Results:We firstly detected LINC00460 expression was significantly upregulated in both HCC tumor tissues and cell lines. The upregulation of LINC00460 was positively associated with HCC progression. Functionally, LINC00460 facilitated HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion capacities, which due to that LINC00460 could physically bind to and repress miR-342-3p to elevate the expression of AGR2.Conclusion:Our data firstly reveal the clinical relevance, biological function, and regulatory mechanism of LINC00460 in HCC development. LINC00460 promotes HCC progression by elevating AGR2 expression via sponging miR-342-3p, providing a promising therapeutic target for HCC treatment.
