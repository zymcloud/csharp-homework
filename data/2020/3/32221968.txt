Background and aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death that develops as a consequence of obesity, cirrhosis, and chronic hepatitis. However, the pathways along which these changes occur remain incompletely understood.Approach and results:In this study, we show that the deubiquitinase USP30 is abundant in HCCs that arise in mice maintained on high-fat diets. IKKÎ² phosphorylated and stabilized USP30, which promoted USP30 to deubiquitinate ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) and fatty acid synthase (FASN). IKKÎ² also directly phosphorylated ACLY and facilitated the interaction between USP30 and ACLY and the latter's deubiquitination. In HCCs arising in DEN/CCl4 -treated mice, USP30 deletion attenuated lipogenesis, inflammation, and tumorigenesis regardless of diet. The combination of ACLY inhibitor and programmed death ligand 1 antibody largely suppressed chemical-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. The IKKÎ²-USP30-ACLY axis was also found to be up-regulated in human HCCs.Conclusions:This study identifies an IKKÎ²-USP30-ACLY axis that plays an essential and wide-spread role in tumor metabolism and may be a potential therapeutic target in HCC.
