Background:Current guidelines lack recommendations for the use of immunotherapy and immune-related biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aim to provide reliable evidence of the association of survival with HCC immunotherapy and to demonstrate that genomic mutation signature could be an effective biomarker to predict immunotherapy efficacy of HCC patients.Methods:We conducted a meta-analysis of 17 randomized trials with 2055 patients and an individual patient-level analysis of 31 patients. Trial data were identified in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Central library, and individual patient data were obtained from the cBioPortal database. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed with the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018083991.Results:The meta-analysis showed that compared to conventional therapy, immunotherapy resulted in prolonged OS (HR =0.65, PConclusions:Immunotherapy showed longer OS and PFS than conventional therapy among HCC patients, especially patients with a low mutation risk score. The nomogram based on genomic and clinical characteristics is effective in predicting survival of HCC patients undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor.
