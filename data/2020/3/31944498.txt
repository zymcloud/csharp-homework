Secondary malignancies are a significant cause of non-relapse mortality in patients who undergo allogeneic HCT. However, secondary liver cancer is rare, and ICC following HCT has never been reported in the literature. Secondary solid cancers typically have a long latency period, and cholangiocarcinoma is classically a malignancy occurring in older individuals. Here, we report the first case of secondary ICC, which presented just 3 years after HCT in a young adult with a history of childhood ALL. A 26-year-old male with history of precursor B-cell ALL presented with asymptomatic elevated liver function tests 3 years after HCT. Laboratories were indicative of biliary obstruction. ERCP showed focal biliary stricturing of the common and left hepatic ducts. MRCP revealed left intrahepatic duct dilatation, suggestive of intrahepatic obstructing mass. Additional workup lead to a clinical diagnosis of ICC. The patient underwent left hepatectomy with extrahepatic bile duct resection and portal lymphadenectomy. Surgical pathology was consistent with moderately differentiated cholangiocarcinoma. Our case illustrates a rare SMN following HCT for ALL. It is the first case report of ICC occurring as a secondary cancer in this patient population. Although cholangiocarcinoma is characteristically diagnosed in the older population, it must remain on the differential for biliary obstruction in post-HCT patients.
