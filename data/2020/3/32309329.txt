Background:Compared with 2D evaluation, 3D evaluation possesses the virtues of displaying spatial anatomy of intrahepatic blood vessels and its relations to tumors, and enabling calculation of liver volumes, thus facilitating preoperative surgery planning.Methods:The objective of this study is to study whether preoperative 3D (three-dimensional) evaluation produced better long-term overall survival (OS) outcomes compared to the traditional 2D (two-dimensional) evaluation in patients who underwent major hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This retrospective study matched patients who underwent preoperative 2D evaluation with those who underwent preoperative 3D evaluation in a 1:1 ratio using propensity score matching. The primary endpoints were long-term survival outcomes in the two groups after major hepatectomy for HCC.Results:Of the 248 patients in each of the 2 matched groups, the baseline characteristics were comparable. The median follow-up for all patients was 36 months (range, 0-40 months). The 3-year OS of patients in the PSM cohort was 38.5%. Compared with the 2D Group, patients in the 3D Group had a better OS rate (HR 0.722, 95% CI: 0.556-0.938, P=0.015) and disease-free survival (DFS) rate (HR 0.741, 95% CI: 0.590-0.929, P=0.009). The 3-year OS and DFS rate for the 3D Group versus the 2D group were 58.9% and 44.0% versus 47.4% and 33.1%, respectively.Conclusions:3D preoperative evaluation resulted in significantly better intermediate-term (3-year) overall survival rate than the traditional 2D evaluation.
