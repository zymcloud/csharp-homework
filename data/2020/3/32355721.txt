Background:Whether anesthesia methods affect the prognosis of tumor patients is controversial. With the aim of comparing the effects of general anesthesia (GA) and local anesthesia (LA) in primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients presenting for elective thermal ablation (TA) surgeries, a multiple center retrospective cohort study was designed and implemented.Methods:Patients who received elective TA surgery under GA or LA from Jan. 2014 to Dec. 2016 and met the eligibility criteria were included. Survival analysis was used to identify the influence of anesthesia methods on recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to minimize the bias between the GA group and the LA group.Results:A total of 244 patients with GA and 245 with LA were eligible for analysis. After PSM, 178 patients remained in each group. In the matched groups, GA showed a significantly higher recurrence rate compared with LA by both the Kaplan-Meier survival analyses (P=0.011) and multivariable Cox regression analyses (P=0.002). The multivariable Cox regression model also revealed that GA had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.746 (P=0.036) for death compared with the LA group.Conclusions:GA is associated with decreased RFS and OS after surgery compared with LA in HCC patients undergoing TA surgery. Prospective trials exploring the effects of different anesthetic methods on cancer outcome in these patients are warranted.
