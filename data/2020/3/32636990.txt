Hepatocellular adenomas are benign liver tumours that occur mainly but not exclusively in young women taking contraceptives. Their malignant transformation into hepatocellular carcinoma is a rare complication that has been rarely reported in women taking contraceptives. The purpose of our work is to remind the epidemiological and diagnostic features of malignant transformation of hepatic adenomas by reporting the case of a hepatocellular carcinoma developed from a hepatocellular adenoma diagnosed within the Pathology Department of the Mohammed VI university hospital of Oujda.
Hepatocellular adenoma; hepatocellular carcinoma; malignant transformation.
