Background and aims:Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/United Network for Organ Sharing (OPTN/UNOS) policy mandates a 6-month waiting period before exception scores are granted to liver transplant candidates with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aims to evaluate wait-list and posttransplant outcomes in patients with HCC, before and after implementation of the 6-month waiting rule.Approach and results:We examined two groups from the UNOS registry: Group 1 (pre-6-month rule) consisted of patients registered as transplant candidates with HCC from January 1, 2013, to October 7, 2015 (n = 4,814); group 2 (post-6-month rule) consisted of patients registered from October 8, 2015, to June 30, 2018 (n = 3,287). As expected, the transplant probability was higher in the first 6 months after listing in group 1 than group 2 at 42.0% versus 6.3% (P Conclusions:The HCC policy change was associated with decreased wait-list mortality/dropout and increased transplant probability. The policy helped to decrease but did not eliminate regional disparities in transplant opportunity without an effect on posttransplant outcomes.
