The patient was a 67-year-old man. At the age of 60, he underwent resection of thymic carcinoma with partial resection of the right upper lobe of the lung because of invasive thymic carcinoma. The pathological diagnosis was Masaoka stage â…¢ squamous cell carcinoma. Follow-up examination 2 years after surgery showed metastases to the mediastinall ymph node and liver. After undergoing radiotherapy of 50 Gy to the mediastinal lymph node metastasis, partial hepatectomy was performed for metastatic liver cancer. Post-operation, he received 4 courses of combination therapy of carboplatin and paclitaxel. Five years post-hepatectomy, the patient developed liver metastasis again and underwent hepatectomy for local control. Postoperative recurrent cases of thymic carcinoma generally have poor prognosis. We describe a patient with thymic carcinoma of postoperative liver and mediastinal lymph node metastases who achieved long-term survival through multidisciplinary treatment.
