Rap2B, belonging to the Ras superfamily of small guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins, is upregulated and contributes to the progression of several tumors by acting as an oncogene, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanism underlying the functional roles of Rap2B in HCC remains unclear. In this study, the evaluation of Rap2B expression in HCC cells and tissues was achieved by qRT-PCR and western blot assays. The effects of Rap2B on the malignant biological behaviors in HCC were explored by means of MTT assay, flow cytometry analysis, and Transwell invasion assay, respectively. Protein levels of Ki67, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and cleaved caspase-3, together with the alternations of the ERK1/2 and PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathways were qualified by western blot assay. Further verification of the Rap2B function on HCC tumorigenesis was attained by performing in vivo assays. We found that Rap2B levels were upregulated in HCC tissues and cells. Rap2B silencing led to a reduction of cell-proliferative and invasive abilities, and an increase of apoptosis in HCC cells. In addition, xenograft tumor assay demonstrated that Rap2B silencing repressed HCC xenograft tumor growth in vivo. In addition, we found that Rap2B knockdown significantly inhibited the ERK1/2 and PTEN/PI3K/Akt cascades in HCC cells and xenograft tumor tissues. Together, Rap2B knockdown inhibited HCC-malignant progression, which was involved in inhibiting the ERK1/2 and PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathways. Our findings contribute to understanding of the molecular mechanism of Rap2B in HCC progression.
