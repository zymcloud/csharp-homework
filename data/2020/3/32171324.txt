Background:Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is associated with high morbidity and ranks sixth among malignancies worldwide. Increasing evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) play a critical role in regulating cancer stem cells (CSCs), which drive the proliferation and spread of OSCC. Therefore, based on the alteration of aberrantly expressed miR-495 and homeobox C6 (HOXC6) by Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) analysis, we subsequently explore the potential effect of miR-495 on the progression of CSCs in OSCC.Methods:After the isolation of CSCs from the clinical tissue samples of OSCC patients, the expression of miR-495 and HOXC6 was determined, followed by the validation of the relationship between miR-495 and HOXC6. Subsequently, gain- and loss-function approach was performed to detect the role of miR-495 and HOXC6 in cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle entry, apoptosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CSCs in OSCC, as well as the tumor growth in vivo.Results:HOXC6 was highly expressed while miR-495 was poorly expressed in OSCC. HOXC6 was verified to be a target gene of miR-495, and miR-495 could inhibit the activation of the TGF-β signaling pathway. CSCs with miR-495 overexpression or HOXC6 silencing exhibited reversed EMT process; reduced abilities of proliferation, migration, and invasion; and promoted cell apoptosis in vitro. Moreover, inhibited tumor growth was observed in vivo after injection with miR-495 agomir or sh-HOXC6. In contrast, the downregulation of miR-495 showed an induced role in the progression of OSCC.Conclusion:These findings suggest that miR-495 may suppress HOXC6 to inhibit EMT, proliferation, migration, and invasion while promoting apoptosis of CSCs in OSCC by inhibiting the TGF-β signaling pathway.
