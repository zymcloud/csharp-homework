Actin filament-associated protein 1 antisense RNA 1 (AFAP1-AS1), a long non-coding RNA transcribed from the antisense strand of protein coding gene AFAP1, has attracted attention in cancer research. Despite, its biological function and regulatory mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma still unknown. The present study revealed AFAP1-AS1 mediated hepatocarcinoma progression through targeting CRKL. The bidirectional interaction of AFAP1-AS1 and oncogenic protein CRKL, and the deregulation of AFAP1-AS1 effects on Ras, MEK and c-Jun activities were investigated in depth. AFAP1-AS1 was upregulated in surgical tumorous tissues from hepatocarcinoma patients compared with the paired paracancerous non-tumor liver tissues, and in hepatocarcinoma Huh7, HCCLM3 and HepG2 cell lines compared with LO2, a normal liver cell line. AFAP1-AS1 knockdown noticeably suppressed the proliferative, migratory and invasive properties, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of HepG2 and HCCLM3 through upregulating E-cadherin and downregulating N-cadherin and vimentin. CRKL knockdown reduced AFAP1-AS1 expression levels in HepG2 and HCCLM3 cells. AFAP1-AS1 suppression impaired CRKL expression in HepG2 and HCCLM3. AFAP1-AS1 level change was positively correlated with the expression level changes of Ras, MEK and c-Jun in mediating the invasiveness of hepatocarcinoma cells. Current work demonstrated AFAP1-AS1 to be an applicable progression indicator of hepatocarcinoma. AFAP1-AS1 probably promotes the proliferation, EMT progression and metastasis of hepatocarcinoma cells via CRKL mediated Ras/MEK/c-Jun and cadherin/vimentin signaling pathways. AFAP1-AS1-CRKL bidirectional feedback signaling is worthy of further study on the monitoring, diagnosis and treatment of cancers.
