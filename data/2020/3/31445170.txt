Genetic aberrations in the toll-like receptor (TLR)3 pathway are associated with increased susceptibility to herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. Leucine-rich repeat and PYD-containing protein (NLRP)12 is a component of the inflammasome apparatus, which is critical to an immediate innate inflammatory response. Aberrations in NLRP12 have been shown to mediate auto-inflammation. In this study, we present a 44-year old patient with severe HSV esophagitis and Crohn's disease. An immune and genetic investigation confirmed two coinciding genetic mutations in TLR3 and NLRP12. Our findings support conducting laboratory workup that targets TLR3 pathway in the immunocompetent host developing recurrent HSV infections.
