Introduction:Because tumor-associated inflammation is a hallmark of cancer treatment, in the present study, sorafenib mesoporous silica nanomatrix (MSNM@SFN) co-administrated with flufenamic acid (FFA, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)) was investigated to enhance the anti-tumor activity of MSNM@SFN.Methods:Metastatic breast tumor 4T1/luc cells and hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells were selected as cell models. The effects of FFA in vitro on cell migration, PGE2 secretion, and AKR1C1 and AKR1C3 levels in 4T1/luc and HepG2 cells were investigated. The in vivo anti-tumor activity of MSNM@SFN co-administrating with FFA (MSNM@SFN+FFA) was evaluated in a 4T1/luc metastatic tumor model, HepG2 tumor-bearing nude mice model, and HepG2 orthotopic tumor-bearing nude mice model, respectively.Results:The results indicated that FFA could markedly decrease cell migration, PGE2 secretion, and AKR1C1 and AKR1C3 levels in both 4T1/luc and HepG2 cells. The enhanced anti-tumor activity of MSNM@SFN+FFA compared with that of MSNM@SFN was confirmed in the 4T1/luc metastatic tumor model, HepG2 tumor-bearing nude mice model, and HepG2 orthotopic tumor-bearing nude mice model in vivo, respectively.Discussion:MSNM@SFN co-administrating with FFA (MSNM@SFN+FFA) developed in this study is an alternative strategy for improving the therapeutic efficacy of MSNM@SFN via co-administration with NSAIDs.
