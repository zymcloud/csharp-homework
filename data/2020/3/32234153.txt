Objective: To explore the feasibility of short-term efficacy prognosis prediction model for HCC patients undergoing transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) based on MRI-based radiomics technique. Methods: A total of 123 patients with liver cancer who received TACE treatment in Lishui Central Hospital from June 2016 to July 2018 were retrospectively collected, including 90 males and 33 females, with an average age of 24-83 (58Â±10) years. All the patients were pathologically confirmed as hepatocellular carcinoma and underwent MRI scan before surgery.All patients were followed up 3-4 months after TACE, and further divided into training group (n=85, 42 of which were effective and 43 cases were ineffective) and the validation group (n=38, 19 of which were effective and 19 were ineffective) according to the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST). There was no statistical difference in the general information between the two groups of patients, which was comparable. Then, preoperative T(2)WI images were used for radiomics analysis, texture parameters were screened based on R language, and short-term efficacy prediction model of TACE for training group and verification group was constructed. Results: T(2)WI image analysis of each patient received 396 different texture parameters, and further used Lasso dimensionality reduction and 10 times cross-validation screening to obtain 5 characteristic texture parameters, specifically stdDeviation, ClusterProminence_angle135_offset4, Correlation_angle135_offset4, Inertia_angle135_offset4, InverseDifferenceMoment_angle45_offset4. According to the above five texture parameters and their corresponding coefficient values, the corresponding radiomics scores (Radscore) were calculated, and the prediction models of the training group and the verification group were further constructed.It was found that the area under the ROC curve of the training group was 0.812 (95%CI: 0.722-0.901), the sensitivity and specificity were 83.7% and 69.0%, respectively. The area under the ROC curve of the validation group was 0.801 (95%CI:0.654-0.947), and the sensitivity and specificity were 89.5% and 63.2%, respectively. Conclusion: The constructed TACE prediction model in the present study has high prediction accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.The short-term efficacy prognosis prediction model for HCC based on MRI is constructed, stable and reliable.
