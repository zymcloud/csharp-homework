The optimal treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is surgical resection. However, only a small percentage of patients are amenable to this option. Percutaneous radiofrequency interstitial thermal ablation (TA) proved to be effective in the treatment of unresectable HCC. Recent advances in laparoscopic ultrasound have improved the accuracy in detecting small intrahepatic HCC nodules missed by pre-operative imaging techniques. Our objective was to evaluate an operative combination of laparoscopic ultrasound with laparoscopic thermoablation (LTA) in the treatment of HCC not amenable to liver resection. The aim of our review was to evaluate the advantages and limits of the laparoscopic approach according the criteria of the evidence-based medicine. LTA of HCC proved to be a safe and effective technique both in the short- and long-term follow-up period. This technique may be indicated in selected cases when the percutaneous approach to the lesion is very difficult or contraindicated.
