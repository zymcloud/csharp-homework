Background and objectives:Tracking of the tumor progression by MSCs-based therapy is being increasingly important in evaluating relative therapy effectively. Herein, Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) technology was used to dynamically and quantitatively track the hepatocellular carcinoma suppressive effects by human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs).Methods and results:The stem cells present typical phenotypic characteristics and differentiation ability by morphology and flow cytometry analysis of marker expression. Then, the growth inhibition effect of conditioned medium and UC-MSC on H7402 cells was studied. It is found both the conditioned medium and UC-MSC can effectively decrease the proliferation of H7402 cells compared with the control group. Meanwhile, the relative migration of UC-MSC to H7402 is also increased through the transwell migration assay. In addition, a mice hepatoma tumor model was built by H7402 cells which can express a pLenti-6.3/DEST-CMV-luciferase 2-mKate2 gene. The effect of stem cells on growth inhibition of tumor in a mice transplantation model was dynamically monitored by bioluminescence imaging within 5 weeks. It has shown the bioluminescence signal intensity of the tumor model was significantly higher than that of the UC-MSC co-acting tumor model, indicating that the inhibition of UC-MSC on liver cancer resulted in low expression of bioluminescent signals.Conclusions:The microenvironment of UC-MSCs can effectively inhibit the growth of liver cancer cells, and this therapeutic effect can be dynamically and quantitatively monitored in vivo by BLI. This is of great significance for the imaging research and application of stem cells in anticancer therapy.
