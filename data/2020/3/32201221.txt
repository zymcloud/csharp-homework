Aims:To analyze the perioperative differences in a consecutive cohort of liver transplant recipients (LTRs) classified according to the indication of transplantation, and assess their impact upon early mortality 90 days after transplantation.Design:A retrospective cohort study was carried out.Scope:A single university hospital.Patients:A total of 892 consecutive adult LTRs were included from January 1995 to December 2017. Recipients with acute liver failure, retransplantation or with grafts from non-brain death donors were excluded. Two cohorts were analyzed according to transplant indication: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC-LTR) versus non-carcinoma (non-HCC-LTR).Main variables of interest:Recipient early mortality was the primary endpoint. The pretransplant recipient and donor characteristics, surgical time data and postoperative complications were analyzed as independent predictors.Results:The crude early postoperative mortality rate related to transplant indication was 13.3% in non-HCC-LTR and 6.6% in HCC-LTR (non-adjusted HR=2.12, 95%CI=1.25-3.60; p=0.005). Comparison of the perioperative features between the cohorts revealed multiple differences. Multivariate analysis showed postoperative shock (HR=2.02, 95%CI=1.26-3.24; p=0.003), early graft vascular complications (HR=4.01, 95%CI=2.45-6.56; pConclusions:The crude early postoperative mortality rate in non-HCC-LTR was higher than in HCC-LTR, due to a greater incidence of postoperative complications with an impact upon mortality (shock at admission to intensive care and the development of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome).
