Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for approximately 90% of all cases of primary liver cancer; it is the third most frequent cause of cancer-related death worldwide. In early-stage disease, surgical resection and liver transplantation are considered curative treatments. However, the majority of HCC patients present with advanced-stage disease that is treated using palliative systemic therapy. Since HCC is heterogeneous owing to its multiple etiologies, various risk factors, and inherent resistance to chemotherapy, the development of an effective systemic treatment strategy for HCC remains a considerable challenge. Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent catabolic degradation pathway that is essential for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. Autophagy dysfunction is closely linked with the pathogenesis of various cancers; therefore, the discovery of small molecules that can modulate autophagy has attracted considerable interest in the development of a systemic treatment strategy for advanced HCC. Here, we reviewed the roles of autophagy in HCC and the recent advances regarding small molecules that target autophagy regulatory mechanisms.
