Humans and rodents with Comparative Gene Identification-58 (CGI-58) mutations manifest nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Here we show that liver CGI-58 knockout (LivKO) mice fed a Western diet rapidly develop advanced NAFLD, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatic fibrosis. After 14 weeks of diet challenge, starting at 6 weeks of age, LivKO mice showed increased inflammatory cell infiltration and proinflammatory gene expression in the liver, which was associated with elevated plasma levels of aminotransferases. Hepatic ductular reactions, pericellular fibrosis, and bridging fibrosis were observed only in the LivKO mice. Consistently, the KO mice had a significant increase in hepatic mRNAs for fibrogenic genes. In addition, LivKO mice displayed massive accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs) in hepatocytes. LDs were also observed in the cholangiocytes of the LivKO mice, but not the floxed controls. Four of the five LD coat proteins, including perilipins 2, 3, 4, and 5, were increased in the CGI-58 KO liver. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of CGI-58 in Huh7 human hepatoma cells induced LD deposition and perilipin expression, suggesting a cell autonomous effect. Our findings establish the Western diet-fed LivKO mice as an animal model of NASH and hepatic fibrosis. These animals may facilitate preclinical screening of therapeutic agents that counter against NAFLD progression.
