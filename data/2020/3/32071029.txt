Purpose:We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous cryoablation (PC) for early or very early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and assess the risk factors for local tumor progression (LTP) after PC.Methods:A total of 45 treatment-naïve patients treated with PC for early or very early stage HCCs were included in this retrospective study. The safety of PC was assessed by evaluating procedure-related complications and comparing hepatic function before and after the procedure. The effectiveness was assessed by evaluating technical success, LTP rates, and disease progression (DP) rates. Prognostic factors associated with LTP after PC were also analyzed.Results:Technical success and complete response were achieved in all patients (100%) by 1 month after PC. During a mean of 28.1±15.6 months of follow-up, the incidences of LTP and DP were 11.1% and 37.8%, respectively. The LTP-free and DP-free survival rates were 93.3% and 84.4% at 1 year and 88.9% and 62.2% at 2 years, respectively. Hepatic function was normalized within 3 months after PC. There were no major complications and only one minor complication of small hematoma. On univariate and multivariate analysis, minimal ablative margin Conclusion:PC is a safe and effective therapy for patients with early or very early stage HCC. Minimal ablative margin
