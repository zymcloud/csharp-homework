Our previous study proved that celastrol was a potential candidate for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy. However, poor water solubility and toxic side effects may restrict its clinical application. To overcome these shortcomings and optimize its antitumor efficacy, we developed galactosylated liposomes using galactose-modified 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-poly(ethylene glycol) to deliver celastrol (C-GPL). C-GPL improved the water solubility of celastrol and exhibited high encapsulation efficiency, good stability in serum, and slow drug release profile. In vitro studies showed that C-GPL increased the cellular uptake of celastrol through receptor-mediated endocytosis, thereby enhancing celastrol cytotoxicity and cancer cell apoptosis. Particularly, in vivo antitumor activity of C-GPL was assessed in rapid HCC mouse models established via hydrodynamic transfection of the activated forms of AKT and c-Met. Compared to free celastrol, C-GPL significantly prevented liver weight gain, decreased liver damage biomarkers (glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase and alanine aminotransferase) and HCC marker (alpha-fetoprotein), and led to tumor disappearance on the liver surface. The improved therapeutic effect of C-GPL may be attributed to suppression of AKT activation, induction of apoptosis, and retardation of cell proliferation. Importantly, C-GPL exerted low toxicity to normal tissues without causing severe weight loss in mice. Taken together, C-GPL may become a promising drug delivery system for HCC treatment.
