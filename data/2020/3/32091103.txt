Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prominent form of presentation in liver cancer. It is also the fourth most common cause of cancer-associated deaths globally. The role of nucleus accumbens associated protein-1 (NACC-1) has been evaluated in several cancers. This protein is a transcriptional regulator that regulates a number of significant cellular processes. In the current study, we aimed to understand the role of NACC-1 in HCC. Primarily, we measured the expression of NACC-1 using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. We knocked down the expression of NACC-1 in HCC cell lines Huh7 and HepG2 by transferring a commercially synthesized small interfering RNA and explored the impact of NACC-1 knockdown on cellular growth, migration, invasion, and chemoresistance to doxorubicin. Through bioinformatic analysis, we identified NACC-1 as a potential target of miR-760. Using a dual reporter luciferase assay, we confirmed the predicted target and assessed miR-760-mediated regulation of NACC-1 and rescue of tumorigenic phenotypes. We observed increased expression of NACC-1 in HCC. Furthermore, knockdown of NACC-1 resulted in reduced cell proliferation and invasion and increased susceptibility to doxorubicin-mediated chemosensitivity. Overexpression of miR-760 in HCC cell lines rescued NACC-1-mediated migration and invasion. We revealed that miR-760 regulated NACC-1 expression in HCC. Our data indicated that both miR-760 and NACC-1 could be used as prognostic markers, and miR-760 may have therapeutic benefits for HCC and other cancers.
