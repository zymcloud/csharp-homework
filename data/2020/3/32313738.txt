Simultaneous primary cancers are rare in the oropharynx. This report describes the first reported case of a collision tumor of squamous cell and adenoid cystic carcinoma in the soft palate. The patient was immunosuppressed with a history of liver transplantation, smoking and heavy alcohol drinking. He was treated with wide local excision followed by adjuvant radiotherapy with surface acrylic mold brachytherapy. This technique was used instead of external beam radiotherapy in order to minimize toxicity. The patient tolerated the treatment well and with the only acute grade two mucositis at the soft palate and minimal late toxicity. There is no evidence of disease recurrence and the patient continues to maintain excellent quality of speech and swallowing 14 months after treatment completion.
