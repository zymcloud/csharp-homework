Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common primary liver neoplasia, represents the fifth most common malignant disease in men. Percutaneous ablation treatment is recommended among the treatments suggested for HCC patients in the very early/early stage. In the last decade, very important results in terms of survival benefits have been obtained with local ablative therapies, also outside the standard indications, thanks to many technical innovations. In particular, important results of ablation as a safe and effective technique have been obtained in the treatment of intermediate- or advanced-stage patients with HCC, and in the treatment of unfavourable tumour locations. Moreover, awareness is growing regarding the necessity of overcoming the rigidity of traditional guidelines in the treatment of HCC due to the complexity of patients with HCC, focusing on Precision Medicine. In this context, it is important to know the standard and non-standard indications of ablation in the treatment of HCC in order to offer the best therapeutic option tailored for each patient. The aim of this study was to analyse the possible clinical applications of ablative therapies for HCC patients, beyond the traditional indications recommended in the most widespread clinical practice guidelines for the management of HCC.
