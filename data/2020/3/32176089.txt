Despite many studies, the molecular mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development remain unclear. Thyroid hormone (TH) levels may vary in many chronic diseases including cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate TH status in patients with cirrhosis and HCC and to investigate the relationship between THs and HCC development.Five hundred seventy-seven patients with cirrhosis who applied to DemiroÄŸlu Bilim University, Faculty of Medicine, Gastroenterology Department between 2004 and 2019 were included the study. Three hundred sixty-seven patients who applied to Internal Medicine Unit for general health check-up were included in the study as healthy control group. Demographic, laboratory, and imaging findings of study groups were retrospectively reviewed and recorded from hospital information system.In the cirrhosis group, 252 patients had HCC (43.67%), and 325 patients had non-HCC cirrhosis (56.33%). Free thyroxine (FT4) levels were higher in the control group than in the cirrhotic group but there was no significant difference (P = .501). Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and FT4 levels were similar between groups, while free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels were significantly different between HCC group, non-HCC cirrhosis group, and control group (P = .299 for TSH, P = .263 for FT4, P
