Cell therapy and tissue engineering (TE) are considered alternative therapeutic approaches to organ transplantation. Since cell therapy approaches achieved little success for liver failure treatment, liver TE is considered a more promising alternative. In this study, we produced a liver tissue equivalent (called "liver-derived extracellular matrix scaffold [LEMS]-Patch") by co-culture of human bone marrow stromal cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and a hepatoma cell line, Huh7, within an artificial three-dimensional liver-extracellular matrix scaffold. The results showed significant increase in the liver-specific gene expression and hepatic functions, in terms of albumin (ALB) and fibrinogen secretion, urea production, and cytochrome inducibility in the LEMS-Patch compared to controls. In addition, transplanted LEMS-Patch was successfully incorporated into the recipient liver of acute liver failure mice and produced human ALB. Consequently, our data demonstrated that the generated LEMS-Patch could be used as a good platform for functional improvement of hepatic cells in vitro and in vivo.
