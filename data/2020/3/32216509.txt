Background: Recent studies implicate the role of microRNAs in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study was designed to induce HCC, in an experimental model, with the prospect to study the molecular pathophysiologic changes accompanying the development of HCC and the effect of miRNA-195 vector on the process of hepatocarcinogenesis.Methodology: This study incorporated three groups of male albino mice; one control group and two other groups injected intraperitoneal with diethylnitrosamine (DEN) weekly for 12 weeks for the gradual induction of HCC. The third group was injected intra-hepatic with miR-195 vector 1 month after DEN injection. At the 8th and 12th weeks post-DEN treatment, the tumor-associated biomarkers alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) were assessed in the serum of all mice. Hepatic specimens were subjected to ultra-structural pathological examination as well as to caspase-3 and survivin genes expression analysis.Results: All the assessed serological and molecular parameters of HCC development, in the miRNA-195-treated group of mice, showed a significant increase, versus the DEN-treated group, whereas survivin was significantly down-regulated, in the miR-195-treated group (P < 0.001). Additionally, ultra-structural criteria of HCC were depicted, in the 12th week, in DEN-injected group, versus the 8th week, in the miRNA-195-treated group.Conclusions: Intra-hepatic injection of miRNA-195 vector induced apoptotic gene expression and suppressed anti-apoptotic gene but these favorable anti-cancer effects could not counteract the inflammatory, and subsequently, the oncogenic effect probably caused by vector administration. Therefore, further studies are required to investigate the effect of miRNA in combination with anti-inflammatory medications.
