Aim:Several studies have recently reported that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence does not differ between hepatitis C virus patients receiving interferon (IFN)-based and IFN-free treatments considering the patients' backgrounds. However, liver fibrosis was not directly considered in these studies.Methods:In total, 3972 patients without a history of HCC who started IFN-based or IFN-free treatment between August 2002 and April 2017 at 30 Japanese hospitals and achieved a sustained virologic response were included. Propensity score matching considering liver histology was performed.Results:The median age and percentage of patients with advanced liver fibrosis (F3/4) were 58 years and 11.4% in the IFN-based group, and 68 years and 18.9% in the IFN-free group, respectively. The HCC occurrence rates at 1 year and 2 years were 0.4% and 1.1% in the IFN-based group, and 1.6% and 4.1% in the IFN-free group, respectively, and HCC occurrence in the IFN-free group was significantly higher than that in the IFN-based group (P Conclusions:HCC occurrence in sustained virologic response patients does not differ between IFN-based and IFN-free treatment considering liver fibrosis stage. The degree of its progress at diagnosis does not differ between the two groups.
