Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of miR-1275 rs16759, IGF2BP1 rs11079850 and IGF2BP3 rs34414305 with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk. Materials & methods: Genotyping of the rs16759 and rs11079850 was performed using a Taqman assay and genotyping of the rs34414305 was performed using PCR. Relative expression of miR-1275, IGF2BP1 and IGF2BP3 was examined using quantitative PCR. Results: Comparison of the rs16759GG, CG/GG and CC genotype showed an increased risk of HCC. When comparing G with C allele, a significantly increased risk of HCC was also found. The rs16759, rs11079850 and rs34414305 had combined the interactive effects on the carcinogenesis of HCC. Moreover, the rs34414305 Del/ATT-Del/Del carriers displayed lower levels of IGF2BP3. Conclusion: The rs16759, rs11079850 and rs34414305 may singly and interactively contribute to carcinogenesis of HCC.
