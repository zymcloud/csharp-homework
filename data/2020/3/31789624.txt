Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complicated and poor prognosis cancer, necessitating the development of a potential treatment strategy. In this study, we initially revealed that LukS-PV belonged to leukocidin family performs an anti-HCC action. Then, we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) to compare protein expression profiles of the LukS-PV-treated human HCC cell lines HepG2 and the control cells. GO annotations and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis were carried out of differential expression followed by protein-protein interactome, to explore the underlying cancer suppressor mechanisms of LukS-PV for human HCC. A total of 88 upregulated proteins and 46 downregulated proteins were identified. The top 10 proteins identified by the MCC method are FN1, APP, TIMP1, nucleobindin-1, GOLM1, APLP2, CYR61, CD63, ENG, and CD9. Our observation on protein expression indicated that LukS-PV produces a signature affecting central carbon metabolism in cancer, galactose metabolism, and fructose and mannose metabolism pathways. The results give a functional effects and molecular mechanism insight, following LukS-PV treatment.
