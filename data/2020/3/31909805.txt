The risk of cancer due to exposure to ionizing radiation is higher in infants than in adults. In a previous study, the effect of adult-onset calorie restriction (CR) on carcinogenesis in mice after early-life exposure to X-rays was examined (Shang, Y, Kakinuma, S, Yamauchi, K, et al. Cancer prevention by adult-onset calorie restriction after infant exposure to ionizing radiation in B6C3F1 male mice. Int J Cancer. 2014; 135: 1038-47). The results showed that the tumor frequency was reduced in the CR group. However, the mechanism of tumor suppression by CR is not yet clear. In this study, we examined the effects of CR on radiation-induced mutations using gpt delta mice, which are useful to analyze mutations in various tissues throughout the whole body. Infant male mice (1-week old) were exposed to 3.8 Gy X-rays and fed a control (95 kcal/week/mouse) or CR (65 kcal/week/mouse) diet from adult stage (7-weeks old). Mice were sacrificed at the age of 7 weeks, 8 weeks and 100 days, and organs (spleen, liver, lung, thymus) were harvested. Mutations at the gpt gene in the DNA from the spleen were analyzed by using a gpt assay protocol that detects primarily point mutations in the gpt gene. The results showed that mutation frequencies were decreased in CR groups compared with non-CR groups. Sequence analysis of the gpt gene in mutants revealed a reduction in the G:C to T:A transversion in CR groups. Since it is known that 8-oxoguanine could result in this base substitution and that CR has an effect of reducing oxidative stress, these results indicate that the suppression of oxidative stress by CR is the cause of the reduction of this transversion.
