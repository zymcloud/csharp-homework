Lymphogenic and hematogenic metastases are uncommon in ovarian cancer, especially at presentation. We hypothesized that MMP-14 and MMP-2, CD44, and highly sulfated chondroitin sulfate (CS-E) may be overexpressed in tumors with these metastatic patterns. These molecules are all present in the ovarian tumor microenvironment, wherein they may interact. In an ovarian cancer cohort of 44 patients with metastases in lymph nodes, spleen, and/or liver, the presence of MMP-14, MMP-2, CD44, and CS-E in both the primary tumor and the metastases was determined with immunohistochemistry and related to clinical characteristics. Immunohistochemical expression was found for MMP-14 in all primary tumors as well as in all metastases and for MMP-2 expression in most of the samples. Most primary tumors with synchronous metastases were positive for CS-E, as well as most primary tumors with metachronous lymphogenic metastases. The expression of the MMPs and CS-E in the stroma seemed to colocalize. For CD44 immunohistochemical expression, this relationship was not found. Epithelial MMP-14 on the one hand and stromal CS-E on the other hand seem to be essential players in ovarian cancer with lymphogenic and hematogenic metastases. CD44 expression is not correlated with the other markers. More research on the interaction of these molecules and their role in the process of dissimination of disease is warranted.
