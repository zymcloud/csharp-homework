Precision tissue diagnostics rely on high quality input specimens so that assay results are not affected by artifact, but advances in collection and processing of tissue specimens have lagged behind innovations in diagnostic assay development. Therefore, we have designed and evaluated a novel surgical tissue collection device that maintains and monitors sample temperature and motion throughout transport so that the major preanalytical variable of tissue temperature can be controlled and measured. This device, in combination with an improved cold-hot tissue fixation protocol affords optimal biomarker preservation in less overall time, thereby simultaneously improving diagnostic quality and turnaround time. We collected 50 primary and metastatic liver tumors using a novel transport device. Tissue was fixed using a rapid cold-hot fixation protocol and immunohistochemical assays were used to assess the performance of the device, in comparison to control tissue preserved using standard clinical fixation protocol. Two pathologists evaluated the IHC studies in a blinded fashion to determine the immunophenotype of each tumor. The observed IHC staining intensities and the clinical impressions of the immunophenotypes did not differ between tissue collected with the novel device and control tissue, while improvements in processing time were achieved. The novel cold transport device and rapid fixation protocol can be successfully and safely combined and used to monitor specimen conditions, thus preserving the diagnostic utility of specimens and improving the overall turn-around time of the diagnostic process.
