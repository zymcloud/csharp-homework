MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in tumorigenesis, progression, recurrence, and drug resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, few miRNAs have been identified and entered clinical practice. Herein, we report that microRNA (miR)-552 is upregulated in HCC tissues and has an important function in liver tumor-initiating cells (T-ICs). Functional studies revealed that a forced expression of miR-552 promotes liver T-IC self-renewal and tumorigenesis. Conversely, miR-552 knockdown inhibits liver T-IC self-renewal and tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, miR-552 downregulates phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) via its mRNA 3' UTR and activates protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation. Our clinical investigations elucidated the prognostic value of miR-552 in HCC patients. Furthermore, miR-552 expression determines the responses of hepatoma cells to sorafenib treatment. The analysis of patient cohorts and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) further demonstrated that miR-552 may predict sorafenib benefits in HCC patients. In conclusion, our findings revealed the crucial role of the miR-552 in liver T-IC expansion and sorafenib response, rendering miR-552 an optimal target for the prevention and intervention in HCC.
