Purpose:The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of preoperative AAPR in hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma patients after curative hepatectomy.Patients and methods:A total of 221 patients with hepatitis B virus-related HCC patients who received curative liver resection were included. After propensity matching analysis, 188 patients were enrolled in the final analysis. COX regression analyses were used to analyze the prognosis value of AAPR and other prognostic factors. The overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) curves were constructed and compared between different groups.Results:The optimal cutoff of AAPR was defined as 0.40 with X-tile software. According to cutoff value, patients were divided into low-AAPR group (≤0.40) and high-AAPR group (>0.40). The cumulative 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 97.1%, 78.2%, and 67.3% in patients with AAPR>0.40 group, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in the AAPR≤0.40 group (80.2%, 54.4%, and 40.1%, respectively) (P Conclusion:AAPR shows promise as a reliable prognostic factor in patients with hepatitis B virus-related HCC after curative hepatectomy, which could be used as a routine inspection of HCC patients before surgery.
