In this study, sediment samples from Makoko and Ikorodu sites of the Lagos lagoon (Nigeria) were screened for toxicological responses on mammalian and fish cell lines using different extraction methods. Rat hepatoma H4IIE and fish PLHC-1 cell-lines were exposed to serial dilutions of the elutriate, polar and non-polar extracts. We evaluated exposed cells for cytotoxicity and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-mediated toxicity. Cells exposed to polar and water extracts from Makoko and Ikorodu showed viability percentage of >80% at 48 h. On the other hand, exposure to the non-polar extracts exhibited cell viability of 50-60% at all tested dilutions. For both cell lines, a significant concentration-dependent induction of cyp1a mRNA was observed after exposure to the different extracts from both sites. Interestingly, the extracts affected functional enzymes differently for both cell lines. For H4IIE cells, while EROD activity paralleled cyp1a mRNA expression patterns, MROD showed significant concentration-specific reduction in cells exposed to polar and water extracts. On the contrary, while the MROD activity paralleled cyp1a mRNA, EROD activity was significantly inhibited in PLHC-1 cells exposed to water-, polar and non-polar extracts from both sites. These observations paralleled sediments PAH contamination burden from the study sites as revealed by co-relation analysis. In conclusion, although the different extracts did not exert high cytotoxic effects (except the non-polar) at the tested concentrations, they significantly modulated phase I biotransformation responses, showing that the studied sediments contain complex chemical mixture in the different extracts, with potential for overt physiological and general health consequences.
