microRNAs' (miRNAs) loci may influence hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Many recent studies have assessed the relationship between miRNA-499, miRNA-146a, and miRNA-196a2 loci and HCC risk. However, the observed results are conflicting. A total of 584 HCC patients and 923 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited. The correlation of miRNA-499 rs3746444, miRNA-146a rs2910164, and miRNA-196a2 rs11614913 with HCC development was assessed. In the <53-year-old subgroup, a correlation of the rs2910164 locus with HCC risk was found (GG/CG vs. CC: adjusted p = 0.011, GG vs. CC: adjusted p = 0.021 and CG vs. CC: adjusted p = 0.027). The association between miRNA-146a rs2910164 and the risk of HCC was also found in the never smoking (GG/CG vs. CC: adjusted p = 0.011 and CG vs. CC: adjusted p = 0.018). Using false-positive report probability method and power value, we identified that miRNA-146a rs2910164 conferred a risk to HCC in the <53-year-old and never-smoking subgroups. In conclusion, this study indicates rs2910164 may be a risk factor for HCC, especially in the <53-year-old and never-smoking subgroups.
