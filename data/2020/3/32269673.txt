Recent studies have indicated that ANXA7 promotes progression and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study we found a significant negative correlation between the levels of miR-124-3p and ANXA7 protein in HCC. Level of miR-124-3p in tumor tissues was negatively correlated, while ANXA7 protein was positively correlated, with TNM stage and tumor metastasis. Furthermore, we confirmed ANXA7 was a target gene of miR-124-3p by a dual luciferase reporter assay. In vitro, up-regulation of miR-124-3p promotes apoptosis and inhibits migration and invasion of Hca-F. Bcl-2 correlates X protein (Bax) protein level was up-regulated, while ANXA7, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9) and C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) protein levels were suppressed relative to miR-124-3p over-expression. In vivo, up-regulation of miR-124-3p suppresses lymph node metastasis (LNM) and tumorigenicity of Hca-F cells. The expression of ANXA7, MMP-9, and CXCL12 protein in transplanted tumors was suppressed relative to miR-124-3p overexpression. In addition, we found the levels of Bcl-2, MMP-9, and CXCL12 in Hca-F cells decreased significantly after transfection of shRNA-Anxa7 in vitro. In conclusion, our study revealed miR-124-3p inhibits tumor growth, invasion, and lymphatic metastasis in HCC by down-regulation of ANXA7 gene, thereby reducing the expression of Bcl-2, MMP-9, and CXCL12.
