Background:Hepatoid carcinoma (HC) is an extremely rare neoplasm that is morphologically similar to hepatocellular carcinoma. HC has been described in various organs; however, HC of the pancreas is extremely rare. To our knowledge, only 38 cases have been reported. We present a case of HC of the pancreas in a 36-year-old male patient.Case summary:A 36-year-old cachexic man with no significant past medical history was transferred to our hospital with a history of painless jaundice, elevated blood glucose and significant weight loss. Lab tests showed elevated serum transaminases, bilirubin and alpha-fetoprotein levels. Magnetic resonance imaging of the upper abdomen showed a diffusely enlarged pancreas, appearing "sausage-shaped". Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed upstream ductal dilation secondary to stricture of the main pancreatic duct and the common bile duct, which were not visible. Immunohistochemistry of biopsied tissue from a percutaneous pancreatic biopsy showed tumor cell positivity for HepPar1, polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen and CK19, suggestive of HC of the pancreas. The characteristics of 39 patients with HC of the pancreas were reviewed.Conclusion:HC of the pancreas is more prevalent in males, and patients have a median age of 57 years. It is most commonly asymptomatic or presents as abdominal back pain, and the pancreatic tail is the most common location. At the time of diagnosis, liver metastasis is often present.
