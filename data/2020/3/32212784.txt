Background:Adipokines play an important role in the regulation of inflammation and tumor progression.Aim:Assessment of the possible role of adiponectin, leptin and visfatin in HCV associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:patients were classified into 85 patients with HCV associated HCC, 100 patients with chronic hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection compared to 50 normal control (NC) subjects. All subjects included in the study were assessed for HCV infection by seropositive HCV antibodies, as well as HCV RNA by RT-PCR. Serum levels of adiponectin, leptin and visfatin were assessed using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The data were correlated to the relevant clinic-pathological features of the patients, and the overall survival (OS) rate.Results:There was a significant difference in the serum levels of adiponectin and visfatin among HCC, HCV and NC groups (PConclusion:Adiponectin, leptin and visfatin have an important role(s) in the pathogenesis of HCV associated HCC. .
