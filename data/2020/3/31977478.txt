Ga-PSMA PET/CT imaging is an emerging imaging modality in prostate cancer. PSMA expression is also reported for nonprostate malignancies, including primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Herein, we present a case of a 74-year-ald man with recently diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma who was referred for F-FDG PET/CT imaging for initial staging. The patient underwent F-FDG PET/CT as part of staging procedure; he also underwent Ga-PSMA PET/CT. PET/CT images revealed only slight F-FDG uptake in the liver lesion, but intense Ga-PSMA uptake, without any metastatic lesion seen elsewhere in the body.
