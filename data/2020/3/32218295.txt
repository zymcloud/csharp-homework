There are limited reports regarding early predictors of objective response (OR) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with lenvatinib. This retrospective study including 70 patients aimed to investigate the efficacy of hepatic biochemical markers. Changes in tumor marker (alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)/des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP)) levels and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score between the baseline value and that estimated one month after treatment were evaluated. We identified several predictors of OR, including changes in tumor marker levels. The OR rate calculated using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (mRECIST) was 41.4%. Response was defined as a reduction in AFP and DCP levels of ≥40% from baseline. OR was significantly associated with AFP response, but not with DCP. Predictors of OR were evaluated in two groups (high-AFP group: baseline AFP ≥ 10 ng/mL; low-AFP group: remaining patients). A multivariate analysis identified AFP response (odds ratio, 51.389; p = 0.001) and ALBI score (odds ratio, 6.866; p = 0.039) as independent predictors of OR in the high-AFP and low-AFP groups, respectively. Changes in the ALBI score indicated deterioration in both responders and non-responders, with a significant difference in non-responders (p = 0.003). AFP response, baseline ALBI score, and change in the ALBI score were early predictors of OR in patients with HCC undergoing lenvatinib treatment.
