Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common malignant cancers worldwide, is associated with substantial mortality. Because HCCs have strong resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents, novel therapeutic strategies are needed to improve survival in patients with HCC. The multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) model is a powerful method for anticancer research because of its ability to mimic the complexity and heterogeneity of tumor tissue, the three-dimensional cellular context of tumor tissue, and the pathophysiological gradients of in vivo tumors. However, it is difficult to obtain meaningful results from the MCTS model without considering the conditions of clinical tumors. We, therefore, provided a proof of concept to determine whether spheroid models simulate in vivo tumor microenvironments. Through a high-throughput screening for HCC therapy using the MCTS model, we selected inhibitors of Na+/K+-ATPase (ouabain and digoxin) that could suppress cell growth and migration via inhibition of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of HCC in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that this model provides a new paradigm for high-throughput drug screening and will significantly improve the efficiency of identifying new drugs for HCC treatment. Through utilization of MCTS models, here we found that inhibitors of Na+/K+-ATPase may be feasible as a novel target to sensitize HCC cells.
