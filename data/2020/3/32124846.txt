Objective:Kidney cancer is around 2-3% of malignant tumours in adults. It has an important tendency to metastasize, being the most affected organs lungs, liver,brain, bone and adrenal glands. The pancreas is a rare site of kidney metastasis, with an incidence of 1-2.8%. The aim of this paper is to analyze the clinical diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of the pancreatic metastasis secondary to kidney cancer.Method:We present a retrospective descriptive analysis of 6 cases of pancreatic metastasis of primary kidney cancer diagnosed at Cruces University Hospital since 2011.We describe the cases individually also making a global analysis of the pathology and literature review.Results:Two of the patients had pancreatic and extrapancreatic metastatic lesions, being treated systemic treatment without adjacent surgery. They showed an overall worse prognosis. The rest of the patients had only pancreatic disease,rational for surgical removal of all masses without need of further adjuvant treatment. The results after surgery were encouraging, with longer overall survival, progression free survival and better quality of life.Conclusions:Pancreatic metastases of kidney cancer are very rare and they can appear several years after nephrectomy. Patients with history of kidney cancer should be followed for long term after surgery. When metastases are limited to the pancreas, radical surgery has longer overall survival, progression free survival and better quality of life outcomes.
