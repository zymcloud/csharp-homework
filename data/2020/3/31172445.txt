Purpose:Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) positivity is regarded as a sensitive marker for occult and prior hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, the prognosis of patients with HBcAb-positive in non-B, non-C hepatocellular carcinoma (NBNC-HCC) remains unclear. The study aimed to compare the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with HBcAb-positive NBNC-HCC to those with overt HBV (hepatitis B surface antigen positive) HCC.Methods:306 HCC patients underwent hepatectomy were divided into two groups: an overt HBV-HCC group and HBcAb-positive NBNC-HCC group. Then patients were analyzed using propensity score matching (PSM) to reduce selection bias. Clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes were compared between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate analysis for risk factors were also evaluated.Results:HBcAb-positive NBNC-HCC group showed comparable survival outcomes to the overt HBV-HCC group (3-year overall survival rates 66% vs 62%, 69% vs 53%; 3-year recurrence-free survival rates 49% vs 40%, 47% vs 37%; P > 0.05) before and after PSM. Patients with HBcAb-positive NBNC-HCC were older, had more complications, higher proportions of vascular invasion, and larger tumor sizes but lower proportions of cirrhosis, elevated alanine aminotransferase and prothrombin time.Conclusions:HBcAb-positive NBNC-HCC group had more advanced tumors, but their prognosis was relatively comparable to that of the other group. Therefore, we believe that screening is also necessary in HBcAb-positive patients for early detection of HCC, especially in the elderly.
