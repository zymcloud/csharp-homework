Background/aim:The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with transfusion dependent thalassemia (TDT) has been increasing, where viral hepatitis and iron overload are the two established HCC risk factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the etiological factors of HCC development and to evaluate the possible factors associated with survival in our cohort of TDT patients with HCC.Methods:Records of patients with TDT diagnosed with HCC from 2008 to 2018 were reviewed. Liver iron concentration (LIC) has been assessed by the signal-intensity-ratio MRI. The diagnosis of HCC was made by a 3-phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and patients were staged and treated for HCC according to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) grading system.Results:Forty-two TDT patients with HCC have been included. Most of them (78.5%) were anti-HCV positive, 59.5% HCV-RNA positive, and 16.5% had serological markers of resolved HBV infection. Patients with HCV infection have been treated successfully with either Peg-IFNaÂ±Ribavirin or with the new direct antivirals (DAAs). At the time of HCC diagnosis, all patients with chronic HCV infection were HCV-RNA negative, 78.5% had underlying cirrhosis, and the vast majority (98%) had average or mild elevated LIC values. According to the BCLC system, patients were classified as 0-A: 28.5%, B: 57% and C-D: 14.5%. HCC has been treated with loco-regional treatment in 78.5% of our patients, while the rest have received sorafenib. Twenty-eight patients (66.5%) died due to HCC with a median survival time of 6 months (range: 2-60). Using the Cox proportional hazard model, the only factors associated with poor survival were BCLC stages C and D.Conclusions:In conclusion, BCLC staging is the main prognostic factor of survival in patients with TDT who develop HCC.
