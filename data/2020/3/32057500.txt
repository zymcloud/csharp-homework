Cholangiocarcinoma is the second most common neoplasm in the liver, with a very poor, short-term prognosis. Today, surgery associated with or without an adjuvant is the only curative treatment. Liver transplantation (LT) is the best treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma tumor. In recent years, treatment of hilar cholangiocarcinoma by LT associated with neoadjuvant therapy has been studied under a criterion. But could it be possible to apply LT like the curative treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCC)? Initially the answer is no, but there are different studies about incidental LT in patients with iCC that demonstrate survival over 40% to 50%. In our center, we conducted a review of 468 transplants completed between 2002 and 2018, and we identified 1 case of incidental LT in a patient with iCC with an overall survival of 10 years. Because there is currently an increase in donors owing to the expansion of the criteria, a study to consider extending the criteria of LT to include iCC would be beneficial.
