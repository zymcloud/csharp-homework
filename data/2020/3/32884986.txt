The global incidence of liver cancer continues to grow. Liver cancer, especially hepatocellular carcinoma, has high recurrence and mortality rates. Here, we review the past decade's diagnostic, therapeutic, and management strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma, and summarize new patient management approaches, including enhanced recovery after surgery, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. We compare traditional and innovative management methods, which comprise developments in precision medicine, and consider their limitations. Ongoing innovation and technological advances enable surgeons to gain deeper understandings of the multidimensionality of hepatocellular carcinoma, thereby promoting the continuous development of precision therapy.
