Plenty of evidence has suggested that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a vital role in competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks. Poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (PDHCC) is a malignant phenotype. This paper aimed to explore the effect and the underlying regulatory mechanism of lncRNAs on PDHCC as a kind of ceRNA. Additionally, prognosis prediction was assessed. A total of 943 messenger RNAs (mRNAs), 86 miRNAs, and 468 lncRNAs that were differentially expressed between 137 PDHCCs and 235 well-differentiated HCCs were identified. Thereafter, a ceRNA network related to the dysregulated lncRNAs was established according to bioinformatic analysis and included 29 lncRNAs, 9 miRNAs, and 96 mRNAs. RNA-related overall survival (OS) curves were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. The lncRNA ARHGEF7-AS2 was markedly correlated with OS in HCC (P = .041). Moreover, Cox regression analysis revealed that patients with low ARHGEF7-AS2 expression were associated with notably shorter survival time (P = .038). In addition, the area under the curve values of the lncRNA signature for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival were 0.806, 0.741, and 0.701, respectively. Furthermore, a lncRNA nomogram was established, and the C-index of the internal validation was 0.717. In vitro experiments were performed to demonstrate that silencing ARHGEF7-AS2 expression significantly promoted HCC cell proliferation and migration. Taken together, our findings shed more light on the ceRNA network related to lncRNAs in PDHCC, and ARHGEF7-AS2 may be used as an independent biomarker to predict the prognosis of HCC.
