Purpose:We aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) guided by multiple imaging modalities for hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in special (i.e., high-risk or unfavorable) locations compared with those in conventional locations.Methods:A total of 122 HCC patients were enrolled, including 85 patients (69.7%) with HCC in conventional locations and 37 (30.3%) with HCC in special locations. The clinical data, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and procedure-related adverse events were analyzed.Results:RFA combined with TACE was successfully performed in all patients. Three complications (2.5%) occurred, with no significant difference between the conventional (n=1, 1.2%) and special (n=2, 5.4%) locations (P = 0.218). Complete tumor necrosis rate was not significantly different between the conventional (n=73, 85.9%) and special (n=34, 91.9%) locations at one-month imaging (P = 0.353). After a follow-up of 3-48 months, the PFS was 17 months for patients with HCC in conventional locations and 14 months for patients with HCC in special locations; one-year PFS rate was 68.1% in the conventional location group, not significantly (P = 0.741) different from 59.1% in the special location group. The OS was 28 months in the conventional location group while 32 months in the special location group. The cumulative one- and two-year OS rates were 89.9% and 63.3%, respectively, in the conventional location group, not significantly different from 96.3% and 65% in the special location group (P = 0.273). Age (P = 0.043) and tumor size (P Conclusion:RFA guided by multiple imaging modalities combined with TACE may be safe and effective for treating HCCs in special locations.
