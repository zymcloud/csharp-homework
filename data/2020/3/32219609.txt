Polymer materials encapsulating drugs have broad prospects for drug delivery. We evaluated the effectiveness of polyethylene glycol-poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA-PEG) encapsulation and release characteristics of PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 (BEZ235). We proposed a strategy for targeting radiosensitization of liver cancer cells. The biocompatibility, cell interaction, and internalization of Glypican-3 (GPC3) antibody-modified, BEZ235-loaded PLGA-PEG nanoparticles (NP-BEZ235-Ab) in hepatoma cells in vitro were studied. Also, the cell killing effect of NP-BEZ235-Ab combined with γ-ray cell was evaluated. We used confocal microscopy to monitor nanoparticle-cell interactions and cellular uptake, conducted focus-formation experiments to analyze the synergistic biological effects of NP-BEZ235-Ab and priming, and studied synergy in liver cancer cells using molecular biological methods such as western blotting. We found that PLGA-PEG has good loading efficiency for BEZ235 and high selectivity to GPC3-positive HepG2 liver cancer cells, thus documenting that NP-BEZ235-Ab acts as a small-molecule drug delivery nanocarrier. At the nominal concentration, the NP-BEZ235-Ab nanoformulation synergistically kills liver cancer cells with significantly higher efficiency than does the free drug. Thus, NP-BEZ235-Ab is a potential radiosensitizer.
