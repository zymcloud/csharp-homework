Dual-specificity phosphatase-1 (DUSP1/MKP1) plays a key role in controlling various physiological and pathological phenomena, including tumor metastasis and invasion. However, the role of MKP1 in tumorigenesis is controversial. We showed that the expression of MKP1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is significantly downregulated, and MKP1 is an independent predictor of poor prognosis. In in vitro and in vivo studies, we showed that MKP1 significantly inhibits the invasion and metastasis of HCC cells. Additionally, we found that low MKP1 expression is associated with the expression of ROCK2, which plays an important role in HCC. Our data suggest that MKP1 is crucial for ROCK2-mediated metastasis and invasion. Interestingly, we demonstrated that ROCK2 has opposite effects on protein and mRNA levels of MKP1, as it decreases the expression at the protein level and increases the expression at the mRNA level. We also identified the mechanism responsible for this incongruency; ROCK2 activates ERK1/2-ATF2 signaling, which leads to the increased mRNA expression of MKP1. At the same time, ROCK2 promotes the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of MKP1 by activating ERK1/2, therefore promoting the metastasis of HCC. In conclusion, our data provide new evidence for the biological and clinical significance of MKP1 as a potential biomarker. We demonstrate that ROCK2 disturbs the protein and mRNA expression of MKP1 in human HCC progression.
