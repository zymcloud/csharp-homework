Sorafenib is acknowledged as the standard therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but in the clinical practice the treatment of these patients is extremely complex and needs to be personalized. New evidence suggests that surgical resection-based multimodal treatments may improve outcome in these patients. There is no strong evidence supporting the ability of sorafenib in downstage HCC before surgery. We presented a case of a 53-year-old man with well-compensated HCV-cirrhosis complicated with HCC and neoplastic portal vein thrombosis. The patient was treated initially with sorafenib with optimal radiological and serological response and subsequently with liver resection. Pathological examination showed necrotic portal thrombosis and massive necrosis of a metastatic regional node confirming radiological evidence. This finding suggests that sorafenib exhibits a potential to downstage advanced HCC which is not irrelevant. A possible combination of different modalities has to be considered in the view of a personalized medicine.
