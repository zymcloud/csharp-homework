Background:Portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) and extrahepatic metastasis are associated with the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to investigate the effect of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection on HCC patients with PVTT or extrahepatic metastasis.Patients and methods:The clinical data of 639 patients with HCC from our hospital were retrospectively analyzed to analyze the correlation between HBV and HCC with PVTT or extrahepatic metastasis.Results:Univariate analysis revealed that positive hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), a detectable serum hepatitis B virus DNA load (>500 IU/ml), cirrhosis and ascites were associated with the presence of PVTT. Positive hepatitis B virus e antigen (HBeAg), cirrhosis and ascites were associated with the presence of extrahepatic metastasis. In a multivariate regression analysis carried out a detectable serum hepatitis B virus DNA load, cirrhosis and ascites were independent risk factors of PVTT. Ascites was an independent risk factor of extrahepatic metastasis. The patients in the PVTT of type III/IV group and the PVTT of type I/II group had a significantly higher rate of positive serum HBsAg, a detectable serum hepatitis B virus DNA load (>500 IU/ml) and HBsAg + HBeAb + HBcAb test positive compared with those in the PVTT-negative group. HBsAg + HBeAb + HBcAb test positive was significantly associated with the presence of extrahepatic metastasis (P=0.028).Conclusions:HBV infection and replication status are associated with the formation of PVTT or extrahepatic metastasis in patients with HCC.
