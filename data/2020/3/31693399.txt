Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent primary liver cancer in adults. Previous studies in our laboratory found that long non-coding RNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) was upregulated in HCC cells, which could affect the metastasis and invasion of HCC. However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Herein, we studied the interaction between MALAT1 and miR-140 on the regulation of angiogenesis and immunosuppressive properties. We revealed that the expression of MALAT1 and VEGF-A was significantly increased in HCC cells. Knockdown of MALAT1 in HCC cells suppressed the production of VEGF-A, impaired the angiogenesis of HUVECs, and facilitated the polarization of macrophage toward the M1 subset. Mechanistically, the interaction between MALAT1 and miR-140 or between miR-140 and VEGF-A was confirmed by multiple assays. Besides, a negative correlation between MALAT1 and miR-140 was found in HCC tissues. Furthermore, miR-140 inhibition significantly increased VEGF-A expression, promoted angiogenesis of HUVECs, and redirected the polarization of macrophages toward the M2 subset. In addition, in vivo studies also verified the regulatory network of the MALAT1/miR-140 axis on VEGF-A in HCC progression. In summary, this study revealed the mechanism that MALAT1 worked as a putative HCC promotor via inhibiting miR-140. Therefore, targeting MALAT1 or miR-140 might alleviate the progression of HCC in the future.
