Background:Multi-phase computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been the standard of care for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis for years.Case summary:We report a case series of four patients in whom positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan complemented the conventional CT/MRI scans in evaluating treatment response. In these four cases the conventional multi-phase CT and MRI failed to identify residual HCC disease post-treatment, while PET-CT complemented and aided in treatment response evaluation. In each case, the addition of PET-CT identified and located residual HCC disease, allowed retreatment, and altered medical management.Conclusion:This case series suggests that PET-CT should perhaps play a role in the HCC management algorithm, in addition to the conventional contrast-enhanced multi-phase scans.
