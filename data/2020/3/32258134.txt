Methods:The percentages of MDSCs, IFN-γ-producing CD4 and CD8 T cells in the peripheral blood of HCC patients, chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, and healthy controls (HC) were determined by flow cytometry. The serum concentrations of IL-10 and TNF-α were determined by ELISA. The association of the percentages of MDSCs with tumor burden, liver function parameters, systemic inflammation-related indexes, and IFN-γ-producing T cells was assessed.Results:The percentages of MDSCs and PMN-MDSCs were significantly higher in HCC patients than those in CHB patients and HC. The level of MDSCs was correlated with indirect bilirubin and prealbumin, as well as systemic inflammation response index, monocyte/lymphocyte ratio, and monocyte counts. The frequency of IFN-γ-producing CD8 T cells of HCC patients was lower than that of HC. However, there was no relationship between MDSCs and IFN-γ-producing CD8 T cells. The level of IL-10 in HCC patients was significantly higher than that in CHB patients.Conclusion:MDSCs seem to play an important role in the process leading from chronic HBV infection to HCC. Early inhibiting these cells could affect tumor progression.
