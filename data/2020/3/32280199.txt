Purpose:Liver fibrosis (or liver scarring) is a causative factor for hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Alginate (Agn) isolated from brown algae is known to slow the proliferation of fibroblasts, through the mechanisms of these effects remain undefined. This study explored the benefits of Agn on hepatic health and its associated mechanism(s) of action in hepatic stellate cells (HSC-T6s).Materials and methods:To assess the effects of Agn, HSC-T6s were treated with PDGF and cell proliferation, colony formation, cell migration, cell invasiveness and apoptosis were assessed. Rat models of liver fibrosis were produced through 12-week injections of intraperitoneal (IP) carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Rats were Agn-treated from weeks 8 to 12, and liver damage was assessed through Masson's and H & E staining. Gene expression profiles were assayed via RT-PCR, Western blot and commercial ELISA kits.Results:Agn reduced the proliferation of HSC-T6s and increased apoptotic rates through the downregulation of the Bcl-2:Bax ratio. Agn also inhibited the invasion and migration of HSC-T6s, prevented ECM deposition, and reduced the occurrence of liver fibrosis in rat models. Agn also prevented IκBα and p65 phosphorylation.Conclusion:Agn prevents liver fibrosis through its attenuation of HSC activation and division through the suppression of NF-κB in in vitro and animal models. This highlights how the clinical use of Agn can prevent hepatic fibrosis.
