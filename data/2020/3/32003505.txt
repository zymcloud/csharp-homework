Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignancy of the liver with a high worldwide prevalence and poor prognosis. Researches are urgently needed on its molecular pathogenesis and biological characteristics. Metabolic reprogramming for adaptation to the tumour microenvironment (TME) has been recognized as a hallmark of cancer. Dysregulation of lipid metabolism especially fatty acid (FA) metabolism, which involved in the alternations of the expression and activity of lipid-metabolizing enzymes, is a hotspot in recent study, and it may be involved in HCC development and progression. Meanwhile, immune cells are also known as key players in the HCC microenvironment and show complicated crosstalk with cancer cells. Emerging evidence has shown that the functions of immune cells in TME are closely related to abnormal lipid metabolism. In this review, we summarize the recent findings of lipid metabolic reprogramming in TME and relate these findings to HCC progression. Our understanding of dysregulated lipid metabolism and associated signalling pathways may suggest a novel strategy to treat HCC by reprogramming cell lipid metabolism or modulating TME.
