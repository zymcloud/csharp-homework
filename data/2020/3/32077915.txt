Objective:To study the role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00978 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) carcinogenesis.Materials and methods:LINC00978 expression level was measured by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) in HCC tissues and adjacent healthy liver tissues from 49 HCC patients. MTT assay, colony forming assay, and flow cytometry were performed to evaluate the effects of shRNA-mediated LINC00978 knockdown on HCC cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis in vitro. Xenograft tumor model was performed to determine the effects of LINC00978 knockdown on HCC tumor growth in vivo. Western blot was used to assess the activation of signaling molecules in the apoptosis and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway.Results:LINC00978 expression was significantly up-regulated in human HCC tissue relative to adjacent normal tissue, and LINC00978 high expression was correlated with poor HCC overall survival. LINC00978 was up-regulated in HCC cell lines. ShRNA-mediated LINC00978 knockdown significantly decreased HCC cell proliferation, and induced HCC cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro. LINC00978 knockdown led to significant decrease in tumor xenograft size in vivo. Western blots revealed LINC00978 inhibition decreased ERK, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation in HCC cells.Conclusions:LINC00978 is highly expressed in human HCC tissue and correlates with poor HCC prognosis. LINC00978 promotes HCC cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and survival, partially by activating the MAPK/ERK pathway. Our findings partially elucidated the roles of LINC00978 in HCC carcinogenesis, and identified a therapeutic target for HCC.
