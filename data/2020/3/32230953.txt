The liver plays an outsized role in oncology. Liver tumors are one of the most frequently found tumors in cancer patients and these arise from either primary or metastatic disease. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most prevalent form of primary liver cancer and the 6th most common cancer type overall, is expected to become the 3rd leading cause of cancer mortality in the US by the year 2030. The liver is also the most common site of distant metastasis from solid tumors. For instance, colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasizes to the liver in two-thirds of cases, and CRC liver metastasis is the leading cause of mortality in these patients. The interplay between inflammation and cancer is unmistakably evident in the liver. In nearly every case, HCC is diagnosed in chronic liver disease (CLD) and cirrhosis background. The consumption of a Western-style high-fat diet is a major risk factor for the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), both of which are becoming more prevalent in parallel with the obesity epidemic. Excessive alcohol intake also contributes significantly to the CLD burden in the form of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Inflammation is a key component in the development of all CLDs. Additionally, during the development of liver metastasis, pro-inflammatory signaling is crucial in eliminating invading cancer cells but ironically also helps foster a pro-metastatic environment that supports metastatic seeding and colonization. Here we review how Westernized high-fat diets and excessive alcohol intake can influence inflammation within the liver microenvironment, stimulating both primary and metastatic liver tumorigenesis.
