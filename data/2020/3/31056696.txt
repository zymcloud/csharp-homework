Background:Liver fibrosis is an important risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after sustained virologic response (SVR) in patients with persistent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, as the degree of liver fibrosis changes following the eradication of HCV after SVR, it is unclear whether the prediction of HCC development based on liver fibrosis at baseline remains valid.Methods:In 522 patients who achieved SVR by interferon-based anti-HCV therapy, the Fibrosis-4 Index for Liver Fibrosis (FIB-4 index) was updated annually by recalculation based on laboratory values after SVR. The incidence of HCC was reassessed annually based on the updated FIB-4 index.Results:The percentage of patients with mild liver fibrosis (FIB-4 index Conclusions:The FIB-4 index retained its predictive ability for the risk of HCC when recalculated after SVR, despite the decrease in patients with high FIB-4 index values. Dynamic assessment of the FIB-4 index can be useful in the surveillance of HCC after SVR. Patients with a FIB-4 index
