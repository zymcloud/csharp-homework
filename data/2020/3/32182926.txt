This study presents a U-shaped optical fiber developed for a facile application of microRNA detection. It is fabricated by the lamping process and packaged in a quartz tube to eliminate human negligence. In addition, silanization and electrostatic self-assembly are employed to bind gold nanoparticles and miRNA-133a probe onto the silicon dioxide of the fiber surface. For Mahlavu of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), detection is determined by the wavelength shift and transmission loss of a U-shaped optical fiber biosensor. The spectral sensitivity of wavelength and their coefficient of determination are found at -218.319 nm/ ng/mL and 0.839, respectively. Concurrently, the sensitivity of transmission loss and their coefficient of determination are found at 162.394 dB/ ng/mL and 0.984, respectively. A method for estimating the limit of detection of Mahlavu is at 0.0133 ng/mL. The results show that the proposed U-shaped biosensor is highly specific to miRNA-133a and possesses good sensitivity to variations in specimen concentration. As such, it could be of substantial value in microRNA detection.
