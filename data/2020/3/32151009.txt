Salinomycin is a polyether antibiotic showing anticancer activity. There are many reports of its toxicity to animals but little is known about the potential adverse effects in humans. The action of the drug may be connected to its metabolism. That is why we investigated the cytotoxicity of salinomycin and pathways of its biotransformation using human primary hepatocytes, human hepatoma cells (HepG2), and the mouse fibroblast cell line (Balb/c 3T3). The cytotoxicity of salinomycin was time-dependent, concentration-dependent, and cell-dependent with primary hepatocytes being the most resistant. Among the studied models, primary hepatocytes were the only ones to efficiently metabolize salinomycin but even they were saturated at higher concentrations. The main route of biotransformation was monooxygenation leading to the formation of monohydroxysalinomycin, dihydroxysalinomycin, and trihydroxysalinomycin. Tiamulin, which is a known inhibitor of CYP450 izoenzymes, synergistically induced cytotoxicity of salinomycin in all cell types, including non-metabolising fibroblasts. Therefore, the pharmacokinetic interaction cannot fully explain tiamulin impact on salinomycin toxicity.
