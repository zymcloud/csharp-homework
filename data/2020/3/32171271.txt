Background:Cervical lymphadenopathy refers to a frequently observed clinical presentation in numerous pathological conditions. A wide spectrum of diseases can cause cervical lymphadenopathy, irrespective of the fact that the patients are infected with HIV or not. The present study focuses on validating whether the causes of cervical lymphadenopathy differ significantly in HIV and non-HIV patients by using fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) combining cell block.Methods:A total of 589 patients with cervical lymphadenopathy were recruited in the FNA clinic. The samples were obtained by an auto-vacuumed syringe that benefited the sampling more materials. The cytological smears were prepared by Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE), Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS), Gomori's methenamine silver (GMS) and acid-fast staining. Cell blocks were made if required, and immunohistochemistry stain was performed on the cell block section.Results:The study found 453 (76.9%) patients with HIV and 136 (23.1%) patients without HIV infection. The average age of HIV-infected patients was 34.8 ± 10.2 years, which was significantly lower than that of non-HIV-infected patients (42.9 ± 18.1 years) (p Conclusions:There were significantly different causes of cervical lymphadenopathy in HIV infected and non-HIV infected patients. FNAC was a useful diagnostic method for differential diagnosis of cervical lymphadenopathy.
