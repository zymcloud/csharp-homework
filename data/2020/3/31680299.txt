Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the most common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide, wherein the expression of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is reactivated to promote tumorgenesis. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) protein encoded by the HBV virus X gene has been considered to be oncogenic and implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the relationship between HBx and abnormal AFP expression in HCC is yet to be fully understood. To explore the potential regulation of HBx on AFP re-expression in HCC, 97 HCC samples of different etiologies were analyzed, and extremely higher serum AFP levels were found in patients with HBsAg+ . Analyses of HBV-related HCC specimens showed that the expression of AFP was negatively correlated with the levels of miR-1236 and miR-329. Further analyses indicated that HBx promotes the expression of AFP by orchestrating the levels of miR-1236 and miR-329 both in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, miR-1236 and miR-329 bind to the potential target sequences in AFP mRNA 3'-untranslated region to suppress its expression. HBx transfection resulted in the significant decrement of these microRNAs and increment of AFP expression. Moreover, AFP promotes the proliferation of hepatoma cells and attenuates the proapoptotic effect of chemotherapy agents. These findings revealed a novel regulatory mechanism of HBx on the abnormal AFP expression in HCC, which may provide a therapeutic approach for combating HBV-related HCC by targeting the regulation of AFP expression.
