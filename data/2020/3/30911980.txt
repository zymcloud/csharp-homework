Introduction:Selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) with yttrium-90 (Y-90) is an intra-arterial therapy for hepatic malignancy in patients who are unsuitable for surgical resection. This treatment is considered palliative, although some patients can demonstrate a response that is adequate to facilitate surgical resection with curative intent.Methods:All patients who underwent liver resection post SIRT were reviewed. Data gathered included patient demographics, tumor type, surgical details, and post-operative outcomes.Results:Twelve patients underwent SIRT followed by liver resection (7 males and 5 females). Pathologies were hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 5), metastatic colorectal cancer (n = 5), and neuroendocrine tumor (n = 2). Lesional response (size, volume, and RECIST (response evaluation criteria in solid tumors)) was calculated and where appropriate functional liver remnant (FLR) is presented. Mean FLR increase was 264cm3 (range - 123 to 909), and all cases demonstrated a partial response according to RECIST with a mean largest lesion volume reduction of 475cm3 (range 14-1632). No post-SIRT complications were noted. Hepatectomy occurred at a mean of 322 days from SIRT treatment. Ninety-day morbidity was 67% (n = 6), complications post-surgery were analyzed according to the Clavien-Dindo classification scale; a total of 15 events occurred in 6 patients. Ninety-day mortality of 11% (n = 1).Conclusion:In selected cases, liver resection is possible post SIRT. As this can represent a potentially curative option, it is important to reconsider resection in the follow-up of patients undergoing SIRT. Post-operative complications are noted following major and extended liver resection. Therefore, further studies are needed to improve patient selection.
