Purpose:ASB16 antisense RNA 1 (ASB16-AS1) is a cancer-associated long non-coding RNA that contributes to tumorigenesis and tumor development. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, whether and how ASB16-AS1 is implicated in osteosarcoma (OS) malignancy remains unclear and therefore warrants exploration. Our current study focused on making in-depth investigation of ASB16-AS1 in OS. In the present study, the expression pattern of ASB16-AS1 in OS tissues and cell lines was analyzed. In addition, we examined the clinical value of ASB16-AS1 for OS patients. Furthermore, we explored the impacts of ASB16-AS1 on the malignant phenotype of OS cells in vitro and in vivo as well as the underlying mechanism.Methods:ASB16-AS1, microRNA-760 (miR-760) and hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) expressions were measured using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated using CCK-8 and flow cytometry analyses, respectively, and cell migration and invasion were determined via cell migration and invasion assays.Results:ASB16-AS1 expression was significantly elevated in OS tissues and cell lines, and increased ASB16-AS1 expression was related to patients' tumor size, TNM stage, and distant metastasis. The overall survival rate of OS patients presenting high ASB16-AS1 expression was shorter than that of patients presenting low ASB16-AS1 expression. Reduced ASB16-AS1 expression inhibited OS cell proliferation, migration, and invasion; promoted cell apoptosis; and impaired tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, ASB16-AS1 served as a sponge for miR-760 and positively modulated the expression of its target HDGF. Finally, inhibiting miR-760 and restoring HDGF expression abolished the impacts of ASB16-AS1 knockdown on the malignant characteristics of OS cells.Conclusion:ASB16-AS1 is a novel oncogenic lncRNA in OS cells. ASB16-AS1 increased HDGF expression by sponging miR-760, thereby conferring cancer-promoting roles in OS. ASB16-AS1 is a potential early diagnostic and therapeutic target in OS.
