Case:A 76-year-old man was referred to our hospital for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)with chronic hepatitis type B. Although he underwent right anterior sectionectomy and S3 segmentectomy, multiple recurrences were found in the hepatic remnant after 2 months. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(TACE)and transcatheter arterial infusion (TAI)were performed separately. One and a half month after the last TAI, AFP and PIVKA-â…¡ levels markedly elevated, and multiple early enhancing nodules with portal vein tumor thrombosis were detected on CT. A half dose of sorafenib(400mg/ day)was administered to the patient who was refractory to TACE. Sorafenib was discontinued after 4 weeks because the patient developed general fatigue and anorexia(Grade 3). Furthermore, these adverse events became worse, and ascites appeared. He was hospitalized in the palliative care unit for best supportive care for 3 weeks and also received outpatient treatment for more than 14 months. Fifteen months after discontinuing sorafenib administration, his condition improved dramatically, and CT revealed that the multiple HCC had reduced in size. Moreover, the portal vein tumor thrombosis disappeared. As his performance status and liver function were well preserved, he underwent partial hepatectomy for residual HCC. The patient remains alive without recurrence at 18 months, despite no administration of sorafenib.Conclusion:This case demonstrates that sorafenib administration combined with surgical treatment could possibly cure advanced HCC refractory to TACE.
