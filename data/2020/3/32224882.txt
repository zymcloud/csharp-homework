Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a significant contributor to cancer-related morbidity and mortality with increasing incidence in both developing and developed countries. Embolotherapy as a locoregional therapeutic strategy consists of trans-arterial or "bland" embolization (TAE), trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE), and selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT). Trans-catheter arterial therapies can be applied along all stages of HCC, either as an alternative or neoadjuvant to surgical resection/transplantation in very early and early stage HCC or as a palliative option for local disease control in unresectable and advanced stage HCC. In advanced stage HCC, SIRT did not demonstrate superiority in comparison to systemic treatment options in several recent large prospective trials, though for carefully selected patients, may confer improved tolerability with similar disease control rates. The latest embolotherapeutic techniques and literature as they pertain to the management of HCC, as well as future directions, are reviewed in this article.
