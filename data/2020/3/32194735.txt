Sarcopenia is a prognostic factor for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cancer rehabilitation (CR) improves patients' physical function and muscle mass. We investigated the effects of CR on the prognosis of patients with HCC. The present study was a prospective observational study, which analyzed 152 patients with HCC who underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) between 2013 and 2016. Patients were classified into the CR (n=85) and control (n=67) groups. The effects of CR on muscle mass were evaluated by changes in the skeletal muscle index (SMI) before and after TACE. Independent factors associated with survival were evaluated by Cox regression analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare the survival rate between the CR and control groups. The difference in survival rate between the two groups was also examined after propensity score matching. SMI was significantly increased in the CR group compared with the control group. In Cox regression analysis, independent factors associated with survival were CR and Child-Pugh class A (estimate 1.760, 95% CI 0.914-3.226, P=0.001; estimate 1.602, 95% CI 0.426-2.998, P=0.0129). The survival rate was significantly higher in the CR group than in the control group (median 552 vs. 424 days; P=0.0359). The survival rate was also significantly higher in the CR group than that in the control group after propensity score matching (median 529 vs. 369 days; P=0.0332). CR was associated with prolonged survival in patients with HCC who underwent TACE. Patients with cancer are recommended to maintain physical activity even during cancer treatment.
