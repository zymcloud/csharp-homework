Background:We introduced solo surgery using a laparoscopic scope holder to wide an operator's activity range and reduce instrument crowding and clashing in single incisional surgery. This study aimed to compare the surgical outcomes of solo single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) and conventional multiport laparoscopic surgery (MULS) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Among 477 consecutive patients between January 2004 and December 2017, 214 patients were included. To overcome selection bias, we performed 1:1 match using propensity score matching between SILS and MULS. Baseline characteristics, operative outcomes, and postoperative complications were compared.Results:No significant differences in baseline characteristics and pathologic features were found between the two groups. Operation time, estimated blood loss, and postoperative major complication were not significantly different (119.0 min vs 141.6 min, p = 0.275; 200.0 mL min vs 373.3 min, p = 0.222; 0 vs 0, p = 1.000). However, postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter in SILS (2.73 days vs 7.67 days, p = 0.005).Conclusions:Solo SILS had comparable postoperative complications and feasibility in the aspect of operation time and hospital stay compared with conventional MULS for a favorable located single HCC.
