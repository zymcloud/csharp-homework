The treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma after liver transplantation (LT) is controversial because of its high recurrence rate and low survival rate. Here, we report a case of early diffuse bilateral lung metastasis after LT beyond the Milan transplantation criteria (d = 18 cm, Î±-fetoprotein >24,000 ng/mL) that successfully achieved 1-year tumor-free remission survival with sirolimus combined with regorafenib. The donor source of the liver is legal, and this study followed the guidelines of the Helsinki Congress in this LT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of regorafenib as a first-line agent combined with sirolimus to treat recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma after LT, and this case expands the indications for LT.
