Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors with a high mortality rate and low survival rate. This study was designed to explore a novel molecular with high sensitivity and specificity, which can be applied in early diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of HCC. The current study aims to investigate the effect and important role of Axin1 on cell proliferation, invasion, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatocellular carcinoma. qRT-PCR results showed lower Axin1 expression level and higher miR-650 expression level in HCC. Luciferase reporter assay was carried out to verify the negative correlation between Axin1 and miR-650 mRNA levels. CCK-8 assay results showed that the cell proliferation ability was significantly suppressed by Axin1 overexpression in SK-HEP-1 cells. The results in wound healing assay uncovered that cell migration ability was markedly suppressed by Axin1 overexpression. The results in trans-well invasion assay showed that Axin1 overexpression caused decreased invasive ability in SK-HEP-1 cells. The WB results showed that the protein level of E-cad was significantly increased and the protein levels of N-cad, vimentin and snail were obviously reduced following Axin1 overexpression. Whereas, the suppressive effects on cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT caused by Axin1 overexpression were abolished by miR-650 mimic. All the results in the current study confirmed the truth that Axin1 overexpression could suppress cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT by downregulating miR-650 expression.
