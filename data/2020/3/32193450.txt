Recently proposed tumor fitness measures, based on profiling neoepitopes for reactive viral epitope similarity, have been proposed to predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma and small-cell lung cancer. Here we applied these checkpoint based fitness measures to the matched checkpoint treatment naive Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) samples where cytolytic activity (CYT) imparts a known survival benefit. We observed no significant survival predictive power beyond that of overall patient tumor mutation burden, and furthermore, found no association between checkpoint based fitness and tumor T-cell infiltration, cytolytic activity, and abundance (tumor infiltrating lymphocyte, TIL, burden). In addition, we investigated the key assumption of viral epitope similarity driving immune response in the hepatitis B virally infected liver cancer TCGA cohort, and uncovered suggestive evidence that tumor neoepitopes actually dominate viral epitopes in putative immunogenicity and plausibly drive immune response and recruitment.
