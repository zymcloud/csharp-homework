We report a rare case of renal metastasis from primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A mass in the right kidney of a 71-year-old man was detected by follow-up computed tomography (CT) for HCC. He was diagnosed as having primary HCC 18 years ago and had undergone partial hepatectomy, transarterial chemoembolization, and pulmonary segmentectomy for primary HCC and its metastasis over 10 years. Eight years after this, follow-up CT revealed a right kidney mass, and laboratory testing showed an elevated level of protein induced by vitamin K absence II (PIVKA-II). We performed laparoscopic radical nephrectomy for the right kidney mass. Histopathology revealed renal metastasis from primary HCC. To date, only a small number of cases of renal metastasis from HCC have been reported.
