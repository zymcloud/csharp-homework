Recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation (LT) is increasing, with a consequent impact on survival. Here we report our experience with sorafenib to treat HCC recurrence after LT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We undertook a retrospective cohort study of LT patients with recurrent HCC. RESULTS: The study included 12 patients with recurrent HCC after LT between January 2008 and March 2019; 9 were men and 3 women, with a median age of 58 years. Adverse effects were manageable in most patients with symptomatic treatment or with sorafenib dose adjustment. Stable disease was the best response and was achieved. Eight patients (66.7%) died during the study period, 5 (62.5%) due to tumor progression and 3 (37.5%) because of sepsis. The median survival time was 7.5 months.
