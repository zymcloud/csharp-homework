The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network recently approved liver transplant (LT) prioritization for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) beyond Milan Criteria (MC) who are downstaged (DS) with locoregional therapy (LRT). We evaluated post-LT outcomes, predictors of downstaging, and the impact of LRT in beyond-MC HCC patients from the US Multicenter HCC Transplant Consortium (20 centers, 2002-2013). Clinicopathologic characteristics, overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and HCC recurrence (HCC-R) were compared between patients within MC (n=3,570) and beyond MC (n=789) who were downstaged (DS, n=465), treated with LRT and not downstaged (LRT-NoDS, n=242), or untreated (NoLRT-NoDS, n=82). Five-year post-LT OS and RFS was higher in MC (71.3% and 68.2%) compared to DS (64.3% and 59.5%), and lowest in NoDS (n=324; 60.2% and 53.8%; overall P5cm,P12 months. LRT-NoDS had greater HCC-R compared to NoLRT-NoDS (34.1% vs 26.1%,P
