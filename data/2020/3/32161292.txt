Snake venom serine proteases (SVSPs) are complex and multifunctional enzymes, acting primarily on hemostasis. In this work, we report the hitherto unknown inhibitory effect of a SVSP, named collinein-1, isolated from the venom of Crotalus durissus collilineatus, on a cancer-relevant voltage-gated potassium channel (hEAG1). Among 12 voltage-gated ion channels tested, collinein-1 selectively inhibited hEAG1 currents, with a mechanism independent of its enzymatic activity. Corroboratively, we demonstrated that collinein-1 reduced the viability of human breast cancer cell line MCF7 (high expression of hEAG1), but does not affect the liver carcinoma and the non-tumorigenic epithelial breast cell lines (HepG2 and MCF10A, respectively), which present low expression of hEAG1. In order to obtain both functional and structural validation of this unexpected discovery, where an unusually large ligand acts as an inhibitor of an ion channel, a recombinant and catalytically inactive mutant of collinein-1 (His43Arg) was produced and found to preserve its capability to inhibit hEAG1. A molecular docking model was proposed in which Arg79 of the SVSP 99-loop interacts directly with the potassium selectivity filter of the hEAG1 channel.
