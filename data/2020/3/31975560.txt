Previous studies have demonstrated the role of abnormal alternative splicing (AS) in tumor progression. This study examines the prognostic index (PI) of alternative splices (ASs) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The clinical features and splicing events of patients with HCC were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Differentially expressed AS (DEAS) were compared between HCC and adjacent normal samples. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to determine changes in DEAS associated with overall survival (OS). A PI was generated from OS-associated DEASs using Kaplan-Meier curves, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, multivariate Cox regression, and cluster analysis. Then, the correlation between DEASs and splicing factors was assessed, followed by functional and pathway enrichment analysis. We identified 34 163 ASs of 8985 genes in HCC, and 153 OS-ASs were identified using univariate Cox regression analysis. Low- and high-PI groups were determined based on the median "PI-ALL" value according to significantly different survival (P = 2.2e - 16). The ROC curve of all PI (PI-ALL) had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.993 for survival status in patients with HCC. A potential regulatory network associated with prognosis of patients with HCC was established. Enrichment analysis also resulted in the identification of several pathways potentially associated with carcinogenesis and progression of HCC. Four clusters were identified that were associated with clinical features and prognosis. Our study generated comprehensive profiles of ASs in HCC. The interaction network and functional connections were used to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of AS in HCC.
