Background:Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are both major health problems throughout the world. It has been reported that T2DM is an independent risk factor for HCC, although the pathophysiology is still unclear.Methods:In order to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in T2DM and HCC, gene expression datasets for T2DM (GSE15653), HCC (GSE60502) and metformin-treated cells (GSE69850) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database repository. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for the DEGs were constructed and gene clusters selected for functional enrichment analysis. Ten genes with the highest degree of connectivity were selected as hub genes and prognostic analysis together with analysis of gene expression and protein distribution were performed for these genes. Lastly, we investigated associations between the hub genes and genes associated with metformin treatment in hepatocarcinoma cells.Results:In total, 256 common DEGs, including 155 up-regulated genes and 101 down-regulated genes, were identified. Enrichment analyses showed that the genes of the major module were largely associated with the cell cycle. All of the 10 hub genes (CCNA2, CCNB1, MAD2L1, BU1B, RACGAP1, CHEK1, BUB1, ASPM, NCAPG and TTK) have a strong association with lower overall survival in liver cancer patients and four genes (CCNA2, CCNB1, CHEK1 and BUB1) have reduced expression in metformin-treated samples.Conclusions:This study identified a number of genes that may play important roles in the association of T2DM and HCC, including four genes which may be the target of metformin treatment for diabetes and HCC. The specific mechanisms involved remain to be identified.
