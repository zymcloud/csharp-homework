Background & aims:In 2012, the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system designated a single large hepatocellular carcinoma (SLHCC) (>5 cm) as BCLC stage A rather than stage B. However, a recent study from western countries reported that prognosis following liver resection (LR) among patients with SLHCC was similar to that among patients with BCLC stage B. We aim to evaluate the prognosis following LR among patients with SLHCC from an Asian high-volume liver surgery center.Methods:Patients who underwent curative-intent LR for histologically proven HCC between 2011 and 2017 were enrolled using an HCC registry database. Overall survival (OS) among patients with BCLC stages 0, A, and B was examined. Patients with a SLHCC were classified as BCLC stage A1.Results:Among 543 patients, 89 (16.4%) were BCLC stage 0, 289 (53.2%) were BCLC stage A, 92 (16.9%) were BCLC stage A1, and 73 (13.4%) were BCLC stage B. The median follow-up was 38 months. The five-year OS rates among patients with BCLC stages 0, A, A1, and B were 83.5%, 83.7%, 77.4%, and 55.4%, respectively (pConclusion:Prognosis following LR among patients with SLHCC was similar to that among patients with BCLC stage A. The prognosis for SLHCC should thus be considered comparable to that for BCLC stage A.
