Aim: To evaluate the prognostic role of mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatectomy. Patients & methods: A total of 289 HCC patients were classified into two groups based on the cut-off value of MCHC. Significant prognostic factors were screened by univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: Low MCHC value was significantly associated with tumor diameter (p = 0.004) and vascular invasion (p = 0.038). Besides, Cox regression analysis showed that low MCHC was significantly associated with poor prognostic outcomes with HCC after hepatectomy (overall survival: hazard ratio: 0.372; 95% CI: 0.206-0.672; p = 0.001; recurrence-free survival: hazard ratio: 0.450; 95% confidence interval: 0.317-0.638; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Preoperative MCHC can predict prognosis for patients with HCC, and the lower MCHC value was associated with poor prognosis after hepatectomy.
