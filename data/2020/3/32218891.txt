The staging and treatment of intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial. According to the recommendations of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system, patients with intermediate HCC are candidates for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. However, not all patients with intermediate HCC benefit from transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Therefore, it is meaningful to propose a novel staging system of intermediate HCC in order to allocate different treatments for different subgroups. Bolondi et al proposed the first subclassification system of intermediate HCC. Subsequently, investigators performed studies to validate the feasibility of Bolondi' s criteria and proposed several novel staging systems. The present study reviewed the literatures and provided a general overview of the evolution and current status of the subclassification of intermediate HCC. We propose to expand the indication of liver resection and add radical treatments as the first option of the treatment for patients with intermediate HCC.
