Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. HCC is also is a tumor with a distinct ability to invade and grow within the hepatic vasculature. Approximately 20% of patients with HCC have macrovascular invasion (MVI) at the time of diagnosis. MVI is associated with dismal prognosis, with median survival ranging from 2 to 5 months. Current staging systems designate MVI as advanced disease. Recent advances in multimodal approaches, including systemic therapies, radiation therapy, liver-directed therapies, and surgical approaches, in the treatment of HCC with MVI have rendered this disease process more treatable with improved outcomes and are discussed here.
