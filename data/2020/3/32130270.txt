Background & aim:In clinical practice, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been widely used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) beyond as well as within guideline recommendations. Here we aimed to verify whether two consecutive non-responses could be an optimal criterion for creating a rule to stop TACE being performed on these patients.Methods:This study evaluated 200 patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria, initially treated with TACE. TACE response was determined using the mRECIST criteria via dynamic CT or MRI. Median follow-up duration was 23.9 months.Results:Within the 200 patients analyzed, 183 (91.5%) were male, with a total median age of 59.8 years. The mean size of the largest tumor was 6.8 cm, with 80 (40.0%) patients with â‰¥4 tumors. After the first TACE procedure, complete response, partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease were observed in 48 (24.0%), 87 (43.5%), 59 (29.5%) and 6 (3.0%) of patients, respectively. 45 (22.5%) patients showed no objective response (OR) following two consecutive TACE sessions. Of these, 28 received a subsequent TACE, with a 10.7% OR rate. Patients without OR showed poorer survival when compared to patients who achieved OR after repeated TACE. Multivariable analysis showed that size of the largest tumor >5cm and high alpha-fetoprotein of >200 ng/mL were significant factors associated with failure of OR to two consecutive TACE sessions.Conclusion:Patients showing no OR to two consecutive TACE sessions will present a poor OR to subsequent TACE procedures. Early transition to systemic therapy may be advocated in such cases.
