The epigenetic silencing mechanism of suppressor 3 of cytokine signaling (SOCS3) in cancers has not been fully elucidated. Polycomb repressive complexes 2 (PRC2), an important epigenetic regulatory factors, exerts a critical role in repressing the initial phase of gene transcription. Whether PRC2 participates the down- regulation of SOCS3 in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear and how does PRC2 be recruited target gene still needs to explore. In this study, Using TCGA HCC dataset, and detecting HCC tissue specimens and cell lines, we found that SOCS3 expression in HCC was inversely related to that of EZH2, and depended on its promoter methylation status. CTCF, vigilin, EZH2 and H3K27me3 were enriched at CTCF and EZH2 binding sites on the methylated SOCS3 gene promoter. The depletion of CTCF did not affect expression of EZH2 and DNMT1, but decrease recruitment of CTCF, vigilin, EZH2 and H3K27me3. Further, knockdown of CTCF led to a loss of methylation of the methylated SOCS3 promoter, which sequentially increased the expression of SOCS3 and decreased the expression of pSTAT3, the downstream effector. These findings suggest that the CTCF dependent recruitment of EZH2 to the SOCS3 gene promoter is likely to participate in the epigenetic silencing of SOCS3 and in regulating its gene expression.
