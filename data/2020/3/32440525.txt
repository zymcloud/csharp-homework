Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is one of the few treatment options available for infiltrative hepatocellular carcinoma with tumor in vein. This is backed by the published data showing marginally favorable toxicity profile compared with other locoregional and systemic therapies. Although lung shunt fraction studies are performed to prevent radiation injury to the lungs, TARE-induced embolization/metastasis to the lungs has not been reported before. We report an intriguing case of new lung metastases within 1 month after TARE for infiltrative hepatocellular carcinoma with a tumor in the vein, with only a slightly elevated but acceptable lung shunt fraction. This report brings to light the possibility of such a complication and argues for improved preprocedural assessment of a tumor in vein burden and embolization potential.
