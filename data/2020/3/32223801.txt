We aimed to explore the potential prognostic impact of the metastatic site on the management approach and prognosis of stage IV colorectal cancer patients with synchronous metastases. Synchronous metastatic colorectal cancer patients reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database between 2010 and 2013 were included in this study. Overall survival (OS) was compared between patients with different treatment options using risk-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models. Overall, 17,776 patients with stage IV colorectal cancer were identified. Of these patients, 2,052 (11.5%) underwent surgical resection for tumors at both the primary and metastatic sites. Patients who underwent surgical resection of both primary and metastatic sites with liver, lung, and simultaneous liver and lung metastases had a longer median OS (P < 0.001) than patients who underwent nonsurgical treatments. Cox regression analysis revealed that surgical resection of both primary and metastatic sites was associated with a significantly enhanced OS (P < 0.001). Colorectal cancer patients with hepatic or pulmonary metastases, who underwent metastasectomy, even in selected patients with both hepatic and pulmonary metastases after multidisciplinary evaluation, could have a better survival benefit than patients who underwent nonsurgical treatments.
