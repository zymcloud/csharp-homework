Nucleotide binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) is a recognized innate immune sensor which can initiate potent immune response against pathogens. Many innate immune sensors have been reported to be of great importance in carcinogenesis. However, the role of NOD2 in cancer is not well understood. Here we investigated the role of NOD2 in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We demonstrated that NOD2 deficiency promoted hepatocarcinogenesis in N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN)/carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced HCC mice model and xenograft tumor model. In vitro investigation showed that NOD2 acted as a tumor suppressor and inhibited proliferation, colony formation and invasion of HCC cells. Clinical investigation showed that NOD2 expression was completely lost or significantly downregulated in clinical HCC tissues, and loss of NOD2 expression was significantly correlated with advanced disease stages. Further investigation showed that NOD2 exerted its anti-tumor effect through activating adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) -activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, and NOD2 significantly enhanced the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib, lenvatinib and 5-FU treatment through activating AMPK pathway induced apoptosis. Moreover, we demonstrated that NOD2 activated AMPK pathway by directly binding with AMPKÎ±-LKB1 complex, which led to autophagy-mediated apoptosis of HCC cells. Altogether, this study showed that NOD2 acted as a tumor suppressor as well as a chemotherapeutic regulator in HCC cells by directly activating AMPK pathway, which indicated a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment by upregulating NOD2-AMPK signaling axis.
