The protective effect and mechanism of action of p-coumaric acid for alleviating palmitic acid (PA)-induced hepatocyte injury were investigated using a PA-induced human hepatoma cell (HepG2)-based hepatocellular injury model and MTT cell viability determinations. Additionally, reduced glutathione content and catalase activity were detected using commercial kits, while intracellular lipid accumulation and total triglyceride content were measured using Oil Red O staining and a triglyceride quantification kit, respectively. Meanwhile, levels of proteins (fatty acid synthase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1) and proliferator-activated receptor-α mRNA were determined using western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively. After p-coumaric acid targets were identified using network pharmacological analysis, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression was assessed via western blotting, while prostaglandin E2 accumulation was measured via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Notably, PA-treated hepatocytes exhibited increased viability (87.3 ± 2.2% vs 65.5 ± 2.5% for untreated cells), with reduced intracellular lipid accumulation reflecting promotion of lipolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation; this protective effect may depend on inhibition of both PA-induced HepG2 cell COX-2 expression and PGE2 accumulation.
