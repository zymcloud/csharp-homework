Background:To explore the role of preoperative prealbumin levels in predicting the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer.Methods:A total of 989 gastric cancer patients in the Affiliated Tumour Hospital of Harbin Medical University who underwent gastrectomy were included in this retrospective study. The preoperative prealbumin level, clinicopathological data, and follow-up data were recorded. According to the maximum chi-square survival correlation value, the survival of patients with low preoperative prealbumin (<140 mg/L) and high preoperative prealbumin (≥140 mg/L) were compared using the log-rank test and the Cox proportional hazard regression model.Results:Based on the best cut-off value of 140 mg/L, we divided the patients into the lower prealbumin group (<140 mg/L) and the higher prealbumin group (≥140 mg/L). Compared with the higher prealbumin group, the lower prealbumin group were older and had larger tumor volumes, lower hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and more upper gastric cancer tumors. The univariate analysis showed that prealbumin and other clinicopathological factors, including age, hemoglobin, tumor size, macroscopic type, cell differentiation, liver metastasis, operation type, N stage, and T stage, were significant prognostic factors. The multivariable analysis showed that age, prealbumin, macroscopic type, location, T stage, and N stage were independent prognostic factors.Conclusions:The preoperative prealbumin level was an independent prognostic factor for patients with gastric cancer. The preoperative prealbumin level can be used to predict the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer and guide clinical practice.
