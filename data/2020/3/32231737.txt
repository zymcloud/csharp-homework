The increasing incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major challenge worldwide. In the past few years, an increasing number of studies have suggested that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play an important role in the development of human tumors, including HCC, but our understanding of their function is still limited. In this study, we investigated differences in the expression of circRNA MAN2B2 (circMAN2B2) in hepatocellular tissues and paired normal tissues. We found that knockdown of circMAN2B2 expression in the HCC cell lines Hep-G2 and Huh-7 significantly inhibited cell proliferation by sponging (miRNA) miR-217 and inhibiting its function. Through a series of experiments, we also demonstrated that miR-217 functioned as a tumor suppressor molecule in HCC cells and regulated the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1). Restoration of MAPK1 rescued repression of cell proliferation induced by circMAN2B2 knockdown. In summary, our study indicated that circMAN2B2 acted as an onco-miRNA in HCC by sponging miRNA-217 to promote MAPK1 expression.
