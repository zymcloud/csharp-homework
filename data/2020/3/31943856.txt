Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer and is extremely harmful to human health. In recent years, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation in eukaryotic mRNA has been increasingly implicated in cancer pathogenesis and prognosis. In this study, we downloaded the expression profile and clinical information of 307 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and 64 patients from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and univariate Cox analysis revealed that METTL14 was a prognostic m6A RNA methylation regulator. For further study on the related genes of METTL14, weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to find the relationship between METTL14 and gene expression, and univariate Cox analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methods were used to identify hub genes that may be associated with HCC prognosis. The results indicated that cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2, and suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 were key genes affecting the prognosis of HCC patients, and m6A methylation of these mRNAs may be regulated by METTL14. Finally, a nomogram was constructed based on the hub gene expression levels, and its prediction accuracy and discriminative ability were measured by the C-index and a calibration curve. In conclusion, METTL14, an m6A RNA methylation regulator, may participate in the malignant progression of HCC by adjusting the m6A of cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2, and suppressor of cytokine signaling 2, and these genes are useful for prognostic stratification and treatment strategy development.
