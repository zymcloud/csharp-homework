A new azaphilone, chaephilone E, eight azaphilone derivatives, and three chaetoglobosins were isolated from endophytic fungi Chaetomium globosum. The structures of the compounds were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR as well as HR-ESI-MS data, and the absolute configuration of chaephilone E was established on the basis of electronic circular dichroism and NOESY spectrum. The activity of chaephilone E was evaluated via the cytotoxic assay (human hepatoma cell lines HepG-2) and brine shrimp (Artemia salina) bioassay.
