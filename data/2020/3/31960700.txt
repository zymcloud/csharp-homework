We present a case of rhabdomyolysis related to treatment with sorafenib in a patient with multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma. Rhabdomyolysis is a severe situation and potentially fatal. There are no laboratory data that can predict this condition. Early diagnosis is essential for prognosis. Rhabdomyolysis has been described as an adverse reaction of several drugs but it is not frequently related to sorafenib.
