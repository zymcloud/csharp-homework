H19 is a long non-coding RNA [lncRNA] which was firstly described as an oncofetal transcript. The imprinted gene is normally expressed from the maternal allele. However, this pattern of imprinting is dysregulated in several cancers leading to aberrant up-regulation of H19 in malignant tissues. Several studies have utilized this aberrant expression pattern to find specific biomarkers for detection of cancer in tumoral tissues or peripheral blood. Moreover, single nucleotide polymorphisms within H19 have been associated with risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer. Taken together, H19 is regarded as a biomarker for cancer and a putative therapeutic target in these human disorders.
