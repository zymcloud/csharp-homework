During recombinant Adeno-associated virus (AAV) production, a proportionately large amount of vectors is released in the culture supernatant, which is often discarded. It has been shown that these vectors often associate with vesiculated structures, such as exosomes. Exosome-associated AAV (vexosomes) represent an additional gene-delivery platform. The efficiency of such vexosomes in suicide gene therapy is unexplored. In the present study, we have generated AAV serotype 6 vexosomes containing an inducible caspase 9 (iCasp9) suicide gene by a differential ultracentrifugation-based protocol. We further tested the cytotoxic potential of these vexosomes in a human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) model in vitro and in vivo. The AAV6-iCasp9 containing vexosomes, when primed with a pro-drug (AP20187), demonstrated a significant loss in cell viability (57% ± 8% versus 100% ± 4.8%, p < 0.001) in comparison to mock-treated Huh7 cells. An intratumoral administration of AAV6-iCasp9 vexosomes and AP20187 in a murine xenograft model revealed a 2.3-fold increase in tumor regression in comparison to untreated animals. These findings were further corroborated by histological analysis and apoptosis assays. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of AAV6 vexosomes in a xenotransplantation model of HCC. Furthermore, the simplicity in production and isolation of vexosomes should further facilitate its application in other malignancies.
