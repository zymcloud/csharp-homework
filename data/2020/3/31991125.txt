Aerobic glycolysis promotes metastasis and correlates with poorer clinical outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the controllers and mechanisms of abnormally activated glycolysis remain unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that the fifth component of the constitutive photomorphogenic 9 (COP9) signalosome complex (COPS5/CSN5) was a controller of glycolysis. For the first time, we found that CSN5 could influence the expression of glycolytic metabolism-associated proteins, especially hexokinase 2 (HK2), a glycolytic rate-limiting enzyme. In addition, we found that CSN5 was associated with HK2 overexpression in HCC tissues. Silencing CSN5 expression caused a decrease in the level of the HK2 protein, glucose uptake, glycolysis capacity and the production of glycolytic intermediates in HCC cells. Re-expression of HK2 rescued the decreased glycolytic flux induced by CSN5 knockdown, whereas inhibition of HK2 alleviated CSN5-enhanced glycolysis. Functionally, CSN5 regulated HCC cell invasion and metastasis via HK2-mediated glycolysis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that CSN5 attenuated the ubiquitin-proteasome system-mediated degradation of HK2 through its deubiquitinase function. Inhibition of CSN5 kinase activity by curcumin decreased HK2 protein expression and glycolysis, repressed the metastasis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo, and prolonged the survival time of tumor-bearing nude mice. Overall, our study identified CSN5 as a controller of glycolysis, and it may be a potential treatment target for HCC.
