Background: Echinochrome (Ech) is a common pigment present in sea urchins, which has antioxidant, antimicrobial, antialgal, hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic activities.Purpose: The present investigation assessed the anticancer and antioxidant activities of Ech against the Ehrlich ascites carcinoma tumor model in mice.Methods: Forty female mice were divided into four groups (n = 10). All groups except the group I received EAC cells (5 Ã— 106 cells/mouse i.p.). Group I, served as saline control (5 ml/kg 0.9% NaCl w/v p.o); group II served as EAC; groups III and IV received Ech (1 mg/kg body weight i.p.), and reference drug (5-Fu, 20 mg/kg body weight i.p.) respectively. Tumor markers, hematological parameters, liver functions, kidney functions and oxidative stress markers were analyzed in the present study.Results: A significant decrease (p < 0.05) were detected in the tumor volume, tumor cell counts, tumor cells viability, WBC count, MDA, urea, uric acid, AST, ALT, and ALP levels in Ech-treated mice. Furthermore, Ech-treated mice showed significant increases in RBCs count, Hb, Pt, GSH, CAT, and GST levels.Conclusion: The study results revealed that echinochrome suppresses tumor growth, decreases lipid peroxidation and improves the antioxidant status.
