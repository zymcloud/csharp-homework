Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the sixth most common malignancy worldwide, is characterized by a dismal prognosis due to high recurrence and metastasis rates. Thus, the need for the development of novel chemotherapeutic drugs is urgent. Cyclovirobuxine D (CVB-D), a steroidal alkaloid extracted from Buxus microphylla that has been extensively used to relieve the symptoms of cardiovascular diseases, has shown promising antineoplastic effects in recent studies. However, the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of CVB-D on HCC remain largely unelucidated. This study experimentally indicated that CVB-D can repress HCC cell proliferation by arresting the cell cycle in G2 phase and can facilitate apoptosis. In addition, the migratory and invasive capabilities of HCC cells were noticeably attenuated by a nonlethal dose of CVB-D, and this attenuation was correlated with the inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, in vivo, CVB-D displayed excellent anticancer effects in HCC tumor-bearing nude mice. Regarding the molecular mechanisms of CVB-D activity, decreased Slug expression was determined to be associated with the aforementioned anti-HCC functions of this extract, which might be regulated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) through the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-associated PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Collectively, our results revealed the suppressive effects of CVB-D on progressive behaviors of HCC, including proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT, in addition to its outstanding proapoptotic effects, which were correlated with the inhibition of the EGFR-FAK-AKT/ERK1/2-Slug signaling pathway. These discoveries provide an experimental and theoretical foundation for the use of CVB-D as a promising candidate for HCC therapy.
