Posttransplant malignancy has become a significant cause of mortality. Data on the long-term outcomes of patients with pretransplant nonhepatic malignancy (PTM) after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) are scarce, although the recipients of other organs with PTM have been reported to have a poor survival. Fifteen patients with PTM (4.4%) among the 342 adult recipients were identified in our LDLT programs. The outcomes of the patients with PTM after LDLT were compared to those of patients without PTM in terms of the all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality (defined as mortality related to malignancy expect for hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, or neuroendocrine tumor). The sites of PTM included the breast in six, stomach in two, and colon, lung, kidney, uterine, thyroid, larynx, and acute myelogenous leukemia in one each. The median interval from the PTM treatment to LDLT was 57 months (range, 2-298). The patients who received the curative treatment for PTM were selected as the recipients. No patients with PTM had recurrence during the follow-up period. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year patient survival rates were 100%, 92.9%, and 92.9% in the PTM group and 86.2%, 76.7%, and 68.5% in the non-PTM group, respectively (p = 0.142). Likewise, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the cancer-specific mortality. In conclusion, the patients with PTM had comparable outcomes with regard to mortality and cancer-specific mortality compared with those without PTM. This study showed that the patients with PTM can obtain an acceptable outcome after LDLT when carefully selected.
