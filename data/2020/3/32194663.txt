The identification of novel and accurate biomarkers is important to improve the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). C-Type lectin domain family 4 member M (CLEC4M) is involved in the progression of numerous cancer types. However, the clinical significance of CLEC4M in HCC is yet to be elucidated. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the involvement of CLEC4M in HCC progression. The expression level of CLEC4M was determined in tumor, and their corresponding adjacent non-tumor tissues derived from 88 patients with HCC, using immunohistochemistry, western blot and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. The correlation between CLEC4M expression and certain clinicopathological characteristics was retrospectively analyzed. The results suggested that CLEC4M was specifically labeled in sinusoidal endothelial cells, in both HCC and non-tumor tissues. Moreover, the expression of CLEC4M in tumor tissues was significantly lower than that in non-tumor tissues (P
