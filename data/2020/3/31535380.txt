Numerous studies have reported that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) dysregulation is involved in the progression of many malignant tumors, including glioma. The lncRNA ZNFX1 antisense RNA 1 (ZFAS1) plays an oncogenic role in various malignant tumors, such as gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of ZFAS1 in glioma has not been fully clarified. In this study, we found that the expression of ZFAS1 was upregulated in both glioma tissues and cell lines. Functional experiments revealed that ZFAS1 promoted glioma proliferation, migration and invasion, and increased resistance to temozolomide in vitro. By using online databases, RNA pull-down assays and luciferase reporter assays, ZFAS1 was demonstrated to act as a sponge of miR-150-5p. Furthermore, proteolipid protein 2 (PLP2) was shown to be the functional target of miR-150-5p. Rescue experiments revealed that ZFAS1 regulated the expression of PLP2 by sponging miR-150-5p. Finally, a xenograft tumor assay demonstrated that ZFAS1 promoted glioma growth in vivo. Our results showed that ZFAS1 promoted glioma malignant progression by regulating the miR-150-5p/PLP2 axis, which may provide a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of glioma.
