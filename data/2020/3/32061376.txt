Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a major role in cancer immunotherapy. A potent tumor immunotherapy may not only require activation of anti-tumor effector cells but also rely on the use of cytokines to create a controlled environment for the development of anti-tumor T cells. In this study, we fabricated a dual-target immunonanoparticle, e.g. poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticle, by loading Interleukin-12 (IL-12) and modifying with CD8 and Glypican-3 antibodies on the surface. Our results demonstrate that the fabricated targeting immunonanoparticles bind specifically to the two target cells of interest, i.e. CD8+ T cells and HepG-2 cells via the antibody-antigen interactions and form T cell-HepG-2 cell clusters, which enhances the cytotoxicity of T cells. IL-12-containing dual-target immunonanoparticles delivered IL-12 specifically to CD8+ T cells, and favored the expansion, activation and cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T lymphocytes. These results suggest that dual-target IL-12-encapsulated nanoparticles are a promising platform for cancer immunotherapy.
