Background:Polyphyllin VI (PPVI), a bioactive component derived from a traditional Chinese herb Paris polyphylla, exhibits potential antitumor activity against hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as breast and lung cancers. However, its effect on glioma remains unknown.Methods:Five glioma cell lines (U251, U343, LN229, U87 and HEB) and an animal model were employed in the study. Anti-proliferation effects of PPVI were first determined using CCK-8 cell proliferation and clone formation assays, then reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell cycle progression and apoptosis effects measured by flow cytometry. The effect of PPVI on protein expression was quantified by Western blot analysis.Results:Data showed that PPVI inhibited the proliferation of glioma cell lines by modulating the G2/M phase. Additionally, incubation of cells with PPVI promoted apoptosis, autophagy, increased accumulation of ROS and activated ROS-modulated JNK and p38 pathways. On the other hand, N-acetyl cysteine, a ROS inhibitor, attenuated PPVI-triggered effects. Furthermore, JNK and p38 inhibitors ameliorated PPVI-triggered autophagy and apoptosis in glioma cells. In vivo assays showed that PPVI inhibited tumor growth of U87 cell line in nude mice.Conclusion:Overall, these data suggested that PPVI might be an effective therapeutic agent for glioma.
