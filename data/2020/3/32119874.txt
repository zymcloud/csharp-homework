Coordinated assembly of viral and host factors is essential for the successful propagation of viruses as well as the generation of host antiviral response. Previous studies from our group, as well as from other groups, have identified host proteins interacting with various components of the hepatitis E virus (HEV). However, the functional relevance of host protein interactions in HEV replication context has been notably overlooked. The present study reports that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), namely hnRNPK, hnRNPA2B1, hnRNPH, PCBP1 and PCBP2, interact with HEV RNA promoter and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to regulate HEV replication. We found that hnRNPK and hnRNPA2B1 are the virus-supportive factors interacting with HEV RNA at promoter regions along with HEV polymerase protein, which are essential for HEV replication in the cells. Contrarily, hnRNPH, PCBP1 and PCBP2 are the antiviral factors that interact exclusively with HEV genomic promoter and inhibit HEV replication in Huh7 S10-3 cells. In vitro RNA-binding assays revealed that the antiviral hnRNP proteins hamper the binding of virus-supportive hnRNP proteins at HEV genomic promoter. In the binding reaction, the binding of HEV polymerase protein to the genomic promoter is slightly affected by the presence of antiviral hnRNPH. In an effort of visualizing the subcellular localization of hnRNP proteins in the HEV replication scenario in the Huh7 cells, we showed that hnRNPK, hnRNPA2B1, hnRNPH, PCBP1 and PCBP2 redistribute from nucleus to cytoplasm. In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of hnRNP proteins in HEV replication regulation.
