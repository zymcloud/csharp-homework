Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious problem due to its extensive worldwide distribution and poor prognosis including cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. The hepatitis B surface antigen(HBsAg) is a vital serum marker in HBV infection and a major obstacle for effective and subsequently virus clearance. However, Current anti-HBV drugs, such as nucleos(t)ide analogs (NA) and PegIFN, do not meet ideal result of sustained HBsAg loss (defined as functional cure). Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify a new compound targeting HBsAg. In this study, nobiletin was screened out from 1500 compounds due to its low cytotoxicity and high antiviral activity. The effect of nobiletin on HBV was determined in HepG2.2.15 and HepG2-NTCP cells. Furthermore, the antiviral capability of nobiletin was also verified in vivo. Unlike entecavir (ETV) therapy, which reduced HBV DNA but do not lead to an effective reduction in HBsAg, nobiletin significantly reduced the level of HBsAg as well as lowered HBV DNA in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, combination of nobiletin and ETV led to broad reductions of both HBV DNA and HBsAg level. This study may shed light on the development of a novel class of anti-HBV agents.
