Exhaustion of antigen-specific T-cells in order to escape immune destruction is frequently seen in chronic viral infection and different types of cancer. Blockade of overexpressed negative co-stimulatory pathways, a process known as immune checkpoint modulation, is a promising novel therapy that could improve the treatment of liver diseases with features of T cell exhaustion. We present a case of a 54-year-old hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive patient with an acute flare of hepatitis during nivolumab treatment for a stage IV lung carcinoma, an anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) immunotherapy. Retrospective testing of HCV RNA documented infection more than 6 months ago. Nivolumab treatment was associated with an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) flare reaching a peak value of 663 U/L, along with bilirubin levels of 0.74 mg/dL and no signs of coagulopathy. The assumption of a nivolumab-associated autoimmune hepatitis led to the interruption of the immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. However, a subsequent 1-log decrease of HCV RNA load was noticed, which raised the possibility of an immune reconstitution against the HCV-infected hepatocytes with cell lysis. Liver biopsy specimen demonstrated no evidence for autoimmune liver disease or fibrosis. Clinical evolution was favorable and serum transaminases returned to normal levels and HCV RNA load increased to baseline values following nivolumab cessation. The current case suggests an anti-HCV activity of anti-PD-1 treatment in the setting of concomitant HCV viremia and lung carcinoma.
