Aims:It has been demonstrated that reduced expression of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) led to reduced chemotherapeutic drugs resistance in various cancer cells. However, whether small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated knockdown of α7nAChR can reduce sorafenib (SOR) resistance in HCC cells remains to be determined.Materials and methods:The effects of α7nAChR-siRNA in combination with SOR treatment was analyzed in human (HepG2) and mouse (Hepa 1-6) HCC cell lines. The MTT, DAPI staining and flow cytometry assays were applied to measure the cell viability, apoptosis and cell cycle progression of the cells. Also, the changes in the mRNA and protein levels of the α7nAChR were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis, respectively.Key findings:The results revealed that SOR increased both mRNA and protein levels of α7nAChR in HCC cells. Treatment with α7nAChR-siRNA abolished these effects. Also, SOR treatment in combination with α7nAChR-siRNA significantly sensitizes HCC cells to SOR cytotoxicity. This combination therapy significantly induced HCC cells apoptosis compared to SOR alone.Significance:These experimental results indicate that knockdown of α7nAChR by siRNA increased the SOR antitumor activity of HCC cells and suggests that this additive combination is a promising drug candidate for HCC therapy.
