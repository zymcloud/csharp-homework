The anti-angiogenic drugs represented by sorafenib over the years have always been the first-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the drug resistance has always been a "bottleneck" in curative effect. Recently, aberrant expression of circular RNA (circRNA) is considered to play a crucial role in many types of cancers. However, the genome-wide expression pattern of circRNAs in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells remains unknown. Herein, we identified 1717 differentially expressed circRNAs with 559 up-regulated and 1158 down-regulated (fold change > 2, P < 0.05) in sorafenib-resistant (HUH7-S) HCC cells along with 582 differentially expressed circRNAs with 272 up-regulated and 310 down-regulated (fold change > 2, P < 0.05) in sorafenib-resistant (HepG2-S) HCC cells, compared to parental sorafenib-sensitive (HUH7, HepG2) HCC cells by high-throughput sequencing. In addition, GO (Gene Ontology) term enrichment analysis results revealed an enrichment for binding and catalytic activity and for biological regulation of metabolic processes in both the Huh7-S and HepG2-S cell lines compared to parental cell lines. Moreover, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) Pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes were significantly related to pathways in cancer. Among them, hsa_circ_0006294 and hsa_circ_0035944 expression were consistently down-regulated in resistant HCC cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate, using a global transcriptomic network, that the circRNA expression profile is significantly altered in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells and that the differentially expressed circRNAs may play important functions in HCC sorafenib resistance and HCC progression.
