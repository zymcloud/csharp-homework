Purpose:The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of underlying colorectal carcinoma (CRC) in a cohort of patients who experienced an episode of acute diverticulitis and to assess clinical and laboratory parameters that suggest CRC diagnosis.Methods:We performed a single center retrospective study in EMMS Nazareth Hospital from April 2014 to April 2018. All Patients who experienced an episode of acute diverticulitis and underwent a colonoscopy up to 6-month period were included in the study.Results:Two hundred twenty-five patients (225) patients were included. The mean age was 55.73 Â± 13.81 (24-93). One hundred thirty-nine (139) patients were males. Underlying CRC was diagnosed in 2 out of 225 (0.89%) patients and colonic polyps were found in 17 out of 225 patients (7.56%). The average time interval between the episode of diverticulitis and the performance of colonoscopy was 6 weeks. Male gender was significantly associated with CRC and polyp findings (P = 0.039). Moreover, platelet count (353,000 vs. 234,000, P = 0.002) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (223.65 vs. 127.4, P = 0.015) showed statistically significant correlation with CRC as compared to colonic polyps.Conclusion:The rate of underlying CRC diagnosis was extremely low after an episode of acute diverticulitis. Male gender and platelet to lymphocyte ratio were predictors for the presence of underlying CRC.
