Background:The present study aims to explore the functions of circular RNA hsa_circ_0004812 in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and its underlying molecular mechanisms.Methods:The expression of circular RNA (circRNA)_0004812 was examined using qRT-PCR and Western blot in blood and liver tissues from CHB patients and healthy volunteers. In the in vitro study, the expression levels of circular RNA hsa_circ_0004812, miR-1287-5p, interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-β were determined using qRT-PCR and Western blotting in HBV-infected hepatoma cells, respectively. Luciferase and biotin pull-down assays were used to investigate the interactions between miR-1287-5p and circ_0004812.Results:Levels of circ_0004812 were upregulated in CHB patients and HBV-infected hepatoma cells. Knockdown of circ_0004812 increased the expression of IFN-α and IFN-β in HBV-infected Huh7 cells. MiR-1287-5p was identified as a target of circ_0004812 whose overexpression inhibited the expression of miR-1287-5p. Additionally, circ_0004812 promoted the expression of Follistatin-related protein (FSTL) 1 through inhibiting miR-1287-5p. Circ_0004812/miR-1287-5p/FSTL1 axis regulated HBV-induced immune suppression.Conclusion:Circ_0004812 was identified as a potential target for CHB infection. Circ_0004812 promoted the expression of FSTL1 by inhibiting miR-1287-5p.
