A STRN-ALK fusion protein has been recently identified as a potential therapeutic target in multiple cancers; however, the role of STRN alone in regulating the biological function of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. In this study, we firstly detected an overexpression of STRN in HCC tissues compared to that in adjacent nontumour (ANT) tissues through IHC analysis, and the expression level of this protein was positively correlated with lymph node metastasis and TNM stage. In vitro, high expression of STRN was also confirmed in different HCC cell lines, and regulation of STRN expression in Huh7 cells did not significantly affect tumour cell proliferation or apoptosis but was positively correlated with tumour cell invasion and migration capacities. Moreover, both the knockdown and overexpression of STRN in Huh7 cells can lead to cell morphological changes that are accompanied with an alteration of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) molecular markers E-cadherin and Vimentin. Finally, STRN was further proved to be negatively related to E-cadherin expression but positively related to Vimentin expression in human HCC tissue samples. Taken together, STRN is upregulated in HCC and acts as a tumour promoter regulating cell invasion and migration through facilitating the EMT process.
