The X-ray repair cross-complementing (XRCC) gene family has been revealed to participate in the carcinogenesis and development of numerous cancers. However, the expression profiles and prognostic values of XRCCs (XRCC1-6) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been explored up to now. The transcriptional levels of XRCCs in primary HCC tissues were analyzed by UALCAN and GEPIA. The relationship between XRCCs expression and HCC clinical characteristics was evaluated using UALCAN. Moreover, the prognostic values of XRCCs expression and mutations in HCC patients were investigated via the GEPIA and cBioPortal, respectively. Last but not least, the functions and pathways of XRCCs in HCC were also predicted by cBioPortal and DVAID. The transcriptional levels of all XRCCs in HCC tissues were notably elevated compared with normal liver tissues. Meanwhile, upregulated XRCCs expression was positively associated with clinical stages and tumor grades of HCC patients. Survival analysis using the GEPIA database revealed that high transcription levels of XRCC2/3/4/5/6 were associated with lower overall survival (OS) and high transcription levels of XRCC1/2/3/6 were correlated with poor disease-free survival (DFS) in HCC patients. Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) demonstrated the possible mechanisms of XRCCs and their associated genes participating in the oncogenesis of HCC. Our findings systematically elucidate the expression profiles and distinct prognostic values of XRCCs in HCC, which might provide promising therapeutic targets and novel prognostic biomarkers for HCC patients.
