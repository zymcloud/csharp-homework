Nuclear Inhibitor of PP1 (NIPP1) is a conserved regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase PP1. The selective deletion of NIPP1 in mouse liver parenchymal cells or skin epidermal cells culminates in a late-onset hyperproliferation of a subset of resident progenitor cells. Although a hyperplastic phenotype is usually tumor promoting, we show here that the absence of NIPP1 conferred a strong resistance to chemically induced hepatocellular or skin carcinoma. The ablation of NIPP1 did not affect the metabolism of the administered mutagens (diethylnitrosamine or 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene), but reduced the conversion of mutagen-induced covalent DNA modifications into cancer-initiating mutations. This reduced sensitivity to mutagens correlated with an enhanced DNA-damage response and an augmented expression of rate-limiting DNA-repair proteins (MGMT in liver, XPD and XPG in skin), hinting at an increased DNA-repair capacity. Our data identify NIPP1 as a repressor of DNA repair and as a promising target for novel cancer prevention and treatment therapies.
