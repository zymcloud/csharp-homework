Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at increased risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and might eventually progress to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recommendations on whether to screen for NAFLD in diabetic patients remains conflicted between major guidelines. Transient elastography using FibroScan with CAP (controlled attenuation parameter) can assess both liver steatosis and fibrosis simultaneously. This paper took a new look at the prevalence of NAFLD and the severity of fibrosis among T2DM patients in Vietnam. The study was conducted using a cross-sectional design in T2DM adults who attended Dai Phuoc Ho Chi Minh Polyclinic and Polyclinic of Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine. Liver steatosis and fibrosis was assessed by FibroScan. NAFLD was diagnosed if CAP > 233 dB/m (steatosis > 5%). Data were analyzed using STATA 12 software program. We found that a total of 307 type 2 diabetic patients qualified for the study's criteria. The prevalence of NAFLD in T2DM patients based on FibroScan was 73.3%. Rates of mild, moderate and severe steatosis were 20.5%, 21.8% and 30.9%, respectively. The prevalence of significant fibrosis (≥ F2), advanced fibrosis (≥ F3) and cirrhosis (F4) was 13.0%, 5.9% and 3.6%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (OR: 1.067; 95% CI: 1.017-1.119; p = 0.008) and platelet levels (OR: 0.985; 95% CI: 0.972-0.999; p = 0.034) were independent of risk factors of advanced fibrosis. Thus, our study supports screening for NAFLD and for evaluating the severity of liver fibrosis in T2DM patients.
