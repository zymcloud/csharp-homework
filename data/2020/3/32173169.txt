Surgical intervention aids in maintaining quality of life in patients with recurrent metastatic head and neck carcinoma with mixed responses to nivolumab treatment. However, the mechanisms involved in these mixed responses remain unclear. Systemic chemotherapy using the EXTREME regimen was administered to the patient with hypopharyngeal carcinoma and liver metastases as well as cervical lymph node metastases. The patient was subsequently treated with nivolumab after developing signs of progressive disease. Although the hypopharyngeal tumors and liver metastases were well-controlled, cervical lymph node dissection was performed because of the enlargement of some of the lymph node metastases. Postoperative nivolumab administration was resumed, and this patient is presently alive and disease-free. Immediately after neck dissection, the LNs that responded and those that did not respond to nivolumab were separated and evaluated. The LNs that responded well to nivolumab presented with prominent interstitial fibrosis. Conversely, in LNs that enlarged after nivolumab, significant proliferation of the viable tumor cells and almost no degeneration or necrosis was observed. Additionally, we performed immunohistological assessments on pathologic samples of multiple lesions with differing responses to treatment. Targeted surgical intervention appears to be a valuable adjunct to treatment with nivolumab.
