Objective:Patients diagnosed with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatic cirrhosis have the potential for progression to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) even while undergoing long-term nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) therapy. This study investigated the predictors for the progression of hepatic cirrhosis to HCC under long-term NA therapy.Methods:This retrospective study enrolled 898 patients diagnosed with HBV-related hepatic cirrhosis. They received NA therapy between January 2012 and January 2015. The values for the liver stiffness measurement (LSM), laboratory tests, and disease history were collected. The diagnostic specificity of the serum, was assessed with a receiver operating characteristic curve.Results:The overall 2- and 3-year cumulative incidence of HCC was 6.8% and 15.15%, respectively. The LSM values were higher in the patients who had progressed to HCC. The serum PIVKA-II levels were more efficient than the serum AFP levels for the diagnosis of early HCC as the larger area under curve (0.866 vs. 0.687). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that HCC occurrence was significantly associated with the baseline LSM value (odds ratio = 1.035). At the end of the study, the death rate for the patients with larger LSM values was higher than that for those with lower LSM values (67.88% vs. 39.90%).Conclusion:Patients with HBV-related cirrhosis have the potential for progression to HCC even under long-term NA therapy. The LSM value and the serum PIVKA-II level are significant predictors of HCC occurrence.
