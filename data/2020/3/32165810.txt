Background:Hepatocellular cancer is the commonest liver cancer which contributes to a high incidence of morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries. Despite the anticipated high burden of the disease in the country, there is paucity of data on the associated risk factors and its pattern on imaging. The aim of this study was to assess Computed Tomography patterns and the risk factors of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:A cross-sectional, prospective study on patients with a diagnosis of HCC on Computed Tomography examination, at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital from July, 2016 to July, 2017. All patients who had characteristic Computed Tomography features and those who were diagnosed by Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)/biopsy and had Computed Tomography examination were included in the study. Risk factors identified were reviewed from patients' medical records.Result:A total of 70(n=70) patients were included in the study. The mean age was 50 Â± 16 years. Fifty-seven (81.4%) of the participants were males, and 13(18.6%) were females. Forty-five (64.3%) of them came from urban areas and 25(35.7%) of them were from rural areas. The lesions were focal in 52(74.3%) and infiltrative in 18(25.7%) of the cases. Vascular invasion and distant metastases were seen in 49(70%) and 17(24.3%) respectively. Twenty-nine (41%) had negative hepatitis markers, and 13(19%) were not investigated for hepatitis infection.Conclusion:The majority of the patients presented with advanced disease such as vascular invasion and metastases. The major risk factors such as hepatitis infection were negative in significant number of patients. The risk factors in our setting should be studied further. Moreover, high-risk group selection and screening is essential to diagnose HCC early.
