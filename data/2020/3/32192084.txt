We aimed to analyze the serum level of a novel fibrosis marker, Mac-2-binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi), and its predictive value for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) under nucleot(s)ide analogue (NA) therapy. Serum M2BPGi levels were quantified in 147 CHB patients at baseline, 48 weeks after starting NA therapy, and at the patients' last visit. The serum M2BPGi level serially decreased at each time point. During the median follow-up time of 6.6 years, 14 of 147 patients developed HCC. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis demonstrated that high serum M2BPGi at 48 weeks was an independent risk factor for HCC development. A cutoff value of M2BPGi at 48 weeks > 1.5 showed an adjusted hazard ratio = 34.9 (95% confidence interval, 4.3-284.9). The 3- and 5-year cumulative incidence of HCC in patients with low M2BPGi were 0.9% and 4.2%, respectively, whereas those in patients with high M2BPGi were 10.1% and 25.6%, respectively (p < 0.001). In conclusion, Serum M2BPGi level at 48 weeks is a useful predictor for HCC development in patients with CHB who receive NA therapy.
