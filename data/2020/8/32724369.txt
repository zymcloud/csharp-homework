Gastric cancer (GC) is the second most common cancer cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Recent studies have demonstrated the function of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of GC. miR-876-5p demonstrated an antitumor role in hepatocellular carcinoma and lung cancer; however, the function of miR-876-5p has not yet been fully identified in GC. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the role of miR-876-5p in GC. The results of the present study demonstrated low expression levels of miR-876-5p in GC tumor tissues. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-876-5p inhibited GC cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis, whilst miR-876-5p knockdown promoted GC cell proliferation and decreased cisplatin sensitivity of GC cells. Transforming growth factor Î²-receptor 1 was demonstrated to be a potential target gene of miR-876-5p. Overall, the results of the present study suggest that miR-876-5p plays an antitumor role in GC.
