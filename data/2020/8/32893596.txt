To systemically evaluate the efficacy and safety of Banmao Capsules in the adjuvant treatment for non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC). All of randomized controlled trials(RCT) about Banmao Capsules in adjuvant treatment for non-small cell lung cancer were retrieved in PubMed, EMbase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP, CBM, WanFang database from database inception to August 2019. Two researchers extracted data and assessed literature quality separately, and made a Meta-analysis by RevMan 5.3 software. Thirteen trials involving 1 148 patients, including 595 in treatment group and 553 in control group, were enrolled in the review. The Meta-analysis showed that compared with conventional treatment, adjuvant treatment of NSCLC with Banmao Capsules can enhance the objective tumor response rate(RR=1.43,95%CI[1.30,1.58],P<0.01), and the disease control rate(RR=1.16,95%CI[1.11,1.22],P<0.01); improve the quality of life(RR=1.56,95%CI[1.27,1.92],P<0.01); reduce the incidence of myelosuppression(RR=0.41,95%CI[0.26,0.66],P<0.01), gastrointestinal reactions(RR=0.46,95%CI[0.33,0.65],P<0.01), liver and kidney dysfunction(RR=0.44,95%CI[0.29,0.66],P<0.01). The results showed that in the treatment of NSCLC, Banmao Capsules can increase the short-term efficacy, improve the quality of life of patients, and reduce the side effects of platinum-based chemotherapy drugs. More high-quality and large-scale randomized controlled trials are required in the future.
