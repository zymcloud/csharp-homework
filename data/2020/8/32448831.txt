A 75-year-old woman with liver cirrhosis was admitted for treatment of portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Computed tomography (CT) showed PVT, massive ascites, and multiple abdominal organ embolism. Blood tests revealed a decreased liver function (Child-Pugh grade C). Language impairment followed by progressive left hemi-paralysis was subsequently detected. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple small acute cerebral infarctions and, on CT, a 30-mm bladder tumour; a biopsy specimen examination showed squamous cell carcinoma. Her general condition worsened rapidly, and the best supportive care was chosen. Our findings suggest that, in patients with PVT, Trousseau syndrome should be considered, even in cases of liver cirrhosis.
