Purpose:The early diagnosis of liver fibrosis is crucial for the prevention of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. As gold standard for staging liver fibrosis, liver biopsy is an invasive procedure that carries the risk of serious complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the residual neural network (ResNet), a non-invasive methods, for staging liver fibrosis using plain CT images.Methods:This retrospective study involved 347 patients subjected to liver CT scanning and liver biopsy. For each patient, we selected three axial images adjacent to the puncture location in the eighth or ninth inter-space on the right side. After processing and enhancement (rotation, translation, and amplification), these images were used as input data for the ResNet model. The model used a fivefold cross-validation method. In each fold, the images of approximately 80% of the total sample size (278 patients) were used for training the ResNet model, the other 20% (69 patients) were used for testing the trained network, with the liver biopsy pathology results as gold standard. The proportion of patients in each fibrosis stage was equal for training and test groups. The final result was the mean of the fivefold cross-validation in the test group. The performance of the ResNet model was evaluated for the test group by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.Results:For the ResNet model, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for assessing cirrhosis (F4), advanced fibrosis (F3 or higher), significant fibrosis (F2 or higher), and mild fibrosis (F1 or higher) was 0.97, 0.94, 0.90, and 0.91, respectively.Conclusions:The ResNet model analysis of plain CT images exhibited high diagnostic efficiency for liver fibrosis staging. As a convenient, fast, and economical non-invasive diagnostic method, the ResNet model can be used to assist radiologists and clinicians in liver fibrosis evaluations.
