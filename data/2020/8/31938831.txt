Purpose:We investigated the predictors of bile leakage after hepatic resection.Methods:The data of 270 consecutive patients who underwent curative hepatic resection in our institute between January, 2016 and April, 2019 were reviewed retrospectively. The patients were assigned to one of two groups according to the presence of bile leakage and the clinicopathological and surgical outcomes were analyzed. Bile leakage was defined by the International Study Group of Liver Surgery (ISGLS) grade.Results:There were no hospital deaths. The median intraoperative blood loss volume was 167 ml. Bile leakage occurred in 12 patients (4.4%), as ISGLS grade A leakage in 1 and as ISGLS grade B leakage in 11. The mean hospital stay was significantly longer for patients with bile leakage. High-risk procedures, hepatocellular carcinoma, and Albumin-Indocyanine Green Evaluation (ALICE) grade 3 were independent predictors of ISGLS grade B or C postoperative bile leakage. In patients with three high-risk factors, the incidence of bile leakage was 53.9%.Conclusions:Based on this retrospective analysis, high-risk procedures, hepatocellular carcinoma, and ALICE grade 3 were independent predictors of bile leakage in patients undergoing hepatic resection. Thus, special care must be taken during surgery to prevent bile leakage in patients with these risk factors.
