The introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) has revolutionized management and care of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, leading to cure rates higher than 90% in patients with advanced liver disease as well. Viral eradication has been associated with longer survival, reduced mortality from both hepatic and extrahepatic causes, improvement in liver function, and reduced incidence of HCV-related extrahepatic diseases. While patients with mild fibrosis can safely be discharged after achievement of a sustained virological response, patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis remain at risk of developing complications of liver disease, thus requiring regular and life-long surveillance. Major complications of cirrhosis that need to be monitored are hepatocellular carcinoma onset and development or progression of clinically significant portal hypertension.
