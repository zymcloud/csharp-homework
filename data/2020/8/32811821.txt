Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide. LncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 14 (SNHG14) functions as an oncogene in a variety of cancers. However, the role of SNHG14 in HCC remains elusive. The aim of this study is to unravel the functional role and regulatory mechanism of SNHG14 in HCC. A cohort of 40 HCC tumor tissues and paired adjacent normal tissues were collected. Histopathological changes were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemistry. qRT-PCR and western blotting were performed to determine the levels of SNHG14, PABPC1, and PTEN signaling molecules. CCK-8, immunofluorescence, and colony formation assays were conducted to monitor cell proliferation. Wound healing and tube formation assays were employed to determine cell migration and angiogenesis. ChIP assay was performed to investigate the enrichment of H3K27 acetylation in PABPC1 promoter. Xenograft mice model was constructed to further verify the SNHG14/PABPC1 axis in vivo. SNHG14 was highly expressed in HCC tissues and cells, which promoted cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis in Hep3B and HepG2 cells. PABPC1 functioned as a downstream effector of SNHG14. SNHG14 dramatically induced upregulation of PABPC1 via H3K27 acetylation. In addition, SNHG14/PABPC1 promoted cell proliferation and angiogenesis via PTEN signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo. SNHG14 promoted cell proliferation and angiogenesis via upregulating PABPC1 through H3K27 acetylation and modulating PTEN signaling in the tumorigenesis of HCC.
