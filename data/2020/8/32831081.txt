Background:DNA methylation is a common chemical modification of DNA in the carcinogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:In this bioinformatics analysis, 348 liver cancer samples were collected from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to analyse specific DNA methylation sites that affect the prognosis of HCC patients.Results:10,699 CpG sites (CpGs) that were significantly related to the prognosis of patients were clustered into 7 subgroups, and the samples of each subgroup were significantly different in various clinical pathological data. In addition, by calculating the level of methylation sites in each subgroup, 119 methylation sites (corresponding to 105 genes) were selected as specific methylation sites within the subgroups. Moreover, genes in the corresponding promoter regions in which the above specific methylation sites were located were subjected to signalling pathway enrichment analysis, and it was discovered that these genes were enriched in the biological pathways that were reported to be closely correlated with HCC. Additionally, the transcription factor enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were mainly enriched in the transcription factor KROX. A naive Bayesian classification model was used to construct a prognostic model for HCC, and the training and test data sets were used for independent verification and testing.Conclusion:This classification method can well reflect the heterogeneity of HCC samples and help to develop personalized treatment and accurately predict the prognosis of patients.
