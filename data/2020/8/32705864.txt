The biotransformation of a mixture of resveratrol and pterostilbene was performed by the protein secretome of Botrytis cinerea. Several reaction conditions were tested to overcome solubility issues and to improve enzymatic activity. Using MeOH as cosolvent, a series of unusual methoxylated compounds was generated. The reaction was scaled-up, and the resulting mixture purified by semipreparative HPLC-PDA-ELSD-MS. Using this approach, 15 analogues were isolated in one step. Upon full characterization by NMR and HRMS analyses, eight of the compounds were new. The antibacterial activities of the isolated compounds were evaluated in vitro against the opportunistic pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The selectivity index was calculated based on cytotoxic assays performed against human liver carcinoma cells (HepG2) and the human breast epithelial cell line (MCF10A). Some compounds revealed remarkable antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant strains of S. aureus with moderate human cell line cytotoxicity.
