The scale of the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) epidemic is staggering. It is estimated that 24 percent of the world's people have NAFLD [1]. By the year 2030, the United States will have approximately 100 million individuals with NAFLD, leading to a higher incidence of decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver-related death [2]. NAFLD is strongly associated with the metabolic syndrome and its individual components [3]. Unfortunately, relative to the scale of the epidemic, few public health dollars are spent on obesity and NAFLD prevention [4].
