Background:Genetic polymorphisms in the CXCL2 may participate in the progress of HBV-related HCC. However, no researches have evaluated the association between them.Methods:To figure out the effects of CXCL2 gene polymorphisms on the risk of HBV-related HCC, two major variants of CXCL2 and their association with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC), and HCC were conducted in a Guangxi population. CXCL2 polymorphisms rs9131 and rs3806792 were examined in 147 healthy controls, 138 CHB patients, 137 HBV-related LC patients, and 150 HBV-related HCC patients, using the SNaPshotâ„¢ genotyping technique.Results:No significant differences were found regarding the CXCL2 rs9131 and rs3806792 polymorphisms among the case groups (including CHB, LC, and HCC) and the healthy controls, no matter in comparisons of alleles, genotypes, or haplotypes. Similar insignificant results were also observed when subgroup analyses were performed in different gender. However, when compared the frequencies of allele and genotype in the healthy individuals of our research and those from the 1000 Genomes Project, CC and C for rs9131, and TT and T for rs3806792 of CXCL2 in our healthy controls were only similar with those in Han Chinese in Beijing, but significantly higher than other ethnicities; this indicates that these two polymorphisms of CXCL2 may be not associated with the pathogenesis of HBV-related HCC in Chinese population, but may play a role in other ethnicities.Conclusion:Our observation suggests that SNPs rs9131 and rs3806792 of CXCL2 gene might not contribute to the development of CHB, HBV-related LC, and HCC in a Guangxi population.
