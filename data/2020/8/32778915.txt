Purpose:Post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) is one of the most feared morbidities after liver resection (LR) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to investigate the incidence and predictors of PHLF after LR for HCC and its impact on survival outcomes.Methods:We reviewed the patients who underwent LR for HCC during the period between January 2010 and 2019.Results:Two hundred sixty-eight patients were included. Patients were divided into two groups according to the occurrence of PHLF, defined according to ISGLS. The non-PHLF group included 138 patients (51.5%), while the PHLF group included 130 patients (48.5%). Two hundred forty-six patients (91.8%) had hepatitis C virus. Major liver resections were more performed in the PHLF group (40 patients (30.8%) vs. 18 patients (13%), p = 0.001). Longer operation time (3 vs. 2.5 h, p = 0.001), more blood loss (1000 vs. 500 cc, p = 0.001), and transfusions (81 patients (62.3%) vs. 52 patients (37.7%), p = 0.001) occurred in PHLF group. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year Kaplan-Meier overall survival rates for the non-PHLF group were 93.9%, 79.5%, and 53.9% and 73.2%, 58.7%, and 52.4% for the PHLF group, respectively (log rank, p = 0.003). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year Kaplan-Meier disease-free survival rates for the non-PHLF group were 77.7%, 42.5%, and 29.4%, and 73.3%, 42.9%, and 25.3% for the PHLF group, respectively (log rank, p = 0.925). Preoperative albumin, bilirubin, INR, and liver cirrhosis were significant predictors of PHLF in the logistic regression analysis.Conclusion:Egyptian patients with HCC experienced higher PHLF incidence after LR for HCC. PHLF significantly affected the long-term survival of those patients.
