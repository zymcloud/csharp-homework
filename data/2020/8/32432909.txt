OBJECTIVE. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the outcome of new arterial phase enhancing nodules at MRI of cirrhotic livers, including clinical and imaging factors that affect progression to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to assess the diagnostic performance of Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2018 (LI-RADSv2018) versus version 2017 (LI-RADSv2017) in categorizing these nodules. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A database search identified 129 new arterial phase enhancing, round, solid, space-occupying nodules in 79 patients with cirrhosis who underwent surveillance MRI. Three readers assessed the nodules for LI-RADS findings and made assessments based on the 2017 and 2018 criteria. Clinical information and laboratory values were collected. Outcome data were assessed on the basis of follow-up imaging and pathology results. Interreader agreement was assessed. Logistic regression and ROC curve analyses were used to assess the utility of the features for prediction of progression to HCC. RESULTS. Of the 129 nodules, 71 (55%) progressed to HCC. LI-RADSv2017 score, LIRADSv2018 score, and mild-to-moderate T2 hyperintensity were significant independent predictors of progression to HCC in univariate analyses. Serum α-fetoprotein level, hepatitis B or C virus infection as the cause of liver disease, and presence of other HCCs were significant predictors of progression to HCC in multivariate analyses. The rates of progression of LI-RADS category 3 and 4 observations were 38.1% and 57.6%, respectively, for LI-RADSv2017 and 44.4% and 69.9%, respectively, for LI-RADSv2018. CONCLUSION. New arterial phase enhancing nodules in patients with cirrhosis frequently progress to HCC. Factors such as serum α-fetoprotein level and presence of other HCCs are strong predictors of progression to HCC.
