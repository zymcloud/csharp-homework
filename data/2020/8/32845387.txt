Objectives:To compare the diagnostic performances of first and second portal venous phases (PVP1 and PVP2) in revealing washout and capsule appearance for non-invasive HCC diagnoses in gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI (Gd-EOB-MRI).Methods:This retrospective study included 123 at-risk patients with 160 hepatic observations (HCCs, n = 116; non-HCC malignancies, n = 18; benign, n = 26) showing arterial phase hyper-enhancement (APHE) ≥ 1 cm at Gd-EOB-MRI. The mean time intervals from gadoxetic acid injection to PVP1 and PVP2 acquisitions were 53 ± 2 s and 73 ± 3 s, respectively. After evaluating image findings independently, imaging findings and diagnoses were finalized by a consensus of two radiologists using either PVP1 or PVP2 image sets according to the LI-RADS v2018 or EASL criteria. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were compared.Results:Among HCCs, more washout and enhancing capsule were observed in PVP2 (83.6% and 27.6%) than in PVP1 (50.9% and 19.8%) (p Conclusion:Late acquisition of PVP detected washout and enhancing capsule of HCC more sensitively than early acquisition, enabling accurate diagnoses of HCC, according to LI-RADS or EASL criteria.Key points:• Among HCCs, more washout and enhancing capsules were observed in PVP2 than PVP1, quantitatively and qualitatively. • The portal venous phase acquired at around 70 s after contrast media administration (PVP2) provided significantly higher sensitivity and AUC value than PVP1 by using LI-RADS v2018 or EASL criteria. • More HCCs were categorized as LR-5 in PVP2 than in PVP1 images, and the specificity of PVP2 (93.5%) was comparable with PVP1 (93.5%).
