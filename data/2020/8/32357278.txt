Telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) is closely involved in the regulation of telomere length, which plays critical roles in tumorigenesis. However, the biological significance of TERRA in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that HCC cells show a frequent downregulation of TERRA and its positive regulator TTAGGG repeat binding factor-1 (TRF1), whereas the negative regulator TTAGGG repeat binding factor-1 (TRF2) was upregulated. We found that TERRA, TRF1, and TRF2 contributed to poor prognosis of HCC patients. Importantly, we found that the downregulation of TERRA significantly promoted HCC cell growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo, whereas the upregulation of TERRA showed an opposite effect. Mechanistically, downregulation of TERRA significantly increased telomerase activity and promoted telomere elongation. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of TERRA overexpression on the growth and metastasis of HCC cells were reversed by treatment with TA-65 that activates telomerase activity. In contrast, the protumor effect of TERRA downregulation was reversed by treatment with TMPyP4 that inhibits telomerase activity. Our findings reveal that TERRA plays a critical role in HCC cell growth and metastasis, indicating that TERRA is a potential therapeutic target for HCC.
