Introduction:Ablation has become an effective treatment for small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Whilst ablation is a safe and effective technique, diaphragmatic injury is a rarely associated but significant complication.Case presentation: We present a case of a 67 year old patient who developed a diaphragmatic defect following microwave ablation (MWA) for HCC. The diaphragmatic defect progressed to herniation which was complicated by perforation of intrahernial large bowel. The patient was treated by emergency laparotomy and an extended right hemi-colectomy was performed.Conclusion:Our report adds to the current available knowledge on diaphragmatic injury following hepatic ablation and demonstrates the potential for life threatening consequences associated with this complication.
