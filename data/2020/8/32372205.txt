Aim:To compare clinico-radiological pattern of non-cirrhotic versus cirrhotic HCC and correlate them with histopathological tumor grade.Materials and methods:This prospective study was carried out on 94 patients enrolled following ultrasound diagnosis of a liver mass measuring > 3 cm. Multiphasic MDCT was performed on all treatment-na√Øve cases and 56 cases with imaging pattern consistent with unifocal HCC were selected. Background liver parenchyma was assessed on ultrasound for cirrhosis and NAFLD. Cases were categorized into cirrhotic liver (CL) and non-cirrhotic liver (NCL) groups with 26 and 30 cases, respectively, and guided biopsy of each liver mass was performed. AFP levels were compared in both groups. Serum markers for hepatitis B and C were assessed. Masses in both groups were compared for morphology, attenuation on each phase and washout time. Presence of capsule, corona enhancement, satellite nodules and portal vein invasion was noted.Results:AFP level was higher in CL group. HBV serum marker was raised in both groups. Most HCCs in NCL were moderately differentiated (histopathology), larger, had well-defined margins, showed mosaic pattern of enhancement, complete capsule and delayed phase washout. Majority in CL group were poorly differentiated, smaller, had ill-defined margins, showed heterogeneous enhancement, absent capsule and portal venous phase washout. Time of washout correlated with histopathological differentiation of masses, with earlier washout indicating poorer differentiation.Conclusion:HCCs in NCL have different clinico-radiological characteristics than HCCs in CL. Time of contrast washout correlates with histopathological grade of HCC. Non-cirrhotic NAFLD may require formulation of new screening guidelines for HCC.
