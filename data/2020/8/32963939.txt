Pyroptosis is a form of programmed cell death, and recently described as a new molecular mechanism of chemotherapy drugs in the treatment of tumors. Miltirone, a derivative of phenanthrene-quinone isolated from the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, has been shown to possess anti-cancer activities. Here, we found that miltirone inhibited the cell viability of either HepG2 or Hepa1-6 cells, and induced the proteolytic cleavage of gasdermin E (GSDME) in each hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line, with concomitant cleavage of caspase 3. Knocking out GSDME switched miltirone-induced cell death from pyroptosis to apoptosis. Additionally, the induction effects of miltirone on GSDME-dependent pyroptosis were attenuated by siRNA-mediated caspase three silencing and the specific caspase three inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK, respectively. Miltirone effectively elicited intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and suppressed phosphorylation of mitogen-activated and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) and extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) for pyroptosis induction. Moreover, miltirone significantly inhibited tumor growth and induced pyroptosis in the Hepa1-6 mouse HCC syngeneic model. These results provide a new insight that miltirone is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of HCC via GSDME-dependent pyroptosis.
