The mechanisms of the hypercoagulable state in cirrhotics with and without hepatocellular carcinoma are incompetently comprehended. Objective: We aimed to explore the plasma Annexin A5/PS + MP ratio in these patients. Higher levels of Annexin A5 and PhosphatidylSerine bearing microparticles have been observed in cases of inflammation and increased coagulation but there are no studies which explore if there is an association between them and PVT in cirrhotics with and without HCC. So, our goal is to estimate their role in predicting PVT within HCV cirrhotics with and without HCC. 91 HCV cirrhotics with and without HCC and 20 healthy people (controls) were enlisted. Cirrhotics with and without HCC who developed PVT displayed higher levels of PS + MPs and lower Annexin A5/PS + MPs ratio (38.73 ± 1.92) and (0.00238 ± 0.00047) than cirrhotics who didn't develop PVT (22.19 ± 10.58) and (0.00451 ± 0.0023) (P
