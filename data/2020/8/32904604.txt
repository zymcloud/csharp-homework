Purpose:This study aimed to investigate the functions of the circular RNA circMYLK (hsa_circ_0002768) in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to identify the underlying mechanisms of the circMYLK/miR29a/KMT5C axis.Materials and methods:Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was utilized to explore the expressions of circMYLK, miR-29a and KMT5C in HCC tissues and cells. A potential miRNA (miR-29a) regulated by circMYLK was also explored, and the target relationship between miR-29a and KMT5C was confirmed. FISH, qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to examine the circMYLK/miR29a/KMT5C signaling pathways involved in HCC development. Additionally, HCC cells were implanted into nude mice subcutaneously to test the role of circMYLK in tumor growth.Results:circMYLK was determined to be significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and cells. Suppression of circMYLK repressed HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while increasing apoptosis. In addition, FISH, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting, as well as dual-luciferase reporter assays, revealed that circMYLK could bind to miR-29a. In rescue experiments, miR-29a had the potential to eliminate the inhibitory effect of circMYLK knockdown in HCC. Moreover, miR-29a was found to target the KMT5C gene, which was positively regulated by circMYLK. Finally, a nude mouse tumorigenicity assay showed that injection of circMYLK siRNA into nude mice drastically suppressed xenograft tumor formation in vivo.Conclusion:Our current study demonstrated that circMYLK promotes HCC progression by acting as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-29a, which regulates the downstream oncogene KMT5C.
