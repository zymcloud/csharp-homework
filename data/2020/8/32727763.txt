Background/aim:To investigate the accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in differentiating benign and malignant portal vein thrombosis (PVT) complicating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), compared to diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI).Patients and methods:Forty-nine patients with HCC who had PVT were enrolled. The quantitative and qualitative parameters of CEUS were analysed. We examined the diagnostic performance of CEUS compared with DWI. The relationships between CEUS parameters and biomarkers were also assessed.Results:All qualitative CEUS parameters (e.g., arterial-phase enhancement, washout in the venous phase, vessel occlusion, and expansion) were significantly more common in malignant thrombosis than in benign thrombosis (p0.05). Several CEUS parameters exhibited significant correlations with the tumour marker and stage (pConclusion:CEUS was useful for characterisation of PVT and showed a consistent high diagnostic accuracy, compared to DWI.
