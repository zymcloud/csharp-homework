The main limiting factor for liver resection is insufficient future liver remnant (FLR). Portal vein embolization (PVE) is a standard of care treatment to induce FLR hypertrophy, but it is not always efficient. Radioembolization (RE) has a potential to induce liver hypertrophy for PVE-refractory patients. However, this was reported only for the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. We described two cases of lobar RE after PVE failure for the patients with colorectal liver metastases. This enabled to reach sufficient FLR, provide good local disease control and bridge the patients to extended hepatectomy.
