Objective:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the treatment modality for intermediate, or Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its beneficial effect on outcomes is still unsatisfactory. This study aimed to assess the outcomes of combined TACE and sorafenib for patients with intermediate HCC.Methods:Patients with intermediate HCC who were receiving TACE alone (the monotherapy group), or combined TACE and sorafenib (the combined therapy group) from January 2013 to June 2018 were enrolled.Results:Altogether 64 patients were enrolled, of whom 34 were assigned to the monotherapy group and 30 to the combined therapy group. A prolonged time-to-progression (TTP) (mean 14.46 mo vs 6.39 mo, P = 0.001) was noted in the combined therapy group compared with the monotherapy group. Overall survival (OS) (mean 18.96 mo vs15.44 mo, P = 1.000) between the two groups did not differ significantly. After adjustment, there were no significant differences in the 12-18 month mortality rate between the two groups.Conclusion:Patients with intermediate HCC receiving combined TACE and sorafenib had a better TTP, but not OS, than those receiving TACE alone.
