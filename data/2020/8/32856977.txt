Germ cell tumors (GCTs) represent the most common form of testicular neoplasms. Metastasis is common in testicular GCTs with lungs, liver, and brain being the common sites of distant tumor spread. Cutaneous metastasis is, however, seldom encountered in testicular GCTs. Herein, we report a rare case of testicular mixed GCT in a 28-year-old male presenting with cutaneous metastasis after orchiectomy. Moreover, the tumor was characterized by estradiol and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) cosecretion. Although hCG secretion is not uncommon, autonomous estradiol secretion from GCTs is an extreme oddity.
