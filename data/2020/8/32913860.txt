Background:Extrahepatic metastasis (EHM) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurs in 10%-15% of cases following initial treatment. The most frequent sites of EHM are the lung, lymph nodes, and bone. Gastrointestinal or brain metastasis from HCC is rarely reported. Here, we report a rare case of concurrent HCC metastases to the stomach, colon, and brain.Case summary:A 72-year-old male with a history of alcohol induced HCC presented with multiple intrahepatic recurrences and tumorous lesions in the stomach and ascending colon. Three years earlier, he underwent right hemihepatectomy, and 1 year ago, he had a video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection for pulmonary metastasis of HCC. We decided on surgical resection of the new metastases because of massive gastric bleeding and concern for possible colonic obstruction. The patient underwent gastric wedge resection and right hemicolectomy. Two weeks later, the patient developed dysarthria and mild cognitive disorder. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a left frontal lobe lesion, and he underwent resection of a metastatic brain tumor. Unfortunately, he died 6 weeks after the last surgery due to hepatorenal syndrome.Conclusion:Decision of surgery was carefully recommended in this case and may extend survival in other metastatic HCC patients with well-preserved hepatic function.
