Infarcted regenerative nodules in a cirrhotic liver is a rare condition that may be confused with hepatocellular carcinoma on imaging. We report here a case of a 58-year-old man with live cirrhosis who presented with abdominal pain and distension and sudden onset of haematemesis. Computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse multinodular infarcted regenerative nodules and gastric bleeding. Physicians should include infarcted regenerative nodules in any differential diagnosis of multiple hepatic lesions in liver cirrhosis, particularly in patients with gastrointestinal varices.
Liver cirrhosis; haemorrhage; hypotension; infarctions.
