The long noncoding RNA WEE2 antisense RNA 1 (WEE2-AS1) plays anoncogenic role in hepatocellular carcinoma and triple negative breast cancerprogression. In this study, we investigated the expression and roles of WEE2-AS1 inglioblastoma (GBM). Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms behind the oncogenicactions of WEE2-AS1 in GBM cells were explored in detail. WEE2-AS1 expressionwas detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The roles ofWEE2-AS1 in GBM cells were evaluated by the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, flowcytometric analysis, and Transwell cell migration and invasion assays, and tumorxenograft experiments. WEE2-AS1 expression was evidently enhanced in GBM tissuesand cell lines compared with their normal counterparts. An increased level of WEE2-AS1 was correlated with the average tumor diameter, Karnofsky Performance Scalescore, and shorter overall survival among GBM patients. Functionally, depleted WEE2-AS1 attenuated GBM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, promoted cellapoptosis, and impaired tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, WEE2-AS1 functionedas a molecular sponge for microRNA-520f-3p (miR-520f-3p) and consequentlyincreased specificity protein 1 (SP1) expression in GBM cells. A series of recoveryexperiments revealed that the inhibition of miR-520f-3p and upregulation of SP1 couldpartially abrogate the influences of WEE2-AS1 downregulation on GBM cells. Inconclusion, WEE2-AS1 can adsorb miR-520f-3p to increase endogenous SP1expression, thereby facilitating the malignancy of GBM. Therefore, targeting theWEE2-AS1-miR-520f-3p-SP1 pathway might be a promising therapy for themanagement of GBM in the future.
