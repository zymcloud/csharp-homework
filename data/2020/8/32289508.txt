Background:Brain metastases (BMs) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are rare, with a paucity of reported cases. In the present retrospective cohort report, we assessed the proportion of BMs arising from HCC and characterized the related details, including patient demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment modalities, and survival outcomes.Methods:We retrospectively identified and reviewed the medical records of 14 patients with BMs from HCC seen at our institution from 2008 to 2018.Results:Among all patients with BMs, the proportion originating from primary liver cancer was 0.39%. In every case (n = 14), the liver cancer was HCC. The median age at the BM diagnosis was 64 years (range, 37-82 years). The median alpha-fetoprotein level at the diagnosis of BM was 540 ng/mL (range, 3-10,000 ng/mL). The median interval from the HCC diagnosis to the development of BMs was 31.1 months (range, 3.17-107 months). Of the 14 patients, 8 (57%) had had metastases to the brain parenchyma and 6 had had skull or dural metastases. For patients with brain parenchymal metastases, the median number of metastases was 1 (range, 1-5). Of the 14 patients, 13 have died, with a median overall survival after the BM diagnosis of 2.83 months (range, 0.430-24.0 months). At the latest follow-up examination, the survival for the 14th patient was 142 months after the BM diagnosis. Resection of BMs with radiosurgery was associated with increased survival compared with radiosurgery alone (10.9 months vs. 2.8 months; P = 0.04).Conclusions:HCC BMs are rare and constitute a small fraction of the total incidence of BMs. The prognostic data we have provided can aid medical providers in caring for patients with HCC BMs.
