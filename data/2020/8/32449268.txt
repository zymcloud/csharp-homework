Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK) is a calcium/calmodulin kinase that plays a vital role as a suppressor gene in various cancers. Yet its role and target gene independent of p53 is still unknown in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we discovered that DAPK suppressed HCC cell migration and invasion instead of proliferation or colony formation. Using a proteomics approach, we identified DEAD-box helicase 20 (DDX20) as an important downstream target of DAPK in HCC cells and critical for DAPK-mediated inhibition of HCC cell migration and invasion. Using integrin inhibitor RGD and GTPase activity assays, we discovered that DDX20 suppressed HCC cell migration and invasion through the CDC42-integrin pathway, which was previously reported as an important downstream pathway of DAPK in cancer. Further research using cycloheximide found that DAPK attenuates the proteasomal degradation of DDX20 protein, which is dependent on the kinase activity of DAPK. Our results shed light on new functions and regulation for both DAPK and DDX20 in carcinogenesis and identifies new potential therapeutic targets for HCC.
