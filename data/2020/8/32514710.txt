To investigate lncRNAs acting as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) involved in oncogenesis and progression of HCC. Different expressed lncRNAs, microRNAs, and mRNAs (DElncRNAs, DEmiRNAs, DEmRNAs), downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, were identified by edgeR package. CeRNA network was constructed based on miRcode, TargetScan, and miRTarBase. Target DEmRNAs were annotated by KEGG pathway and GO analysis. Negatively correlated lncRNA-miRNA pairs were analyzed by Pearson correlation coefficient, simultaneously, overall survival (OS) were evaluated. The expression of these lncRNAs were examined in HCC cell lines and tissues through qRT-PCR. 1070 DElncRNAs, 147 DEmiRNAs and 1993 DEmRNAs were acquired. CeRNA network was successfully established, including 27 lncRNAs, 5 miRNAs, and 30 mRNAs significantly correlated with OS. The DEmRNAs were significantly enriched in "Cell Cycle" and "pathways in cancer". Six lncRNAs and 2 miRNAs were negatively correlated. These lncRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR. These observations will provide a novel perspective to elucidate HCC pathogenesis.
