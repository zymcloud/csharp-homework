Little is known about the incidence of late effects following non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) among adolescent and young adult (AYA, 15-39 years) survivors. Using data from the California Cancer Registry linked to hospital discharge, we estimated the cumulative incidence of late effects at 10 years among AYAs diagnosed with NHL during 1996-2012, who survived ≥2 years. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to investigate the influence of sociodemographic and clinical factors on the occurrence of late effects. Of 4392 HIV-uninfected patients, the highest incident diseases were: endocrine (18·5%), cardiovascular (11·7%), and respiratory (5·0%), followed by secondary primary malignancy (SPM, 2·6%), renal and neurologic (2·2%), liver/pancreatic (2·0%), and avascular necrosis (1·2%). Among the 425 HIV-infected survivors, incidence was higher for all late effects, especially over threefold increased risk of SPM, compared to HIV-uninfected patients (8·1% vs. 2·6%). In multivariable models for HIV-uninfected patients, public or no health insurance (vs. private), residence in lower socioeconomic neighbourhoods (vs. higher), and receipt of a haematopoietic stem cell transplant were associated with a greater risk of most late effects. Our findings of substantial incidence of late effects among NHL AYA survivors emphasise the need for longterm follow-up and appropriate survivorship care to reduce morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population.
