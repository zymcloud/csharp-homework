The feasibility and safety of microwave ablation in elderly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients remains unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of surgical microwave ablation for HCC in patients older than 80 years of age. This retrospective study enrolled consecutive 114 patients older than 80 years of age who underwent surgical microwave ablation for HCC between July 1994 and December 2017. We analyzed perioperative outcomes and long-term outcomes to clarify the prognostic factors. The 1-, 3-, 5-year overall survival and recurrence-free survival rates were 97.3%, 76.0%, 49.2% and 84.2%, 44.7%, and 32.5%, respectively. The overall major morbidity rates (Clavien-Dindo grade IIIA or above) were 2.6%. There were no cases of mortality. Multivariate analysis showed that hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV-Ab) positivity and the presence of multiple tumors were independent prognostic factors for long-term outcomes. The overall survival rate of patients with HCV-Ab negative and single tumor was better than that of other patients (p = 0.026). Surgical microwave ablation was feasible and safe for elderly patients with HCC. Elderly patients with HCV-Ab negative and single tumor would be expected to have better long-term outcomes after surgical microwave ablation.
