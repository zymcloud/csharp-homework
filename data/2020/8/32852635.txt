Background:How much difference there is between hepatic resection (HR) combined with intraoperative radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) in treatment of multifocal hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) remains unclear. This study compared outcomes for patients with multifocal HCCs meeting the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) criteria treated by LDLT or HR + RFA.Methods:A total of 126 consecutive Child-Pugh A patients with multifocal HCCs meeting the UCSF criteria, who underwent LDLT (n = 51) or HR + RFA (n = 75), were included. Propensity score (PS) matching was performed to adjust for baseline differences. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were calculated, and subgroup, multivariate and nomogram analyses were performed.Results:LDLT provided significantly better OS and RFS than did HR + RFA before and after PS matching and reduced the dropout rate on waiting list, but HR + RFA was more convenient, less invasive and less cost. Patients with all lesions located in the same lobe had better OS and RFS than those located in the different lobes after HR + RFA. Multivariate and nomogram analyses revealed that HR + RFA, alpha-fetoprotein â‰¥ 400 ng/mL, the major tumour size > 3 cm and microvascular invasion were independent predictors of poor prognosis.Conclusion:For Child-Pugh A patients with multiple HCCs meeting the UCSF criteria, LDLT may offer significantly better long-term results than did HR + RFA, and HR + RFA may still be considered as an acceptable curative therapy for those without considering transplantation or as a bridge treatment for a patient, with a plan for transplantation in the future.
