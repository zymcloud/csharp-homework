Management of chronic hepatitis B infection complicated by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in pregnancy poses a treatment dilemma as the pregnancy accelerates disease progression and narrows the diagnostic tools and therapeutic choices. Studies have reported higher maternal and fetal losses. We share our experience with a 36-year-old pregnant woman who presented at 35 weeks' gestation with a large painful nodular liver and significant weight loss. She tested HBsAg-positive and had both clinical and laboratory features of severe liver decompensation. The abdominal ultrasound rightly described HCC on a cirrhotic background. The fetus was delivered by cesarean section but the mother died soon after.
