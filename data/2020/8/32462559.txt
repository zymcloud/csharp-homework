Purpose:Air pollution and smoking are associated with various types of mortality, including cancer. The current study utilizes a publicly accessible, nationally representative cohort to explore relationships between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure, smoking, and cancer mortality.Methods:National Health Interview Survey and mortality follow-up data were combined to create a study population of 635,539 individuals surveyed from 1987 to 2014. A sub-cohort of 341,665 never-smokers from the full cohort was also created. Individuals were assigned modeled PM2.5 exposure based on average exposure from 1999 to 2015 at residential census tract. Cox Proportional Hazard models were utilized to estimate hazard ratios for cancer-specific mortality controlling for age, sex, race, smoking status, body mass, income, education, marital status, rural versus urban, region, and survey year.Results:The risk of all cancer mortality was adversely associated with PM2.5 (per 10 Âµg/m3 increase) in the full cohort (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.22) and the never-smokers' cohort (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.33). PM2.5-morality associations were observed specifically for lung, stomach, colorectal, liver, breast, cervix, and bladder, as well as Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia. The PM2.5-morality association with lung cancer in never-smokers was statistically significant adjusting for multiple comparisons. Cigarette smoking was statistically associated with mortality for many cancer types.Conclusions:Exposure to PM2.5 air pollution contributes to lung cancer mortality and may be a risk factor for other cancer types. Cigarette smoking has a larger impact on cancer mortality than PM2.5 , but is associated with similar cancer types.
