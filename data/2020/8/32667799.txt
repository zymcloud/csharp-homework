Novel small molecule compounds based on various scaffolds including chalcone, flavonoid, and resorcinol dibenzyl ether were designed and tested for their inhibitory activity against the Programmed Cell Death-1/Programmed Cell Death-Ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) pathway. Among them, compound NP19 inhibited the human PD-1/PD-L1 interaction with IC50 values of 12.5 nM in homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) binding assays. In addition, NP19 dose-dependently elevated IFN-Î³ production in a coculture model of Hep3B/OS-8/hPD-L1 and CD3 T cells. Furthermore, NP19 displayed significant in vivo antitumor efficacy in two different mouse models of cancer (a melanoma B16-F10 tumor model and an H22 hepatoma tumor model). Moreover, H&E staining and flow cytometry data suggested that NP19 activated the immune microenvironment in the tumor, which may contribute to its antitumor effects. This work shows NP19 is a promising lead compound for further development as a new generation of small molecule inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway.
