Background & aims:Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to detect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed a prospective study to compare the diagnostic performance of CT, MRI with extracellular contrast agents (ECA-MRI), and MRI with hepatobiliary agents (HBA-MRI) in the detection of HCC using the liver imaging reporting and data system (LI-RADS).Methods:We studied 125 participants (102 men; mean age, 55.3 years) with chronic liver disease who underwent CT, ECA-MRI, or HBA-MRI (with gadoxetic acid) before surgery for a nodule initially detected by ultrasound at a tertiary center in Korea, from November 2016 through February 2019. We collected data on major features and assigned LI-RADS categories (v2018) from CT and MRI examinations. We then compared the diagnostic performance for LR-5 for each modality alone, and in combination.Results:In total, 163 observations (124 HCCs, 13 non-HCC malignancies, and 26 benign lesions; mean size, 20.7 mm) were identified. ECA-MRI detected HCC with 83.1% sensitivity and 86.6% accuracy, compared to 64.4% sensitivity and 71.8% accuracy for CT (P Conclusion:In a prospective study of patients with chronic liver disease and a nodule detected by ultrasound, ECA-MRI detected HCC with higher levels of sensitivity and accuracy than CT or HBA-MRI, based on LI-RADS. Diagnostic performance was best when CT was used in combination with MRI compared with MRI alone.
