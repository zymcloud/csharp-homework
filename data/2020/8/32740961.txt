Spontaneous regression of cancer is rare and has been observed mostly in immunogenic cancers like melanoma. A few cases of spontaneous regression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been reported, but the mechanisms of regression have not been elucidated. Here, we report a patient with advanced HCC who experienced spontaneous regression of her tumor and present evidence for a putative immune-mediated mechanism for tumor regression.
