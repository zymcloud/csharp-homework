Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-producing gastric carcinomas (AFPGCs) are relatively rare tumors known to have a poor prognosis and commonly found as advanced lesions. Histologically, AFPGCs have been described as having hepatoid and fetal enteric (enteroblastic) morphology and are associated with conventional adenocarcinomas. Prior studies reported a hepatoid component present only in invasive areas and hypothesized that AFPGCs may develop hepatoid features during the process of tumor invasion. We report three cases of AFP-producing early gastric cancer which had an intramucosal hepatoid component. Immunohistochemistry showed that the hepatoid component was diffusely immunoreactive for SALL4, AFP, arginase-1, and HepPar1, and focally for CDX2 and PDX1. An intramucosal transition between the hepatoid component and conventional intramucosal adenocarcinoma was identified. Two patients also had a coexistent fetal enteric component, which was admixed with a hepatoid component. Although at an early stage one patient subsequently developed liver metastasis and a second patient was suspected of having liver metastasis, these were not biopsy-proven. The latter patient had a previous history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and SALL4 was used on the HCC to distinguish metastatic/further HCC from a gastric metastatic primary with hepatoid differentiation.
