Background:Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is an acceptable treatment option for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Traditional transplant criteria aim at best utilization of donor organs with low risk of post transplant recurrence. In LDLT, long term recurrence free survival (RFS) of 50% is considered acceptable. The objective of the current study was to determine preoperative factors associated with high recurrence rates in LDLT.Methods:Between April 2012 and December 2019, 898 LDLTs were performed at our center. Out of these, 242 were confirmed to have HCC on explant histopathology. We looked at preoperative factors associated with â‰¤ 50%RFS at 4 years. For survival analysis, Kaplan Meier curves were used and Cox regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of recurrence.Results:Median AFP was 14.4(0.7-11,326.7) ng/ml. Median tumor size was 2.8(range = 0.1-11) cm and tumor number was 2(range = 1-15). On multivariate analysis, AFP > 600 ng/ml [HR:6, CI: 1.9-18.4, P = 0.002] and microvascular invasion (MVI) [HR:5.8, CI: 2.5-13.4, P 600 ng/ml, MVI was seen in 88.9% tumors with poor grade and 75% of tumors outside University of California San Francisco criteria. Estimated 4 year RFS was 78% for the entire cohort. When AFP was 600 ng/ml, RFS was 53% and 0 with well-moderate and poor grade tumors respectively (P Conclusion:Patients with AFP 600 ng/ml, a preoperative biopsy to rule out poor differentiation should be considered for patient selection.
