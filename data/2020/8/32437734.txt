The pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a multistep process, involving the progressive accumulation of molecular alterations and transcriptomic alterations. The Forkhead-box (FOX) transcription factor family is characterized by its unique DNA binding domain (FKH or winged-helix domain). Human FOX family consists of about 17 subfamilies, at least 43 members. Some of them are liver-enriched transcription factors, suggesting that they may play a crucial role in the development or/and functions of the liver. Dysregulation of FOX transcription factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of HCC because they can activate or suppress the expression of various tumor-related molecules, and pinpoint different molecular and cellular events. Here we summarized, analyzed and discussed the status and the functions of the human FOX family of transcription factors in HCC, aiming to help the further development of them as potential therapeutic targets or/and diagnostic/prognostic markers for HCC.
