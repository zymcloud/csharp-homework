De novo HCC following transplantation in a child is a rare occurrence. Even within the adult liver transplantation population, there are a limited number of published cases. In this report, we present a case of de novo HCC found in a child, post-multivisceral transplantation. A 19-year-old boy, at the age of one, received liver and small bowel transplantation due to short gut syndrome secondary to midgut volvulus and total parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease. Eighteen years later, he was found to have a large mass involving the right hepatic dome consistent with HCC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second reported case after gut transplantation and the third case post-liver transplantation in the pediatric population.
