Alcohol‑associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a subtype of HCC with poor prognosis. The present study aimed to identify key biomarkers for alcohol‑associated HCC. The gene data profiles and corresponding clinical traits of patients with alcohol‑associated HCC were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Firstly, good genes and good samples were identified, which were subsequently used to conduct weighted gene co‑expression network analysis (WGCNA). Hub genes in the significant modules were selected following Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses, and from constructing a protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network. Real hub genes among hub genes were determined following progression, survival analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), as well as reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical staining of non‑alcohol‑ and alcohol‑associated HCC samples. In total, 64 good samples of alcohol‑associated HCC with height score
