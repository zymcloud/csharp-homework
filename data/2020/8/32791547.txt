Indication of transplantation:There is an ongoing change in the indications of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) with non-alcoholic and alcoholic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) becoming the main indications whereas the numbers of cirrhosis due to chronic viral hepatitis are declining. 6-MONTH ABSTINENCE RULE: : The directive of the German Federal Medical Association requires absolute abstinence from alcohol for at least 6 months. New data show that patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis for the first time who do not show a response to medical treatment may benefit from OLT. For these patients an individual exception for OLT listing can be requested.Hcc beyond milan criteria:New data show that patients with HCC outside the Milan criteria may have a favorable prognosis, which can be comparable to patients with HCC within the Milan criteria, if effective pre-transplant "down-staging" therapies but also alfa fetoprotein levels are taken into consideration. TOO SICK TO TRANSPLANT?: Even patients with decompensated cirrhosis and multi-organ dysfunction, defined as acute-on-chronic liver failure, may undergo OLT successfully with a beneficial long-term prognosis. However, the timeframe to realize OLT is short.Organ shortage:OLT using organs from HBV- or HCV-infected patients represents a relevant strategy to mitigate organ shortage and can be safely and effectively be performed due to the excellent therapeutic options against these infections which are available now. In addition, machine perfusion, a novel tool for organ conservation and conditioning, may help preserving organs for transplantation that formerly could not be used.
