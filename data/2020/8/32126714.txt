To construct a dual-targeting (magnetic targeting and antibody targeting) multi-functional magnetic fluorescent liposome probe with a good biocompatibility and high specificity for early liver cancerdiagnosis. 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-ethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethylene glycol)] (DSPE-PEG2000-NH2) and Cyanine7 N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Cy7-NHS) were measured and reacted for forming DSPE-PEG2000-Cy7. Egg yolk lecithin, cholesterol, DSPE-PEG2000-Cy7 and Fe₃O₄ were added in orderly into the reaction solution for synthesis of fluorescent ferroferric oxide (Fe₃O₄) liposome. The Magnetic liposome (MLP) was coupled with Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) polyclonal antibody and the ending AFP antibody modified magnetic liposome was analyzed and studied on human hepatoma cell HepG2 and cancer model mouse. The fluorescent ferroferric oxide liposome appeared as a sphericalmorphology and they were about 150 nm in mean hydrodynamic diameter with negative charge. The fluorescent magnetic probe had a little toxic effect on hepG2 cells and increased the specificity liver cancer diagnosis by AFP antibody target imaging in model mouse of liver cancer. In brief, the AFP antibody conjugated fluorescent magnetic probe is a promising multi-functional tool with good biocompatibility and high sensitivity and specificity for clinical cancer diagnosis and therapy.
