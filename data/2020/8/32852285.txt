Globally, liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) has a high mortality and recurrence rate, leading to poor prognosis. The recurrence of LIHC is closely related to two aspects: degree of immune infiltration and content of tumor stem cells. Hence, this study aimed to used RNA-seq and clinical data of LIHC from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Estimation of Stromal and Immune cells in Malignant Tumours, mRNA stemness index score, and weighted gene correlation network analysis methods to find genes significantly linked to the aforementioned two aspects. Key genes and clinical factors were used as input. Lasso regression and multivariate Cox regression were conducted to build an effective prognostic model for patients with liver cancer. Finally, four key genes (KLHL30, PLN, LYVE1, and TIMD4) and four clinical factors (Asian, age, grade, and bilirubin) were included in the prognostic model, namely Immunity and Cancer-stem-cell Related Prognosis (ICRP) score. The ICRP score achieved a great performance in test set. The area under the curve value of the ICRP score in test set for 1, 3, and 5 years was 0.708, 0.723, and 0.765, respectively, which was better than that of other prognostic prediction methods for LIHC. The C-index evaluation method also reached the same conclusion.
