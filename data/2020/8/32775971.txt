Background:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has reached high prevalence, paralleling the obesity pandemic. The aggressive form of the disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is characterized by fatty infiltration and inflammation of the liver, can progress to compensated cirrhosis (CC) and end-stage liver disease (ESLD: decompensated cirrhosis [DCC] and hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]), and may ultimately require liver transplantation (LT). Real-world data on the burden of NAFLD/NASH are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and economic burden of NAFLD/NASH to the French hospital system.Methods:This retrospective cohort study used data from the French PMSI-MCO database. Adults with NAFLD/NASH diagnosis identified between 2009 and 2015 were categorized into disease severity cohorts (NAFLD/NASH, CC, DCC, HCC, and LT). Demographic and clinical data were assessed at the index (diagnosis) date. Hospitalization resource utilization and costs were assessed in the pre- and post-index periods. Rates of liver disease progression and death were evaluated for each cohort.Findings:During the median follow-up of 34.8 months, of the 131,656 patients included, 1491 patients developed CC (1.1%), 7846 developed DCC (5.9%), 1144 developed HCC (0.9%), and 52 required LT (0.04%). The diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH was associated with increasing annual costs: €7736 vs €5076 before the diagnosis. Rates of comorbidities, hospitalization resource utilization, and costs increased with disease progression. The rate of death at seven-year follow-up was 7.9% in NAFLD/NASH, CC: 18.0%, DCC: 34.9%, and HCC: 48.8%.Interpretation:NAFLD/NASH is associated with high economic burden and imparts substantial risk of negative clinical outcomes and mortality at all stages of disease.
