Background and aims:The influence of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) on chronic hepatitis C (CHC)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial. We investigated the effect of eradicating CHC using DAAs on treatment outcomes in patients with CHC-related HCC treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:This nationwide, multi-center, retrospective study recruited patients with CHC-related HCC treated with TACE as the first-line anti-cancer treatment, and who achieved a sustained virological response (SVR) using DAAs (DAA group) between 2006 and 2017. Patients achieving an SVR following interferon-based treatment (IFN group) and those without treatment (control group) were also recruited for comparison.Results:A total of 425 patients were eligible for the study. Of these, 356 (83.8%), 26 (6.1%), and 43 (10.1%) were allocated to the control, IFN, and DAA groups, respectively. A multivariate analysis showed that liver cirrhosis, segmental portal vein thrombosis, and larger maximal tumor size independently predicted an increased risk of progression (all p Conclusions:DAA treatment provided significantly prolonged progression-free survival in patients with CHC-related HCC treated with TACE compared to that in patients administered IFN or no treatment.
