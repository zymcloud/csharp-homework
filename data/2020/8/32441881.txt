Background:To study the effect of microRNA-383 (miR-383) on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, and explore its mechanism.Methods:The expressions of miR-383 and plant homology domain that refers to protein 8 (PHF8) were detected in tissues and cells by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or western blot respectively. The miR-383 group (transfected miR-383 mimics), miR-con group (transfected miR-con), si-con group (transfected si-con), si-PHF8 group (transfected si-PHF8), miR-383 + ctrl group (cotransfected miR-383 mimics and pcDNA-3.1), miR-383 + PHF8 group (cotransfected miR-383 mimics and pcDNA-3.1-PHF8) were transfected into HepG2 cells by liposome method. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion were measured by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) or trans-well assays respectively. The luciferase activity of each group was detected by dual luciferase reporter gene assay.Results:Compared with normal adjacent tissues, the expression of miR-383 was significantly down-regulated and the expression of PHF8 was significantly up-regulated (p Conclusion:miR-383 could inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells by targeting PHF8, which will provide a basis for miR-383 targeted therapy for HCC.
