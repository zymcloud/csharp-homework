Background:The concurrent presence of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) poses a challenge for laparoscopic surgeons to establish a routine practice. The aim of this study was to gather evidence and produce recommendations on the safe and effective practice of laparoscopic hepatectomy for patients with solitary HCC (≤ 5 cm) and liver cirrhosis.Methods:Between October 2013 and October 2014, 356 curative hepatectomies were performed for patients pathologically diagnosed with solitary HCC (≤ 5 cm) accompanied by cirrhosis (stage 4 fibrosis). To overcome selection bias, a 1:2 match using propensity score matching analysis was conducted between laparoscopic and open hepatectomy. Perioperative outcomes were compared between the groups, including hospitalization, operation time, blood loss, and surgical complications. Perioperative inflammation-based markers, including systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) were collected from medical records and analyzed.Results:There were 43 and 77 patients in the laparoscopic and open groups, respectively. The laparoscopic group had less hepatic inflow occlusion (16.3% vs. 61%; P Conclusions:Compared with open hepatectomy, laparoscopic hepatectomy for selected HCC patients, even in the presence of cirrhosis, might result in better perioperative outcomes and postoperative inflammatory response attenuation, and ultimately promote faster recovery. This provides evidence for considering routine laparoscopic hepatectomy through careful selection of patients with HCC.
