Purpose of review:Limited data exist on the prevalence, determinants, and outcomes of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection among HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV)-coinfected persons. This review provides current evidence on the epidemiology, natural history, and treatment of HDV infection in patients with HIV/HBV coinfection and highlights future research needs.Recent findings:Cross-sectional studies in Europe, Africa, South America, and Asia show that the prevalence of HDV among HIV/HBV-coinfected patients ranges from 1.2 to 25%. No studies have evaluated the prevalence of HDV infection among HIV/HBV-coinfected patients in the USA. HDV infection increases the risk of hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma among HIV/HBV-coinfected patients. HDV treatment remains limited to pegylated interferon-alpha, which results in sustained virologic response in fewer than 25%. Data on the epidemiology, natural history, and treatment of HDV among HIV/HBV-coinfected persons remain limited. More research is needed to address these knowledge gaps in order to better manage HDV coinfection in HIV/HBV-coinfected patients.
