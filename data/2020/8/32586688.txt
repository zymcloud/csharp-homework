Sirtuin 7 (SIRT7) is a NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) dependent deacetylase that is reported to contribute to tumour growth and invasion by selectively acting on histone H3K18. It is overexpressed in several cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we investigated the relationship between SIRT7 expression, proliferation (Ki-67 index) in human HCC tissues, and patient prognosis. We analysed 219 HCC samples obtained retrospectively, for clinicopathological features, and with immunohistochemistry. SIRT7 overexpression was observed in 73 cases (33%) and correlated with vascular invasion and poor differentiation of HCC. Ki-67 labelling index was observed to be significantly higher in SIRT7 overexpressing cases. Interestingly, the Ki-67 labelling index was higher in SIRT7 overexpressing cases regardless of the differentiation status of HCC. Multivariate analysis demonstrated SIRT7 overexpression as an independent factor predictive of poor prognosis (p=0.016). In vitro, SIRT7 knockdown led to reduced growth in cells and resulted in a lower percentage of G0/G1 cells compared to controls. In addition, the ratio of apoptotic cells following sorafenib treatment was significantly higher in SIRT7 knockdown cells than control cells (p=0.040), implying that SIRT7 knockdown potentiated the effect of sorafenib. In conclusion, our study showed that overexpression of SIRT7 was associated with increased proliferative activity in HCC and predictive of poor prognosis. In addition, our in vitro model showed that SIRT7 knockdown was associated with reduced proliferation, and suggested abrogation of SIRT7 may potentiate the effect of sorafenib. Therefore, we propose that SIRT7 expression by HCC may be used as a prognostic biomarker, and that SIRT7 may be a potential target for new therapeutic modalities.
