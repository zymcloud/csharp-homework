Early studies have indicated that insulin-like growth factor II mRNA binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3/IMP3) may affect the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the detailed underlying mechanisms, particularly its linkage to tight junction protein-mediated cell invasion, remain unclear. The present study revealed that IGF2BP3 increased HCC cell invasiveness by suppressing zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression, via direct binding to the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR). Analysis of the molecular mechanisms demonstrated that IGF2BP3 binds to the overlapping targets of IGF2BP3-RNA cross-linkage and microRNA (miR)191-5p targeting sites, and promotes the formation of an miR191-5p-induced RNA-induced silencing complex. The knockdown of IGF2BP3 or the addition of a miR-191-5p inhibitor decreased cellular invasiveness and increased ZO-1 expression. Analysis of the human HCC database also confirmed the association between IGF2BP3 and HCC progression. Collectively, these preclinical findings suggest that IGF2BP3 increases HCC cell invasiveness by promoting the miR191-5p-induced suppression of ZO-1 signaling. This newly identified signaling effect on small molecule targeting may aid in the development of novel strategies with which to inhibit HCC progression more effectively.
