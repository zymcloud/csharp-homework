Delineation of organs at risk (OARs) is important but time consuming for radiotherapy planning. Automatic segmentation of OARs based on convolutional neural network (CNN) has been established for lung cancer patients at our institution. The aim of this study is to compare automatic segmentation based on CNN (AS-CNN) with automatic segmentation based on atlas (AS-Atlas) in terms of the efficiency and accuracy of OARs contouring.The OARs, including the lungs, esophagus, heart, liver, and spinal cord, of 19 non-small cell lung cancer patients were delineated using three methods: AS-CNN, AS-Atlas in the Pinnacle-software, and manual delineation (MD) by a senior radiation oncologist. MD was used as the ground-truth reference, and the segmentation efficiency was evaluated by the time spent per patient. The accuracy was evaluated using the Mean surface distance (MSD) and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). The paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare these indexes between the 2 automatic segmentation models.In the 19 testing cases, both AS-CNN and AS-Atlas saved substantial time compared with MD. AS-CNN was more efficient than AS-Atlas (1.6 min vs 2.4 min, P < .001). In terms of the accuracy, AS-CNN performed well in the esophagus, with a DSC of 73.2%. AS-CNN was better than AS-Atlas in segmenting the left lung (DSC: 94.8% vs 93.2%, P = .01; MSD: 1.10 cm vs 1.73 cm, P < .001) and heart (DSC: 89.3% vs 85.8%, P = .05; MSD: 1.65 cm vs 3.66 cm, P < .001). Furthermore, AS-CNN exhibited superior performance in segmenting the liver (DSC: 93.7% vs 93.6%, P = .81; MSD: 2.03 cm VS 2.11 cm, P = .66). The results obtained from AS-CNN and AS-Atlas were similar in segmenting the right lung. However, the performance of AS-CNN in the spinal cord was inferior to that of AS-Atlas (DSC: 82.1% vs 86.8%, P = .01; MSD: 0.87 cm vs 0.66 cm, P = .01).Our study demonstrated that AS-CNN significantly reduced the contouring time and outperformed AS-Atlas in most cases. AS-CNN can potentially be used for OARs segmentation in patients with pathological N2 (pN2) non-small cell lung cancer.
