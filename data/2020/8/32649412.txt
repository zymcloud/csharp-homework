Background:The indocyanine green 15-minute retention (ICG-r15) test was considered as a noninvasive marker of esophageal varices (EV) in cirrhotic patients. However, the performance of ICG-r15 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has rarely been assessed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the value of ICG-r15 as a noninvasive marker of EV in patients with HCC.Methods:From October 2007 to December 2018, the study retrospectively enrolled 137 HCC patients with compensated hepatic function who received ICG-r15 tests and endoscopy screening for EV. The predictive value of the ICG-r15 test and other noninvasive markers was also evaluated for the diagnosis of EV, including the aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase ratio, platelet count/spleen diameter ratio, AST/platelet ratio index, Lok index, FIB-4, and Park index.Results:In the study cohort, 30 (21.9%) patients had EV. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for determining EV by ICG-r15 was 0.784 (95% CI: 0.686-0.881, -2 ln (L): 77.889, Akaike information criterion: 79.889), and it had the best predictive value compared with other noninvasive markers. The cutoff value of ICG-r15 to identify EV was 31.0%, and it had 40.0% sensitivity and 98.1% specificity. The cutoff value to exclude EV was 9.5% with 86.7% sensitivity and 50.5% specificity. In the multivariate analysis, ICG-r15 (odds ratio [OR]: 1.062, 1.014-1.114; p = 0.015) and the Park index (OR: 1.535, 1.091-2.159; p = 0.014) were independently related to the presence of EV.Conclusion:ICG-r15 is a practical noninvasive marker with cutoff values of 9.5% for excluding EV and 31.0% for identifying EV in patients with HCC.
