Background:We demonstrated that postoperative mesenchymal circulating tumor cell (mCTC) in peripheral blood were independent risk factors for the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after radical resection. However, few studies have been conducted on the efficacy and survival benefit of postoperative adjuvant transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (PA-TACE) for patients with mCTC-positive HCC. We evaluated the effect of PA-TACE on the prognosis of mCTC-positive/mCTC-negative HCC patients.Methods:A total of 261 HCC patients from February 2014 to December 2017 undergoing curative hepatectomy were included in this study. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates, overall survival (OS) rates, and prognostic factors were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazard model.Results:The results showed that 57.8% (59/102) mCTC-positive and 43.4% (69/159) mCTC-negative patients underwent PA-TACE. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that PVTT (HR 2.370; 95% CI, 1.535-3.660; P Conclusions:PA-TACE was a safe intervention and could effectively prevent tumor recurrence and improve the survival of mCTC-positive HCC patients.
