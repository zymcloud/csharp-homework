Background:Epidemiological studies commonly identify the clinical characteristics and survival outcomes of patients with breast cancer at five years. Our study aims to describe the sociodemographic, clinicopathological characteristics and determine the long-term event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of a Peruvian population with triple-negative breast cancer.Methods:We reviewed the medical records of new cases treated at a single institution in the period 2000-2014. The survival analysis included patients with stages I-IV. Survival estimates at 10 years were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the Log-rank test. We further used multivariate Cox regression analysis to calculate prognostic factors of recurrence and mortality.Results:Among the 2007 patients included, the median age at diagnosis was 49 years (19-95 years). Most patients presented histologic grade III (68.7%), tumor stage II (34.2%), and III (51.0%) at diagnosis. Local and distant relapse was present in 31.9 and 51.4% of the patients, respectively. The most frequent sites of metastasis were the lungs (14.5%), followed by bone (9.7%), brain (9.6%), and liver (7.9%). The median follow-up was 153 months. At 3, 5, and 10 years, the EFS of the population was 55%, 49%, and 41%, respectively, while the OS was 64%, 56%, and 47%, respectively. Moreover, an N3 lymph node status was the most important prognostic factor for both disease relapse (HR: 2.54, 95% CI: 2.05-3.15) and mortality (HR: 2.51, 95% CI: 2.01-3.14) at ten years. An older age and higher T staging were associated with a worse OS, while patients who received radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy had better survival rates.Conclusion:The sociodemographic features of Peruvian patients with TNBC are similar to those of other populations. However, our population was diagnosed at more advanced clinical stages, and thus, EFS and OS were lower than international reports while prognostic factors were similar to previous studies.
