Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignant tumor of the liver. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are a class of cells that form the tumor microenvironment and thus have an effect on carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of CD8, CD4, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), and granzyme B in HCC and their correlation with clinicopathologic parameters and prognosis. This study was carried out on 112 cases of HCC. High percentage of CD8 TILs was associated with large tumors and adjacent noncirrhotic liver. High percentage of CD4 TILs and high CD4 to CD8 ratio were associated with nonviral etiology, low alpha fetoprotein, and direct acting antiviral treatment. High percentage of CTLA-4-positive TILs tended to be associated with high-grade HCC, while a high percentage of CTLA-4 in tumor cells was associated with multiple lesions and low tumor grade. High percentage of granzyme B TILs was associated with low grade, early stage, and absence of tumor recurrence. High CD4 percentage and high CD4/CD8 ratio affected patients' overall survival. There is a dynamic interaction between the different subsets of lymphocytes in the environment of HCC manifested by coparallel expression of CD4 and CD8 augmenting the expression of CTLA-4, and only CD8 augments the expression of granzyme B. This opens the gate for the beneficial role of immunotherapy in the management of HCC, reducing recurrence and improving survival.
