Cancer stem cells play important roles in the development of tumors also are important targets to therapy of cancer. Former researches had confirmed the pre-leukemia transcription factor 3 (PBX3) was involved in maintaining the characteristics of liver cancer stem cell. We found that PBX3 is an extremely unstable protein with a short half-life in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Unstable proteins are believed to be susceptible to degradation by ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, when we treated hepatoma cells using the proteasome inhibitor MG132, found the levels of PBX3 protein and mRNA were significantly downregulated, suggesting that PBX3 protein is not degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Our study aims to investigate the mechanism of MG132 regulation of PBX3. We observed that the levels of miR-424, let-7c, miR-222, miR-200b were upregulated when hepatoma cells were treated with MG132, and this increase was negatively correlated with the levels of PBX3. Using the miRWalk algorithm, previous studies have predicted that these miRNAs target the PBX3 gene. Thus, we investigated the mechanism by which the proteasome inhibitor MG132 regulates these miRNAs. It has been reported that the Argonaute2 protein is an important component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), and it can regulate the levels of certain miRNAs. Consequently, we also investigated whether the proteasome inhibitor regulates related miRNAs by stabilizing Argonaute2. Using co-infection, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), and western blot assays, we found that MG132 stabilizes the expression of the Argonuate2 protein by inhibiting its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In summary, the PBX3 protein, which is closely linked to the stemness of hepatoma cells, does not undergo degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPM).
