Background:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an important therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhosis. In particular in advanced cirrhosis, post-TACE hepatic failure liver (PTHF) failure may develop. Currently, there is no standardization for the periinterventional risk assessment. The liver maximum capacity (LiMAx) test assesses the functional liver capacity, but has not been investigated in this setting.Aims:The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate periinterventional LiMAx and CT volumetry measurements in patients with cirrhosis and HCC undergoing repetitive TACE.Methods:From 06/2016 to 11/2017, eleven patients with HCC and cirrhosis undergoing TACE were included. LiMAx measurements (n = 42) were conducted before and after each TACE. Laboratory parameters were correlated with the volume-function data.Results:The median LiMAx levels before (276 ± 166 µg/kg/h) were slightly reduced after TACE (251 ± 122 µg/kg/h; p = 0.08). This corresponded to a median drop of 7.1%. Notably, there was a significant correlation between LiMAx levels before TACE and bilirubin (but not albumin nor albumin-bilirubin [ALBI] score) increase after TACE (p = 0.02, k = 0.56). Furthermore, a significantly higher increase in bilirubin in patients with LiMAx ≤ 150 µg/kg/h was observed (p = 0.011). LiMAx levels at different time points in single patients were similar (p = 0.2).Conclusion:In our prospective pilot study in patients with HCC and cirrhosis undergoing multiple TACE, robust and reliable LiMAx measurements were demonstrated. Lower LiMAx levels before TACE were associated with surrogate markers (bilirubin) of liver failure after TACE. Specific subgroups at high risk of PTHF should be investigated. This might facilitate the future development of strategies to prevent occurrence of PTHF.
