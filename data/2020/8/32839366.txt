The harmful use of alcohol is associated with significant medical and socioeconomic burdens responsible for approximately 6% of all deaths worldwide. In Korea, the total alcohol consumption recently decreased slightly from 14.8 L of alcohol per person on average in 2011 to 9.1 L in 2015. On the other hand, over the past 10 years (2007-2017), the rates of monthly alcohol consumption, which is defined as drinking more than once a month, and the rates of high-risk alcohol consumption, defined as drinking more than seven standard drinks twice a week or more, have increased. In particular, the death rate due to alcoholic liver disease was the highest and increasing among those in their 50s who play crucial socioeconomic roles. In addition, the most notable change over the past 10 years has been the increase in alcohol consumption in young women aged between 20 and 39, and the increase in deaths among women due to alcoholic liver disease. In Korea, alcoholic liver disease is ranked 2nd-3rd as the causes of chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, having a significant negative socioeconomic impact.
