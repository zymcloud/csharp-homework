A 44-year-old woman experienced loss of vision and distorted vision in the right eye. After she visited our hospital, she was diagnosed with a right metastatic choroidal tumor. At the age of 35 years, she had undergone surgery for left breast cancer; as recurrence of the breast cancer was suspected, the patient was referred to our department. A CT scan revealed left axillary lymph node swelling, liver metastasis, and lung metastasis. Lymph node needle biopsy was performed under ultrasound guidance, and the pathological findings revealed recurrence of breast cancer. Combination chemotherapy of bevacizumab( BV)plus paclitaxel(PTX)was administered. After chemotherapy, the metastatic lesion had remarkably shrunk, as observed on a CT scan. Optical coherence tomography(OCT)revealed that the tumor was flattened in her right eye. Choroidal metastasis of breast cancer is rare. BV plus PTX therapy was effective for treating choroidal metastasis of breast cancer, and it should be followed by ophthalmological examination over time.
