Metastasis is the leading cause of mortality in breast cancer patients, with brain metastases becoming increasingly prevalent. Studying this disease is challenging due to the limited experimental models and methods available. Here, we used iron-based cellular MRI to track the fate of a mammary carcinoma cell line (MDA-MB-231-BR) in vivo to characterize the growth of brain metastases in the nude and severely immune-compromised NOD/SCID/ILIIrg-/- (NSG) mouse. Nude and NSG mice received injections of iron-labeled MDA-MB-231-BR cells. Images were acquired with a 3T MR system and assessed for signal voids and metastases. The percentage of signal voids and the number and volume of metastases were quantified. Ex vivo imaging of the liver, histology, and immunofluorescence labeling was performed. Brain metastases grew more rapidly in NSG mice. At day 21 post cell injection, the average number of brain tumors in NSG mice was approximately four times greater than in nude mice. The persistence of iron-labeled cells, visualized as signal voids by MRI, was also examined. The percentage of voids decreased significantly over time for both nude and NSG mice. Body images revealed that the NSG mice also had metastases in the liver, lungs, and lymph nodes while tumors were only detected in the brains of nude mice. This work demonstrates the advantages of using the highly immune-compromised NSG mouse to study breast cancer metastasis, treatments aimed at inhibiting metastasis and outgrowth of breast cancer metastases in multiple organs, and the role that imaging can play toward credentialing these models that cannot be done with other in vitro or histopathologic methods alone.
