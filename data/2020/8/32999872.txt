Purpose:Tenofovir (TDF) and entecavir (ETV) are both equally recommended as first-line treatments for patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). They have comparable efficacy in virologic response, but their effect on the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in CHB is controversial. Therefore, we aimed to compare TDF and ETV evaluating the risk of HCC development in CHB patients.Methods:A systematic literature search was conducted up to November 2019 in MEDLINE/PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases without language and time restrictions. DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models were used to estimate combined hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs.Results:Seven studies containing 35,785 participants were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled HR (95% CI) of HCC in the patients who used TDF versus patients who used ETV was 0.75 (0.56-0.96). There was no significant heterogeneity detected among the included studies results (I<sup>2</sup> = 47.5%). There was no significant publication bias detected among the included studies (Begg's p = 0.88 and Egger's regression test p = 0.96).Conclusions:Evidence to date suggests that TDF treatment is associated with significantly fewer cases of HCC when compared to ETV.
