Background/aims:Lusutrombopag, a small-molecule thrombopoietin receptor agonist, is used to treat thrombocytopenia based on the results of a phase 3 trial, including data for single-use administration in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) undergoing invasive procedures. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of repeated lusutrombopag use.Methods:Lusutrombopag was administered repeatedly in patients undergoing multi-cycle invasive procedures at intervals >1 month.Results:Data from 8 patients (median platelet count at baseline, 44.0 [range, 35-49] × 109/L) and 25 cycles of invasive procedures, including 2 cycles in 3 patients, 3 cycles in 4 patients, and 7 cycles in 1 patient, were retrospectively evaluated. The procedures included 18 transarterial chemoembolizations, 5 radiofrequency ablations, and 2 liver needle biopsies. Platelet counts increased significantly compared with baseline, and median changes in platelet counts were 46.0 × 109/L (p = 0.012) in cycle 1, 44.0 × 109/L (p = 0.012) in cycle 2, and 42.0 × 109/L (p = 0.008) in cycles 3-7. No severe adverse events, including portal vein thrombus or bleeding, were observed.Conclusions:Repeated use of lusutrombopag might be safe and effective against thrombocytopenia in patients with CLD undergoing multi-cycle invasive procedures, although long-term data from more patients are required.
