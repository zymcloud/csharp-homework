The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), or programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) has revolutionized the treatment strategy in various types of cancers. In addition, recent studies have revealed that tumor microsatellite instability (MSI) status and tumor mutation burden (TMB) contribute significantly to the therapeutic response to anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), which led to an accelerated approval to pembrolizumab for the treatment of MSI-high or mismatch-repair-deficient solid tumors after conventional chemotherapies in 2017 and for the treatment of TMB-high solid tumors in 2020 by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In the field of gastrointestinal cancers, many clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of various regimens such as ICI monotherapy, the combination of anti-CTLA-4 mAb and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAb, and combination of ICI and conventional chemotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitor have been reported or are in progress. This review summarizes MSI status and TMB in gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic cancers, and provides the results of most relevant clinical trials evaluating ICIs. We also discuss the development of biomarkers required for improving the selection of patients with a high probability of benefiting from treatment with ICIs, and potential therapeutic strategies that could help to enhance anticancer responses of ICIs.
