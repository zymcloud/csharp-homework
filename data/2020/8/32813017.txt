Background:The human liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini is a food-borne trematode that causes hepatobiliary disease in humans throughout Southeast Asia. People become infected by consuming raw or undercooked fish containing metacercariae. Development of a vaccine to prevent or minimize pathology would decrease the risk of severe morbidity, including the development of bile duct cancer.Methods:We produced an oral vaccine based on recombinant Bacillus subtilis spores expressing the large extracellular loop (LEL) of O. viverrini tetraspanin-2 (Ov-TSP-2), a protein that is abundant on the surface of O. viverrini secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs). Recombinant spores expressing Ov-TSP-2-LEL were orally administered to hamsters prior to challenge infection with O. viverrini metacercariae.Results:Vaccinated hamsters generated serum IgG as well as bile IgG and IgA responses to Ov-TSP-2-LEL, and serum IgG from vaccinated hamsters blocked the uptake of fluke EVs by a human bile duct epithelial cell line. Vaccinated hamsters had 56% reductions in both adult flukes and fecal eggs compared to the control group.Conclusions:These findings indicate that oral vaccination of hamsters with recombinant B. subtilis spores expressing Ov-TSP-2-LEL is efficacious at reducing infection intensity and could form the basis of a vaccine for the control of carcinogenic liver fluke infection in humans.
