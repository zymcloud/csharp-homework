The usefulness of whole-body 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG)-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission (PET)/computed tomography (CT) is established for assessment of disease staging, detection of early disease recurrence, therapeutic evaluation, and predicting prognosis in various malignancies; and for evaluating the spread of inflammation. However, the role of FDG-PET/CT for the liver is limited because CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide an accurate diagnosis of most tumors. In addition, in other potentially useful roles there are several pitfalls in the interpretation of FDG uptake in PET/CT imaging. Accurate evaluation demands knowledge of the FDG uptake of each lesion, including potential negative and positive uptakes, and requires an understanding of the underlying background of the molecular mechanisms. The degree of FDG uptake is dependent on cellular metabolic rate and the expression of glucose transporter, hexokinase, and glucose-6-phosphatase, which in turn are closely affected by biological characteristics such as pathological category (e.g., adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, small cell cancer, transitional cell cancer, neuroendocrine tumor, sarcoma, lymphoma), tumor differentiation, histological behavior (e.g., solid, cystic, mucinous), and intratumoral alterations (e.g., necrosis, degeneration, hemorrhage). Correlation with the CT and MRI findings, which also precisely depict the pathological findings, is important to avoid misdiagnosis.
