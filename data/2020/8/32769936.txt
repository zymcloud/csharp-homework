To investigate the diagnostic value of multimodal ultrasound imaging composed of conventional ultrasonography (US), contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS), and shear wave elastography (SWE) for liver tumors.Between October 2017 and October 2019, US, CEUS, and SWE examinations of a total of 158 liver tumors in 136 patients at The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University were performed. The histopathological or imaging diagnostic results were used as controls to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of US, CEUS, SWE, and multimodal ultrasound imaging, which combines these 3 modes, in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant liver tumors.Among the 158 tumors, there were 64 benign tumors, including 55 cases of hepatic hemangioma, 3 cases of focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver, 4 cases of hepatic cyst, and 2 cases of focal nonuniform distribution of fat in the liver. There were 94 malignant tumors, including 32 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 22 cases of intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma, 29 cases of metastatic liver cancer, and 11 cases of dysplastic nodules in cirrhotic liver. In the diagnosis of benign and malignant liver tumors, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 82.56%, 68.06%, 75.96%, 75.53%, and 76.56% for US; 92.39%, 86.36%, 89.87%, 90.43%, and 89.06% for CEUS; 87.14%, 76.81%, 82.91%, 82.98%, and 82.81% for SWE; and 97.85%, 95.38%, 96.83%, 96.81%, and 96.88% for multimodal ultrasound imaging, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were all significantly higher for multimodal ultrasound imaging than those values for US, CEUS, and SWE (all P
