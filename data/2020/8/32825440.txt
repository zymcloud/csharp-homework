Even though advancement in medicine has contributed to the control of many diseases to date, cancer therapy continues to pose several challenges. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) etiology is multifactorial. Recently, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been considered as an important risk factor of HCC. NAFLD can be divided into non-alcoholic simple fatty liver (NAFL) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) based on histopathological features. Recently, studies have indicated that the gut microbiota is associated with NAFLD and HCC. Therefore, in this review, we have discussed the effects of gut microbiota-related mechanisms, including dysbiosis and gut barrier function, and gut microbiota-derived metabolites on NAFLD and HCC pathogenesis and the potential therapeutic strategies for NAFLD and HCC. With a better understanding of the gut microbiota composition and function, new and improved diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies for common liver diseases can be developed.
