Background:To investigate the potential value of volumetric iodine quantification using preoperative dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) for predicting microvascular invasion (MVI) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:This retrospective study included patients with single HCC treated through surgical resection who underwent preoperative DECT. Quantitative DECT features, including normalized iodine concentration (NIC) to the aorta and mixed-energy CT attenuation value in the arterial phase, were three-dimensionally measured for peritumoral and intratumoral regions: (i) layer-by-layer analysis for peritumoral layers (outer layers 1 and 2; numbered in close order from the tumor boundary) and intratumoral layers (inner layers 1 and 2) with 2-mm layer thickness and (ii) volume of interest (VOI)-based analysis with different volume coverage (tumor itself; VOIO1, tumor plus outer layer 1; VOIO2, tumor plus outer layers 1 and 2; VOII1, tumor minus inner layer 1; VOII2, tumor minus inner layers 1 and 2). In addition, qualitative CT features, including peritumoral enhancement and tumor margin, were assessed. Qualitative and quantitative CT features were compared between HCC patients with and without MVI. Diagnostic performance of DECT parameters of layers and VOIs was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.Results:A total of 36 patients (24 men, mean age 59.9 Â± 8.5 years) with MVI (n = 14) and without MVI (n = 22) were included. HCCs with MVI showed significantly higher NICs of outer layer 1, outer layer 2, VOIO1, and VOIO2 than those without MVI (P = 0.01, 0.04, 0.02, 0.02, respectively). Among the NICs of layers and VOIs, the highest area under the curve was obtained in outer layer 1 (0.747). Qualitative features, including peritumoral enhancement and tumor margin, and the mean CT attenuation of each layer and each VOI were not significantly different between HCCs with and without MVI (both P > 0.05).Conclusions:Volumetric iodine quantification of peritumoral and intratumoral regions in arterial phase using DECT may help predict the MVI of HCC.
