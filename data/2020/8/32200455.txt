Purpose:To test the technical reproducibility of acquisition and scanners of CT image-based radiomics model for early recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We included primary HCC patient undergone curative therapies, using early recurrence as endpoint. Four datasets were constructed: 109 images from hospital #1 for training (set 1: 1-mm image slice thickness), 47 images from hospital #1 for internal validation (sets 2 and 3: 1-mm and 10-mm image slice thicknesses, respectively), and 47 images from hospital #2 for external validation (set 4: vastly different from training dataset). A radiomics model was constructed. Radiomics technical reproducibility was measured by overfitting and calibration deviation in external validation dataset. The influence of slice thickness on reproducibility was evaluated in two internal validation datasets.Results:Compared with set 1, the model in set 2 indicated favorable prediction efficiency (the area under the curve 0.79 vs. 0.80, P = 0.47) and good calibration (unreliability statistic U: P = 0.33). However, in set 4, significant overfitting (0.63 vs. 0.80, P Conclusions:CT-based radiomics has poor reproducibility between centers. Image heterogeneity, such as slice thickness, can be a significant influencing factor.
