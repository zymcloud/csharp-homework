Zinc finger protein 521 (ZNF521) plays an important role in the tumor development and process. However, its regulatory role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that ZNF521 mRNA and protein was down-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Down-regulated ZNF521 expression was significantly associated with malignant prognostic features, including advanced TNM stage and large tumor size. For 5-year survival, ZNF521 served as a potential prognostic marker of HCC patients. Moreover, ZNF521 inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation and cell viability through Runx2 transcriptional inhibition and AKT phosphorylation pathway. Moreover, we demonstrated that ZNF521 expression was regulated by miR-802. In HCC tissues. MiR-802 has an inverse correlation with ZNF521 expression. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that ZNF521 is down-regulated in HCC tissues and inhibits HCC growth through Runx2 transcriptional inhibition and AKT inactivation, which was regulated by miR-802, suggesting the potential therapeutic value for HCC.
