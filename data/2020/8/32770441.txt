Cabozantinib is an oral multikinase inhibitor whose targets include vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, MET, and the TAM family of kinases (TYRO3, AXL, MER). Cabozantinib is approved for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who have been previously treated with sorafenib, based on improved overall survival and progression-free survival relative to placebo in the phase III CELESTIAL study. During CELESTIAL, the most common adverse events (AEs) experienced by patients receiving cabozantinib included palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, fatigue, gastrointestinal-related events, and hypertension. These AEs can significantly impact treatment tolerability and patient quality of life. However, AEs can be effectively managed with supportive care and dose modifications. During CELESTIAL, more than half of the patients receiving cabozantinib required a dose reduction, while the rate of treatment discontinuation due to AEs was low. Here, we review the safety profile of cabozantinib and provide guidance on the prevention and management of the more common AEs, based on current evidence from the literature as well as our clinical experience. We consider the specific challenges faced by clinicians in treating this patient population and discuss factors that may affect exposure and tolerability to cabozantinib.
