Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) accounts for >90% of cases of oral cancer, including cancer at the lip and oral cavity and cancer at the oropharynx. Most OSCCs develop from oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs), which consist of heterogeneous lesions with different malignant transformation potentials that make early detection of OSCC a challenge. Using a targeted mass spectrometry-based assay to compare multiple candidate proteins, we previously identified matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) as one of the most promising salivary OSCC biomarkers. To explore the clinical utility of MMP-1 in OSCC detection, we developed an in-house, sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for measuring MMP-1 content, and tested it on saliva samples from 1160 subjects (313 healthy controls, and 578 OPMD and 269 OSCC patients) collected at two medical centers. Salivary MMP-1 levels measured by our in-house ELISA significantly discriminated OSCC patients from non-cancerous groups. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that MMP-1 was effective in separating non-cancer groups from patients with OSCCs at the oral cavity. Additionally, salivary MMP-1 levels in oral cavity cancer patients were highly correlated with tumor progression (tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and overall stage). Collectively, our results indicate that salivary MMP-1 is an effective biomarker for OSCC that can be sensitively detected using our newly developed ELISA. The newly developed MMP-1 ELISA may be used as a new adjunctive tool to aid in detecting and monitoring OSCC.
