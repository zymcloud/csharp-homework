Background:Post-liver transplantation (LT) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence still occurs in approximately 20% of patients and drastically affects their survival. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of various treatments for recurrent HCC after LT in a Chinese population.Methods:A total of 64 HCC patients with tumor recurrence after LT were enrolled in this study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors affecting post-recurrence survival.Results:Of the 64 patients with recurrent HCC after LT, those who received radical resection followed by nonsurgical therapy had a median overall survival (OS) of 20.9 months after HCC recurrence, significantly superior to patients who received only nonsurgical therapy (9.4 months) or best supportive care (2.4 months). The one- and two-year OS following recurrence was favorable for patients receiving radical resection followed by nonsurgical therapy (93.8%, 52.6%), poor for patients receiving only nonsurgical therapy (30.8%, 10.8%), and dismal for patients receiving best supportive care (0%, 0%; overall P Conclusions:Aggressive surgical intervention in well-selected patients significantly improves OS after recurrence. A multidisciplinary treatment approach is required to slow down disease progression for patients with unresectable recurrent HCC.
