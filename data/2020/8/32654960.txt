Purpose:To assess the use of opioid analgesics and/or antiemetic drugs for pain and nausea following selective chemoembolization with doxorubicin-based conventional (c)-transarterial chemoembolization versus drug-eluting embolic (DEE)-transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:From October 2014 to 2016, 283 patients underwent 393 selective chemoembolization procedures including 188 patients (48%) who underwent c-transarterial chemoembolization and 205 (52%) who underwent DEE-transarterial chemoembolization. Medical records for all patients were retrospectively reviewed. Administration of postprocedural opioid and/or antiemetic agents were collated. Time of administration was stratified as phase 1 recovery (0-6 hours) and observation (6-24 hours). Logistic regression model was used to investigate the relationship of transarterial chemoembolization type and use of intravenous and/or oral analgesic and antiemetic medications while controlling for other clinical variables.Results:More patients treated with DEE-transarterial chemoembolization required intravenous analgesia in the observation (6-24 hours) phase (18.5%) than those treated with c-transarterial chemoembolization (10.6%; P = .033). Similar results were noted for oral analgesic agents (50.2% vs. 31.4%, respectively; P Conclusions:Compared to c-transarterial chemoembolization, DEE-transarterial chemoembolization required greater amounts of opioid analgesic and antiemetic agents 6-24 hours after the procedure. Surgical data indicate that a persistent opioid habit can develop even after minor surgeries, therefore, caution should be exercised, and a regimen of nonopiate pain medications should be considered to reduce postprocedural pain after transarterial chemoembolization.
