A new coumarin named (9 R, 10 R)-9, 10-dihydro-10-hydroxy-9-methoxy-bergapten (1) and 13 known compounds (2-14) were isolated from the roots of Heracleum dissectum Ledeb., in which compounds (2-13) were obtained from H. dissectum for the first time. Their structures were illuminated by HR-ESI MS, 1 D and 2 D NMR, optical rotation and comparison with literatures. All compounds were evaluated against hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cell lines and the results showed that candinol C (8) had moderate cytotoxic activity against HepG2 cells with IC50 value at 57.6 ± 1.1 µM.
