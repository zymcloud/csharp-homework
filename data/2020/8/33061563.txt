Background:Hepatic artery interventional therapy has been recognized as the first choice for advanced liver cancer. However, reliable prognostic markers are still lacking. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of inflammation factors including neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with hepatic artery interventional treatments.Methods:Patients undergoing hepatic artery interventional therapy after being diagnosed with HCC between 2007 and 2014 were enrolled. Pre-treatment NLR, PLR and MLR were calculated, and all factors including gender, age, TNM stage, BCLC staging, inflammation factors, LDH, ALP, CEA, AFP, hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, portal vein involvement, surgical history and hepatic artery interventional treatment on overall survival (OS) were evaluated by the univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses.Results:Overall, 407 patients were included. The optimal cutoff values determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses for NLR, PLR and MLR were 3.82, 140.00 and 0.27, respectively. High NLR was associated with worse OS (median survival time: high NLR group 9 vs low NLR group 19 months, HR 1.842, 95% CI: 1.457-2.329, PConclusion:Elevated pre-treatment NLR, PLR and MLR were associated with worse survival time in HCC patients after hepatic artery interventional therapy. Among them, NLR was an independent prognostic factor for OS.
