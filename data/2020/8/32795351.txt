Background:Owing to its low incidence, there is insufficient clinical awareness and diagnostic experience with primary hepatic malignant vascular tumors (PHMVTs). The aim of our study was to investigate the imaging and clinicopathological features of patients with PHMVTs and analyze the clinicopathological correlations.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 42 patients who had pathologically confirmed PHMVT during the period from June 2012 to December 2019 and enrolled them in our study. The computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images and pathological findings of each patient were recorded.Results:There were more female (29/42) than male patients. The imaging features of primary hepatic angiosarcoma (PHA) (n = 11) included ill-defined margins (11/11, 100%), necrosis (5/11, 45%), calcification (3/11, 27%) and "slow in-slow out" centripetal enhancement (7/11, 64%). Patients with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) (n = 15) presented with ill-defined margins (15/15, 100%), necrosis (6/15, 40%), calcification (2/15, 13%), "fast in-slow out" centripetal enhancement (10/15, 67%), halo sign (15/15, 100%), pseudocapsule sign (4/15, 27%), lollipop sign (2/15, 13%) and capsule retraction sign (2/15, 13%). Patients with malignant hemangiopericytoma (MHP) (n = 3) showed ill-defined margins (3/3, 100%), necrosis (3/3, 100%) and "fast in-slow out" progressive enhancement (3/3, 100%). Infantile hemangioendotheliomas (IHEs) (n = 13) were defined by ill-defined margins (7/13, 54%), necrosis (8/13, 62%), calcification (5/13, 38%) and "fast in-slow out" centripetal enhancement (13/13, 100%). Immunohistochemistry showed strong positive expression of CD31, CD34, ERG, FaVIII and FLI-1. Patients with IHE (96 months) and EHE (88 months) had the longest survival times, followed by those with MHP (23 months), while patients with PHA (15 months) had the shortest survival time.Conclusion:On CT and MR images, most PHMVTs were ill-defined, heterogeneous, hypervascular masses with centripetal progressive enhancement and possibly calcification, especially in female patients. The prognosis of patients with PHMVT was associated with the pathological type of the tumor.
