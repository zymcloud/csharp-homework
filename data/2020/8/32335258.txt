Src family kinases (SFKs) play a crucial role in the regulation of multiple cellular pathways, including mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Aberrant activities of one of the most predominant SFKs, c-Src, was identified as a fundamental cause for dysfunctional cell signaling and implicated in cancer development and metastasis, especially in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent work in our laboratory revealed that c-Src is implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism in cancer. In this study, we investigated the effect of c-Src expression on mitochondrial energy metabolism by examining changes in the expression and activities of OXPHOS complexes in liver cancer biopsies and cell lines. An increased expression of c-Src was correlated with an impaired expression of nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded subunits of OXPHOS complexes I and IV, respectively, in metastatic biopsies and cell lines. Additionally, we observed a similar association between high c-Src and reduced OXPHOS complex expression and activity in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines. Interestingly, the inhibition of c-Src kinase activity with the SFK inhibitor PP2 and c-Src siRNA stimulated the expression of complex I and IV subunits and increased their enzymatic activities in both cancer and normal cells. Evidence provided in this study reveals that c-Src impairs the expression and function of mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes, resulting in a significant defect in mitochondrial energy metabolism, which can be a contributing factor to the development and progression of liver cancer. Furthermore, our findings strongly suggest that SFK inhibitors should be used in the treatment of HCC and other cancers with aberrant c-Src kinase activity to improve mitochondrial energy metabolism.
