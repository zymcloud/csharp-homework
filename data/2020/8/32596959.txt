Although renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common malignant urological cancer, its pathogenesis remains unclear. Previous studies have indicated that miR-140-5p acts as a tumor suppressor in various tumors, including bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and gastric cancer, but its biological function in RCC remains unknown. In the present study, we found that miR-140-5p was upregulated in RCC tissues, whereas Kr√ºppel-like factor 9 (KLF9) was downregulated and correlated inversely with miR-140-5p in RCC tissues. miR-140-5p promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of RCC cells in vitro, and knockdown of miR-140-5p significantly suppressed tumor growth and lung metastasis in nude mouse model of RCC. We also found that miR-140-5p significantly suppressed the expression of KLF9 by binding to the 3'-UTR of KLF9 mRNA and that KLF9, as a transcription factor, upregulates KCNQ1 (also called Kv 7.1 and Kv LQT1) expression by binding to the site (-841/-827) in the KCNQ1 promoter region in RCC cells. Moreover, forced expression of KCNQ1 decreased the growth and metastasis of RCC cells. These results suggest that the miR-140-5p/KLF9/KCNQ1 axis functions as a key signaling pathway in RCC progression and metastasis and represents a potential target of RCC therapies.
