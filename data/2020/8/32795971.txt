Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common type of liver cancer and has a high mortality world-widely. The diagnosis, prognoses, and therapeutics are very poor due to the unclear molecular mechanism of progression of the disease. To unveil the molecular mechanism of progression of HCC, we extract a large sample of mRNA expression levels from the GEO database where a total of 167 samples were used for study, and out of them, 115 samples were from HCC tumor tissue. This study aims to investigate the module of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) which are co-expressed only in HCC sample data but not in normal tissue samples. Thereafter, we identified the highly significant module of significant co-expressed genes and formed a PPI network for these genes. There were only six genes (namely, MSH3, DMC1, ALPP, IL10, ZNF223, and HSD17B7) obtained after analysis of the PPI network. Out of six only MSH3, DMC1, HSD17B7, and IL10 were found enriched in GO Term & Pathway enrichment analysis and these candidate genes were mainly involved in cellular process, metabolic and catalytic activity, which promote the development & progression of HCC. Lastly, the composite 3-node FFL reveals the driver miRNAs and TFs associated with our key genes.
