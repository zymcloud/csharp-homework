Objectives:Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) are used as tumour markers for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigate whether combined liver function marker such as gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and PIVKA-II increase their diagnostic predictive value in diagnosis of HCC.Methods:The serum levels of PIVKA-II, AFP and GGT/AST ratio were analysed in 112 transplant candidates. Of these patients, 66 (59%) had HCC and 46 (41%) patients did not.Results:Histological grade was positively correlated with serum levels of PIVKA-II and AFP (r = 0.255, P Conclusions:This study showed that combined tumour markers such as AFP, PIVKA-II and GGT/AST ratio increase their sensitivity in HCC diagnosis.
