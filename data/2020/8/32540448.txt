Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects about 70 million people worldwide. HCV is responsible for both hepatitis and extra-hepatic manifestations. Chronic infection has been shown to develop in about 70% of cases and can progress to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Ten percent of HCV patients may develop extra-hepatic manifestations, including mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Many studies have demonstrated that, after antiviral therapy, MC can disappear along with HCV eradication. After the introduction of the new direct antiviral agents (DAAs), the combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin has been abandoned. Several studies on new DAAs have reported remarkable 90% to 100% eradication rates, regardless of HCV genotype. Treatment with DAAs has comparable efficacy on viral eradication in patients with MC, but definite clinical improvements of vasculitis can be observed only in half the patients. On the contrary, the regression of renal disease and lympho-proliferative disorders, induced by HCV, appears to have a lower remission rate after viral eradication with DAAs and most cases need immunosuppressive treatments. In HCV related CV, the main clinical goal must be early eradication of HCV, to avoid organ complication and manifestation of lympho-proliferative diseases. This review focuses on the role of DAAs in treatment of HCV-related cryoglobulinemic vasculitis.
