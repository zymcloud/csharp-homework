Background:Most effective method for reducing mortality from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is early diagnosis. Despite its lack of adequate sensitivity, ultrasound is considered fundamental for HCC screening.Aim:to evaluate urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) as non-invasive marker for HCC diagnosis in Egyptian patients.Methods:One hundred and twenty patients were divided into three groups (40 patients each): patients with chronic viral hepatitis (HCV or HBV), cirrhotic patients and HCC patients and 40 healthy age and gender matched subjects were enrolled as control group. After clinical assessments, urinary NGAL was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Results:Our results revealed that median level of urinary NGAL was 290, 834, 1090 and 1925 pg/ml in control, chronic hepatitis, cirrhotic and HCC groups respectively among studied groups (pConclusion:Urinary NGAL could be a simple, non-invasive test for diagnosis of HCC in chronic liver disease patients..
