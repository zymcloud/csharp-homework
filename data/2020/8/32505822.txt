Streptomyces Sp FJS31-2 is a strain isolated from special habitat soils in the early stage of our laboratory for producing a new type of halogenated type II polyketide antibiotic with good anti-MRSA activity. In this experiment, a variety of chromatographic and spectroscopic methods was used to isolate and identify a milbemycin compound VM48130 from the ethyl acetate extract of the fermentation products. To investigate its bioactivity, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to test the cytotoxic activity of the compound against a variety of cancer cells (human liver cancer cell line MHCC97H and SK-Hep1, human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE1, mouse melanoma cell line B16, human colon cancer cell line LOVO, human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549) and normal cells (human bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE, human normal liver cell line L02, human nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line NP69). The results showed that the compound had significant cytotoxic activity against the above cancer cells, and the IC50 values were 21.96 ± 1.45, 22.18 ± 0.55, 19.42 ± 0.71, 18.61 ± 1.68, 18.62 ± 0.67, 18.52 ± 0.64 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the CCK-8 method was used to evaluate the compound's reversal of cisplatin resistance in multidrug resistant cisplatin-resistant human lung adenocarcinoma (A549/DDP) cells. The results indicated that when the compound concentration was 0.5 μM, the reversal fold (RF) reached 6.25 and showed a dose-dependent effect. At 5 μM, the RF reached 8.35, which was approximately equivalent to the reversal effect of the positive drug verapamil at the same concentration. The expression of MDR1, MRP1, LRP, MAST1 resistance genes and the corresponding proteins were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot assay, and found that the compound could significantly down-regulate the expression of these genes and proteins. These results indicated that VM48130 had the potential of being a lead compound for the treatment or adjuvant treatment of cancer.
