Goals:To evaluate the impact of a prospective patient-centered hepatitis B virus (HBV) educational intervention on improving HBV care.Background:Improving patients' HBV knowledge has the potential to improve adherence to HBV monitoring and management, particularly among underserved safety-net populations.Methods:Consecutive chronic HBV adults at a single-center safety-net liver clinic were recruited from July 2017 to July 2018 to evaluate the impact of an in-person, language concordant formal HBV educational intervention on improvements in HBV knowledge and HBV management: appropriate HBV clinic follow-up (≥1 visit/year), HBV laboratory monitoring (≥1 HBV viral load and alanine aminotransferase test/year), hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance (≥1 liver imaging test/year among eligible patients), and HBV treatment among treatment eligible patients. HBV knowledge and management were assessed before and after the intervention and compared with age-matched and sex-matched HBV controls who did not receive an education.Results:Among 102 patients with chronic HBV (54.9% men; mean age, 52.0±13.8), HBV education improved HBV knowledge scores by 25% (PConclusion:A formal, in-person, language concordant educational intervention leads to significant improvements in HBV knowledge, resulting in improved HBV monitoring and appropriate HBV treatment.
