Background:The aim of the study was to investigate whether preoperative quantitative analysis of multiphase magnetic resonance images may assist in predicting the pathological grade of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 49 patients with small HCCs (≤3 cm) underwent multiphase magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and were retrospectively reviewed. Routine unenhanced and post gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA)-enhanced MRI were preoperatively performed. Signal intensity (SI) was measured within the designated region of interest (ROI) including those of the lesion and paraspinous muscles. The lesion-to-paraspinous muscle relative contrast ratio (RCR) on T2-weighted (T2W) imaging, diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging, and dynamic phase Gd-BOPTA-enhanced T1W (T1-weighted) imaging were calculated, and statistical analysis was performed to determine the predictive power for the histological grade.Results:In all, 49 cases were included comprising 3 well-differentiated (WD) HCCs, 36 moderately differentiated (MD) HCCs, and 10 poorly differentiated (PD) HCCs. There was a negative correlation between the RCR and pathological grade of small HCC in the arterial phase [correlation coefficient (ρ)=-0.305, P0.05 for all). There was also no correlation between tumor margin, tumor location, cystic/necrotic change, intratumoral fat, enhancement pattern, tumor capsule, tumor boundary or tumor size, and any of the differentiation categories (P>0.05 for all).Conclusions:The lesion-to-paraspinous muscle RCR on arterial phase Gd-BOPTA-enhanced T1W imaging may be useful for the prediction of the histological characteristics of small HCC.
