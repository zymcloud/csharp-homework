Objective:To compare the classification based on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) with that of contrast-enhanced CT and MRI (CECT/MRI) LI-RADS for liver nodules in patients at high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Two hundred thirty-nine patients with 273 nodules were enrolled in this retrospective study. Each nodule was categorized according to the CEUS LI-RADS version 2017 and CECT/MRI LI-RADS version 2017. The diagnostic performance of CEUS and CECT/MRI was compared. The reference standard was histopathology diagnosis. Inter-modality agreement was assessed with Cohen's kappa.Results:The inter-modality agreement for CEUS LI-RADS and CECT/MRI LI-RADS was fair with a kappa value of 0.319 (p Conclusions:The inter-modality agreement of the LI-RADS category between CEUS and CECT/MRI is fair. The positive predictive values of HCCs in LR-5 of the CEUS and CECT/MRI LI-RADS are comparable. CECT/MRI LR-M has better diagnostic performance for non-HCC malignancy than CEUS LR-M.Key points:• The inter-modality agreement for the final LI-RADS category between CEUS and CECT/MRI is fair. • The LR-5 of CEUS and CECT/MRI LI-RADS corresponds to comparable positive predictive values (PPVs) of HCC. For LR-3 and LR-4 nodules categorized by CECT/MRI, CEUS examination should be performed, at least if they can be detected on plain ultrasound. • CECT/MRI LR-M has better diagnostic performance for non-HCC malignancy than CEUS LR-M. For LR-M nodules categorized by CEUS, re-evaluation by CECT/MRI is necessary.
