Objective:The aim of the present study was to analyze the outcome of laparoscopic approach specifically in patients with Intermediate-stage disease and to define the differential benefit with Early-stage patients.Methods:Six hundred twenty-two resections for HCC were dichotomized according to staging (Early and Intermediate) and to approach and then matched in a 1:1 ratio using propensity scores to obtain four groups (E-MILS and E-Open, including 104 patients respectively; Int-MILS and Int-Open, including 142 patients, respectively). The differential benefit associated with the minimally invasive technique was evaluated between intermediate-stage and early-stage patients taking into account blood loss and morbidity rate as outcome indicators.Results:Laparoscopic approach resulted in a statistically significant lower blood loss, reduced morbidity, reduced incidence of hepatic decompensation and shorter time for functional recover and length of stay. The evaluation of the differential benefit showed a greater advantage of laparoscopic approach in Intermediate-stage patients compared with Early-stage patients, both in terms of blood loss and morbidity rate.Conclusions:The favorable biological scenario associated with laparoscopic approach allows to obtain enhanced benefits in the setting of more advanced liver disease. The push towards minimal invasiveness and the incremental benefit associated with it could potentially promote stage migration in suitable patients.
