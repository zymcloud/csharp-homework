APOBEC3G (A3G) cytidine deaminase is an innate immune restriction factor that can edit and inhibit hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. The preferred target of A3G is deamination of the third cytosine of 5'CCC to form a mutant marker 5'CC C → K. However, the distribution of A3G-induced mutations on HBV DNA during infection is not well characterized. To provide clarity, we obtained the HBV DNA sequences from HBV infected individuals with and without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC and non-HCC, respectively), from the NCBI database, and calculated the r values of A3G-induced 5'CCC → K mutation prevalence in HBV DNA. A3G-induced mutations were weakly prevalent and mainly distributed in the plus strand of HBV DNA (r = 1.407). The mutations on the minus strand were weaker (r = .8189). There were A3G-induced mutation regions in the 1200 to 2000 nt region of the plus strand and the 1600 to 1500 nt region of the minus strand. There was no significant difference in the r values of A3G-induced mutations in HBV DNA between the HCC and non-HCC groups. However, the rvalue of the plus strand 2400 to 2800 nt regions of HCC derived HBV DNA (r = 4.2) was significantly higher than that of the same regions of non-HCC derived HBV DNA (r = 1.21). These findings clarify the weak prevalence and preferred plus-strand distribution of A3G-induced mutations on HBV DNA from HCC and non-HCC. These findings may provide valuable clues regarding the interaction mechanism between A3G and HBV DNA and inform HCC screening.
