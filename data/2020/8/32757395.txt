The ability of quinoline alkaloids (cinchonine, cinchonidine, quinine, and quinidine) to sensitize different human cancer cell lines to doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cell death was evaluated. Cell viability was analyzed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and the alkaloids ability to enhance DOX-induced apoptosis was explored using Western blotting analysis. Also, flow cytometry was applied to analyze cell fractions in the different cell cycle phases. All alkaloids showed a significant enhancement of DOX-induced cell death in HeLa and HepG2 cell lines. The chemosensitizing activity of the quinoline alkaloids was attributed to the induction of apoptosis as indicated by splitting of caspase-3 and its substrate poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). In addition, there was an increase in the cell fractions in sub-G0/G1 phase in case of DOX combination with the alkaloids. This study proves the ability of the quinoline alkaloids to enhance DOX-induced apoptotic cell death in human cervical and hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
