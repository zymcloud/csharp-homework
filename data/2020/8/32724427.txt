Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are important in tumor microenvironments and are closely associated with cancer occurrence, metastasis and progression. Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) serves a crucial role in TAM formation. Whether CSF1R expression is regulated by DNA methylation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been fully elucidated. In the current study, HCC and adjacent non-cancerous tissue (ANT) samples were collected from 160 patients with HCC. CSF1R methylation levels were analyzed using a Mass ARRAY Analyzer to establish the potential impact of CSF1R methylation alternations on HCC clinicopathological characteristics. The mean methylation level of the CSF1R promoter (chr 5:149492491-149492958) was demonstrated to be significantly higher in ANTs compared with HCC tissues (65.3±7.5% vs. 57.3±14.4%, respectively; P0.4; P
