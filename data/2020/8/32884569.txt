Background:To compare the efficacies of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) (TACE + RFA) and TACE alone in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and macrovascular invasion (MVI).Methods:In total, 664 patients having HCC with MVI were included. Of these patients, 141 were treated with TACE + RFA, 254 with TACE alone, and 269 with supportive therapy (control group). The overall survival (OS) was compared among these groups. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed for balancing the characteristics of the three groups.Results:After one-to-one PSM, the 12-month OS rates were higher in the TACE and TACE + RFA groups than in the control group (p=0.0009 and p=0.0017, respectively). Furthermore, higher 12-month OS rates were observed in the TACE + RFA group than in the TACE group (p=0.0192). The 12-month OS rates of patients were remarkably higher in Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) < 400 ng/ml, tumor < 3, tumor diameter < 5 cm, or portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) group who were treated with TACE + RFA than in those who were treated with TACE (p=0.0122, p=0.0090, p=0112, and p=0.0071, respectively).Conclusions:TACE + RFA provides a superior survival outcome than TACE alone in HCC patients, especially in AFP
