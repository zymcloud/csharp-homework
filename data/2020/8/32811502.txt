Diacid metabolite as the stable form of norcantharidin (DM-NCTD) derived from Chinese blister beetle (Mylabris spp.). The previous studies reported that DM-NCTD could enhance ABT-737-triggered cell viability inhibition and apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. To translate this synergistic therapy into in vivo anticancer treatment, a folate receptor-targeted lipid bilayer-supported chlorodimethyloctadecylsilane-modified mesoporous silica nanoparticle (FA-LB-CHMSN) with DM-NCTD loaded in CHMSN and ABT-737 in lipid bilayer was prepared, which could promote the cancer cell uptake of the drugs through folate receptor-mediated endocytosis. The structure and the properties of the nanoparticle were evaluated. FA-LB-CHMSN with DM-NCTD/ABT-737 loaded induced apparent tumor cell apoptosis and showed remarkably tumor inhibition in H22 tumor-bearing mice model, with significant cellular apoptosis in the tumor and no obvious toxicity to the tissues. We expect that this nanoparticle could be of interest in both biomaterial investigations for HCC treatment and the combination of chemotherapeutic drugs for synergistic therapies.
