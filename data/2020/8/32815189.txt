Background:The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) guidelines were updated in 2012, and a single large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) more than 5 cm was regarded as BCLC stage A rather than B in the updated version. In this study, we sought to re-evaluate the outcomes of patients with HCC who underwent liver resection (LR) within (stage 0 and A) and beyond (stage B and C) the BCLC guideline recommendations of the updated BCLC staging system.Methods:This retrospective study enrolled 774 consecutive patients with naÃ¯ve HCC who underwent LR from 2011 to 2018 at our institution. The overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) of these patients were examined.Results:Of the patients, 606 had BCLC stage 0 or A HCC, and 168 had BCLC stage B or C HCC. The 5-year OS and RFS among the patients within the BCLC criteria for LR were 75.2% and 56.1%, respectively, vs 54.9% and 34.0%, respectively, among the patients beyond the BCLC criteria (P Conclusions:LR provided acceptable outcomes among selected patients with BCLC stage B and C HCC.
