Objectives:HOXD3 is associated with progression of multiple types of cancer. This study aimed to identify the association of YY1 with HOXD3-ITGA2 axis in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.Materials and methods:Bioinformatics assay was used to identify the effect of YY1, HOXD3 and ITGA2 expression in HCC tissues. The function of YY1 and HOXD3 in HCCs was determined by qRT-PCR, MTT, apoptosis, Western blotting, colony formation, immunohistochemistry, and wound-healing and transwell invasion assays. The relationship between YY1 and HOXD3 or HOXD3 and ITGA2 was explored by RNA-Seq, ChIP-PCR, dual luciferase reports and Pearson's assays. The interactions between YY1 and HDAC1 were determined by immunofluorescence microscopy and Co-IP.Results:Herein, we showed that the expression of YY1, HOXD3 and ITGA2 associated with the histologic and pathologic stages of HCC. Moreover, YY1, recruiting HDAC1, can directly target HOXD3 to regulate progression of HCCs. The relationship between YY1 and HOXD3 was unknown until uncovered by our present investigation. Furthermore, HOXD3 bound to promoter region of ITGA2 and up-regulated the expression, thus activating the ERK1/2 signalling and inducing HCCs proliferation, metastasis and migration in the vitro and vivo.Conclusions:Therefore, HOXD3, a target of YY1, facilitates HCC progression via activation of the ERK1/2 signalling by promoting ITGA2. This finding provides a new whole way to HCC therapy by serving YY1-HOXD3-ITGA2 regulatory axis as a potential therapeutic target for HCC therapy.
