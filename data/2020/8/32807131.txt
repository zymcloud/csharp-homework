Background:Autophagy is a programmed cell degradation mechanism that has been associated with several physiological and pathophysiological processes, including malignancy. Improper induction of autophagy has been proposed to play a pivotal role in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Univariate Cox regression analysis of overall survival (OS) was performed to identify risk-associated autophagy-related genes (ARGs) in HCC data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Multivariate cox regression was then performed to develop a risk prediction model for the prognosis of 370 HCC patients. The multi-target receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the model's accuracy. Besides, the relationship between drug sensitivity and ARGs expression was also examined.Results:A total of 62 differentially expressed ARGs were identified in HCC patients. Univariate and multivariate regression identified five risk-associated ARGs (HDAC1, RHEB, ATIC, SPNS1 and SQSTM1) that were correlated with OS in HCC patients. Of importance, the risk-associated ARGs were independent risk factors in the multivariate risk model including clinical parameters such as malignant stage (HR = 1.433, 95% CI = 1.293-1.589, P Conclusion:We developed a novel prognostic risk model by integrating the molecular signature and clinical parameters of HCC, which can effectively predict the outcomes of HCC patients.
