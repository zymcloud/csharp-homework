Background:Currently, pediatric-inspired regimens are commonly applied to adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after the recent recognition that these protocols improve survival. While asparaginase in whatever available formulation is a key component of modern treatment of ALL, many adult oncologists and hematologists struggle to deal with its particular toxicities in clinical practice. We reviewed toxicity outcomes of pegylated asparaginase (PEG-ASP) in adults with ALL treated in 3 reference centers in Brazil.Patients and methods:This was a cross-sectional retrospective chart-review study encompassing patients aged 15 years and older diagnosed with ALL or ambiguous-lineage leukemia who received at least one dose of PEG-ASP, regardless of the adopted regimen.Results:A total of 57 patients were included (age range, 15-57 years). Most patients (70%) received 2000 IU/m2 as the initial dose, by intravenous route (72%). The incidence of thromboembolic events was 17.5%, and the main site was cerebral venous sinus (4/10). Thrombosis was more frequent in patients receiving second-line treatment. In obese patients, grade 3 hepatotoxicity and hyperbilirubinemia were more common. Clinical pancreatitis (grade 3 or higher) was found in 2 of 57 cases. PEG-ASP had to be discontinued in 19.3% of exposed patients (11/57).Conclusion:By reviewing the medical charts of adult patients with ALL from 3 reference centers, we found that our incidence of thrombotic and hepatic adverse events is similar to those reported in other trials involving PEG-ASP. Usually these effects should not preclude further use of the drug because most events are manageable in routine clinical practice.
