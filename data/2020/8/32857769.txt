Background:Copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) are essential nutrients and cofactors of enzymatic reactions with their binding partner. Metallothionein (MT) plays an important role in protecting against heavy metals and oxidative injury, however it may also portend drug resistance and a worse prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. The aim of this study was to determine the amount of Cu, Zn, Cu/Zn and MT in evaluating a group of patients with HCC, including those treated with lenvatinib.Methods:We enrolled 175 patients with HCC (139 men, 36 women; mean age 71.1 years; hepatitis C virus n = 85, hepatitis B virus n = 19, hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus n = 2, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis n = 39, alcohol n = 25, others n = 5; Child-Pugh A n = 141, Child-Pugh B n = 30, Child-Pugh C n = 4; Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) stage 0 n = 38, stage A n = 56, stage B n = 39, stage C n = 38, stage D n = 4). We evaluated the associations between Cu, Zn and MT. The study outcome was liver cancer-specific survival. Moreover, we treated 12 HCC patients with lenvatinib and investigated the changes in MT during lenvatinib therapy.Results:The serum level of Cu was positively correlated with alanine aminotransferase and the BCLC stage. The serum level of Zn decreased concordant with liver disease progression. Patients with a Cu/Zn ratioâ‰¥0.999 had significantly improved rates of survival when compared to patients with a Cu/Zn ratioConclusions:The Cu/Zn ratio could serve as a useful predictive marker for survival in cases of HCC. MT levels increased in HCC patients receiving lenvatinib therapy, and maybe a predictor of reduced survival.
