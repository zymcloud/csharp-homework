Background:We retrospectively investigated factors predictive for ascites after hepatic resection to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:The data of 114 patients with HCC who underwent curative hepatic resection were reviewed. The patients were assigned to two groups according to the presence or not of postoperative ascites.Results:Ascites occurred in 16 patients (14.0%), and refractory ascites in four (3.5%). A MAC2-binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) cutoff index of 1.61 [sensitivity=75.0%, specificity 67.9%, area under the curve (AUC)=0.745] and virtual touch tissue quantification (VTQ) of 2.62 (sensitivity=68.8%, specificity=89.8%, AUC=0.827) were the best cut-off values. Patients with ascites had lower serum albumin levels, higher serum creatinine levels, higher albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade, higher M2BPGi, higher VTQ, and longer operative time. ALBI grade 2 and both M2BPGi>1.61 and VTQ>2.62 were independent predictors of postoperative ascites.Conclusion:We demonstrated retrospectively that ALBI grade 2 and both high M2BPGi and VTQ were independent predictors of postoperative ascites in patients undergoing hepatic resection for HCC.
