Introduction:The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks sixth in the world, but its mortality is the third highest due to the lack of early diagnostic markers. Nowadays, the increase of autoantibody levels has been found in many cancers, and many studies have begun to pay attention to the detection of anti-p53 antibodies in HCC. The purpose of this study is to quantitatively and comprehensively analyze the potential diagnostic value of anti-p53 autoantibodies in HCC METHODS:: English articles up to November 2019 were collected. The overall sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Besides, the positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and summary receiver operating characteristic curves of the overall diagnostic accuracy of anti-p53 antibody were calculated by STATA software. Finally, according to the heterogeneity of the results, the subgroup analysis, and the publication bias were performed.Results:A total of 16 eligible studies were incorporated into this meta-analysis, including 1323 patients with HCC and 1896 control. The pooled sensitivity was 0.28(0.17-0.41) and specificity was 0.98 (0.95-0.99). The pooled DOR was 10.44 (6.31-17.29) and the pooled NLR was 0.74 (0.63-0.86). The area under ROC curve of symmetrical ROC was 0.840.Conclusions:The anti-p53 antibody has a high specificity for HCC, but the low sensitivity is not perfect and would limit the clinical application. The anti-p53 antibody would help rule out HCC but not help rule in HCC for early diagnosis. Whether combined as a diagnostic panel with other biomarkers or laboratory tests may prove useful requires further study.
