A novel strategy on combining variational mode decomposition (VMD) and composite weighted-scale sample entropy (CWSE) modified from composite multiscale entropy (CMSE) is proposed to screen hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by measuring the terahertz (THz) pulse signals of ten normal and ten HCC serums. Eight measured HCC specimens are negative in serum biomarker alpha fetoprotein (AFP) determination. In CWSE, the time series with weighted-scales are generated from the weighted average processing in the coarse-grained time series corresponding to each scale of the CMSE algorithm. VMD served as a preprocessing method was introduced into decomposing THz signal to obtain the mode functions of specific bandwidth for identification. Final results reveal that more obtainable entropy values of CWSE for recognition in comparison to those of CMSE on the basis of the rule of statistically significant difference and effect size and also manifest the stronger discriminability than the traditional THz parameters. This study provides a new potential auxiliary tool for diagnosis HCC and develops the methodology on the discrimination for similar THz signals.
