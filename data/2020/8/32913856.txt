Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer death, causing about 750000 deaths worldwide every year. Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma will often only receive transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). Glypican-3 (GPC3) is one of the most promising serum markers for HCC. Abnormal expression of miRNAs may be involved in the occurrence and development of tumor.Aim:To explore the value of miR-1271 and GPC3 in evaluating the prognosis of patients with HCC after TACE.Methods:From January 2016 to December 2018, 162 patients with advanced HCC who received TACE in our hospital were selected into the cancer group, and 162 patients who underwent physical examination during the same period were selected into the health group. The patients in the HCC group were treated with TACE. The changes of serum GPC3 and circulating miR-1271 in the HCC before and after TACE were analyzed. The expression of serum GPC3 was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the expression of circulating miR-1271 was detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The methodological results of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of miR-1271 and GPC3 alone and joint detection of HCC were also evaluated.Results:The level of serum GPC3 in patients with HCC was significantly higher than that in healthy controls. GPC3 levels were increased in both HCC patients and those treated with TACE compared with healthy controls. After TACE, the level of serum GPC3 was significantly lower than that before treatment (P < 0.05), and the level of circulating miR-1271 was significantly higher than that before treatment (P < 0.05). There were 112 cases (69.14%) with remission (complete remission + complete remission + stable disease) and 50 cases (30.86%) with relapse disease progression in HCC patients. After TACE, the miR-1271 level in patients with remission and relapse was lower than that in the healthy group, and the GPC3 level was higher than that in the healthy group, the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The miR-1271 of relapsed patients was lower than that of remission patients, and the level of GPC3 was higher than that of remission patients, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The sensitivity of combined detection of miR-1271 and GPC3 was significantly higher than that of single detection, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05); while the specificity of the two combined detections was lower than that of the single detection; and the accuracy was slightly higher than that of single detection, but the difference was not statistically significant.Conclusion:The level of miR-1271 in patients with HCC was significantly increased and the level of GPC3 was decreased after TACE. Monitoring the levels of serum GPC3 and circulating miR-1271 has important clinical reference value for evaluating the prognosis of patients with HCC. The levels of serum GPC3 and circulating miR-1271 may help to determine tumor recurrence, evaluate survival status, and guide the next step of treatment.
