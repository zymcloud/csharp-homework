Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a poor prognosis in the setting of chronic inflammation and fibrosis, both of which promote nuclear DNA oxidative damage. 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) DNA glycosylase (OGG1) enhances the repair of 8-OHdG, which is the primary oxidative stress-induced mutation that leads to malignant alterations. This study aims to clarify the relationships between oxidative stress-induced factors and HCC progression. The clinicopathological factors were compared with immunohistochemistry OGG1 and 8-OHdG expressions in 86 resected HCC specimens. High 8-OHdG expression was associated with high serum aspartate transaminase and total bilirubin levels, as well as a low platelet count, compared with low 8-OHdG expression. Histological liver cirrhosis and poor differentiation were more frequent in patients with high 8-OHdG expression than in those with low 8-OHdG expression. The 8-OHdG was negatively correlated with OGG1 expression in HCC patients. Therefore, we classified the patients into two groups, low OGG1/high 8-OHdG group and the other group. The patients with low OGG1/high 8-OHdG expressions had worse prognosis than those with the other expressions. Our results showed that low OGG1/high 8-OHdG expressions in nuclei influence HCC patient outcomes. Evaluating the patterns of OGG1 and 8-OHdG expressions might provide pivotal prognostic biomarkers in patients with HCC.
