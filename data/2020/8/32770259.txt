The "macrotrabecular-massive" (MTM) pattern of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been suggested to represent a distinct HCC subtype and is associated with specific molecular features. Since the immune microenvironment is heterogenous in HCC, it is important to evaluate the immune microenvironment of this novel variant. CMTM6, a key regulator of PD-L1, is an important immunocheckpoint inhibitor. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic effect of CMTM6/PD-L1 coexpression and its relationship with inflammatory cells in HCC. We analyzed 619 HCC patients and tumors were classified into MTM and non-MTM HCC subtypes. The expression levels of CMTM6 and PD-L1 in tumor and inflammatory cells were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The density of inflammatory cells in the cancer cell nest was calculated. Tumoral PD-L1 expression and inflammatory cell density were higher in the MTM type than in the non-MTM type. CMTM6-high expression was significantly associated with shorter OS and DFS than CMTM6-low expression in the whole HCC patient population and the MTM HCC patient population. Moreover, MTM HCC patients with CMTM6/PD-L1 coexpression experienced a higher risk of HCC progression and death. In addition, CMTM6/PD-L1 coexpression was shown to be related to a high density of inflammatory cells. Notably, a new immune classification, based on CMTM6/PD-L1 coexpression and inflammatory cells, successfully stratified OS and DFS in MTM HCC. CMTM6/PD-L1 coexpression has an adverse effect on the prognosis of HCC patients, especially MTM HCC patients. Our study provides evidence for the combination of immune status assessment with anti-CMTM6 and anti-PD-L1 therapy in MTM HCC patients.
