Background:T cell receptor gamma locus antisense RNA 1 (TRG-AS1) has been reported to involve in the progression of glioblastoma, however the role and its underlying molecular mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown.Methods:Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was applied to detect TRG-AS1 expression in HCC cells. Besides, the proliferation abilities of HCC cells were assessed by colony formation and EdU assays. The migratory and invasive abilities of HCC cells were examined by transwell assays. Imunofluorescence staining (IF) was used to analyze the epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT). The interaction among TRG-AS1, miR-4500 and BTB domain and CNC homolog 1 (BACH1) were proofed by means of RIP and RNA pull down and luciferase reporter assays.Results:TRG-AS1 was conspicuously overexpressed in HCC cells. TRG-AS1 silencing apparently suppressed HCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanism exploration revealed that TRG-AS1 acted as a molecular sponge of miR-4500 to regulate BACH1. MiR-4500 silencing or BACH1 overexpression in BACH1-downregulated cells fully rescued cell proliferation migration, invasion and EMT progress.Conclusion:TRG-AS1 regulates HCC progression by targeting miR-4500/BACH1 axis.
