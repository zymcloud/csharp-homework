Purpose:This study aimed to evaluate survival outcomes in patients with non-B non-C hepatocellular carcinoma (NBNC-HCC) with reference to patients with HCC achieving sustained virological response (SVR) by preoperative interferon (IFN) treatment for chronic hepatitis C.Methods:We examined 781 patients who underwent hepatic resection for HCC. They were classified into NBNC-HCC, SVR-HCC, and non-SVR HCC groups.Results:Multivariate analysis for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) revealed that the adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of NBNC-HCC and non-SVR HCC groups with reference to the SVR-HCC group were 1.46 (p = 0.10) and 2.10 (p Conclusions:NBNC-HCC patients had an increased risk for overall death as compared with those with SVR-HCC. Worsening of background liver function may reduce the chances of re-hepatic resection for recurrence and increase the risk for overall death in NBNC-HCC patients. For alcoholic hepatitis patients, sobriety may prevent deterioration of liver function after surgery.
