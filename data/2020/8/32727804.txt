Background/aim:Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of salvage surgery following downstaging of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim was to assess the outcomes of salvage surgery after successful downstaging using hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC).Patients and methods:Patients whose diagnosis was unresectable locally advanced HCC and who were resected after conversion to a resectable status by HAIC were included. The overall survival (OS) rate, and disease-free survival (DFS) rate were analyzed by stratifying patients into those with Vp3/4, Vv2/3, and those without major vascular invasion (MVI).Results:Eighteen patients were censored. Among them, six patients had Vp3/4, four patients had Vv2/3, and eight patients had no MVI. The 5-year OS rates of patients with Vp3/4 and those without MVI were 83% and 73%, respectively, whereas those with Vv2/3 had 0% (pConclusion:Salvage surgery has the potential to provide excellent outcomes in resectable HCC patients, except for those with Vv2/3.
