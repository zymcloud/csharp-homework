Chronic liver disorders are the main leading cause of morbidity and mortality data. Viral infection, toxic injury, metabolic, autoimmun, storage disorders, in the case of ongoing presence of the etiological factors, could result in fibrotic remodelling in the liver. The process is complex, not fully understood in details; cells, cytokines, chemokines release, altered secretion of hepatokines, lipotoxicity, innate immun system, gut microbiom, metal ions and free radical reactions all have a role in it. Chronic liver disorders are often symptomless, diagnosed in the stage of fibrotic tissue accumulation, liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma formation, when the prognosis is poor, treatment options are narrow. Noninvasive, properly sensitive and specific biomarkers are the targets of studies, with them the necessity of liver biopsies can be decreased, through the follow-up of processes, progression and treatment efficacy. Authors review the processes taking part in the progression of the most frequent chronic liver disorders, emphasizing the parameters of pro/antioxidant balance, and the necessity of a combined reliable biomarker.
