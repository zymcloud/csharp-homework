Background/Aims Regorafenib has been approved as a second-line systemic therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after the phase III RESORCE trial. This study analyzed real-world data to assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of regorafenib compared to the RESORCE trial. Methods This multicenter cohort study included HCC patients treated with regorafenib after sorafenib (n = 133). We evaluated the time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety in patients receiving regorafenib along with the predictors of prognosis. Results The median age was 60 years and 81.2% patients were men. Hepatitis B virus infection (68.4%) was the commonest etiology. Most patients were classified as Child-Pugh A (98.5%) and had extrahepatic metastasis (84%) and vascular invasion (45.1%). This study demonstrated similar characteristics apart from more frequent hepatitis B etiology and more vascular or extrahepatic involvement compared with the RESORCE trial. An objective response rate of 12.5% was obtained for response assessment (n = 112); the disease control rate was 34.8%. Thirty-eight patients died during follow-up. With regorafenib, the median OS, PFS, and TTP were 10.0, 2.7, and 2.6 months, respectively. In the exploratory analysis after sorafenib administration, the median OS was 25.8 months. The rate of response and survival were comparable to those in the RESORCE trial. Child-Pugh score > 5, alpha-fetoprotein > 400 ng/ml, and TTP for sorafenib â‰¥ median were independently associated with OS. Conclusions This real-word regorafenib study showed comparable effectiveness and safety to the RESORCE trial. Regorafenib improves the prognosis of patients with prolonged TTP during previous sorafenib therapy.
