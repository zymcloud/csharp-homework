Background:Gadoxetate sodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA) is taken into hepatocytes and excreted into the bile. Hepatocytes with reduced function or dysfunction due to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hepatitis or hepatic fibrosis show impaired Gd-EOB-DTPA uptake. The purpose of the present retrospective case series was to assess the relationship between liver function and contrast enhancement using Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI.Methods:Sixteen dogs with a histopathological diagnosis of liver disease, including six with HCC, three with nodular hyperplasia, two with hepatocellular adenoma, two with liver fibrosis and three with hepatitis were included in the study along with three dogs with suspected liver disease but no histopathological diagnosis of liver disease. Relative signal intensities (RSI) of the common bile duct and gall bladder were calculated, and their relationship with the following serum biochemical parameters was assessed: total bilirubin, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and albumin (Alb). To assess anatomical liver function, relative contrast enhancement indices (RCEI) of the liver were calculated, and differences were assessed between normal and diseased liver.Results:RSI showed no significant differences between dogs without and with a histopathological diagnosis of liver disease (P=0.88) although they were significantly correlated with Alb (œÅ=0.57, P=0.02) in dogs with a histopathological diagnosis of liver disease. RCEI was significantly higher in normal liver tissue than that in livers with hepatitis/fibrosis (P=0.048) and HCC (P=0.03) but not nodular hyperplasia/hepatocellular adenoma (P=0.51).Conclusions:Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI may be potentially useful in the assessment of anatomical liver function in dogs with liver disease.
