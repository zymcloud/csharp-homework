Background/aim:In this retrospective study, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of immune-cell therapy using T lymphocytes activated in vitro with or without dendritic cell vaccination in combination with standard therapies in terms of the survival of patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial and cervical cancers of the uterus.Patients and methods:A total of 187 patients with advanced or recurrent uterine cancer were enrolled in this study. The correlation between overall survival and various clinical factors was examined by univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:Univariate analysis revealed that the prognosis was improved in uterine cancer patients who received immune-cell therapy without prior chemotherapy or without distant metastasis. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the absence of prior chemotherapy for endometrial cancer and liver/lung metastasis of cervical cancer are indications for immune-cell therapy.Conclusion:Survival benefit in uterine cancer patients could be potentially obtained by a combination of immune-cell therapy with other therapies.
