Objective:To investigate the effect of perioperative antiviral therapy on the prognosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA-negative patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The clinical data of 140 patients who were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) but negative for HBV DNA before partial hepatectomy were retrospectively analyzed. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to eliminate the influence of confounding factors on prognosis. Postoperative liver function, HBV reactivation rate, recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between antiviral and non-antiviral therapy groups.Results:Compared with the non-antiviral therapy group, the antiviral therapy group had a lower rate of HBV reactivation and better postoperative liver function (P Conclusion:Perioperative antiviral therapy can significantly reduce the risk of HBV reactivation and improve postoperative liver function, RFS and OS.
