Alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase 2-like 1 (AGXT2L1) is a modulator of phospholipid metabolism, and its role in tumor biology is obscure. Previously, significant downregulation of AGXT2L1 has been observed in hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of the present study was to investigate AGXT2L1 expression and its association with the clinical characteristics of common carcinomas of the digestive system. In the present study, the expression levels of AGXT2L1 were detected by immunohistochemical staining in colorectal cancer (CRC), gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer tissues. The associations between AGXT2L1 expression and clinicopathological features were analyzed using public gene expression datasets. Small interfering RNA was transfected into SW480 and HCT116 cells to explore the role of AGXT2L1 in CRC cells. AGXT2L1 expression was significantly decreased in cancerous tissues compared with in normal tissues, and low AGXT2L1 expression was associated with an unfavorable prognosis in patients. Furthermore, it was revealed that AGXT2L1 may regulate phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine metabolism in cancerous tissues, and that decreased AGXT2L1 expression could induce autophagy in CRC cells. Overall, the present study provides a basis for further understanding of the role of AGXT2L1 and its association with autophagy in cancer.
