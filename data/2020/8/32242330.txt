Chronic liver injury due to viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, and metabolic disorders is a worldwide health concern. Insufficient treatment of chronic liver injury leads to fibrosis, causing liver dysfunction and carcinogenesis. Most cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develop in the fibrotic liver. Pathological features of liver fibrosis include extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation, mesenchymal cell activation, immune deregulation, and angiogenesis, all of which contribute to the precancerous environment, supporting tumor development. Among liver cells, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and macrophages play critical roles in fibrosis and HCC. These two cell types interplay and remodel the ECM and immune microenvironment in the fibrotic liver. Once HCC develops, HCC-derived factors influence HSCs and macrophages to switch to protumorigenic cell populations, cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor-associated macrophages, respectively. This review aims to summarize currently available data on the roles of HSCs and macrophages in liver fibrosis and HCC, with a focus on their interaction.
