Presently, there is a lack of effective blood-based biomarkers facilitating the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus, we aimed to investigate novel methylation markers for HCC diagnosis, and explore relationships between biomarker methylation and clinicopathology of HCC. The methylation status of the SCAN domain containing three (SCAND3) and myosin 1g (Myo1g) genes in HCC cell lines and tissues were detected by digital droplet PCR. The serum SCAND3 and Myo1g methylation levels were analyzed in HCC-afflicted patients and unafflicted controls. The results indicated SCAND3 and Myo1g methylation were abnormally high in the HCC cell lines and tissues. The values of serum SCAND3, Myo1g, and SCAND3 + Myo1g methylation with respect to facilitating the detection, and early detection of HCC were better than for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) alone. Furthermore, when we combined SCAND3 + Myo1g with AFP, a high sensitivity and specificity resulted. Notably, in the AFP-negative HCC group, the methylation of SCAND3 and Myo1g also showed an excellent diagnostic performance. Besides this, a high serum SCAND3 methylation level was an independent risk factor for predicting portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) in HCC patients (OR = 4.746, p = 0.013). Finally, SCAND3 and Myo1g enhanced the HCC diagnostics as noninvasive serum methylation biomarkers, and the SCAND3 methylation status effectively indicated HCC accompanied by PVTT.
