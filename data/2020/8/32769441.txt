Esophageal cancer (EC) is known as a type of common malignant tumor, with the incidence ranking eighth worldwide. Because of the high metastasis of advanced EC, the total survival rate has been quite low. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a main type of EC. Targeted therapy for ESCC has become a new direction; however, newly therapeutic targets are also badly needed. Shc SH2 domain-binding protein (SHCBP1) is located on 16q11.2, which is a downstream protein of the Shc adaptor. SHCBP1 participates in the regulation of several physiological and pathologic processes, such as cytokinesis. Recent studies have found that SHCBP1 was abnormally upregulated in multiple types of tumors, such as breast cancer and liver cancer, and that it affects the proliferation and motility of cancer cells in vitro. However, it remains unclear whether SHCBP1 is related to the progression of EC. Herein, we found the upregulation of SHCBP1 in human EC tissues. Our findings further demonstrated that SHCBP1 expression was related to the clinical features of ESCC patients. We found that SHCBP1 depletion inhibited the proliferation and motility of ESCC cells via the transforming growth factor Î² pathway and that it suppressed the growth of tumors in mice. We, therefore, concluded that SHCBP1 could serve as a promising EC molecular target.
