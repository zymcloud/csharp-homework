The impact of different antiviral regimen on prognosis of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be explored.A total of 479 CHB-related HCC patients after curative liver resection were enrolled receiving tenofovir (TDF, TDF group) or lamivudine, telbivudine, and entecavir (non-TDF group). Both the overall survival and diseases-free survival were analyzed and compared.A total of 242 patients received TDF treatment and 237 patients received other antiviral regimen. Child-Pugh score, serum Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) level, total bilirubin level, status of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), and cirrhosis were compared between groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with TDF treatment had significantly longer overall survival than those of patients with other regimen (P = .015). Similarly, compared with patients with non-TDF treatment, disease-free survival time was longer (P = .042) in those with TDF treatment. Multivariate analysis showed that TDF treatment (P = .04), AFP level (P = .03) were significant independent factors associated with overall survival of CHB-related HCC patients. While TDF treatment (P = .04) and serum AFP level (P = .03) were independent factors associated with disease-free survival.Anti-virus treatment with TDF benefits for both overall survival and disease-free survival of CHB-related patients than other Nucleos(t)ide analogues.
