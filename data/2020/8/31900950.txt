Citrullinated histone H3 (H3Cit) is the product of the conversion of peptidylarginine to citrulline in histone H3. We evaluated the H3Cit level in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and assessed its association with Beclin1 messenger RNA (mRNA) (a key autophagic regulator). The level of H3Cit was detected by a capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while Beclin1 mRNA was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 80 HBV-related patients with HCC. We found that the mean level of H3Cit was 72.25 ng/mg in HCC and 44.02 ng/mg in nontumor tissues. The mean HCC/nontumor ratio of Beclin1 mRNA was higher (0.096) in tumor samples than in nontumor specimens (0.056). Specifically, Beclin1 mRNA was elevated in 51 HCC cases (63.75%) and decreased in 29 cases (36.25%). Moreover, the levels of H3Cit and Beclin1 mRNA were significantly associated with vascular invasion and serum AFP levels. A shorter survival (19 months) was associated with a high H3Cit level. We also found increased levels of Beclin1 mRNA in the H3Cit (high) group compared with the H3Cit (low) group. The results implied that elevated histone H3 citrullination is associated with increased Beclin1 expression during the development of HBV-related HCC.
