Purpose:To determine preferences of clinicians and surgeons regarding radiology reporting of liver observations in patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Members of the American College of Radiology Liver Imaging and Data Reporting System (LI-RADS) Outreach & Education Group (30 members) as well as Society of Abdominal Radiology Disease-Focused Panel on HCC diagnosis (27 members) created and distributed an 18-question survey to clinicians and surgeons, with focus on preferences regarding radiology reporting of liver observations in patients. The survey questions were directed to physician demographics, current use of LI-RADS by their local radiologists, their opinions about current LI-RADS and potential improvements.Results:A total of 152 physicians responded, 66.4% (101/152) from North America, including 42 surgeons, 81 physicians and 29 interventional radiologists. Participants were predominantly from academic centers 83% (126/152), while 13.8% (21/152) worked in private/community centers and 3.2% (5/152) worked in a hybrid practice. Almost 90% (136/152) of participants preferred the use of LI-RADS (compared to nothing or other standardized reporting systems; OPTN and AASLD) to communicate liver-related observations. However, only 28.5% (43/152) of participants input was sought at the time of implementing LI-RADS in their institutions. Fifty-eight percent (88/152) of all participants found standardized LI-RADS management recommendations in radiology reports to be clinically helpful. However, a subgroup analysis of surgeons in academic centers showed that 61.8% (21/34) prefer not to receive standardized LI-RADS recommendations.Conclusions:Most participants preferred the use LI-RADS in reporting CT and MRI examination. When considering inclusion of management recommendations, radiologists should consult with their referring physicians, as preference may differ.
