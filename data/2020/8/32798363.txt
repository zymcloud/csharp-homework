Introduction:This study aimed to evaluate the potential of non-contrast enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging as an imaging surveillance tool for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) detection in at-risk patients and to compare the performance of non-contrast MR imaging with ultrasonography (US) as a screening modality for the same.Methods:In this retrospective study, patients diagnosed with HCC between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2015 were selected from our institution's cancer registry. Patients with MR imaging and US scanning performed within three months of the MR imaging were included. For each MR imaging, two non-contrast MR imaging sequences - T2-weighted fat-saturated sequence (T2w-FS) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) - were reviewed for the presence of suspicious lesions. A non-contrast MR image was considered positive if the lesion was seen on both sequences. The performance of non-contrast MR imaging was compared to that of hepatobiliary US for the detection of HCC.Results:A total of 73 patients with 108 HCCs were evaluated. Sensitivity of non-contrast MR imaging for the detection of HCC using T2w-FS and DWI was 93.2%, which was significantly higher than that of US, at 79.5% (p = 0.02). In a subgroup of 55 patients with imaging features of liver cirrhosis, the sensitivity of non-contrast MR imaging was 90.9%, which was also significantly higher than US, at 74.5% (p = 0.02).Conclusion:Our pilot study showed that non-contrast MR imaging, using a combination of T2w-FS and DWI, is a potential alternative to US as a screening tool for the surveillance of patients at risk for HCC.
