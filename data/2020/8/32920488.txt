Chronic HCV can result in advanced liver disease, including cirrhosis. Patients with advanced fibrosis experience poor clinical outcomes and increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These outcomes are, in part, a consequence of immune dysfunction. Increased inhibitory receptor and Galectin-9 (GAL-9) expression is a possible mechanism promoting lymphocyte dysfunction. In this study, we measured the expression of inhibitory receptors and GAL-9 on T/NK cells of patients with chronic HCV with no to moderate fibrosis (F0-F2) and advanced fibrosis (F3-F4). To analyze their co-expression, we employed t-SNE analysis. Notably, we found that F3-F4 patients had higher frequencies of >3 inhibitory receptor co-expression on NK cells. Moreover, F3-F4 patients manifest a higher frequency of NK cells co-expressing TIGIT and TIM-3, and CD4/NK cells co-expressing LAG-3 and GAL-9. In conclusion, we identified phenotypes of immune dysregulation that could explain the increased susceptibility to infection and HCC in patients with chronic HCV with advanced fibrosis.
