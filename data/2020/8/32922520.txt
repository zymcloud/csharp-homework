Background:Long non-coding RNAs have suppressive or oncogenic effects in various types of cancers by serving as competing endogenous RNAs for specific microRNAs. In the present study, we aim to delineate the underlying mechanism by which the LINC00473/miR-29a-3p/Robo1 axis affects cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The level of Robo1 was examined in HCC tissues and cells, along with its regulatory effects on proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells. Afterwards, the possible involvement of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was determined. Next, miR-29a-3p expression was overexpressed or inhibited to investigate its regulatory role on HCC cell activities. The interaction among miR-29a-3p, Robo1, and LINC00473 was further characterized. Finally, a xenograft tumor in nude mice was conducted to measure tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo.Results:miR-29a-3p was downregulated while Robo1 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cells. miR-29a-3p targeted Robo1 and negatively regulated its expression. In response to miR-29a-3p overexpression, Robo1 silencing or LINC00473 silencing, HCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, tumor progression, and metastasis were impeded, which was involved with the inactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Notably, LINC00473 could competitively bind to miR-29a-3p to upregulate Robo1 expression.Conclusion:LINC00473 might be involved in HCC progression by acting as a miR-29a-3p sponge to upregulate the expression of Robo1 that activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which leads to enhanced cell proliferation, migration, invasion, tumor progression, and metastasis in HCC.
