Purpose:To describe ablation of bone, liver, lung, and soft tissue tumors from oligometastatic breast cancer and to define predictors of local progression and progression-free survival (PFS).Materials and methods:A total of 33 women (mean age 52 ± 12 years old; range, 28-69 years), underwent 46 thermal ablations of liver (n = 35), lung (n = 7), and bone/soft tissue (n = 4) metastases. Mean tumor diameter was 18 ± 15 mm (range, 6-50 mm). Ablations were performed to eradicate all evident sites of disease (n = 24) or to control growing sites in the setting of other stable or responding sites of disease (n = 22). Patient characteristics, ablation margins, imaging responses, and cases of PFS were assessed. Follow-up imaging was performed using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, or positron-emission tomography/ CT.Results:Median PFS was 10 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.2 -14.5 months), and time to local progression was 11 months (95% CI, 5-16 months). Eight patients (24%) maintained no evidence of disease during a median follow-up period of 39 months. Ablation margin ≥5 mm was associated with no local tumor progression. Longer PFS was noted in estrogen receptor-positive patients (12 vs 4 months; P = .037) and younger patients (12 vs 4 months; P = .039) treated to eradicate all sites of disease (13 vs 5 months; P = .05). Eighteen patients (55%) developed new metastases during study follow-up.Conclusions:Thermal ablation of oligometastatic pulmonary, hepatic, bone, and soft tissue tumors can eliminate local tumor progression if margins are ≥5 mm. Longer PFS was observed in patients who were estrogen receptor-positive and patients who were younger and in whom all sites of disease were eradicated.
