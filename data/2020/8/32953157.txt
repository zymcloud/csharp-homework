Background:For lack of accurate diagnosis and ideal prognosis assessment, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become the fourth cancers-related death malignant diseases. Small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) have been investigated as a new class of regulators associated with pathogenesis and clinical evaluation of tumors such as HCC. As for RNU5E-1, one newly identified snRNA, may have similar functions. However, the relationship between RNU5E-1 expression and HCC tumorigenesis remains unclear.Methods:The relative RNU5E-1 expression was measured in several HCC cell lines and HCC tissues of 100 patients using quantitative real-time PCR. All patients were grouped according to individual RNU5E-1 expression. Then, the potential association between RNU5E-1 expression in HCC clinical characteristics and prognostic information of patients was evaluated.Results:Compared to human normal hepatocyte cell line QSG-7701, the RNU5E-1 expression in HCC cell lines (fold change: SK-HEP-1, 0.417; Hep 3B, 0.313; Huh-7, 0.189) were significantly down-regulated (PConclusions:The research revealed that RNU5E-1 was down-regulated in HCC and it could be one of indicators for diagnosis and prognostic prediction of HCC patients.
