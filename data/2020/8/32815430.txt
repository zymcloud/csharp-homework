Objective:Microvascular invasion is shown to be an independent risk factor for liver cancer recurrence. Timely treatment may reduce the recurrence rate and prolong total survival time. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of sorafenib in treating patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and microvascular invasion.Methods:A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, web of science and Cochrane Library databases for articles published up to December 2019. Two researchers independently reviewed and cross-checked independent reports with sufficient information. A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the impact of sorafenib on mortality in patients with HCC and microvascular involvement.Results:Four studies were included in the qualitative and quantitative analyses, comprising 955 cancer events and 505 cancer deaths. Meta-analyses showed that sorafenib treatment was associated with an improved survival rate versus no sorafenib treatment in patients with HCC and microvascular invasion (relative risk 1.369, 95% confidence interval 1.193, 1.570).Conclusions:Sorafenib treatment may improve survival in patients with HCC and microvascular invasion. However, due to the potential for residual confounding, the results should be interpreted with caution.
