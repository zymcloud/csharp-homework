Agrochemicals are one the most significant sources of environmental pollution. Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity are the serious side effects of fungicide. In the current study, I have evaluated acute cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of triphenyltin (TPT) on human hepatic carcinoma (HepG2) cells and the ameliorating effect of ascorbic acid for 24 h. In this experiment, I have exposed HepG2 cells to ascorbic acids (50, 100, and 200 Î¼M) simultaneously and 24 h prior triphenyltin (TPT, 400 ng/ml) exposure for 24 h to determine the protective effect of ascorbic acid by using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and NRU (neutral red uptake) assays. Oxidative stress, such as intracellular reactive oxygen species and glutathione levels, was measured in HepG2 cells. The intracellular reactive oxygen species was evaluated using fluorescent probe DCFDA (6-carboxy-2',7' dichloro-dihydrofluorescein diacetate). Apoptosis and genotoxicity effects of TPT in HepG2 cells were determined using flow cytometry and comet assay. The result of these experiments showed that the TPT compound (400 ng/ml) induced cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and apoptosis, and DNA damage in HepG2 cells.Ascorbic acid reduced cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and genotoxicity induced by TPT. Thus, ascorbic acid is a potent antioxidant, and it showed a significant protective effect against toxicity induced by TPT in HepG2 cells.
