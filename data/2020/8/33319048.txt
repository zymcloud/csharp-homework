Background and aim:Currently, there is no molecular-targeted agent that has demonstrated evidence of efficacy in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (u-HCC) who have developed resistance to treatment with lenvatinib (LEN). In this real-world study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect and safety of sorafenib (SOR) in patients with u-HCC after progression on treatment with LEN.Methods patients and results:A total of 13 patients with u-HCC (12 males and 1 female), who were treated with SOR after progression on LEN, were enrolled in this retrospective study. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated via contrast-enhanced computerized tomography at 8 weeks after the initiation of SOR therapy according to modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST) and RECIST. According to mRECIST, the objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 15.3% (2/13) and 69.2% (9/13), respectively. According to RECIST, the ORR and DCR were 0% (0/13) and 69.2% (9/13), respectively. The median progression-free survival was 4.1 months. The median albumin-bilirubin scores did not deteriorate significantly at 4, 6, and 8 weeks after initiation of SOR, compared with the scores at the baseline. The most frequent grade 1 or 2 adverse events (AEs) were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, fatigue, diarrhea, and hypertension. There was no incidence of grade 3 AEs.Conclusion:Treatment with SOR may be effective for u-HCC after failure on LEN and may not worsen the liver reserve.
