Although mass spectrometry-based plasma proteomics enables sensitive and large-scale discovery and validation of biomarkers for various diseases, its integrative application to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is not well investigated. Therefore, we analyzed albumin- and immunoglobulin G-depleted plasma samples from 148 and 60 patients with HCC and CCA, respectively, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The algorithm used to measure the content of each protein was the percentage of exponentially modified protein abundance index. From 5320 proteins assayed in plasma, 53 and 25 biomarker candidates were identified for HCC and CCA, respectively. The abundance of six and two HCC markers particularly protruded in stage II and III, respectively, whereas plasma serine protease inhibitor was the sole marker the level of which steadily decreased with CCA progression. From a prognostic facet, we showed candidate markers and their cutoff levels for evaluating probability of tumor recurrence and patient survival period. Combination Kaplan-Meier models showed that HCC stage III or IV and both the content of alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein and apolipoprotein CIII
