Our study aimed to investigate the expression, functional significance, and related mechanism of long noncoding RNA CRNDE (colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis. The resulted revealed that CRNDE was significantly overexpressed in HCC tissues and cell lines, and was statistically correlated with poor clinical outcome. CRNDE knockdown markedly decreased HCC cell proliferation, migration, and chemoresistance. In addition, in vivo experiments confirmed the suppressive effect of CRNDE knockdown on HCC progression. Mechanically, CRNDE directly bound to EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog), SUZ12 (suppressor of zeste 12), SUV39H1, and mediated their inhibition of tumor suppressor genes, including CUGBP Elav-like family member 2 (CELF2) and large tumor suppressor 2 (LATS2). CELF2 exerted tumor suppressive effect in HCC and was involved in CRNDE-mediated oncogenic effect. In addition, the oncogenic effects of CRNDE on HCC proliferation, migration and tumorigenesis, as well as its inhibition of Hippo pathway were abolished by LATS2 overexpression. Together, our work demonstrated the importance of CRNDE in HCC progression and elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms. These findings provided new insights into HCC pathogenesis and chemoresistance mediated by CRNDE.
