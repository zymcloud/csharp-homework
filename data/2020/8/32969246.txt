Liver transplantation has been widely accepted as an effective intervention for end-stage liver diseases and early hepatocellular carcinomas. However, a variety of postoperative complications and adverse reactions have baffled medical staff and patients. Currently, transplantation monitoring relies primarily on nonspecific biochemical tests, whereas diagnosis of multiple complications depends on invasive pathological examination. Therefore, a noninvasive monitoring method with high selectivity and specificity is desperately needed. This review summarized the potential of endogenous small-molecule metabolites as biomarkers for assessing graft function, ischemia-reperfusion injury and liver rejection. Exogenous metabolites, mainly those immunosuppressive agents with high intra- and inter-individual variability, were also discussed for transplantation monitoring.
