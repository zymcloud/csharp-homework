Cancer testis (CT) antigens have received particular attention in cancer immunotherapy. OY-TES-1 is a member of CT antigens. This study was to evaluate OY-TES-1 expression and immunogenicity in hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC). OY-TES-1 mRNA expression was detected in 56 HCC tissues and 5 normal liver tissues by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Of the 56 cases of HCC tissues tested, 37 cases had tumor and matched adjacent non-cancer tissues and were subjected to both RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. OY-TES-1 protein was subsequently observed on a panel of tissue microarrays. Sera from patients were tested for OY-TES-1 antibody by ELISA. To identify OY-TES-1 capable of inducing cellular immune response, OY-TES-1 protein was used to sensitize dentritic cells and the cytotoxicity effect was measured in vitro. The results showed that OY-TES-1 mRNA was highly expressed in 41 of the 56 (73.21%) HCC tissues, whereas none in 5 normal liver tissues. OY-TES-1 mRNA was frequently expressed not only in HCC tissues (72.97%, 27/37), but also in paired adjacent non-cancer tissues (64.86%, 24/37). But the mean expression level of OY-TES-1 mRNA in HCC tissues was significantly higher than that in adjacent non-cancer tissues (0.76854 vs. 0.09834, P=0.021). Immunohistochemistry showed that OY-TES-1 protein expression was detected in 6 of the 49 cases of HCC tissues, and absent in 9 cases of normal liver and 6 cases of cirrhosis tissues. Seropositivity was detected in 10 of the 45 HCC patients, but not detected in 17 cirrhosis patients and 76 healthy donors. The specific cytotoxic T cells elicited by OY-TES-1 could kill HLA-A2+ HCC cell line which expressed OY-TES-1. The target lysis was mainly HLA class I -dependent and could be blocked by antibodies against monomorphic HLA class I but not HLA class II molecule. In summary, OY-TES-1 expression is up-regulated in HCC tissues and can be recognized by humoral and cellular responses, which suggests that OY-TES-1 is an attractive target for tumor immunotherapy in HCC.
