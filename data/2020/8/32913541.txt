Aims:Long noncoding RNA NRON has been investigated in various tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the role of lncRNA NRON in breast cancer remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the function and mechanism of lncRNA NRON in breast cancer.Materials and methods:Overexpression and knockdown vectors were constructed. Proliferation and invasion were measured to evaluate the function of lncRNA NRON. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was utilized to analyze the potential binding target of lncRNA NRON. A rescue experiment was performed to verify the relationship between lncRNA NRON and SRSF2.Results:Our results showed that the expression of lncRNA NRON was significantly downregulated in breast cancer tissues. Overexpression of lncRNA NRON significantly inhibited proliferation and invasion in breast cancer cell lines. Knockdown of lncRNA NRON promoted breast cancer development. We also provided evidence that lncRNA NRON negatively regulated miR-302b. Moreover, we identified SRSF2 as a downstream target of miR-302b.Conclusion:Overall, we performed a comprehensive analysis to indicate that the lncRNA NRON/miR-302b/SRSF2 axis plays an important role in breast cancer. Our study is the first to prove that lncRNA NRON functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer.
