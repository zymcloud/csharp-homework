Castleman's disease (CD) is a primary lymphoproliferative disorder of the lymph nodes with rare extra-nodal primary affection.Presentation of case:Here we present a case of primary hepatic CD associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Discussion:Sixty-two years old, male received direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for HCV infection. Follow up revealed sustained virologic response; however, three hepatic focal lesions were accidently discovered. Triphasic CT confirmed the HCC nature of two masses while the other mass remained undiagnosed. Surgical intervention was the treatment of choice, and pathological examination showed a fairly circumscribed mass formed of angiolymphoid hyperplasia displayed atrophic germinal center, expanded mantle zone, and variable hyalinization. The radiological evaluation of lymph nodes was unremarkable. The patient is 40 months alive after resection, with no further management advised.Conclusion:The immune-modulatory effect of DAAs may induce hepatic CD development in a cirrhotic patient, necessitating further studies. A new radiologic finding was observed in the present case in the form of vessels traversing through the lesion with no attenuation or occlusion. Pathology remains the gold standard in the diagnosis of CD.
