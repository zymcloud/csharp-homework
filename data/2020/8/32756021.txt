Purpose:To evaluate whether computed tomography (CT) radiomics feature analyses could aid in assessing the Ki-67 marker index in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The preoperative CT findings of 74 patients with HCC were analyzed retrospectively. The texture feature calculations were computed from MaZda 4.6 software, and the sequential forward selection algorithm was used as the selection method. The correlation between radiomics features and the Ki-67 marker index, as well as the difference between low Ki-67 (Results:Contrast, correlation, and inverse difference moment (IDM) were significantly different (P Conclusions:The radiomics characteristics of CT have potential as biomarkers for predicting Ki-67 status in patients with HCC. These findings suggest that the radiomics features of CT might be used as a noninvasive measure of cellular proliferation in HCC.
