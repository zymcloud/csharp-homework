Gene therapy is likely to be the most promising way to tackle cancer, while defects in molecular strategies and delivery systems have led to an impasse in clinical application. Here, it is found that onco-miRNAs of the miR-515 and -449 families were upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the sponge targeting miR-515 family had a significant probability to suppress cancer cell proliferation. Then, we constructed non-toxic sponge-loaded magnetic nanodroplets containing 20% C6F14 (SLMNDs-20%) that are incorporated with fluorinated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles enhancing external magnetism-assisted targeting and enabling a direct visualization of SLMNDs-20% distribution in vivo via magnetic resonance imaging monitoring. SLMNDs-20% could be vaporized by programmable focused ultrasound (FUS) activation, achieving âˆ¼45% in vitro sponge delivery efficiency and significantly enhancing in vivo sponge delivery without a clear apoptosis. Moreover, the sponge-1-carrying SLMNDs-20% could effectively suppress proliferation of xenograft HCC after FUS exposure because sponge-1-suppressing onco-miR-515 enhanced the expression of anti-oncogenes (P21, CD22, TIMP1, NFKB, and E-cadherin) in cancer cells. The current results indicated that ultrasonic cavitation-inducing sonoporation enhanced the intracellular delivery of sponge-1 using SLMNDs-20% after magnetic-assisted accumulation, which was a therapeutic approach to inhibit HCC progression.
