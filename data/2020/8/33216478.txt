Background:Though direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) therapy is associated with a high cure rate of hepatitis C virus infection, a potential risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) exists. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and predictors of morbidity and mortality related to DAAs therapy.Methods:This prospective study was conducted on a real word cohort of 1562 treatment naïve chronic hepatitis C (CHC) Egyptian patients, who received 12-weeks therapy with sofosbuvir (SOF) plus daclatasvir (DCV) ± ribavirin (RBV). The incidence and predictors of SAEs and mortality during treatment course and over the following 12 weeks were recorded.Results:The mean age of study participants was 51.38 ± 9.70 years (55.22%, males). Liver cirrhosis was defined in 72.4% of participants. SAEs were recorded in 120 participants (7.68%), including hepatic decompensation, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia and hepatocellular carcinoma. Nine patients (0.58%) died and 69 patients (4.42%) discontinued therapy due to SAEs. Severity of cirrhosis was the significant predictor of morbidities and mortality. Hepatic decompensation was predicted by baseline serum albumin [cutoff value: 3.00 g/dL, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC): 0.953] and serum bilirubin (cutoff value: 1.75 mg/dL, AUROC: 0.940).Conclusion:The risk of morbidity and mortality related to SOF/DCV ± RBV therapy in CHC patients is small and is significantly linked to advanced cirrhosis.
