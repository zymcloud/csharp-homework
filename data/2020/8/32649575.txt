Background:Studies assessing the impact of selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) on the regional liver function in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are sparse. This study assessed the changes in total and regional liver function using hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS) and investigated the utility of HBS to predict post-SIRT liver dysfunction.Methods:Patients treated with SIRT for HCC between 2011 and 2019, underwent Tc-mebrofenin HBS with single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) before and 6 weeks after SIRT. The corrected mebrofenin uptake rate (cMUR) and corresponding volume was measured in the total liver, and in treated and nontreated liver regions. Patients with and without post-SIRT liver dysfunction were compared.Results:A total of 29 patients, all Child-Pugh-A and mostly intermediate (72%) stage HCC were included in this study. Due to SIRT, the cMURtotal declined from 5.8 to 4.5%/min/m (P Conclusion:In patients treated with SIRT for HCC, HBS accurately identified changes in total and regional liver function and may have a complementary role to personalize lobar or selective SIRT. In this pilot study, there were no pre-SIRT differences in cMUR or volume to aid in predicting post-SIRT liver dysfunction.
