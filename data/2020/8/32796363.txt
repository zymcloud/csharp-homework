Background:One of the most widespread cancer-associated death worldwide is Hepatocellular carcinoma. Concerning hepatic malignant tumor staging system known as Barcelona clinic of liver cancer, a superior curative response could be carried out by combined techniques [radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)] for stage B comparing with TACE alone as palliative monotherapy.Objectives:To discuss the merging effect of RFA followed by TACE and vice versa on objective response, overall survival, local recurrence and tumor-free survival.Patients and methods:Sixty-eight cases included with hepatic tumor on top of chronic liver disease post-viral infection and divided into two groups according to different combined treatment modality; first cohort included 34 patients treated with TACE followed by RFA, while the second one included 34 patients treated with RFA followed by TACE for two lesions or single medium-sized lesion stage.Results:Complete response and objective response rates were 91% and 82% after TACE/RFA and 100% and 91% after RFA/TACE, respectively. Regarding Milan criteria, there was significant downstaging after RFA/TACE (P 0.05). Kaplan-Meier curve as regards disease-free survival rate, median time were 17.1 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.2-22.0] in TACE/RFA and 23.2 (95% CI 18.1-28.2) months in RFA/TACE (P > 0.05).Conclusion:RFA/TACE showed effective complete response, downstaging, disease-free survival and overall survival for the treatment of hepatic malignant tumors.
