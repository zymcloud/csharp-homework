This current study explored the effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on deoxyribonucleic acid methylation in human bronchial epithelial cells. Human bronchial epithelial cells were exposed to PM2.5 for 24 h after which, deoxyribonucleic acid samples were extracted, and the differences between methylation sites were detected using methylation chips. Subsequent gene ontology functional enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed for the differential methylation sites. Functional epigenetic modules analysis of the overall differential methylation site interactions was also conducted. A total of 127 differential methylation sites in 89 genes were screened in the PM2.5 10 μg/ml group, of which 55 sites demonstrated increased methylation, with methylation levels decreasing in a further 72 sites. Following an exposure of 50 μg/ml PM2.5, a total of 238 differentially methylated sites were screened in 168 genes, of which methylation levels increased in 127 sites, and decreased in 111. KEGG analysis showed that the top 10 enrichment pathways predominantly involve hepatocellular carcinoma pathways and endometrial cancer pathways, whereas functional epigenetic modules analysis screened eight genes (A2M, IL23A, TPIP6, IL27, MYD88, ILE2B, NLRC4, TNF) with the most interactions. Our results indicate that exposure to PM2.5 for 24 h in human bronchial epithelial cells induces marked changes in deoxyribonucleic acid methylation of multiple genes involved in apoptosis and carcinogenesis pathways, these findings can provide a new direction for further study of PM2.5 carcinogenic biomarkers.
