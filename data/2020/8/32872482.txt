This review aims to highlight the recent findings of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in liver disease. In particular, we focus on the functions of lncRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We summarize the current research trend in lncRNAs and their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of HCC and NASH.
