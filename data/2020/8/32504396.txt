In South Africa (SA), hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is strongly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). As HBV genotypes/subgenotypes and mutations can influence disease manifestation and progression, our aim was to molecularly characterize HBV in Black cancer patients, with and without HCC. The basal core promoter/precore (BCP/PC) and complete surface (S) regions of HBV isolates were amplified and sequenced from 55 HCC cases and 22 non-HCC cancer controls. Phylogenetic analysis of 43 polymerase/complete S region amplicons showed that the majority (88.4%) clustered with subgenotype A1, 4.7% with A2, and 7% with A3. The following mutations were significantly more frequent in HCC cases than in controls (p 10,000 IU/mL and were significantly younger than non-HCC controls (34 ± 7.1 vs. 41.2 ± 9.5 years, p = 0.05). The 1762T/1764A double mutation was detected in the majority (90.9%) of the isolates from HCC cases with preS deletions. Black HBV carriers were mainly infected with subgenotype A1, with HCC cases carrying BCP/PC and preS mutant strains that are associated with hepatocarcinogenesis. This is the first study to compare the molecular characteristics of HBV from HCC and non-HCC cancer patients in SA.
