Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common cause of chronic liver disease, ranges from simple hepatic steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is a more aggressive form characterized by hepatocyte injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. Increasing evidence suggests that NASH is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the second most common cause of cancer-related death. Recent studies support a strong mechanistic link between the NASH microenvironment and HCC development. The liver has a large capacity to remove circulating pathogens and gut-derived microbial compounds. Thus, the liver is a central player in immunoregulation. Altered immune responses are tightly associated with the development of NASH and HCC. The objective of this study was to differentiate the roles of specific immune cell subsets in NASH and HCC pathogenesis.
