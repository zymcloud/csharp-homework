Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been reported to regulate the gene expression through sponging corresponding microRNAs in multiple malignant tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Up to now, the effects of circ_0001178 in HCC are barely known. In our current work, we tested circ_0001178 expression in HCC tissues and HCC cells and found it was greatly elevated. Then, we evaluated the function of circ_0001178 on HCC cell proliferation. We found HepG2 and Huh-7 cell proliferation was repressed after circ_0001178 shRNA was infected into the cells. Moreover, flow cytometry evidenced that HepG2 and Huh-7 cell apoptosis was markedly triggered and cell cycle was arrested. Meanwhile, it was shown that HCC cell migration and invasion capacity were markedly inhibited by loss of circ_0001178. Knockdown of circ_0001178 restrained HCC tumor growth in vivo. Then, miR-382 was predicted and confirmed as the target of circ_0001178. Circ_0001178 was demonstrated to modulate miR-382 expression negatively. The effect of circ_0001178 on HCC tumor was rescued by miR-382 overexpression. Furthermore, vascular epithelial growth factor A (VEGFA) is identified in various cancers. Currently, VEGFA was proved to be the downstream target of miR-382. To conclude, this research revealed that circ_0001178 induced HCC progression via modulating miR-382 and VEGFA axis.
