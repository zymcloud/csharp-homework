Objective:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of different nucleos(t)ide analogues in the prognosis of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after curative treatment by network meta-analysis.Methods:Literature retrieval was conducted in globally recognized databases, namely, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library databases, and Science Citation Index Expanded, to address relative studies investigating nucleot(s)ide analogues for HBV-related HCC patients after curative resection. Relative parametric data, including 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rate and 1-, 3-, and 5-year recurrence-free survival rate were quantitatively pooled and estimated. The inconsistency factor, the cumulative ranking curve, and the publication bias were evaluated.Results:Fourteen observational studies of 2481 adults performed between 2000 and 2019 were eligible. In terms of overall survival, ADV (Adefovir dipivoxil) (Odds ratio (OR): 2.35, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17-4.73), Lamivudine (OR: 2.08, 95% CI: 1.78-5.58), and Entecavir (OR: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.59-2.88) were found to be more beneficial than control group while ADV has the highest probability of having the most efficacious treatment (SCURA values 66.3) for 5-year overall survival. In late recurrence-free survival, ADV (OR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.77-4.60), Entecavir (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.36-2.55), and Lamivudine (OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.06-2.82) all had better significant prognosis than patients without antiviral therapy postoperatively and patients with ADV as postoperative antiviral therapy has significantly recurrence-free survival benefit at 5-year follow-up compared to those undertaking Entecavir (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.52-7.38) and Lamivudine (OR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.09-3.01). Moreover, the application of ADV possessed the highest possibility of having the best clinical effects on 1- (surface under the cumulative ranking probabilities (SUCRA), 64.7), 3- (SUCRA, 64.7), and 5-year (SUCRA, 70.4) recurrence survival rate for HBV-related HCC patients.Conclusions:Patients with postoperative nucleos(t)ide analogues antiviral therapy had better survival benefit than those without antiviral therapy for HBV-related HCC patients after curative treatment. Additionally, nucleotide analogues like ADV and Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has better impact on early and late recurrence-free survival of patients after curative treatment than those undertaking nucleoside analogues.
