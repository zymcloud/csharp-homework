We aimed to evaluate the biliary complications and efficacy of proton beam therapy (PBT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We retrospectively analyzed 167 patients who received PBT with ≥ 75 GyRBE of biological effective dose with ?/β = 10 for primary HCC. The perihilar region was defined as a 1-cm area extending from the right, left, and common hepatic ducts, including the gallbladder and cystic duct. PBT-related biliary complications were defined as follows: significant elevation in bilirubin level to > 3.0 mg/dL; elevation to more than twice of the baseline level after the completion of PBT; or newly developed radiological biliary abnormalities, which were not caused by HCC progression, comorbidities, or other treatments. Eighty (47.9%) had perihilar HCC. PBT-related events occurred in seven (4.2%), three of whom had perihilar HCC. Radiologic biliary abnormalities developed in 12 patients (7.2%); however, no events were PBT-related. All patients who experienced PBT-related biliary complications had underlying liver cirrhosis. The albumin-bilirubin grade was identified as an independent factor associated with PBT-related biliary complications. PBT at the current dose showed a low rate of PBT-related biliary complications even for patients with perihilar HCC. PBT for HCC patients with risk factors requires attention to reduce PBT-related biliary complications.
