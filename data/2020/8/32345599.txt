miR-106a is aberrantly regulated in various tumors and plays an important role in carcinogenesis. However, the biological role and molecular mechanism by which miR-106a contributes to cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) remains elusive. In this study, we verified that miR-106a was elevated in both human papilloma virus (HPV) 16-positive CSCC tissues and cell lines. ROC curve analysis showed that miR-106a could well distinguish HPV-16-positive CSCC tissues from normal cervical squamous epithelium tissues. High expression of miR-106a was associated with malignant clinicopathologic parameters in CSCC tissues. Exogenous expression of miR-106a greatly promoted cervical cancer cell proliferation while attenuated autophagy. Furthermore, a novel target of miR-106a, liver kinase B1 (LKB1), a proven tumor suppressor in cervical cancer was verified. Here we confirmed LKB1 was negatively correlated with malignant clinicopathologic parameters in CSCC tissues. Overexpression of LKB1 neutralized the effect of miR-106a on proliferation and autophagy in cervical cancer cell lines. In addition, the role of miR-106a in cell proliferation and autophagy was via LKB1 and its downstream pathway AMP-activated protein kinase-mammalian target of rapamycin. Of note, miR-106a was upregulated by HPV-16 E7 protein. The function of HPV-16 E7 to cell proliferation was suppressed when knockdown miR-106a in HPV-16 E7-expressing cells. IMPLICATIONS: Our study highlights the tumorigenic role and regulatory mechanism of miR-106a in CSCC. miR-106a may be a potential therapeutic target in HPV-associated cervical cancer.
