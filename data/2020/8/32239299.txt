The growing role of precision medicine in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is expected to ameliorate the poor prognosis and high mortality of this highly malignant disease; however, it is faced with challenges such as the low frequency of tissue biopsy. Hence, attention is turning to the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), an important component of liquid biopsy. Obtaining molecular information about cancer from blood provides a good prospect in precision oncology including molecular diagnosis, molecular classification, targeted therapy, personalized decision making, and detection of drug-resistance mutations. However, inherent constraints of HCC and ctDNA (like background chronic liver diseases (CLD) and low concentration of ctDNA) along with some technical issues should be well handled and solved before the potential of ctDNA in precision medicine of HCC can be truly realized. In this review, we will focus on the prospects and challenges of ctDNA in HCC precision medicine.
