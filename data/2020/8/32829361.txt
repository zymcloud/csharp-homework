A 50-year-old female who had a liver tumor was referred to our hospital for further examination. Abdominal CT and MRI revealed a 2 cm tumor in liver segment 2 that was suspected to be HCC. On the basis of the CT and MRI findings, the patient underwent needle biopsy. The pathological findings suggested the possibility of perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa). Accordingly, we performed laparoscopic liver segmentectomy. As a hepatic PEComa is relatively rare, the current case serves as an important reminder to consider PEComa in the differential diagnosis of liver tumors.
