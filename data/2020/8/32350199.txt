The development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after a sustained virologic response (SVR) due to interferon (IFN) therapy for hepatitis C virus infection remains a serious problem. We herein report 2 cases of HCC that developed more than 20 years after SVR with IFN therapy for chronic hepatitis C. The patients were 89- and 72-year-old men with HCC that developed 24-25 years after an SVR with IFN therapy. These patients regularly underwent imaging examinations; therefore, the HCC was detected in the early stage, when it was still curable. Both cases suggest that long-term surveillance after an SVR is effective for the detection of HCC, and radical treatment is possible.
