Introduction:nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) comprises a broad spectrum of diseases, which can progress from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease in developed countries, affecting approximately 25% of the general population. Insulin resistance, adipose tissue dysfunction, mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress, chronic inflammation, genetic and epigenetic factors are NAFLD triggers that control the disease susceptibility and progression.Areas covered:In recent years a large number of investigations have been carried out to elucidate genetic and epigenetic factors in the disease pathogenesis, as well as the search for diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. This paper objective is to report the most studied genetic and epigenetic variants around NAFLD.Expert opinion:NAFLD lead to various comorbidities, which have a considerable impact on the patient wellness and life quality, as well as on the costs they generate for the country's health services. It is essential to continue with molecular research, since it could be used as a clinical tool for prognosis and disease severity. Specifically, in the field of hepatology, plasma miRNAs could provide a novel tool in liver diseases diagnosis and monitoring, representing an alternative to invasive diagnostic procedures.
