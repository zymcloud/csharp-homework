Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. DNA methylation alterations are frequently observed in malignant tumours and play critical roles in the development of cancers, including HCC. To provide novel clinical prognosis biomarkers for HCC patients, we first performed a comprehensive analysis and identified a collection of prognosis-associated genes with DNA methylation-driven expression dysregulation in HCCs. Then, we optimally established a 10-gene prognostic risk score model using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis. Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that the high-risk score is significantly associated with poor prognosis after being adjusted by clinical parameters, indicating its potential prognostic value. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis showed that this 10-gene prognostic risk score model outperformed several other publicly available models in predicting both short- and long-term prognosis. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the high-risk score is relevantly associated with pathways involved in cell cycle and DNA damage repair. The above results indicate that we have constructed a 10-DNA-methylation-driven-gene prognostic risk score model, which might serve as a potential prognostic biomarker for HCC patients and guide treatment decisions for patients at high risk of tumour progression.
