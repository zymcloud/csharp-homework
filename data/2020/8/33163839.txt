Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a strong racial and ethnic association, with Hispanic patients having a higher incidence and mortality. However, there are limited data regarding clinical features and outcomes. This study includes Hispanic and non-Hispanic White patients with HCC diagnosed between January 2000 and June 2014 from five United States academic medical centers. The chi-square test for categorical variables and analysis of variance for continuous variables were used for statistical analysis, with two-tailed P < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Of 5,327 patients, 4,217 met inclusion criteria, of whom 12.3% were Hispanic patients. Compared to their non-Hispanic White counterparts, Hispanic patients were older at age of diagnosis (mean ± SD, 64.2 ± 10.9 vs. 61.9 ± 10.5 years; P < 0.0001), with higher body mass index (29.6 ± 6.5 vs. 28.8 ± 5.9 kg/m2; P = 0.01), and were more likely to have diabetes and hypertension. Hispanic patients had significantly more nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol-related liver disease (both P < 0.0001). Hispanic patients presented with larger tumors, more advanced stage disease, and increased rates of macrovascular invasion and extrahepatic spread. HCCs in Hispanic patients were less likely to be within Milan criteria (26% vs. 38%; P < 0.0001) and were less likely to be treated with resection (9% vs. 13%; P = 0.03) or transplantation (8% vs. 19%; P < 0.0001). Hispanic patients had a median overall survival of 1.4 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-1.56), which was similar to that of non-Hispanic White patients (1.3 years; 95% CI, 1.26-1.41; P = 0.07). Conclusion: Hispanic patients with HCC were more likely to have metabolic risk factors for chronic liver disease, including obesity. Despite diagnosis at more advanced stages with less curative intervention than non-Hispanic White patients, median overall survival was similar between groups.
