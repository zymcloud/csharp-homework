Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Despite progress in the prevention and therapy of HCC, high incidence and recurrence rates of HCC remain big threats, resulting in poor patient survival. Effective biomarkers and targets of HCC are therefore urgently needed for better management and to improve patient outcomes. Pre-S mutants have been well demonstrated as HBV oncoproteins that play important roles in HCC development through activation of multiple oncogenic signal pathways in hepatocytes, in vitro and in vivo. The presence of pre-S mutants in patients with chronic HBV infection and HBV-related HCC has been associated with a significantly higher risk of HCC development and recurrence after curative surgical resection, respectively. In this review, we summarize the roles of pre-S mutants as biomarkers for predicting HBV-related HCC development and recurrence, and highlight the pre-S mutants-activated oncogenic signal pathways as potential targets for preventing HBV-related HCC development.
