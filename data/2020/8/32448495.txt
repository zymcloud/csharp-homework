Background:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is regarded as a feature of metabolic syndrome in the liver. Metabolic syndrome is associated with a higher risk of bladder cancer. However, the association between NAFLD and bladder cancer is unclear. We aimed to investigate the association between NAFLD and bladder cancer.Materials and methods:The records of all patients (n = 251) diagnosed with the bladder cancer in our hospital between 2009 and 2013 were reviewed. We also randomly collected the records of adults without cancer (n = 266) as the control group. Clinical characteristics, biochemical tests for liver and metabolic function and abdominal computed tomography were assessed.Results:The incidence of NAFLD was 12.0% in the bladder cancer group and 4.9% in the control group. By multiple logistic regression analysis, NAFLD (P = 0.007; odds ratio [OR]: 2.61; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.30-5.22), male sex (P < 0.001; OR: 2.34; 95% CI: 1.61-3.41) and use of lipid lowering drugs (P = 0.001; OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.26-0.72) showed significant associations with bladder cancer. In bladder cancer patients, the median survival time was significantly longer in patients without NAFLD than in these with NAFLD (40 months versus 21.5 months, P = 0.022).Conclusions:NAFLD was positively associated with bladder cancer and was a poor prognostic factor of bladder cancer. Further studies are needed to confirm whether NAFLD is a factor for the development of bladder cancer.
