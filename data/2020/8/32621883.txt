Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the single most common indication for liver transplantation. HCV vaccines eliciting specific T-cell responses, have been considered as potent method to prevent HCV infection. Despite several reports on progress of vaccine, these vaccine failed in mediating clinical relevance activity against HCV in humans. In this study we integrated both immunoinformatic and molecular docking approach to present a multiepitope vaccine against HCV by designating 17 conserved epitopes from eight viral proteins such as Core protein, E1, E2, NS2, NS34A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. The epitopes were prioritized based on conservation among epitopes of T cell, B cell and IFN-γ that were then scanned for non-homologous to host and antigenicity. The prioritized epitopes were then linked together by AAY linker and adjuvant (β-defensin) were attached at N-terminal to enhance immunogenic potential. The construct thus formed were subjected to structural modeling and physiochemical characteristics. The modeled structure were successfully docked to antigenic receptor TLR-3 and In-silico cloning confers the authenticity of its expression efficiency. However, the proposed construct need to be validate experimentally to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile.
