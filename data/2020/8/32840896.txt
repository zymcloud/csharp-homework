Objectives:Quantitative image analysis is one of the methods to overcome the lack of objectivity of ultrasound (US). The aim of this study was to clarify the correlation between the features from a US image analysis and the histologic grade and microvascular invasion (MVI) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and differentiation of HCC smaller than 2 cm from borderline lesions.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed grayscale US images with histopathologic evidence of HCC or a precancerous lesion using ImageJ version 1.47 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).Results:A total of 148 nodules were included (borderline lesion, n = 31; early HCC [eHCC], n = 3; well-differentiated HCC [wHCC], n = 16; moderately differentiated HCC [mHCC], n = 79; and poorly differentiated HCC [pHCC], n = 19). A multivariate analysis selected lower minimum gray values (odds ratio [OR], 0.431; P = .003) and a higher standard deviation (OR, 1.880; P = .019) as predictors of HCC smaller than 2 cm. Median (range) minimum gray values of borderline lesions, eHCC, wHCC, mHCC, and pHCC were 29 (0-103), 7 (0-47), 6 (0-60), 10 (0-53), and 2 (0-38), respectively, and gradually decreased from borderline lesions to pHCC (P Conclusions:In a US image analysis, HCC smaller than 2 cm had features of greater heterogeneity and a lower minimum gray value than borderline lesions. Moderately differentiated HCC was smoother than borderline lesions, and the anechoic area correlated with histologic grading. Microvascular invasion was correlated with a slender shape and a lower minimum gray value.
