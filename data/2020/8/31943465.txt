Background:Microvascular invasion (MVI) is implicated in the poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Presurgical stratifying schemes have been proposed for HCC-MVI but lack external validation.Purpose:To perform external validation and comparison of four presurgical stratifying schemes for the prediction of MVI using gadoxetic acid-based MRI in a cohort of HCC patients.Study type:Retrospective.Subjects:Included were 183 surgically resected HCCs from patients who underwent pretreatment MRI.Field strength/sequence:This includes 1.5-3.0 T with T2 , T1 , diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and dynamic gadoxetic acid contrast-enhancement imaging sequences.Assessment:A two-trait predictor of venous invasion (TTPVI), Lei model, Lee model, and Xu model were compared. We relied on preoperative characteristics and imaging findings via four independent radiologists who were blinded to histologic results, as required by the tested tools.Statistical test:Tests of accuracy between predicted and observed HCC-MVI rates using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision curve analysis. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cronbach's alpha statistics were used to evaluate reproducibility.Results:HCC-MVI was identified in 52 patients (28.4%). The average ROC curves (AUCs) for HCC-MVI predictions were 0.709-0.880, 0.714-0.828, and 0.588-0.750 for the Xu model, Lei model, and Lee model, respectively. The rates of accuracy were 60.7-81.4%, 69.9-75.9%, and 65.6-73.8%, respectively. Decision curve analyses indicated a higher benefit for the Xu and Lei models compared to the Lee model. The ICC and Cronbach's alpha index were highest in the Lei model (0.896/0.943), followed by the Xu model (0.882/0.804), and the Lee model (0.769/0.715). The TTPVI resulted in a Cronbach's alpha index of 0.606 with a sensitivity of 34.6-61.5% and a specificity of 76.3-91.6%.Data conclusion:Stratifying schemes relying on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI provide an additional insight into the presence of preoperative MVI. The Xu model outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy when performed by an experienced radiologist. Conversely, the Lei model outperformed the other models in terms of reproducibility.Level of evidence:3 TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE: 2 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2020;52:433-447.
