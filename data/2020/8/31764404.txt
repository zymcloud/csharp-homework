Background:Metformin is associated with improved survival among hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with diabetes mellitus. However, the role of metformin in the survival of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients with diabetes mellitus after radical resection is unclear, so this study aimed to assess the effects of metformin on the clinical outcomes of patients who received radical resection for HCC.Patients and methods:A total of 250 HCC patients (30-78 years old) diagnosed with diabetes mellitus were selected between 2000 and 2013 from the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University and the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital in China. Patients were divided into the metformin group (n = 66) and the nonmetformin group (n = 184). A propensity score matching analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of metformin in patients receiving radical resection for HCC.Results:In the propensity score-matched cohort (n = 176), the overall survival (OS) in the metformin group at 1, 3, and 5 years was significantly higher than in the nonmetformin group (P = 0.002), and a similar treatment effect was observed for disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.030). The adjusted Cox proportional hazards model showed that metformin usage significantly improved OS [hazard ratio: 0.558, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.385-0.810].Conclusions:Metformin is associated with satisfactory clinical outcomes among HBV-related HCC patients with diabetes mellitus after radical resection. The use of metformin could significantly improve the OS and reduce the risk of HCC recurrence in patients after radical resection. A prospective controlled study is recommended to verify the metformin effect and explore its possible mechanisms.
