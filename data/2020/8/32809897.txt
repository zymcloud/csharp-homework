Background:Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is considered to be a risk factor for cancer; however, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. This study aimed to explore the impacts of the IL-12 rs3212227 and rs568408 gene polymorphisms on HCC.Methods:We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Chinese Knowledge Infrastructure databases for studies on the associations between HCC and IL-12 rs568408 and rs3212227 polymorphisms published prior to 1 May 2020. The effects of the polymorphisms on HCC susceptibility were presented as odds ratios (ORs) and associated 95% confidence intervals.Results:Seven studies were ultimately included, including 2375 cases and 3445 controls. The rs3212227 polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of HCC in both the dominant model (CC+AC vs. AA, OR=1.22) and the allele model (C vs. A, OR=1.12). Combined analysis of rs568408 yielded a significant relative risk for HCC in the dominant (AA+AG vs. GG, OR=1.13), recessive (AA vs. AG+GG, OR=1.72), allele (A vs. G, OR=1.29), heterozygote (AG vs. GG, OR=1.27), and homozygote models (AA vs. GG, OR 1.17).Conclusion:The IL-12 rs3212227 and rs568408 gene polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk of HCC.
