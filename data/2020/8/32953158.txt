Background:There is still no general consensus on the optimal chemotherapeutic agent selection for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of TACE with raltitrexed plus liposomal doxorubicin (R + PGLD) vs. tegafur plus pirarubicin (T + P) in patients with unresectable HCC.Methods:A total of 148 patients with unresectable HCC treated with TACE between January 2012 and December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Of them, 74 patients were in the R + PGLD group and 74 patients were in the T + P group (1:1). The treatment response of the tumor, overall survival (OS) time, and adverse effects were compared between the two groups.Results:There were no significant differences in patient characteristics or embolization effect (lipiodol deposition) between the two groups (P>0.05). R + PGLD treatment had a better clinical efficacy than T + P treatment (OR: 64.9% vs. 45.9%, P=0.031; DC: 89.2% vs. 74.3%, P=0.032). Portal vein invasion, hepatic vein invasion, tumor size and BCLC stage were associated with OR or DC after TACE using R + PGLD treatment. Survival analysis revealed that patients who received TACE with R + PGLD had a better prognosis than those treated with T + P. Moreover, some complications in the R + PGLD group, including vomiting, myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity, were significantly lower than those in the T + P group (P<0.05).Conclusions:TACE with raltitrexed and liposomal doxorubicin could reduce the incidence of adverse reactions and significantly improve the OS of patients with unresectable HCC.
