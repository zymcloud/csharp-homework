As a member of the reactive nitrogen species (RNS) family, peroxynitrite (ONOO-) as an oxidant and nitrating mediator plays a significant role in some physiopathologic processes. The excessive production of peroxynitrite anion in a drug-damaged liver is a culprit of hepatotoxicity. The detection of peroxynitrite is of vital importance for the treatment of some diseases including cancer and liver injury. In this study, a novel turn-on fluorescent probe IC-ONOO with new chalcone fluorophore was designed and synthesized for the detection of in vitro and in vivo. The probe responded rapidly towards ONOO- (only within 15 min did the fluorescent intensity maximize), and was endowed with high sensitivity and excellent selectivity. Given the fact that the linear correlation between the fluorescent intensity at 560 nm and the concentrations of the probe ranged from 0 to 9 μM, the limit of detection (LOD) was calculated to be 3.1 × 10-8 M. With all the merits, probe IC-ONOO was qualified as a robust tool to monitor peroxynitrite anion under physiopathologic condition. Moreover, it was successfully applied in the imaging of endogenous peroxynitrite in living MCF-7 cells (Human breast carcinoma cells) and mouse drug-damaged liver tissue with low cytotoxicity. Given all the extraordinary merits, great potential has been seen in its application to other peroxynitrite related diseases.
