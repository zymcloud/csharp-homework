Piperlongumine (PL), a herbal drug extracted from long pepper (Piper longum L), is known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. Although, its anti-cancer potential has been evaluated in cancer models like breast, pancreatic, gastric, hepatocellular and lung carcinoma, there is no report on its bio-activity evaluation in intestinal cancers. Here, we report the anti-neoplastic potential of PL against human intestinal carcinoma in-vitro and its possible mechanisms of action. Cytotoxicity studies demonstrate that PL inhibits cell proliferation of INT-407 and HCT-116 cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Also, PL elevated the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species, which may lead to lethal oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and nuclear fragmentation. Remarkably, P53, P21, BAX, and SMAD4 were significantly upregulated after PL treatment whereas; BCL2 and SURVIVIN were down-regulated. Moreover, the combination study also shows the synergistic effect of PL with the current chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel. These findings suggest that PL possesses anti-neoplastic properties in intestinal cancer cells.
