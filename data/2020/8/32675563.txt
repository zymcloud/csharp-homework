Background:Previous studies have suggested that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has an aggressive presentation and a shorter survival in people with HIV (PWH). This could be due to later diagnosis or lower rates of HCC treatment, and not to HIV infection itself. AIM: :: To assess the impact of HIV on HCC survival in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients.Methods:Multicenter cohort study (1999-2018) of 342 and 135 HCC cases diagnosed in HIV/HCV-infected and HCV-monoinfected patients. Survival after HCC diagnosis and its predictors were assessed.Results:HCC was at Barcelona-Clinic Liver-Cancer (BCLC) stage 0/A in 114 (33%) HIV/HCV-coinfected and in 76 (56%) HCV-monoinfected individuals (P Conclusion:HIV coinfection has no impact on the survival after the diagnosis of HCC in HCV-infected patients. Although overall mortality is higher in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, this seem to be related with lower rates of early diagnosis HCC in HIV-infected patients and not with HIV infection itself or a lower access to HCC therapy.
