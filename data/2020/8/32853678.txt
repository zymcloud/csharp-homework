Excessive consumption of saturated fat leads to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is attenuated by supplementation of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is crucial in the development of NAFLD, but how high-saturated fat diet (HFD) causes ER stress and NAFLD remains unclear. Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) is involved in hepatic ER stress. We aimed to explore the roles of LOX-1 in HFD-induced ER stress. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed an HFD without or with supplementation of fish oil for 16 weeks. The effects of n-3 PUFAs on hepatic ER stress degrees and the expression levels of LOX-1 were examined. Then human L02 hepatoma cells were treated with palmitate or palmitate and DHA to determine the ER stress and LOX-1 expression levels in vitro. After that the expression of LOX-1 in L02 cells was either knocked-down or overexpressed to analyze the roles of LOX-1 in palmitate-induced ER stress. The feeding of HFD induced NAFLD development and ER stress in the liver, and LOX-1 expressing level, which were all reversed by fish oil supplementation. In vitro, DHA treatment reduced the expression of LOX-1, and palmitate-induced ER stress. SiRNA-mediated knock-down of LOX-1 inhibited palmitate-induced ER stress, whereas overexpression of LOX-1 dramatically induced ER stress in L02 cells.LOX-1 is critical for HFD-induced ER stress, and inhibition of its expression under the treatment of n-3 PUFAs could ameliorate HFD-induced NAFLD.
