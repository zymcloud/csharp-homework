Based on accumulating evidence, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for many diseases, including tumors. In this study, we consulted The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to explore the functions and modulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Asian patients and constructed a risk scoring system composed of four lncRNAs (SNHG1, STEAP3-AS1, RUSC1-AS1, and SNHG3) to predict the outcomes of Asian patients with HCC. The prognostic value of this risk model was validated in the internal validation cohort (n = 157). The stratified survival analysis revealed good performance for the risk model in stratifying clinical features. According to the Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, the four-lncRNA risk model is an independent prognostic model for Asian patients with HCC. Finally, we developed a nomogram that integrates prognostic signals and other clinical information to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates. In conclusion, the prognostic lncRNAs identified in our study exerted potential biological effects on the development of HCC. The risk scoring model based on four lncRNAs may be an effective classification tool for assessing the prognosis of Asian patients with HCC.
