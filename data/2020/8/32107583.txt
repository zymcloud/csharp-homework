Purpose:To evaluate the rapeutic effectiveness of Angio-CT or cone-beam CT (CBCT)-guided immediate radiofrequency ablation (RFA) after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:117 large HCC patients (mean maximum diameter: 9.3 cm; range 5.3-17.7 cm) were retrospective studied and divided into Angio-CT group (n = 66 cases), CBCT group (n = 21 cases), and single TACE group (n = 30 cases) according to treatment (Angio-CT/CBCT-guided immediate RFA after TACE, single TACE, respectively). The operative time, effective radiation dose, local-regional tumor responses, overall survival (OS), and progressionâ€‘free survival (PFS) time and complications were recorded.Results:The operative time and effective radiation dose of Angio-CT group and CBCT group were higher than those of TACE group (P Conclusions:MIYABI Angio-CT or CBCT-guided immediate RFA after TACE for large HCC both have more effective than single TACE. The former is worth popularizing, due to its advantages of convenience, shorter operative time, and less radiation dose for doctors.
