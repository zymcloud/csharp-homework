Background:Apatinib, a selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR 2), has exhibited modest antitumor efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of apatinib versus sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC.Methods:All patients with advanced HCC who underwent sorafenib or apatinib between January 2016 to December 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Seventy-two patients received apatinib (26 patients, 500 mg, daily) or sorafenib (46 patients, 400 mg, twice daily) until disease progression or intolerable toxicities. Primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) per modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST), disease control rate (DCR), and safety.Results:The median follow-up was 13.2 (5.7-20.7) months. The 1-year OS for apatinib of 62.0% was comparable to that of sorafenib [64.2%, hazard ratio (HR), 1.15; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.369-3.58]. The median PFS was 4.1 months in the apatinib group (95% CI, 3.2 to 7.4 months) and 3.6 months in the sorafenib group (95% CI, 2.7 to 5.9 months; HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.586 to 1.800; P=0.925). The apatinib group exhibited higher ORR (19.2% vs. 2.2%, P=0.012) but similar DCR (57.7% vs. 50%, P=0.530) compared with the sorafenib group. The most common any-grade adverse events in the apatinib and sorafenib groups were hand and foot syndrome (53.8% vs. 50%), hypertension (50% vs. 19.6%), diarrhea (34.6% vs. 28.3%), and elevated transaminase (57.7% vs. 63%).Conclusions:Compared with sorafenib, apatinib yielded comparable PFS and OS, and even better ORR, in patients with advanced HCC.
