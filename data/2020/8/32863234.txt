The well-documented anticarcinogenic properties of natural polyphenolic proanthocyanidins (OPC) have been primarily attributed to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potency. Emerging evidence suggests that OPC may target canonical oncogenic pathways, including PI3K/AKT; however, the underlying mechanism and therapeutic potential remain elusive. Here we identify that proanthocyanidin B2 (OPC-B2) directly binds and inhibits AKT activity and downstream signalling, thereby suppressing tumour cell proliferation and metabolism in vitro and in a xenograft and diethyl-nitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse models. We further find that OPC-B2 binds to the catalytic and regulatory PH domains to lock the protein in a closed conformation, similar to the well-studied AKT allosteric inhibitor MK-2206. Molecular docking and dynamic simulation suggest that Lys297 and Arg86 are critical sites of OPC-B2 binding; mutation of Lys297 or Arg86 to alanine completely abolishes the antitumor effects of OPC-B2 but not MK-2206. Together, our study reveals that OPC-B2 is a novel allosteric AKT inhibitor with potent anti-tumour efficacy beyond its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
