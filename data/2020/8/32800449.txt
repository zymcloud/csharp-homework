Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after liver resection (LR) adversely affects prognosis but is difficult to predict. Aberrant expression of Polo-Like Kinase 4 (PLK-4) is implicated in several adult malignancies. We sought to evaluate the prognostic value of PLK-4 expression in HCC after curative-intent LR.Methods:Patients undergoing LR for HCC between July-2015 and November-2017 at our centre were retrospectively identified. PLK-4 expression was measured in tumour and adjacent non-tumour liver tissue using quantitative RT-PCR. Disease-free survival (DFS) was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models.Results:A total of 145 patients were identified. Patients were divided according to PLK-4 expression (high: n = 58, low: n = 87) by generating a receiver operating characteristic curve for recurrence with an area under the curve of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.6-0.8). Recurrence and death rates were similar between groups. In patients without mVI, low PLK-4 expression was associated with worse actuarial DFS (low 1-, 3-, 5-year 83%, 60%, 47% vs. high 91%, 81%, 81%; p = 0.02). In patients without mVI, high PLK-4 expression was an independent predictor of survival (HR 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1-1.0; p = 0.04).Conclusion:PLK-4 represents a biomarker for good prognosis in patients with HCC who do not have mVI. This could aid clinical decision making for adjuvant clinical trials.
