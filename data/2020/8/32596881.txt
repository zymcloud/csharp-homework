Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is the major cause of chronic liver disease and a global health concern. ALD pathogenesis is initiated with liver steatosis, and ALD can progress to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Salvianic acid A (SAA) is a phenolic acid component of Danshen, a Chinese herbal medicine with possible hepatoprotective properties. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of SAA on chronic alcoholic liver injury and its molecular mechanism. We found that SAA significantly inhibited alcohol-induced liver injury and ameliorated ethanol-induced hepatic inflammation. These protective effects of SAA were likely carried out through its suppression of the BRD4/HMGB1 signalling pathway, because SAA treatment largely diminished alcohol-induced BRD4 expression and HMGB1 nuclear translocation and release. Importantly, BRD4 knockdown prevented ethanol-induced HMGB1 release and inflammatory cytokine production in AML-12 cells. Similarly, alcohol-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines were blocked by HMGB1 siRNA. Collectively, our results reveal that activation of the BRD4/HMGB1 pathway is involved in ALD pathogenesis. Therefore, manipulation of the BRD4/HMGB1 pathway through strategies such as SAA treatment holds great therapeutic potential for chronic alcoholic liver disease therapy.
