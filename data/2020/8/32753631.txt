The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 on HCC and to explore the possible underlying mechanisms. The expression levels of KCNQ1OT1, miR-149 and S1PR1 were detected by qRT-PCR assay. A dual luciferase reporter assay was used to detect the interaction between KCNQ1OT1 and miR-149, as well as miR-149 and S1PR1. The interaction between KCNQ1OT1 and miR-149 was further investigated by RNA pull-down assay. Wound healing assays and Transwell assays were carried out to determine cell migration and invasion. A xenograft tumour assay was used to validate the role of KCNQ1OT1 in vivo. KCNQ1OT1 and S1PR1 were significantly increased, but miR-149 was decreased in HCC cells. Luciferase reporter assays and RNA pull-down assays revealed that KCNQ1OT1 directly targeted miR-149. In addition, miR-149 bound to the 3'-UTR of S1PR1. Knockdown of KCNQ1OT1 or overexpression of miR-149 inhibited the invasion and migration of HCC cells. However, suppression of miR-149 could abrogate the effect of KCNQ1OT1 knockdown on the invasion and migration abilities of HCC cells. In vivo assays showed that KCNQ1OT1 knockdown suppressed tumour growth. This work suggests that lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 might act as a potential therapeutic target in HCC.
