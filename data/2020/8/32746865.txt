Background:Collagens are the most abundant proteins in extra cellular matrix and important components of tumor microenvironment. Recent studies have showed that aberrant expression of collagens can influence tumor cell behaviors. However, their roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are poorly understood.Methods:In this study, we screened all 44 collagen members in HCC using whole transcriptome sequencing data from the public datasets, and collagen type IV alpha1 chain (COL4A1) was identified as most significantly differential expressed gene. Expression of COL4A1 was detected in HCC samples by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Finally, functions and potential mechanisms of COL4A1 were explored in HCC progression.Results:COL4A1 is the most significantly overexpressed collagen gene in HCC. Upregulation of COL4A1 facilitates the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells through FAK-Src signaling. Expression of COL4A1 is upregulated by RUNX1 in HCC. HCC cells with high COL4A1 expression are sensitive to the treatment with FAK or Src inhibitor.Conclusion:COL4A1 facilitates growth and metastasis in HCC via activation of FAK-Src signaling. High level of COL4A1 may be a potential biomarker for diagnosis and treatment with FAK or Src inhibitor for HCC.
