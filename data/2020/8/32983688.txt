Lymph node metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a challenging clinical scenario with a poor prognosis, especially in the setting of prior liver transplant. Long-term survival is achievable in select patients with isolated lymph node metastases who undergo surgical resection, but little data exist regarding non-surgical options. For intrahepatic HCC, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has emerged as a standard and effective nonsurgical treatment option. Here, we present three patients (two with prior liver transplant) with isolated lymph node metastases treated with curative intent using SBRT to doses of 30-45 Gy in three to five fractions. Two patients (with follow-up of 27 and 31 months) had a complete or near-complete response and remain cancer-free. One patient had intrahepatic HCC recurrence shortly after SBRT but stable disease in the treated lymph node metastasis at 20 months. Liver function remained excellent after radiation in all three patients, but one patient developed a grade 3 duodenal ulcer at 20 months that resolved with medical management. These cases illustrate the potential utility of SBRT as a non-invasive, definitive treatment option for patients with isolated lymph node metastases from HCC.
