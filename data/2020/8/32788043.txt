Introduction and objectives:Despite chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is still a global burden as the high morbidity and mortality, the recently approved direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) permit a very high rate of sustained virologic response (SVR) in these patients. The clinical improvement due to viral eradication is being documented, however it is not clear why a subset of patients does not benefit in terms of fibrosis regression or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Aim of the study was to assess the hepatic stiffness regression at SVR24 and detect factors impacting stiffness course.Patients and methods:Hepatic stiffness assessed by acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) and anthropometric- and biochemical parameters were retrospectively collected by 166 CHC patients treated with DAAs, form baseline and SVR24.Results:Viral eradication significantly improved overall hepatic stiffness and other related hepatitis hallmarks such as ALT, AST, γGT, platelets count, AST to Platelets ratio Index (APRI), total- and LDL cholesterol. The multiple regression analysis showed that patients with baseline glucose > 110mg/dl presented a stiffness regression significantly lower when compared to low glucose patients (Conclusions:Although viral eradication with DAAs entails overall benefits, glycaemic decompensation negatively affects fibrosis regression and probably facilitates HCC development.
