The HIV infection remains a serious public health concern in France and around the world. Cancers are frequent among people living with HIV (PLWH) and have become the leading cause of mortality among this population in France. Certain non-AIDS-defining cancers are much more common among PLWH, such as anal carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and lung cancer. The incidence of cancer among PLWH depending on various factors, virological control under combined antiretrovial therapies (cART), exposure prevention to oncogenic virus and toxics are of utmost importance, such as the implementation of specific screening programmes. Drug interactions between cART and oncologic treatments can lead to serious adverse effects or to a reduction in the therapeutic effects, therefore they require a close monitoring. The PLWH have been excluded from the oncologic clinical trials assessing the efficacy and toxicity profile of the immune checkpoints inhibitors (ICPi) because of an increased theoretical risk of inducing adverse events and a feared lack of efficacy in the immunocompromised population. However, the mostly retrospective clinical data reporting the use of ICPi among PLWH are somewhat reassuring with a safety and efficacy profile similar to what observed in HIV-negative patients. Regarding the "shock and kill" anti-HIV effects of ICPi, the preliminary clinical data available are still modest and relatively disappointing despite encouraging results obtained in vitro. HIV-associated cancers represent a particular care challenge due to the multiple comorbidities in the population and the high risk of drug interactions, thus the CANCERVIH national network is of particular interest within this context.
