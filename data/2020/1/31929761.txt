Prostate cancer (PCa) is the third leading malignancy engendering mortality among men globally. The present study aimed at determining the expression of hepatocellular carcinoma-related protein-1 (HCRP-1) in PCa, to explore its potential role in prostate tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. We evaluated HCRP-1 protein with immunohistochemistry (IHC) technology and found HCRP-1 expression was significantly low in PCa tissues (PCTs); In addition, the decreased HCRP-1 was significantly associated with TNM (tumor node metastasis) stage, advanced histology grade and gleason score. Transwell, tube formation, Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays were utilized to determine the role of down-regulating HCRP-1 in PCa cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis. Meanwhile, we found HCRP-1 depletion induced Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation, which could be reversed by Src inhibitor PP2 or FAK inhibitor. Furthermore, down-regulated HCRP-1 evidently induced lung metastasis of PCa cells in xenograft mode. Taken together, our study indicates HCRP-1 plays an important role in PCa metastasis. HCRP-1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for PCa.
