Metabolic reprogramming has been identified as a hallmark of cancer. Liver is an essential hub in the body for the metabolism of three major nutrients including glucose, lipids and amino acids. Hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) usually presents a variety of changes in characteristic metabolism, such as increased aerobic glycolysis, enhanced de novo lipid synthesis, glutamine depletion, and oxidative metabolism imbalance, which can provide energy and bio-macromolecular raw materials for rapidly growing and proliferating tumor cells. The process of tumor metabolic reprogramming is regulated by multiple factors, such as alterations in metabolic enzyme activity, abnormal gene expression, and signaling pathway disturbance. Advances in high-throughout metabolomics technology have provided a powerful platform for discovering the novel biomarkers and metabolic targets of HCC. Therefore, in-depth study of the metabolic characteristics and regulatory mechanisms of HCC is critical for the development of novel antimetabolites.
