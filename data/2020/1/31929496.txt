BACKGROUND Inflammation and activation of the coagulation cascades have a role in the pathogenesis of malignancy, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This retrospective study aimed to investigate the prognostic role of the combined fibrinogen and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (F-NLR) in patients with resectable HCC. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study included 292 patients with HCC who underwent surgical resection. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the cut-off value of preoperative fibrinogen (Fib) levels and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). The. Hyperfibrinogenemia was >3.35 g/L, and an increased NLR was â‰¥2.47. The F-NLR was calculated for all patients. Kaplan-Meier survival curves, univariate analysis, multivariate analysis, and subgroup analysis were used to identify independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of the F-NLR score and OS, according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage, was performed. RESULTS Increased F-NLR scores were significantly associated with the presence of tumor thrombus (P=0.001), larger tumor diameter (P
