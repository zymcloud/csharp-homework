Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing non-integrin-related protein (DC-SIGNR) is a transmembrane receptor primarily involved in pathogen recognition by the innate immune system, with particular importance for viral recognition. DC-SIGNR may also be associated with tumorigenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between DC-SIGNR expression, development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and clinicopathological features. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess DC-SIGNR protein expression in HCC and paired non-cancerous tissue samples. DC-SIGNR expression was lower in HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissue samples. The expression of DC-SIGNR was associated with small tumor size, low Edmondson grade and high patient long term survival rates. Bioinformatics analyses were performed on several datasets to assess the potential function of DC-SIGNR and related genes; the data revealed that DC-SIGNR mRNA expression was lower in HCC tissues compared with non-cancerous controls, and analyses of ten-year survival rates indicated patients with low DC-SIGNR expression exhibited shorter average survival times. In conclusion, decreased DC-SIGNR expression in HCC tissues may be a relevant predictive biomarker of clinical prognosis, in addition to being a viable therapeutic target for HCC treatment.
