Autophagy-related genes (ATGs) depress tumorigenesis. However, in tumor tissue, it promotes tumor progression. Here, we demonstrated that 63 ATGs were differentially expressed in normal tissues and tumor tissues of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and seven prognostic-related genes were chosen to establish prognostic risk signatures. It is not just an independent prognostic factor for HCC, but also closely related to the degree of malignancy of HCC. Further, the hallmarks of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling was significantly enriched in the high-risk group. Moreover, AKT-pS473 and mTOR-pS2448 expression was down-regulated and correlated with patient prognosis in high-risk group. Finally, we demonstrate that the prognosis signature of ATGs is closely related to immune cell infiltration and PD-L1 expression. In conclusion, ATGs are a crucial factor in the malignant progression of HCC and will be a new prognostic marker for diagnosis and treatment. ATGs prognostic signatures are potentially useful for predicting PD-L1 therapeutic effects.
