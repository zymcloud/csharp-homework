Background:Using natural polysaccharides from Traditional Chinese Medicine as nanodrug delivery systems have considerable potential for tumor diagnostics and therapeutics.Purpose:On the basis of targeted therapy and combining the advantages of natural polysaccharides (angelica polysaccharide, APS) and natural Chinese medicine (curcumin, Cur) to design functionalized nanoparticles to improve the therapeutic through cell membrane encapsulation and immunotherapy.Study design and methods:Cur-loaded, glycyrrhetic acid (GA)-APS-disulfide bond (DTA)-Cur nanomicelle (GACS-Cur), which were prepared by the dialysis method. GACS-Cur was encapsulated with the membranes from red blood cells (RBCm) termed GACS-Cur@RBCm, which were prepared by the principle of extrusion using a miniature extruder. The developed formulations were subjected to various in vitro and in vivo evaluation tests.Results:The resulting APS nanocarriers supported a favorable drug-loading capacity, biocompatibility, and enhanced synergistic anti-hepatoma effects both in vitro and in vivo. After administration in mice, in vivo imaging results showed that the GACS-Cur and RBCm-coated groups had an obvious stronger tumor tissue targeting ability than the control treatment groups. Additionally, the immunomodulatory effect increased IL-12, TNF-α and IFN-γ expression and CD8+ T cell infiltration (1.9-fold) than that of the saline group. Notably, in comparison with hyaluronic acid (HA) nanocarriers, APS nanocarriers possess higher anti-hepatoma efficiency and targeting capabilities and, thus, should be further studied for a wide range of anti-cancer applications.Conclusion:Our data demonstrated that APS nanocarriers encapsulated with erythrocyte membrane mighty be a promising clinical method in the development of efficacy, safety and targeting of liver cancer therapy.
