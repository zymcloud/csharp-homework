Gastric carcinoma (GC) is still one of the most common digestive system neoplasms and the primary reason for malignant cancer-associated death. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to play critical roles in GC progression. In this study, we demonstrated that lncRNA testis development-related gene 1 (TDRG1) is markedly upregulated in clinical GC tissues and GC cells. High level of lncRNA TDRG1 correlates with the metastasis and prognosis of patients with GC. Overexpression of lncRNA TDRG1 promotes GC growth and metastatic-related traits in vitro and in vivo, and silencing TDRG1 causes opposite results. We future find that TDRG1 is inversely associated with miR-873-5p and positively modulates the expression of hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF), a functional target gene of miR-873-5p. Finally, lncRNA TDRG1 regulates the progression of GC through regulating miR-873-5p/HDGF pathway. Taken together, our data uncover the crucial function of TDRG1-miR-873-5p-HDGF axis in human gastric cancer.
