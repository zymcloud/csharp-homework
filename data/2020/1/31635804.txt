Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are crucial regulators of tumorigenesis and progression in human cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role of most lncRNAs that are dysregulated in HCC remains to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the role of OSER1-AS1 in the progression of HCC. The results of database and qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that OSER1-AS1 was highly expressed in HCC tissues and the high expression of OSER1-AS1 was closely associated with larger tumor size, advanced tumor stages, lower disease free survival and overall survival of HCC patients. OSER1-AS1 knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of HCC cells, and induced the apoptosis. In addition, the dual luciferase reporter assay directly demonstrated that OSER1-AS1 functioned as a molecular sponge for miR-372-3p to promote Rab23 expression. Moreover, the results of immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis showed that Rab23 was highly expressed in HCC tissues, and the high expression of Rab23 was closely associated with the poor overall survival of HCC patients. Immunofluorescence assay also found the subcellular localization of Rab23 in HCC cells. Rab23 was obviously downregulated in cells that were transfected with miR-372-3p mimics. MiR-372-3p mimics significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells). Rab23 restoration partially reversed miR-372-3p-induced tumor suppressive effects on HCC cells. In conclusion, we found that OSER1-AS1 acted as a ceRNA to sponge miR-372-3p, thereby positively regulating the Rab23 expression and ultimately acting as a tumor suppressor gene in HCC progression.
