The rising prevalence of the metabolic syndrome has led to an increase of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and its progressive-inflammatory form called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In recent years, NAFLD and NASH have become major risk factors for developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this case, we report a 46-year-old patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic comorbidities including obesity and arterial hypertension, who was referred because of rising liver enzymes. After clinical and diagnostic evaluation, the patient was diagnosed with NASH-associated liver cirrhosis, Child-Pugh stage B. A normal blood sugar level was difficult to achieve, and the patient presented with consistently elevated HbA1c-levels irresponsive to insulin therapy. Due to the underlying liver cirrhosis, the patient was enrolled in the HCC-surveillance program. Sonography during follow up showed a focal lesion. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the diagnosis of HCC (BCLC stage A) was confirmed based on typical contrast enhancement and portal-venous wash-out. The patient was evaluated for liver transplantation with a labMELD of 17, and an intermittent therapy with TACE was initiated. Only 2 months after liver transplantation, the patient developed severe and lethal complications. Overall, this case highlights the different medical issues of patients with metabolic syndrome developing a chronic liver disease. In this patient, a rapid progression from NASH-associated liver cirrhosis to HCC was seen, and therefore highlights the importance of close surveillance to identify and treat potential risk factors early in the course of the disease.
