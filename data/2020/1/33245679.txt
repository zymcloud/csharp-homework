Objective:To evaluate the use of transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) combined with microwave ablation (MWA) to treat patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and type Ⅱ-Ⅲ portal vein tumour thrombosis (PVTT) intolerant to targeted drug (TG) therapy.Methods:A total of 18 patients with HCC and type Ⅱ-Ⅲ PVTT intolerant to TG were enrolled between June 2015 and December 2019, who were treated with TACE + MWA (MWA group). 24 patients were treated with TACE + TG (TG group; control cohort). Time to progression and overall survival (OS) were analysed along with the incidence of adverse events.Results:The median follow-up time was 19.0 months (9.0-32.0 months). The median OS was 17.0 months (8.3-29.3 months; MWA group) and 13.5 months (5.5-22.5 months; TG group) and was not significantly different. The 1- and 2 year OS was also comparable (MWA group: 66.7%, 44.4% vs Target group: 41.7%, 29.2%). Time to progression showed no distinct differences (MWA group: 11.5 months; TG group: 9.0 months) between the two groups. Moreover, the incidence of major Grade 3-4 adverse events in the MWA group (5.6%) was similar to those in the TG group (8.3%).Conclusion:TACE + MWA and TACE + TG were comparable in their safety and efficacy in patients with HCC, type Ⅱ-Ⅲ PVTT, and intolerance to TG.Advances in knowledge:TACE + MWA can be used as a palliative treatment alternative for TACE + TG in patients with HCC, type Ⅱ-Ⅲ PVTT, and intolerance to TG.
