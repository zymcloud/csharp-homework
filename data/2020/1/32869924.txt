As patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) tend to be older and/or have advanced liver disease in Japan, real-world data are needed to evaluate safe and effective treatment options. The study aim was to assess safety and effectiveness of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) in a real-world cohort of Japanese patients with HCV genotype (GT) 1 infection overall and by patient subgroups: elderly, compensated cirrhotic, advanced fibrotic and those with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A large prospective observational study was conducted, enrolling adult patients treated for HCV GT1 infection with LDV/SOF at clinical sites across Japan. Patients were observed for safety outcomes during and 4 weeks after treatment, and for sustained virologic response at 12-weeks post-treatment (SVR12). Incidence rates (IRs) of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and serious ADRs (SADRs) and SVR12 rates were assessed overall and by subgroups. ADR and SADR IRs were low (2.26 and 0.17 per 100 person-months, respectively) and did not significantly differ in elderly patients or those with presence of compensated cirrhosis, worsening fibrosis or HCC. SVR12 rates were high overall (98.5%) and across subgroups investigated (≥94%), including patients who were elderly (98.2%), treatment-experienced (97.6%), advanced fibrotic (≥95.8%), had existing NS5A resistance-associated substitutions reported pre-treatment (95.0%), compensated cirrhosis (95.7%), HCC (94.0%) and other chronic liver diseases (96.1%). In this large, real-world observational study of Japanese patients with HCV GT1 infection, LDV/SOF treatment resulted in low incidence of adverse events, with high real-world effectiveness, even among patients with potentially higher risks of adverse safety outcomes and treatment failure.
