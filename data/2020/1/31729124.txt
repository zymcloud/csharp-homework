Aim:Although a reduced serum zinc level is often observed in patients with chronic liver disease due to hepatitis virus, its prognostic importance has not been adequately investigated. This study aimed to elucidate the association of zinc deficiency with prognosis, especially in early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:From 2005 to 2018, 466 patients with naïve HCC due to hepatitis virus were enrolled (327 men, 139 women; median age 70 years; hepatitis C virus [HCV] n = 389, hepatitis B virus [HBV] n = 69, hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus n = 8; Child-Pugh A n = 367, Child-Pugh B n = 82; Child-Pugh C n = 17; TNM-LCSGJ stage I n = 150, stage II n = 181, stage III n = 91, stage IVa n = 26, state IVb n = 18). Of the 466 patients, 287 were within the Milan criteria (early HCC) and treated curatively. Zinc deficiency was defined as Results:The levels of serum zinc became lower with chronic liver disease progression (Child-Pugh A, B, C: 64.3 ± 14.3, 52.3 ± 15.7, 48.4 ± 13.5 μg/dL, respectively; P Conclusion:Serum levels of zinc were reduced in association with chronic liver disease grade progression. In addition to infection control of hepatitis virus, zinc deficiency might be a significant prognostic factor for survival in patients with early HCC due to viral hepatitis treated curatively.
