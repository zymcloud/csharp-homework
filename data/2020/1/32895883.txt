Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), an intracellular molecular chaperone, is involved in the pathogenesis of cancer by promoting both tumor cell proliferation and resistance to therapy. HSP27 is also present in the circulation and circulating HSP27 (sHSP27) can elicit an autoimmune response with production of antibodies. Levels of sHSP27 are enhanced in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); it is, however, unknown whether changes in HSP27 antibody levels occur in patients with HCC and can be exploited as a circulating biomarker of HCC. Our aim was to assess the potential association between newly diagnosed HCC and serum anti-HSP27 antibody levels. In this cross-sectional study, anti-HSP27 antibody levels were measured in serum samples from 71 HCC patients, 80 subjects with chronic liver disease, and 38 control subjects by immunoenzymatic assay. Anti-HSP27 antibody levels did not differ significantly among groups. However, in patients with chronic active hepatitis/cirrhosis, anti-HSP27 levels were significantly higher in subjects with a positive history of alcoholism (p = 0.03). Our data do not support the hypothesis that anti-HSP27 antibody levels may help identify patients with HCC among subjects with chronic liver disease. However, our finding that alcohol-related liver disease is associated with higher anti-HSP27 levels is novel and deserves further investigations.
