Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which could regulate various HCC biological characteristics. Here, the study seeks to investigate the role of lncRNA LEF1-AS1 in HCC cell chemoresistance by regulating microRNA (miR)-10a-5p and Musashi1 (MSI1). The microarray-based analysis was employed to identify the HCC-related lncRNA-miRNA-gene regulatory network. Expression patterns of LEF1-AS1, miR-10a-5p, and MSI1 in the HCC cell lines, tissues were accessed by means of reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Next, the interaction among LEF1-AS1, miR-10a-5p, and MSI1 in HCC was accessed by bioinformatics and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Then, the cell line resistant to cisplatin was established, which was then treated with sh/oe-lncRNA LEF1-AS1, miR-10a-5p-mimic, and oe/sh-MSI1 vectors alone or in combination. Afterward, the effect of LEF1-AS1, miR-10a-5p, and MSI1 on HCC cell chemoresistance, proliferation, and apoptosis was assessed. At last, in vivo experiments confirmed the role of MSI1 in tumor growth and chemoresistance in HCC. LEF1-AS1 might potentially affect the growth and chemoresistance of HCC cells by regulating miR-10a-5p and MSI1. LEF1-AS1 and MSI1 expression patterns were elevated, while miR-10a-5p was repressed in HCC tissues and cell lines. LEF1-AS1 combined to miR-10a-5p and regulated MSI1, thereby activating the protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway. Knockdown of LEF1-AS1 and MSI1 or elevation of miR-10a-5p compromised the proliferation of Huh7 cell line resistant to DDP and promoted its chemosensitivity and apoptosis. At last, these in vitro findings were also confirmed in vivo. Our results unraveled LEF1-AS1 acts as a miR-10a-5p modulator to promote chemoresistance of HCC cells by stimulating MSI1 and activating the AKT signaling pathway, which might provide a novel therapeutic target for HCC.
