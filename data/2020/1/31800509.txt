Aim:This study aimed to analyze the prognostic factors of patients receiving transarterial radioembolization for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.Material and method:Eighty-six (73 M and 13F; mean age: 64.3 ± 9.8 years) patients who received transarterial radioembolization for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma were included. Relationship between serum alpha-fetoprotein and international normalization ratio level, albumin-bilirubin grade, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, presence of portal venous thrombosis and extrahepatic metastases, the dimension of index lesion and OS were analyzed.Results:Neutrophil lymphocyte ratio was ≤ 5 in 76 (88%) and >5 in 10 (12%) of patients. Sixty-two (72%) patients died during a mean of 25.6± 9.7 months follow-up. Mean OS for all patients was calculated as 12.9 ± 14.6 months. In univariate analysis, albumin-bilirubin grade (22.3 ± 3.8 vs. 11.6 ± 4.2; P = 0.03), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (21.8 ± 3.6 vs. 7.3 ± 2.6; P =0.04), presence of extrahepatic metastases (30.1 ± 5.4 vs. 7.4 ± 2.0; P = 0.001) and portal venous thrombosis (26.5± 4.8 vs. 10.5 ± 2.1; P = 0.01) had significant effect on OS. In multivariate analysis, serum international normalization ratio (P = 0.005) and alpha-fetoprotein level (P = 0.004), albumin-bilirubin grade (P = 0.05), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (P = 0.007), Child-Pugh score (0.006) and presence of ascites (P = 0.005) were significantly correlated with OS.Conclusion:Patients with low basal albumin-bilirubin grade and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio survive longer after transarterial radioembolization for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Presence of extrahepatic metastases and portal venous thrombosis seems to have a prognostic value.
