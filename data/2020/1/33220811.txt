Genitourinary cancers are common. Liver metastases from genitourinary cancers are uncommon; isolated liver metastasis is rare. Liver resection in select patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma can lead to prolonged survival. Patients with metachronous and low-burden disease are most likely to benefit. Chemotherapy is first-line treatment of metastatic germ cell tumors. Liver resection is dependent on germ cell lineage and initial response to chemotherapy. Prognosis with liver metastases from prostate cancer is poor; liver-only lesions are rare. Liver resection generally is not indicated. Cumulative experience with liver resection for metastatic bladder cancer is limited. Liver metastases are poor prognostic indicators for metastasectomy.
