A concurrent increase in the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with that of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity has been reported in the absence of hepatitis B virus surface antigen-negative/hepatitis C virus antibody-negative HCC (NBNC-HCC). However, the prognostic relevance of this association remains unclear. Promoter methylation (PM) of the dihydropyrimidinase-like 3 gene (DPYSL3) has been implicated in virus-related HCC. However, it remains unclear whether T2D influences PM in NBNC-HCC. We determined the influence of T2D on clinicopathological profile and PM of DPYSL3 and CDK2NA in patients with NBNC-HCC who were divided into two groups: non-diabetes (non-DM; n = 46) and diabetes (DM; n = 47). DM was associated with a higher Union for International Cancer Control grade, marginal vascular invasion and tumour cell proliferation irrespective of the duration of T2D as well as higher rates of PM of DPYSL3 than non-DM; however, PM of CDK2NA was similar between both groups. PM of DPYSL3 reduced its expression which inversely correlated with reduced patient survival. In conclusion, T2D is associated with poor prognosis of NBNC-HCC in which a high frequency of PM of DPYSL3 may play a pivotal role in its pathogenesis.
