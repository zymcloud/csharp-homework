Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients still have risk for very late recurrence after curative resection. This study assesses prognostic factors in HCC patients with recurrence-free survival (RFS) for 5 years after primary resection.Methods:We enrolled 383 HCC patients who received primary tumor resection and achieved more than 5 years without recurrence after resection between January 2001 and April 2013. Predictive factors, including albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade, for RFS and overall survival (OS) were analyzed.Results:After a median follow-up of 103 months, 57 patients (14.9%) had recurrent HCC, and 14 (3.7%) died. Independent predictors for HCC recurrence were male sex (p = 0.035), pre-operative liver cirrhosis (LC) (p = 0.025), serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL (p = 0.045), post-operative 5th-year alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) > 15 ng/ml (p 70 years (p = 0.002), post-operative 5th-year AFP > 15 ng/ml (p = 0.003), and ALBI grades 2 and 3 (p = 0.002). Patients whose deteriorated ALBI grades 5 years after resection had adverse RFS outcomes compared to those with constant (p = 0.056) and improved ALBI grades (p = 0.008). In subgroup analysis, patients with post-operative 5th-year ALBI grades 2 and 3 had significantly poorer RFS and OS (both p Conclusion:In HCC patients without recurrence for 5 years after curative resection, post-operative 5th-year ALBI grade is useful for predicting outcomes, even with low AFP during follow-up.
