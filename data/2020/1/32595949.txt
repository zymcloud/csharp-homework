Background: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a serious worldwide health problem, with an estimated global prevalence of 24%; it has a notable relationship with other metabolic disorders, like obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is one of the most important clinical entities of NAFLD, which is associated with an increased risk of progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mexico is one of the countries with the highest prevalence of metabolic diseases; therefore, we sought to investigate the impact that these clinical entities have in the progression to advanced fibrosis in Mexican patients with NASH. Methods: We performed a multicenter retrospective cross-sectional study, from January 2012 to December 2017. A total of 215 patients with biopsy-proven NASH and fibrosis were enrolled. NASH was diagnosed according NAS score and liver fibrosis was staged by the Kleiner scoring system. For comparing the risk of liver fibrosis progression, we divided our sample into two groups. Those patients with stage F0-F2 liver fibrosis were included in the group with non-significant liver fibrosis (n=178) and those individuals with F3-F4 fibrosis were included in the significant fibrosis group (n=37). We carried out a multivariate analysis to find risk factors associated with liver fibrosis progression. Results: From the 215 patients included, 37 had significant liver fibrosis (F3-4). After logistic regression analysis T2DM (p=0.044), systemic arterial hypertension (p=0.014), cholesterol (p=0.041) and triglycerides (p=0.015) were the main predictor of advanced liver fibrosis. Conclusions: In a Mexican population, dyslipidemia was the most important risk factor associated with advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.
