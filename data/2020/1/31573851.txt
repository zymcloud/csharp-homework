OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to validate the use of subtraction images derived from gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI for observation of washout and enhancing capsule in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS. For 120 histologically verified HCCs in 115 high-risk patients, the presence of washout and enhancing capsule in the portal venous phase (PVP) on conventional MR images with and without corresponding subtraction images was determined by two independent observers. The incremental value of subtraction imaging in upgrading the categories outlined in the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) version 2018 for the diagnosis of HCC was analyzed for different subgroups of patients classified on the basis of lesion size (< 10 mm, 10-19 mm, â‰¥ 20 mm), unenhanced T1-weighted signal intensity, and arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE) of the lesions. RESULTS. When conventional PVP images were compared with the combination of conventional and subtraction PVP images, only T1-weighted isointensity or hyperintensity significantly increased the detection of washout (eight vs 15 of 18 lesions; p = 0.0233). Detection of enhancing capsule was significantly increased (p < 0.05) regardless of various factors, except for a lesion size of less than 2 cm (five vs nine of 36 lesions; p = 0.1336). Two lesions (one LI-RADS category 3 lesion and one LI-RADS category 4 lesion) with APHE were upgraded to category 5 on the basis of a review of PVP subtraction images. CONCLUSION. PVP subtraction imaging during gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI can upgrade LI-RADS categories for the diagnosis of HCC because of its superior ability in depicting enhancing capsule and the incremental benefit of showing washout.
