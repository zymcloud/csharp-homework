Objectives:To develop a nomogram for the local tumor progression (LTP) in patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after computed tomography-guided percutaneous microwave ablation (CT-PMWA) and to assess clinical-pathologic risk factors for individual LTP estimation. Furthermore, we compared the prognostic predictive ability for LTP between the nomogram and the traditional staging systems.Methods:This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. Five hundred and forty treatment-na√Øve patients with HCC according to the Milan criteria, who subsequently underwent CT-PMWA were reviewed from 2009 to 2019. Baseline characteristics were collected to identify the risk factors for the determination of LTP after CT-PMWA. The multivariate Cox proportional-hazards model based on significant prognostic factors of LTP was used to construct the nomogram, which was then assessed for its predictive accuracy using mainly the Harrell's C-index and time-dependent area under the curve (tAUC).Results:After a median follow-up time of 28.7 months, 6.5% (35/540) patients had LTP. The nomogram was developed based on the tumor size, tumor number, Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) grade, platelet, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). The nomogram had good calibration and discriminatory abilities in the training set, with C-indexes of 0.799 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.738, 0.860), and tAUCs of 0.844 (CI: 0.728, 0.895), that were greater than those of traditional staging systems. Internal validation with 1000 bootstrap resamples had a good C-index of 0.735 (CI: 0.648, 0.816).Conclusions:The nomogram model can be used to predict accurately LTP after CT-PMWA for early-stage HCC, as well as to assist physicians during the therapeutic decision-making process.
