This study was designed to explore if antiviral treatment influences the performance of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among the high-risk chronic HBV-infected patients. A total of 5936 patients who had evidence of chronic HBV infection were enrolled from four independent centres in this retrospective study, including 1721 chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 2286 liver cirrhosis (LC), 798 HCC within Milan criteria and 1131 HCC beyond Milan criteria patients. Stratified by whether they received treatment or not, the patients were further divided into antiviral and non-antiviral groups. Then, the performance of AFP for discriminating HCC was evaluated. Patients receiving antivirals had significantly lower median levels of AFP compared with the non-antiviral patients (P 1ULN patients. In conclusion, in the era of antiviral therapy, serum AFP's surveillance performance was substantially improved for HCC within Milan criteria among the high-risk population of CHB and LC patients.
