Background/aim:The prognosis of pancreatic cancer remains poor with a high incidence of recurrence even after curative resection. The aim of this study was to investigate prognostic factors in patients with recurrent pancreatic cancer using the multicenter database.Patients and methods:The subjects were 196 patients with recurrent pancreatic cancer who underwent resection between 2008 and 2015. We retrospectively investigated the relation between clinicopathological characteristics of the patients and overall survival from recurrence using univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:In univariate analysis, the positive lymphatic invasion (p=0.0240), time to recurrence from resection <1 year (p<0.0001), sites of recurrence except for local or lymph node (p=0.0273), liver recurrence (p=0.0389) and peritoneal recurrence (p<0.0001) were significantly associated with poor overall survival from recurrence. In multivariate analysis, time to recurrence from resection <1 year (p<0.0001) and peritoneal recurrence (p<0.0001) were independently associated with poor overall survival from recurrence.Conclusion:Time to recurrence from resection <1 year and peritoneal recurrence were significant independent predictors of poor overall survival from recurrence in patients with recurrent pancreatic cancer.
