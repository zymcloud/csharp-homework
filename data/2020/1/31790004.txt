Background and objective:The role of endothelial progenitor cells in patients with cirrhosis has seldom been investigated. This study was conducted to assess the clinical significance of circulating endothelial progenitor cells in patients with liver cirrhosis with or without hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:A blood sample was collected once from patients with cirrhosis alone (n = 34) or cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 46) and healthy controls (n = 27) for assessing levels of endothelial progenitor cells and vascular endothelial growth factor. Blood cells staining positive for CD34/CD133/KDR using flow cytometry were characterized as endothelial progenitor cells. Plasma vascular endothelial growth factor was quantified by ELISA.Results:The levels of CD34/KDR-positive endothelial progenitor cells, CD133/KDR-positive endothelial progenitor cells, and vascular endothelial growth factor were higher in patients with cirrhosis ± hepatocellular carcinoma than in healthy controls (P = 0.017, P Conclusion:Circulating endothelial progenitor cells and plasma vascular endothelial growth factor levels were higher in patients with liver cirrhosis ± hepatocellular carcinoma compared to healthy controls. The increase in endothelial progenitor cells and vascular endothelial growth factor may have a possible role in the development of complications, especially ascites and portal vein thrombosis, or in progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.
