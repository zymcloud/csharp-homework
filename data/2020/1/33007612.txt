Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal tumors worldwide. This study aims to address the lack of faithful and available in vitro models for patient-specific drug screening for HCC. We recently established a novel modeling system using three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology and constructed hepatorganoids with HepaRG cells, which retain the liver function and prolong the survival of mice with liver failure after abdominal transplantation. Here we extend this modeling system to establish individualized model for hepatocellular carcinoma. HCC specimens were obtained from six patients after surgery. Primary HCC cells were isolated and mixed with gelatin and sodium alginate to form the bioink for printing. Patient-derived three-dimensional bio-printed HCC (3DP-HCC) models were successfully established afterward and grew well during long-term culture. These models retained the features of parental HCCs, including stable expression of the biomarker, stable maintenances of the genetic alterations and expression profiles. 3DP-HCC models are capable of displaying the results of drug screening intuitively and quantitatively. In conclusion, 3DP-HCC models are faithful in vitro models that are reliable in long-term culture and able to predict patient-specific drugs for personalized treatment.
