Portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) is very common, and it plays a major role in the prognosis and clinical staging of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We have published the first version of the Consensus in 2016. Over the past several years, many new evidences for the treatment of PVTT become available especially for the advent of new targeted drugs which have further improved the prognosis of PVTT. So, the Chinese Association of Liver Cancer revised the 2016 version of consensus to adapt to the development of PVTT treatment. Future treatment strategies for HCC with PVTT in China would depend on new evidences from more future clinical trials.
