Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent organic pollutants and human carcinogens. It was reported that rat CYP1A1 and catfish CYP1A can hydroxylate 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) and 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 77), while potential roles of other CYP1 enzymes in the metabolism of dioxin-like (DL) PCBs remain unconfirmed. In this study, three representative DL-PCBs, i.e., PCB 77, PCB 126, and 3,4,4',5-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 81), were investigated on their genotoxicity in Chinese hamster V79-derived cell lines genetically engineered for the expression of human CYP1A1, 1A2 and 1B1, and in the human hepatoma C3A cell line, which endogenously expresses various CYPs. Under both 6 h/18 h and 18 h/6 h (exposure/recovery) regimes, PCB 77 and 81 induced micronuclei in V79-hCYP1B1 cells at micromolar levels, with slightly higher potency in the latter regime, while they were inactive in the parental V79-Mz cells and the V79-derived cell lines expressing human CYP1A1 and 1A2. However, PCB 126 was negative in each cell line. Likewise, PCB 77 and 81 induced micronuclei formation in C3A cells, which expressed CYP1B1. This effect was blocked by co-exposure to tetramethoxystilbene (30 nM), a selective CYP1B1 inhibitor. Immuno-fluorescent staining of centromere protein B in the micronuclei in PCB-treated cultures showed a predominance of centromere-negative micronuclei, which indicated a clastogenic effect. Moreover, all three PCBs elevated the level of γ-H2AX protein (indicating DNA double-strand breaks) in C3A cells, and these effects were blocked by tetramethoxystilbene (10 nM). This study demonstrates that some DL-PCBs are clastogenic in mammalian cells following metabolic activation by human CYP1B1.
