In this study liver tumours produced in male and female mice of the low spontaneous liver tumour incidence C57BL/10J strain treated for 99 weeks with 1000 ppm in the diet with the model constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) activator sodium phenobarbital (NaPB) were analysed for β-catenin mutations by Western immunoblotting and DNA/RNA analysis. Some gene array analysis was also performed to identify genes involved in CAR activation and in β-catenin and Hras gene mutations. Analysis of 8 male and 2 female NaPB-induced liver tumour samples (comprising 2 adenomas, 6 carcinomas and 2 samples containing separate adenomas and carcinomas) revealed truncated β-catenin forms in just 4 male liver tumour samples, with the presence of the truncated β-catenin forms being confirmed by β-catenin exon 1-3 mutation analysis. Microarray gene expression analysis was performed with three of the NaPB-induced male mouse liver tumour samples where β-catenin mutations had not been identified by Western immunoblotting and DNA/RNA analysis and with three liver samples from both NaPB-induced non-tumour tissue and control animals. Treatment with NaPB resulted in induction of Cyp2b subfamily gene expression in both NaPB-induced mouse liver tumours and in NaPB-treated non-tumour tissue. In addition, the gene expression analysis demonstrated that the β-catenin and Hras pathways were not modified in NaPB-induced mouse liver tumours not exhibiting truncated β-catenin forms. Overall, while chronic administration of the model CAR activator NaPB results in both hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma in the low spontaneous liver tumour incidence C57BL/10J mouse strain, only 40 % of the liver tumours evaluated in this study had β-catenin mutations. These results are in agreement with previous studies with the CAR activator oxazepam and demonstrate that mouse liver tumours induced by nongenotoxic CAR activators in the absence of initiation with a genotoxic agent are due to a number of mechanisms, including those largely independent of either the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway or Hras oncogene mutations.
