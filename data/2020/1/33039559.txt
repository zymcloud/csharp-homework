CDC20 regulates cell cycle progression by targeting key substrates for destruction, but its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumorigenesis remains to be explored. Here, by using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we identified CDC20 as a hub gene in HCC. We demonstrated that CDC20 expression is correlated with HIF-1 activity and overall survival (OS) of clinic HCC patients. The activity of HIF-1 is regulated by the stability of HIF-1a subunit, which is hydroxylated by oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylase enzymes, the PHDs. In addition, we show that genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of CDC20 can accelerate the degradation of HIF-1a and impair VEGF secretion in HCC cells. Mechanistically, we found that CDC20 binds to the destruction-box (D-box) motif present in the PHD3 protein to promote its polyubiquitination and degradation. The depletion of endogenous PHD3 in CDC20 knockdown HCC cells greatly attenuated the decline of HIF-1a protein and restored the secretion of VEGF. In contrast, overexpression of a non-degradable PHD3 mutant significantly inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings indicate that CDC20 plays a crucial role in the development of HCC by governing PHD3 protein.
