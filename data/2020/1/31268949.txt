Aim:The differences of the clinical features and survival outcomes between cirrhotic and noncirrhotic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remain to be determined. We evaluated clinical characteristics and survival outcomes of noncirrhotic HBV-associated HCC patients compared with cirrhotic patients.Patients and methods:Between January 2005 and December 2015, 1345 patients were diagnosed to have HCC at our hospital. Of these, 860 HBV-associated HCC patients with (cirrhotic group, n = 519, 60.3%) or without cirrhosis (noncirrhotic group, n = 341, 39.7%) were retrospectively analyzed. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to adjust for differences between the two groups.Results:The noncirrhotic group had lower Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) classes and greater tumor sizes and were less likely to have portal vein thrombosis than the cirrhotic group. Age and sex were not significantly different between the two groups. Cumulative overall survival (OS) rates at 2, 4, 6, and 8 years after treatment were significantly higher in the noncirrhotic group (67.2, 57.1, 43.2, and 38.3 vs. 58.3, 41.3, 33.2, and 27.8%, respectively, P Conclusion:After PSM, cumulative OS rates were similar between HBV-related HCC patients with and without cirrhosis, and they were clearly dependent on CTP class, regardless of the presence of cirrhosis itself both in cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients.
