Objectives:We aimed to identify dynamic CT features that can be used for prediction of local recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after proton beam therapy (PBT).Methods:We retrospectively retrieved CT scans of patients with PBT-treated HCC, taken between January 2004 and December 2016. 17 recurrent lesions and 34 non-recurrent lesions were retrieved. The attenuation difference between irradiated tumor and irradiated parenchyma (ADHCC-IP) was compared in the two groups by using the Mann-Whitney U test. Cut-off value of ADHCC-IP was estimated by using the Youden index.Results:The follow-up time after PBT initiation ranged from 374 to 2402 days (median, 1069 days) in recurrent lesions, and 418 to 2923 days (median, 1091.5 days) in non-recurrent lesions (p = 0.892). The time until appearance of local recurrence after PBT initiation ranged from 189 to 2270 days (median, 497 days). ADHCC-IP of recurrent lesions [mean, -21.8 Hounsfield units (HU); from -95 to -31 HU] was significantly greater than that of non-recurrent lesions (mean, -51.7 HU; from -117 to -12 HU) at 1-2 years in portal venous phase (p = 0.039). 5-year local tumor control rates were 0.93 and 0.56 in lesions with ADHCC-IP at 1-2 years in PVP < -55 and â‰¥ -55 HU, respectively.Conclusion:The attenuation difference between irradiated HCC and irradiated liver parenchyma in portal venous phase at 1-2 years after PBT can predict long-term local recurrence of HCC after treatment.Advances in knowledge:We identified a cut-off value for contrast enhancement of HCC after PBT that could predict future local recurrence.
