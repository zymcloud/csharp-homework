Objectives:To explore the real-world data regarding survival following metastasectomy (MS) for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the postcytokine therapy era.Patients and methods:Patients diagnosed with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) between January 2008 and December 2018 at our institutions were retrospectively evaluated. The patients were classified into three groups according to their MS status: (1) complete MS (cMS), (2) incomplete MS (icMS), and (3) without MS (nonMS). Factors for overall survival (OS) after diagnosis were analyzed.Results:Overall, 314 patients were evaluated. During the follow-up period (median: 25.3 months), a total of 98 patients (31.2%) underwent at least one MS. The cMS group (n = 45, 14.3%) had a significantly longer OS (median: not reached [N.R.]) than the icMS (n = 53, 16.9%) (81.5 months, P= 0.0042) and nonMS groups (28.1 months, P< 0.0001). The icMS group had a significantly longer OS than the nonMS group did (P= 0.0010). Multivariate analysis showed that the MS status was an independent factor for OS (cMS vs. nonMS: P= 0.0004; icMS vs. nonMS: P= 0.0176), together with histopathological type, International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk, liver metastasis status, and prior nephrectomy status (all, P< 0.05). In addition, the OS was comparable throughout the eras of systemic therapy (early molecular-targeted therapy, late molecular-targeted therapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitor eras) in the MS group (median: 121.9 vs. N.R. vs. N.R. months, P= 0.948).Conclusions:MS, especially cMS improved survival in selected patients with mRCC in the postcytokine therapy era. In addition, MS still plays a significant role in the current systemic therapy.
