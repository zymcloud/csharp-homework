The five-year overall survival rate with liver cancer currently ranks the second lowest among seventeen common malignant tumors in China. The occurrence and development of liver cancer is a process of progressive exacerbation. Nowadays, the clinical research is mainly aimed at the intermediate stage, that is, the exploration of the principle and method of diagnosis and treatment in the hospital. Notably, the research on the precancerous stage and the recovery stage after treatment of liver cancer are still seriously inadequate. We put forward a stepwise strategy to emphasize that only the full course of prevention and treatment study on liver cancer patients can significantly improve the overall efficacy of liver cancer in China.
