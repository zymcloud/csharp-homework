Background:This study aimed to investigate the clinical relevance of the immune microenvironment in patients with combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-ICC).Patients and methods:The density of tumor-infiltrating CD3+ , CD8+ , CD163+ , and Foxp3+ immune cells, as well as Programmed cell death 1, Programmed cell death-ligand 1, and Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 4, was measured in the peritumor liver, tumor invasive margin, and intratumor subregions of 56 cHCC-ICC by immunohistochemistry. The immune index was established to stratify patients. Prognostic significance of immune cell subsets and immune indices was evaluated.Results:The distribution of immune cells was highly heterogeneous among different subregions of cHCC-ICC. As compared with the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) component, the lower density of CD8+ T cells and higher intensity of Foxp3+ Tregs and immune checkpoints in the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) component may indicate a stronger immune evasive ability of ICC. Based on clustering classification or a combination of random forest and lasso-cox, two models of immune indices were established and both were identified as independent prognostic factors for cHCC-ICC patients. The selected immune variables in the immune prognostic models derived from both HCC and ICC subregions, indicating that the prognosis of cHCC-ICC patients was a complex interaction of both components.Conclusions:The immune contexture was heterogeneous among different subregions of cHCC-ICC patients and contributed differently to patient prognosis. Immune score based on the densities of immune cells might serve as a promising prognostic predictor for cHCC-ICC patients.
