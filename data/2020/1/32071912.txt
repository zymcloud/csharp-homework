Background and aims:This study aimed to identify the utility of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) as a predictor of the response of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to lenvatinib.Methods:We evaluated 28 consecutive patients with HCC diagnosed by dynamic CT or magnetic resonance imaging combined with 18F-FDG-PET/CT. The tumor-to-normal liver standardized uptake value ratio (TLR) of the target tumor was measured before treatment using 18F-FDG-PET/CT, with a TLR ≥2 classified as a high potential for malignant HCC. The treatment response was evaluated 2 weeks after the initiation of lenvatinib using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.Results:Of the 28 patients, 12 (43%) presented with a TLR ≥2. Evaluation of the treatment response at 2 weeks in these 12 patients revealed that 2 (17%) exhibited a complete response, 8 (67%) a partial response, 2 (17%) stable disease, and none with progressive disease. Therefore, 10 of the 12 patients (83%) experienced an objective response to lenvatinib. On the other hand, 7 of the 16 patients with a TLR p = 0.028) is a useful predictor of an early objective response at 2 weeks.Conclusion:Patients with unresectable HCC showed a good early treatment response to lenvatinib. High TLR (≥2) may be a useful predictor of an extremely rapid treatment response.
