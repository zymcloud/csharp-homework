Background:Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) is a de-ubiquitin enzyme that plays an essential role in multiple cancers and becomes a target for treatment. However, the role of USP7 and its therapeutic value for HCC remains unclear.Methods:USP7 expression was examined in HCC tissues by western blot and immunohistochemistry. The correlation of USP7 and HCC prognosis was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival method. Mass spectrometry was determined and cell proliferation and tumorigenicity assays were conducted in vitro and in vivo treated by P22077 and sgRNA-USP7.Results:USP7 expression was significantly increased in HCC and associated with its progression. Interestingly, many HCC cells are sensitive to USP7 inhibition by using P22077. P22077 treatment not only induced cell death but also inhibited cell proliferation and migration in Huh7 and SK-Hep1 cells. In a xenograft model, P22077 efficiently inhibited tumor growth. In chemo-resistant HCC cells, P22077 decreased cell sensitivity to chemotherapy. In addition, mass spectrometry reveals 224 of significantly changed proteins upon P22077 treatment.Conclusions:We demonstrate a critical role of USP7 in HCC devolvement and chemoresistance. Disruption of USP7 function results in dis-regulated several key biological processes and subsequently activates BAX. USP7 might be a novel and drug-able target in HCC.
