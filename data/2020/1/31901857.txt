Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers, whereas the molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. PRAS40 (encoded by AKT1S1) phosphorylation was increased in human melanoma, prostate cancer and lung cancer specimens, which was considered as the results of Akt activation. However the mechanism in detail and its role in HCC stay elusive.Methods:PRAS40 expression and phosphorylation were analyzed in HCC specimens, and the survival rates of patients were investigated. Functional analyses of PRAS40 in HCC were performed in vivo and in vitro. The miR-124-3p binding sites in PRAS40 were investigated using luciferase assay. MiR-124-3p expression in HCC specimens was examined by In Situ hybridization, and the correlation to PRAS40 level was evaluated.Findings:The phosphorylation, protein and mRNA levels of PRAS40 were increased significantly in HCC specimens from our cohorts and TCGA database, which was positively correlated to the poor prognosis of HCC patients. Compared to Akt1s1+/+ mice, hepatocarcinogenesis was suppressed in Akt1s1-/- mice, and the activation of Akt was impaired. PRAS40 depletion resulted in the inhibition of HCC cellular proliferation. Tumor suppressor miR-124-3p was found to downregulate PRAS40 expression by targeting its 3'UTR. MiR-124-3p levels were inversely correlated to PRAS40 protein and phosphorylation levels in HCC specimens. The proliferation inhibition by miR-124-3p mimics was partially reversed by exogenous PRAS40 introduction in HCC cells.Interpretation:PRAS40 hyperexpression induced by loss of miR-124-3p contributes to PRAS40 hyperphosphorylation and hepatocarcinogenesis. These results could be expected to offer novel clues for understanding hepatocarcinogenesis and developing approaches.
