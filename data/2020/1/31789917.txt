Although immunotherapy is a successful approach in oncology, it might be detrimental to some patients. In the condition of hyperprogression, patients experience accelerated progression after immunotherapy, resulting in a worse outcome. Hyperprogression may be difficult to be identified in the early stage. Once the diagnosis is confirmed in the follow-up evaluation, the immunotherapy should be stopped immediately. In this case, we report a hyperprogression patient during combined immunotherapy toward metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma observed by serial F-FDG PET.
