Escherichia coli are commensal gastrointestinal microflora of humans, but few strains may cause food-borne diseases. Present study aimed to identify antimicrobial resistant (AMR), biofilm-forming E. coli from Indian dairy and meat products. A total of 32 E. coli isolates were identified and evaluated for biofilm-formation. EMC17, an E. coli isolate was established as a powerful biofilm-former that attained maximum biofilm-formation within 96 h on glass and stainless-steel surfaces. Presence and expression of virulence-associated genes (adhesins, invasins and polysaccharides) and ability to adhere and invade human liver carcinoma HepG2 cell lines implicates EMC17 to be pathotype belonging to Extra-intestinal Pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC). Antibiotic profiling of EMC17 identified it as multi-drug resistant (MDR) strain, possessing extended spectrum Î²-lactamases (ESBL's) and biofilm phenotype. Early production of quorum sensing molecules (AHLs) alongside EPS production facilitated early onset of biofilm formation by EMC17. Furthermore, the biofilm-forming genes of EMC17 were significantly upregulated 3-27 folds in the biofilm-state. This study showed prevalence of MDR, biofilm-forming, pathogenic E. coli in Indian dairy and meat products that potentially serve as reservoirs for transmission of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) genes of bacteria from food to humans and pose serious food safety threat.
