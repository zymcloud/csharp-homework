Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of an intraoperative 3D hologram, which was a computer graphics model liver, with mixed reality techniques in liver surgery.Summary background data:The merits for the application of a hologram for surgical support are: 1) no sterilized display monitor; 2) better spatial awareness; and 3) 3D images shared by all the surgeons.Methods:3D polygon data using preoperative computed tomography data was installed into head mount displays, HoloLens (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA).Results:In a Wi-Fi-enabled operative room, several surgeons wearing HoloLens succeeded in sharing the same hologram and moving that hologram from respective operators' angles by means of easy gesture-handling without any monitors. The intraoperative hologram contributed to better imagination of tumor locations, and for determining the parenchymal dissection line in the hepatectomy for the patients with more than 20 multiple colo-rectal liver metastases. In another case, the hologram enabled a safe Gliisonean pedicle approach for hepato-cellular carcinoma with a hilar anatomical anomaly. Surgeons could easily compare the real patient's anatomy and that of the hologram just before the hepatic hilar procedure.Conclusions:This initial experience suggested that an intraoperative hologram with mixed reality techniques contributed to "last-minute simulation," not for "navigation." The intraoperative hologram might be a new next-generation operation-supportive tool in terms of spatial awareness, sharing, and simplicity.
