Purpose:To assess the diagnostic performance of the LR-M criteria of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2017 in differentiating intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with and without risk factors for HCC.Methods:Fifty-four ICC in patients with risks and 55 ICC in patients without risks and matched control cases of HCC with and without risks (n = 59 and n = 55, respectively) were enrolled. The enhanced features of the lesions were retrospectively analyzed according to LR-M criteria. The diagnostic performances including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of LR-M criteria were assessed.Result:Peripheral rim-like hyperenhancement, early washout (Conclusion:Although the LR-M criteria showed high sensitivity in distinguishing ICCs from HCCs in patients with and without risks, the specificity would be significantly increased after adjustments to current criteria.Key points:• The LR-M criteria of CEUS-LI-RADS v2017 could be used for distinguishing ICC from HCC not only in patients with risk factors for HCC but also in those without risk factors. • The diagnostic performance of differentiating ICC from HCC by using the LR-M criteria showed high AUC (0.92), high sensitivity (97.25%), intermediate specificity (87.72%), and high accuracy (92.38%). • If the onset of early washout was adjusted to
