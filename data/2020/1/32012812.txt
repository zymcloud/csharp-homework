Tight junctions (TJ) are intercellular adhesion complexes on epithelial cells and composed of integral membrane proteins as well as cytosolic adaptor proteins. Tight junction proteins have been recognized to play a key role in health and disease. In the liver, TJ proteins have several functions: they contribute as gatekeepers for paracellular diffusion between adherent hepatocytes or cholangiocytes to shape the blood-biliary barrier (BBIB) and maintain tissue homeostasis. At non-junctional localizations, TJ proteins are involved in key regulatory cell functions such as differentiation, proliferation, and migration by recruiting signaling proteins in response to extracellular stimuli. Moreover, TJ proteins are hepatocyte entry factors for the hepatitis C virus (HCV)-a major cause of liver disease and cancer worldwide. Perturbation of TJ protein expression has been reported in chronic HCV infection, cholestatic liver diseases as well as hepatobiliary carcinoma. Here we review the physiological function of TJ proteins in the liver and their implications in hepatobiliary diseases.
