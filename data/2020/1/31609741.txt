Purpose of review:Recently, the combination of antiangiogenic agents, chemotherapy and immunotherapy has shown synergistic anticancer effects in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The future for this approach appears bright in lung cancer treatment; however, many challenges remain to be overcome regarding its true potential, optimal sequence and timing of therapy, and safety profile. In this review, we will discuss the current status and future direction of antiangiogenic therapy for the treatment of NSCLC, and highlight emerging strategies, such as tumor vessel normalization (TVN).Recent findings:Bevacizumab was the first antiangiogenic agent approved for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Recently, the combination of chemotherapy/antiangiogenic therapy with immunotherapy showed high efficacy in first-line settings. A subgroup of patients with liver metastasis and driver mutation-addicted tumors benefited most, suggesting that the metastatic location, as well as the genetic background of the tumor, are key determinants for therapy responses.Summary:The efficacy of antiangiogenic therapies in unselected patients is rather limited. The tumor microenvironment has appeared to be more complex and heterogeneous than previously assumed. Only a contextual rather than a cell-specific approach might provide valuable insights towards the clinical validation of combinational therapies.
