Background:The prognostic factors and treatment strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with a large number of tumor nodules have not been fully elucidated. Clinical factors influencing prognosis were investigated in HCC patients with 30 or more tumor nodules.Methods:Forty-six HCC patients with 30 or more tumor nodules participated in this study. None of them had vascular invasion and extrahepatic metastasis. Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox proportional hazard model were used for analysis.Results:The median survival time of our patients was no more than 15 months, suggesting that patients with 30 or more tumor nodules may be regarded as a progressive subgroup showing poorer prognosis. In multivariate analysis, presence of between 30 and 59 tumor nodules (P = 0.002), male gender (P = 0.002), lower total bilirubin (total bilirubin Conclusions:In HCC patients with 30 or more tumor nodules, TACE as an initial therapy may be correlated with better prognosis. Sorafenib administration after the prior transarterial treatment may improve antitumor efficacy.
