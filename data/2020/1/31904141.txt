As a specific inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases, okadaic acid (OA) has been found to be a tumor promoter. However, whether OA plays a role in metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been well elucidated. In this study, Hep3B and HepG2 cells were treated with different doses of OA and the cell viability was determined by CCK8 test. As a result, Hep3B and HepG2 cells showed no obvious cytotoxicity after OA treatment below 20 or 25 nM for 12 or 24 hours. However, wound healing, invasion, and migration abilities of HCC cells were significantly enhanced in the OA-treated groups than those of the control group (P
