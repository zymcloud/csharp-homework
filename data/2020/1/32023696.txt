Objective: To investigate the risk factors for diagnosis of transformation of high-grade dysplastic nodules (HGDN) to hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic liver disease with gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: 2 037 cases that underwent gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging from January 2012 to December 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. 51 cases of HGDN with a background of chronic liver disease were screened and followed-up for at least 2 times with gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI scans and contrast enhanced CT scans was performed within 1 month before and after the first MRI. The endpoint of study was transformation of HGDN to hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma, with a deadline of April 2019. Transformation was divided into transformed (group A) and untransformed (group B) group according to the presence or absence of hypervascularization. Linear regression was used to analyze the possible risk factors for hypervascular transformation. Results: There were 36 nodules in group A and 79 nodules in group B, and hypervascular transformation rate was 31.3% (36/115). On univariate analysis, the length and diameter of nodule was > 10.2 mm (P = 0.034), with annual growth rate > 2% (P < 0.001), and lipid content (P = 0.007) was related to the occurrence of hypervascularity. On multivariate analysis, the annual growth rate of nodules was an independent risk factor for the occurrence of hypervascularity (P < 0.000 1). Conclusion: The annual growth rate of HGDN in patients with chronic liver disease diagnosed with gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI imaging can be used as a potential predictor of hypervascularization.
