Purpose:To compare the diagnostic value of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and intravoxel incoherent motion metrics in discriminating histologic grades of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.Methods:117 chronic HBV patients with 120 pathologically confirmed HCCs after surgical resection or liver transplantation were enrolled in this retrospective study. Diffusion-weighted imaging was performed using eleven b values (0-1500 s/mm2) and two b values (0, 800 s/mm2) successively on a 3.0 T system. ADC0, 800, ADCtotal, diffusion coefficient (D), pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*), and perfusion fraction (f) were calculated. The parameters of three histologically differentiated subtypes were investigated using Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman rank correlation, and receiver-operating characteristic analysis. Interobserver agreement was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient.Results:There was excellent agreement for ADCtotal/D/f, good agreement for ADC0,800, and moderate agreement for D*. ADCtotal, ADC0, 800,D, and f were significantly different for well, moderately, and poorly differentiated HCCs (P < 0.001), and they were all inversely correlated with histologic grades: r = - 0.633, - 0.394, - 0.435, and - 0.358, respectively (P < 0.001). ADCtotal demonstrated higher performance than ADC0,800 in diagnosing both well and poorly differentiated HCCs (P < 0.001 and P = 0.04, respectively). ADCtotal showed higher performance than D and f in diagnosing well differentiated HCCs (P < 0.001) and similar performance in diagnosing poorly differentiated HCCs (P = 0.06 and 0.13, respectively).Conclusions:ADCtotal showed better diagnostic performance than ADC0,800, D, and f to discriminate histologic grades of HCC.
