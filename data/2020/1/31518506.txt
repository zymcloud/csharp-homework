This study analyzed risk factors for anxiety and depression in 714 patients who received surgery for endometrial cancer. Our data indicate that the incidence of postoperative anxiety and depression in 714 patients with endometrial cancer was 15.55% and 32.77%, respectively. Univariate and logistic regression analysis showed postoperative pain (odds ratio (OR) = 3.166, P = 0.000) and combined liver disease (OR = 2.318, P = 0.001) were independent risk factors for postoperative anxiety. Additionally, CD4+/CD8+ (OR = 0.513, P = 0.042) and natural killer (NK) cell ratios (OR = 0.692, P = 0.021) were independent protective factors for postoperative anxiety. As for depression, low literacy (OR = 1.943, P = 0.042), postoperative pain (OR = 2.671, P = 0.001), high clinical stage (OR = 3.469, P = 0.009), and combined liver disease (OR = 4.865, P = 0.000) were independent risk factors for postoperative depression. CD4+/CD8+ (OR = 0.628, P = 0.002) and NK cell ratio (OR = 0.710, P = 0.013) were independent protective factors for postoperative depression. In conclusion, patients with endometrial cancer have a higher incidence of postoperative anxiety and depression where postoperative pain, liver disease, and decreased immune function are risk factors for both anxiety and depression in these patients.
