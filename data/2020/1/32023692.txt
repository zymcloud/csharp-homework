Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) currently holds the second position for cause of cancer-related deaths in China. Most of the pathogenic characteristics of HCC in China follow the tri-step model of hepatitis B-cirrhosis-liver cancer. The screening of precancerous lesions of stomach cancer, colorectal cancer and cervical cancer has achieved remarkable results for the diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors. Dysplastic nodules in the state of cirrhosis have strong potential for malignant changes, especially high-grade dysplastic nodules, have extremely high canceration rate. This expert consensus is based on the research results and clinical experience of foreign and native experts of this field. Furthermore, this consensus summarizes and defines high-grade dysplastic nodules of the liver as precancerous lesions of HCC through multidisciplinary collaboration in terms of conception, screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, with the aim to reduce the HCC incidence and improve the overall therapeutic effect of HCC in China.
