Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth most common primary liver tumor and is an important medical problem worldwide. However, the use of current therapies for HCC is no possible to be cured, and despite numerous attempts and clinical trials, there are not so many approved targeted treatments for HCC. So, it is necessary to identify additional treatment strategies to prevent the growth of HCC tumors. We are looking for a systematic drug repositioning bioinformatics method to identify new drug candidates for the treatment of HCC, which considers not only aberrant genomic information, but also the changes of transcriptional landscapes. First, we screen the collection of HCC feature genes, i.e., kernel genes, which frequently mutated in most samples of HCC based on human mutation data. Then, the gene expression data of HCC in TCGA are combined to classify the kernel genes of HCC. Finally, the therapeutic score (TS) of each drug is calculated based on the kolmogorov-smirnov statistical method. Using this strategy, we identify five drugs that associated with HCC, including three drugs that could treat HCC and two drugs that might have side-effect on HCC. In addition, we also make Connectivity Map (CMap) profiles similarity analysis and KEGG enrichment analysis on drug targets. All these findings suggest that our approach is effective for accurate predicting novel therapeutic options for HCC and easily to be extended to other tumors.
