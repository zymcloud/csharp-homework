Purpose:The goal of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of the transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in combination with apatinib or TACE treatment alone in patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 82 patients with large HCC were consecutively enrolled between January 2016 and December 2017. Of the 82 patients, 34 underwent the combined treatment, while 48 underwent TACE alone. The treatment response was assessed at first month and third month after TACE therapy, and the survival rate at median follow-up time was also compared between the two treatment groups. Furthermore, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and treatment-related complications were assessed and compared.Results:Patients treated with TACE + apatinib presented with better objective response rate and disease control rate compared to those who only underwent TACE. Median OS as well as median PFS was longer in the TACE plus apatinib group compared to the TACE alone group. Multivariate Cox's regression analysis further illustrated that TACE plus apatinib compared to TACE alone was an independent protective factor for PFS and OS.Conclusion:TACE combined with apatinib is a safe and promising treatment approach for patients with large HCC.
