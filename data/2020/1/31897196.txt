Fibrinogen C domain-containing 1 (FIBCD1) is an acetyl-recognition receptor that affects the occurrence and development of certain tumors. However, the prognostic significance of FIBCD1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. This study aimed to explore FIBCD1 expression in HCC and to determine the prognostic value of FIBCD1 in patients with HCC. A total of 1,058 liver tissue samples with detailed and complete clinical information were collected, including 495 HCC samples. Tissue microarray immunohistochemistry analysis was used to evaluate FIBCD1 protein expression in the collected tissues. The Kaplan-Meier plotter online tool was used to investigate the association between FIBCD1 expression and prognosis of patients with HCC. Oncomine and the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis database were used for bioinformatics analysis of FIBCD1. Results showed that FIBCD1 expression was higher in HCC and was associated with tumor diameter (P=0.002), tumor number (P=0.001), tumor node metastasis stage (P
