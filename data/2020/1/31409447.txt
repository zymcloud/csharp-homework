Introduction:Macrovascular invasion (MVI) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a very poor prognostic factor. Treatment in such cases is still a matter of debate. The goal of this study is to assess short- and long-term results of liver resection and thrombectomy in a series of patients with HCC and MVI.Methods:Retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent liver resection for HCC in the period 2007-2015 (n=120). Of all the patients, 108 did not have MVI, while 12 presented with MVI: 1patient in the common portal vein (Vp4), 8patients in first-order portal branches (Vp3), 1patient in a sectorial branch (Vp2), 1patient in a segmental branch (Vp1); another patient presented with tumor thrombus in a main hepatic venous branch in the confluence with the vena cava (Vv2).Results:Patients with MVI needed major hepatic resection more frequently than patients without MVI (83.3% vs 25.9%, PConclusions:Hepatectomy associated with thrombectomy might be justified in a selected group of patients with HCC and MVI, offering a potential benefit in survival with acceptable morbidity.
