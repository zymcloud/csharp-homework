Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is gaining ever-increasing acceptance in the preoperative and postoperative evaluation of liver-transplanted patients. While indications are still a matter of research, CEUS is used in tertiary centers to supplement ultrasound (US) and Color Doppler US examination, with the potential of providing a comprehensive first-line ultrasound-based diagnosis. Alternatively, CEUS is used as a problem-solving tool when previous cross-sectional or US imaging was inconclusive, especially in assessing hepatocellular carcinoma, parenchymal perfusion abnormalities, the vascular status, and even the biliary tree. This review describes the potential use for CEUS in the setting of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).
