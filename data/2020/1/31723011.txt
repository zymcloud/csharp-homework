Pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) is a direct transcription product of hepatitis B virus (HBV) covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), and it plays important roles in viral genome amplification and replication. This study was designed to investigate whether serum pgRNA is a strong alternative marker for reflecting HBV cccDNA levels and to analyze the correlation between serum pgRNA, serum HBV DNA, and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). A total of 400 HBV-infected patients who received nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) therapy with different clinical outcomes were involved in this research. Case groups included asymptomatic hepatitis B virus carrier (ASC), chronic hepatitis B (CHB), liver cirrhosis (LC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, with 100 patients in each group. The results showed that the levels of HBV pgRNA had significant differences between these 4 groups. Serum pgRNA levels correlated well with serum HBV DNA and HBsAg levels (HBV pgRNA levels versus HBV DNA levels, r = 0.58, P < 0.001; HBV pgRNA levels versus HBsAg levels, r = 0.47, P < 0.001). In addition, we focused on the 108 HBV-infected patients with HBV DNA levels of <500 IU/ml; it was surprising to find that in 17.57% (13/74) of cases, HBV pgRNA could be detected even when the HBV DNA level was below 20 IU/ml. In conclusion, HBV pgRNA levels in serum can be a surrogate marker for intrahepatic HBV cccDNA compared with serum HBV DNA and HBsAg. The detection of serum HBV pgRNA levels may provide a reference for clinical monitoring of cccDNA levels and the selection of appropriate timing for discontinuing antiviral therapy, especially when HBV DNA levels are below the detection limit.
