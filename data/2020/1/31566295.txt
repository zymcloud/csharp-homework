Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most frequent primary tumour of the liver. Although often associated with chronic liver disease, it can also occur in non-cirrhotic livers. The aim of this study was to describe post-operative morbidity (POM), and survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in non-cirrhotic liver treated surgically, and to identify variables associated with prognosis.Methods:Case series of patients who underwent surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma in non-cirrhotic liver at Clínica RedSalud Mayor de Temuco, Chile (2001-2017), were studied. The minimum follow-up time considered was 12 months. Principal outcomes were development of POM and survival. Other variables of interest were age, sex, tumour diameter, surgical time, hospital stay, follow-up time, need for surgical re-intervention, mortality, vascular and lymph node invasion and staging. Descriptive and analytic statistics were calculated.Results:A total of 32 patients were studied. They were characterized by a mean age of 67.3 ± 7.2 years, 62.5% of whom were men. Averages of tumour diameter, surgical time and hospitalization were 12.0 ± 2.6 cm, 114.4 ± 32.3 min and 7.2 ± 2.9 days, respectively. POM was 31.3%. There was no mortality and there were no re-interventions. The overall actuarial survival at 1, 2 and 3 years was 96.8%, 73.4% and 17.3%, respectively. Lower survival was verified in patients with vascular invasion, lymph node infiltration and stages III and IVa.Conclusion:Despite the tumour diameter and extent of the resections, POM in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in non-cirrhotic liver is moderate. However, its prognosis is poor. Vascular invasion, lymph node invasion and advances stages were associated with worse survival.
