Objective:Assess the risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infection in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Methods:Retrospective cohort study in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink with three cohorts: subjects with T2DM and HBV infection (T2DM+HBV cohort; N = 297), with T2DM without HBV-infection (T2DM cohort; N = 261 865), and with HBV-infection without T2DM (HBV cohort; N = 3630). Primary analyses were performed on the three cohorts and secondary analyses on subcohorts including patients with NAFLD diagnosis code (N = 6599). Case/outcome definitions were formulated with International Classification of Diseases/Read codes/laboratory results and classified using validated algorithms. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) were estimated with a Poisson regression model.Results:When comparing the T2DM+HBV and T2DM cohorts, adjusted IRRs were 14.06 (95% confidence interval: 4.47-44.19) for cirrhosis and 2.83 (1.06-7.55) for HCC. When comparing the T2DM+HBV and HBV cohorts, adjusted IRRs were 0.68 (0.21-2.27) for cirrhosis and 1.39 (0.46-4.20) for HCC. No cirrhosis cases were identified in T2DM+NAFLD+HBV patients; IRs were 16.92/10 000 person-years (12.97-21.69) and 85.24/10 000 person-years (10.32-307.91) in the T2DM+NAFLD and NAFLD+HBV cohorts.Conclusion:HBV-infection increased significantly the risk for cirrhosis among T2DM patients, however, not beyond the expected incremental risk among infected non-T2DM subjects. Our approach to evaluate the role of T2DM/NAFLD and HBV-infection in liver disease progression could be applied to other settings with higher HBV prevalence.
