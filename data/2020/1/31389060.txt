Oxidative/nitrosative stress is proposed to be a critical factor in various diseases, including liver pathologies. Antioxidants derived from medicinal plants have been studied extensively and are relevant to many illnesses, including liver diseases. Several hepatic disorders, such as viral hepatitis and alcoholic or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, involve free radicals/oxidative stress as agents that cause or at least exacerbate liver injury, which can result in chronic liver diseases, such as liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and end-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. In this scenario, nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) appears to be an essential factor to counteract or attenuate oxidative or nitrosative stress in hepatic cells. In fact, a growing body of evidence indicates that Nrf2 plays complex and multicellular roles in hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, hepatocarcinogenesis and regeneration via the induction of its target genes. Inflammation is the most common feature of chronic liver diseases, triggering fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Increasing evidence indicates that Nrf2 counteracts the proinflammatory process by modulating the recruitment of inflammatory cells and inducing the endogenous antioxidant response of the cell. In this review, the interactions between antioxidant and inflammatory molecular pathways are analyzed.
