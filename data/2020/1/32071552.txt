We investigated the role of microRNA (miR)-9 in modulating chemoresistance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. MiR-9 was overexpressed or knocked down in HCC cell lines. Cell viability, cell proliferation, the expression of EIF5A2 and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins were examined. HCC cells overexpressing miR-9 were more sensitive to cisplatin; miR-9 knockdown yielded the opposite result. The in vivo nude mouse HCC xenograft tumors yielded the same results. EIF5A2 was identified as a potential target of miR-9, where miR-9 regulated EIF5A2 expression at mRNA and protein level. EIF5A2 knockdown reversed miR-9 inhibition-mediated cisplatin resistance. Altering miR-9 and EIF5A2 expression changed E-cadherin and vimentin expression. Furthermore, EIF5A2 mediated miR-9 EMT pathway regulation, indicating that miR-9 can enhance cisplatin sensitivity by targeting EIF5A2 and inhibiting the EMT pathway. Targeting miR-9 may be useful for overcoming drug resistance in HCC.
