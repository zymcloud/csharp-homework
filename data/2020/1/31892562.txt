Background/aim:Adiponectin protects from metabolic disease and cancer. Accordingly, serum adiponectin was reduced in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). This hepatoprotective factor was definitely increased in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CRC metastases to the liver are common and the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether serum adiponectin discriminates primary from secondary liver cancers.Materials and methods:Adiponectin was measured by ELISA in the serum of 36 patients with colorectal liver metastases, 32 patients with HCC and 49 patients without cancer.Results:Serum adiponectin levels were higher in cancer than non-tumor patients. Adiponectin was not related to TNM stage in HCC nor to the levels of serum tumor markers. Moreover, hepatic inflammation and liver fibrosis were not correlated with serum adiponectin levels. Metabolic diseases are associated with low adiponectin and a higher risk of cancer. In HCC, but not in CRC serum, adiponectin was increased in patients with hypertension and hyperuricemia. In this cohort, adiponectin positively correlated with chemerin, an adipokine supposed to contribute to metabolic disturbances.Conclusion:Serum adiponectin cannot discriminate primary from secondary liver tumors.
Hypertension; chemerin; fibrosis; tumor marker.
