Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), a mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus spp., was proved as one of the major causes of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when chronically consumed. An efflux of AFB1 was reported to be associated with breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) whose activity could also be modulated by green tea catechins. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to examine the impacts of green tea catechins on BCRP activity in Caco-2 cells by H33342 (bis-benzamide, BCRP substrate) accumulation and AFB1 efflux. Results showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) of AFB1 in the efflux ratio following the incubation with Ko143, a specific BCRP inhibitor, and sodium fluoride, confirming the association of BCRP in AFB1 efflux transport across the cells. Pre-incubation with green tea and gallate catechins (ECG and EGCG) significantly reduced the efflux ratio of AFB1 (p < 0.05) and significantly increased the intracellular H33342 substrate (p < 0.05) in Caco-2 cells, clearly indicating the inhibitory effects of green tea and gallate catechins on BCRP function. Further study on H33342 accumulation revealed a dose-dependent increment of intracellular H33342 when co-administered with increasing concentrations of AFB1. This result implied a possible role of AFB1 as a BCRP competitive inhibitor. The findings from this study concluded the roles of BCRP as an efflux transporter for AFB1 and could be modulated by the exposure of green tea catechins. Owing to a reduction of its efflux, an inhibitory effect of BCRP when pre-exposed with green tea catechins could be crucial for AFB1 cellular accumulation.
