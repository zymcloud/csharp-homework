It has been reported that miR-623 is deregulated in lung adenocarcinoma and inhibits tumor growth and invasion. However, it is unclear whether miR-623 has a role in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Herein, we found that miR-623 was significantly downregulated in HCC, and that its expression was related to poor clinical outcomes of patients with HCC. Upregulation of miR-623 decreased cell proliferation, viability, migration, and invasion and further promoted apoptosis in 7721, Huh7, and Bel-7402 cells. Moreover, we also observed that miR-623 regulated the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt), Wnt/β-catenin, and extracellular regulated protein kinases/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (ERK/JNK) signaling pathways as well as the expression level of related proteins. Further, X-ray repair cross complementing 5 (XRCC5) was a direct target for miR-623, and the suppression of PI3K/Akt, Wnt/β-catenin, and ERK/JNK signaling pathways and cell proliferation and invasion abilities caused by miR-623 in HCC cells was significantly reversed by the upregulation of XRCC5. Collectively, our data suggested that miR-623 suppressed the progression of HCC by regulating the PI3K/Akt, Wnt/β-catenin, and ERK/JNK pathways by targeting XRCC5 in HCC in vitro, indicating that miR-623 may be a target for the therapy of HCC.
