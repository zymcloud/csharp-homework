An oncogenic role, p21-activated kinase 5 (PAK5), has proven as a significant mediator for many cellular progression, which is expressed highly in human organs such as lung, liver, kidney, blood vessels endothelial cells and inflammatory cells. PAK5 was primitively detected in the cerebrum and accelerated the filopodia formation in neurocytes. It can reverse the effect of Rho and adjust its activity to mediate maintenance and development of nerve axon by binding with Cdc42-GTP. Moreover, PAK5 has been suggested to mediate protean, multitudinous and inscrutable functions in cancer. Currently, many researches indicated that PAK5 was dysregulated in ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, melanoma, osteosarcoma, renal carcinoma, breast cancer, gastric cancer and so on, which was involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion. This review focuses the latest knowledge on the structure, expression, signalling pathway of PAK5, emphasizing its function in cancer.
