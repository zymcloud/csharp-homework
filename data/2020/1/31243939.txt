Background/aims:To investigate whether serum Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive human Mac-2-binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) can predict the recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative resection.Methods:Patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) who underwent curative resection for HCC between 2004 and 2015 were eligible for the study. Recurrence was sub-classified as early (Results:A total of 170 patients with CHB were selected. During the follow-up period (median, 22.6 months), 64 (37.6%) patients developed recurrence. In multivariate analyses, WFA+-M2BP level was an independent predictor of overall (hazard ratio [HR]=1.490), early (HR=1.667), and late recurrence (HR=1.416), together with male sex, des-gamma carboxyprothrombin level, maximal tumor size, portal vein invasion, and satellite nodules (all P2.14 experienced recurrence more frequently than those with a WFA+-M2BP level ≤2.14 (P=0.011 by log-rank test), and had poorer postoperative outcomes than those with a WFA+-M2BP level ≤2.14 in terms of overall recurrence (56.0 vs. 34.5%, P=0.047) and early recurrence (52.0 vs. 20.7%, P=0.001).Conclusion:WFA+-M2BP level is an independent predictive factor of HBV-related HCC recurrence after curative resection. Further studies should investigate incorporation of WFA+-M2BP level into tailored postoperative surveillance strategies for patients with CHB.
