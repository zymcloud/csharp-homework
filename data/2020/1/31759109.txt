Fisogatinib (BLU-554) is a highly selective and potent oral fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) inhibitor currently in Phase I clinical trials for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using (male) genetically modified mouse models, we investigated the roles of the multidrug efflux transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2, the OATP1A/1B uptake transporters, and the drug-metabolizing CYP3A complex in fisogatinib pharmacokinetics. In vitro, fisogatinib was modestly transported by hABCB1. Upon oral administration of 10 mg/kg fisogatinib, its brain accumulation was substantially increased in Abcb1a/1b-/- (6.3-fold) and Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2-/- mice (7.2-fold) compared to wild-type mice, but not in single Abcg2-/- mice. The oral plasma pharmacokinetics and liver distribution of fisogatinib were not significantly affected by the absence of Oatp1a/1b drug uptake transporters. We further found that plasma exposure of fisogatinib in Cyp3a-/- mice increased by 1.4-fold, and was subsequently 1.6-fold decreased upon transgenic overexpression of human CYP3A4 in liver and intestine. However, the relative tissue distribution of fisogatinib remained unaltered. In summary, in mice, fisogatinib brain accumulation is substantially limited by ABCB1 P-glycoprotein in the blood-brain barrier, and oral availability of fisogatinib is markedly restricted by CYP3A activity. The obtained insights may be useful for optimizing the clinical efficacy and safety of fisogatinib.
