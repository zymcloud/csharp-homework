Background:Tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 3 gene (TNFAIP3, also called A20) haploinsufficiency (HA20) leads to autoinflammation and autoimmunity. We have recently shown that a p.(Lys91*) mutation in A20 disrupts nuclear factor κB signaling, impairs protein-protein interactions of A20, and leads to inflammasome activation.Methods:We now describe the clinical presentations and drug responses in a family with HA20 p.(Lys91*) mutation, consistent with our previously reported diverse immunological and functional findings.Results:We report for the first time that inflammasome-mediated autoinflammatory lung reaction caused by HA20 can be treated with interleukin 1 antagonist anakinra. We also describe severe anemia related to HA20 successfully treated with mycophenolate. In addition, HA20 p.(Lys91*) was found to associate with autoimmune thyroid disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis, liver disease, and immunodeficiency presenting with specific antibody deficiency and genital papillomatosis.Conclusions:We conclude that HA20 may lead to combination of inflammation, immunodeficiency, and autoimmunity. The condition may present with variable and unpredictable symptoms with atypical treatment responses.
