<b>Background/Aims:</b> The National Liver Cancer Surveillance Program (NLCSP) was established in 2003 to reduce the socioeconomic burden imposed by liver cancer (LC). We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the NLCSP in South Korea with respect to survival benefits and cost, after adjusting for various confounding factors. <b>Methods:</b> We used the National Health Insurance Service claims data linked with the NLCSP from 2004 to 2015. The Cox proportional hazard model and generalized linear model were used to determine the effects of the NLCSP on the early detection of LC, survival, and medical costs. <b>Results:</b> From 2006 to 2010, 66,632 patients (surveillance group: 10,527 and no surveillance group: 56,105) newly diagnosed with LC were included in the study. The odds of the early detection of LC was 1.82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.73 to 1.93) times higher among patients who participated in the NLCSP once within the 2-year period prior to the diagnosis of LC than among those who did not participate in the surveillance program. The mortality rate of patients who participated in the NLCSP was 22.0% lower (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.80) than that of those who did not participate. When compared with the group who did not participate in surveillance, the group who participated in the NLCSP had higher total medical costs; however, their cost per day was lower after adjustment during the follow-up period. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study highlights the survival benefit in patients who participated in the NLCSP and the need for continuous improvements of the NLCSP in South Korea.
