Current estimates indicate that hepatocarcinoma is the leading cause of death globally. There is interest in utilizing nanomedicine for cancer therapy to overcome side effects of chemo-interventions. Ribavirin, an antiviral nucleoside inhibitor, accumulates inside red blood cells, causing anemia. Its analog, viramidine, can concentrate within hepatocytes and spare red blood cells, thus limiting anemia. Hepatocarcinoma cells have a large number of asialoglycoprotein receptors on their membranes that can bind galactosyl-terminating solid lipid nanoparticles (Gal-SLN) and internalize them. Here, viramidine, 5-fluorouracil, and paclitaxel-loaded Gal-SLN were characterized inside cells. Cytotoxicities of free-drug, nano-void, and drug-loaded Gal-SLN were evaluated using HepG2 cells; over 3 days, cell viability was measured. To test the mechanistic pathway, we investigated in vitro apoptosis using flow cytometry and in ovo angiogenesis using the CAM assay. Results showed that 1 and 2 Î¼M of the viramidine-encapsulated Gal-SLN had the highest cytotoxic effect, achieving 80% cell death with a steady increase over 3 days, with induction of apoptosis and reduction of necrosis and angiogenesis, compared to free-drugs. Gal-SLN application on breast cancer MCF-7 cells confirmed its specificity against liver cancer HepG2 cells. We conclude that viramidine-encapsulated Gal-SLN has anticancer and anti-angiogenic activities against hepatocarcinoma.
