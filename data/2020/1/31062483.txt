Background:Hypervascular hyperplastic nodules (HHNs) occasionally develop in patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC) and show arterial enhancement, thus mimicking hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Importantly, HHN as a benign lesion should be distinguished from HCC.Purpose:To evaluate the value of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI (Gd-EOB-MRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in distinguishing HHN from small (Study type:Retrospective case-control study.Field strength/sequence:3.0T/in- and out-of-phase, T1 -weighted, T2 -weighted, diffusion-weighted, apparent diffusion coefficient, and dynamic gadoxetic acid-enhanced images.Population:Among 560 patients with ALC who underwent Gd-EOB-MRI and DWI, 12 patients with 28 HHNs and 22 patients with 29 hHCCs smaller than 3 cm were included.Assessment:The following MRI features were evaluated by three independent radiologists: signal intensity (SI) on T1 -weighted, T2 -weighted, diffusion-weighted, and hepatobiliary phase (HBP) images; shape, homogeneity, and margin on HBP; diffusion restriction; intralesional fat; necrosis; hemorrhage; washout on portal venous phase (PVP) and/or transitional phase (TP); and capsular enhancement. Quantitative analysis was also conducted.Statistical tests:Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the significant MRI findings, and their diagnostic performance for the prediction of HHN was analyzed.Results:Lesion size of â‰¤16 mm (odds ratio [OR], 24.41; P = 0.007), low-to-iso SI on DWI (OR, 26.92; P = 0.007), and absence of washout on PVP and/or TP (OR, 31.84; P = 0.009) were significant independent factors for predicting HHN. When all three criteria were satisfied, the specificity was 100%. Compared with hHCCs, HHNs showed significantly smaller size (mean, 13.8 mm vs. 19.9 mm; P Data conclusion:Gd-EOB-MRI and DWI may be helpful in differentiating HHN from small hHCC in patients with ALC.Level of evidence:3 Technical Efficacy Stage: 2 J.
