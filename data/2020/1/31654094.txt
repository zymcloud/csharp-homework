Objective and design:To determine whether inflammatory hepatocytes may constitute primary targets for ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, its effects towards expression of hepatic acute-phase proteins, especially C-reactive protein (CRP), were assessed.Materials:Ruxolitinib effects were analysed in primary human hepatocytes and human hepatoma HepaRG cells exposed to various inflammatory stimuli.Results:Ruxolitinib was found to fully inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced CRP secretion and mRNA expression, at concentrations (IC50 = 12.9 nM) achievable in human blood. It similarly repressed CRP up-regulation due to several Toll-like receptor agonists or pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL) 1β, IL6 and tumour necrosis factor α] and counteracted LPS-mediated induction of serum amyloid A, fibrinogen, haptoglobin and serpin. Ruxolitinib was additionally found to block the activation of the IL6/JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway triggered by LPS and whose inhibition by the neutralizing anti-IL6 receptor antibody tocilizumab prevented CRP induction.Conclusion:Ruxolitinib can potently repress induction of CRP in inflammatory human hepatocytes, most likely through targeting the IL6/JAK/STAT signalling cascade. Hepatic production of acute-phase proteins during liver inflammation may, therefore, constitute a target for ruxolitinib.
