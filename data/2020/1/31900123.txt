Background:Liquid biopsies of blood plasma cell free DNA can be used to monitor treatment response and potentially detect mutations that are present in resistant clones in metastatic cancer patients.Case presentation:In our non-interventional liquid biopsy study, a male patient in his fifties diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer and polytope liver metastases rapidly progressed after completing chemotherapy and deceased 8 months after diagnosis. Retrospective cell free DNA testing showed that the APC/TP53/KRAS major clone responded quickly after 3 cycles of FOLFIRI + Bevacizumab. Retrospective exome sequencing of pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy tissue samples including metastases confirmed that the APC/TP53/KRAS and other major clonal mutations (GPR50, SLC5A, ZIC3, SF3A1 and others) were present in all samples. After the last chemotherapy cycle, CT imaging, CEA and CA19-9 markers validated the cfDNA findings of treatment response. However, 5 weeks later, the tumour had rapidly progressed.Conclusion:As FOLFIRI+Bevacizumab has recently also been associated with sustained complete remission in a APC/TP53/KRAS triple-mutated patient, these driver genes should be tested and monitored in a more in-depth manner in future patients. Patients with metastatic disease should be monitored more closely during and after chemotherapy, ideally using cfDNA.
