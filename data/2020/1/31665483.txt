Backgrounds:The incidence of acute kidney injury and the association between acute kidney injury and prognosis have been reported about transcatheter arterial chemoembolization using anthracycline. However, the incidence of acute kidney injury after platinum-based transarterial chemoembolization or transarterial infusion chemotherapy remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate association between acute kidney injury after platinum-based transcatheter arterial chemoembolization/transarterial infusion chemotherapy and prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:We retrospectively analysed 270 sessions in 129 patients who underwent platinum-based transcatheter arterial chemoembolization/transarterial infusion chemotherapy. Acute kidney injury was diagnosed according to the criteria established by the International Club of Ascites. The incidence of acute kidney injury, risk factors for serum creatinine elevation and association between acute kidney injury and prognosis were assessed.Results:Fifteen cases of acute kidney injury (5.6%, 15/270) developed in 14 patients (10.8%, 14/129). Ascites (coefficient: 0.059, P = 0.006), low estimated glomerular filtration rate (coefficient: -0.008, P = 0.029), diabetes (coefficient: 0.072, P Conclusions:The incidence of acute kidney injury after platinum-based transcatheter arterial chemoembolization/transarterial infusion chemotherapy was consistent with that after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization using anthracycline, and the development of acute kidney injury was associated with poor prognosis. Ascites, diabetes, low estimated glomerular filtration rate and high albumin-bilirubin grade were risk factors for serum creatinine elevation after platinum-based transcatheter arterial chemoembolization/transarterial infusion chemotherapy.
