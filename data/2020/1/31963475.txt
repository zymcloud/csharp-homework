The ketogenic diet (KD) is a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat, and adequate-protein diet that induces many metabolic adaptations when calorie intake is not limited. Its therapeutic use in a range of diseases including cancer is currently being investigated. Our objective was to firstly assess the impact of a 6-week non-energy-restricted KD on the abdominal fat distribution and the hepatic fat composition in healthy adults. Body fat distribution and composition were measured by comparing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) results with air displacement plethysmography (ADP) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measurements. A total of 12 subjects from the KetoPerformance study were recruited for this ancillary study. Body mass index (BMI), total mass, total fat mass, total subcutaneous mass, and subcutaneous fat mass decreased significantly. None of the MRS parameters showed a significant change during the study. Even though the average change in body weight was >2kg, no significant changes in intrahepatic lipid (IHL) content could be observed. Total fat mass and total fat-free mass derived from MRI has a strong correlation with the corresponding values derived from BIA and ADP data. BMI and the absolute fat parameter of all three modalities decreased, but there were no or only minor changes regarding the fat-free parameter. Magnetic resonance imaging provides body composition information on abdominal fat distribution changes during a ketogenic diet. This information is complementary to anthropomorphic and laboratory measures and is more detailed than the information provided by ADP and BIA measures. It was shown that there was no significant change in internal fat distribution, but there was a decrease in subcutaneous fat.
