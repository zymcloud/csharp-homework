Aims:To establish and define a new, not previously reported hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) variant, termed fibronodular HCC (FN-HCC).Methods:We retrospectively reviewed 290 HCC cases and identified 29 FN-HCC and 24 scirrhous HCC (SCHCC). Clinical, pathological and radiological features of FN-HCC were reviewed and compared with 30 conventional HCCs (CV-HCC) and SC-HCC.Results:FN-HCCs were more likely to arise in non-advanced fibrotic livers with lower advanced Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage, had lower rates of progression and longer time to progression and were more likely to be surgically resected compared with CV-HCCs and SC-HCCs. Imaging analysis of FN-HCCs demonstrated higher rates of non-peripheral washout and a new distinct pattern of enhancement which is characterised by the presence of multiple rounded nodules within a lesion embedded in fibrotic-appearing parenchyma.Conclusions:FN-HCC may represent a specific variant of HCC with distinct pathological, radiological and clinical features with potential ramifications for outcome.
