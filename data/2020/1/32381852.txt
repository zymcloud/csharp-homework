Recently, the choices of treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)were increasing since the several molecular targeting agents(MTA)were approved for treatment of advanced HCC patients. On the other hand, the transarterial chemoembolization( TACE)and hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy(HAIC)have been improved by various kinds of methods. The liver resection, radiofrequency ablation(RFA)and microwave coagulation(MWA)might achieve complete cure. However, the treatment indication of liver resection, RFA and MWA should be limited. Therefore, multidisciplinary treatment including HAIC, TACE, MTA, RFA, MWA, and liver resection should be considered to control HCC.
