She was found to have multiple metastatic lesions in the liver noted on imaging and underwent workup for malignancy of unknown origin. The initial differential diagnoses included gastrointestinal, urothelial, genital, or breast primary sites. The cervical biopsy results were consistent with large cell neuroendocrine tumor, and the patient was subsequently started on chemotherapy.
