Background/aims:We systematically evaluated the clinical characteristics, prevalence of cirrhosis, and mode of detection in virus-unrelated (non-B non-C, NBNC) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in Korea.Methods:A total of 447 consecutive treatment-na√Øve NBNC-HCC adult patients who were registered at the Samsung Medical Center HCC registry in Korea from 2010 to 2013 were analyzed. NBNC was defined as negative hepatitis B surface antigen and negative anti-hepatitis C virus antibody. Presence of cirrhosis was determined based on histological, radiological, endoscopic, and serologic results. Mode of detection was classified as either under surveillance, incidental, or symptomatic.Results:Heavy alcohol use was the most common potential etiology in NBNCHCC (NBNC-A, alcohol) (59.7%). Ten patients had other identifiable causes (NBNC-O, other identifiable cause) such as autoimmune hepatitis. The rest (38.0%) had no-identifiable cause (NBNC-NA-NO, non-alcohol, no-other identifiable cause). In NBNC-NA-NO group, 83.5% (96/115) of patients with available hepatitis B core immunoglobulin G antibody (HBcIgG) showed HBcIgG positivity, and 80.6% (137/170) had metabolic risk factors (diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and/ or dyslipidemia). Cirrhosis was present in 90.0%, 70.4%, and 60.0% of NBNC-O, NBNC-A, and NBNC-NA-NO patients, respectively. The proportion of patients diagnosed under surveillance was 25.5% across all patients, with specific proportions being 80.0%, 27.7%, and 18.8% for NBNC-O, NBNC-A, and NBNC-NA-NO, respectively.Conclusion:Among NBNC-HCC patients, heavy alcohol use or any other identifiable cause was not found in 38.0%. These NBNC-NA-NO HCC patients showed a high prevalence of HBcIgG positivity and metabolic risk factors, suggesting that prior hepatitis B virus infection and metabolic risk factors may be major contributing factors in the hepatocarcinogenesis in NBNC-NA-NO patients.
