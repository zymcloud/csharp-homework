Objectives:Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) prevalence, particularly the subset with advanced liver disease, is not well defined. Herein, we aim to provide a comprehensive assessment of ALD epidemiology across the spectrum of disease severity and across different settings using 3 unique US databases.Methods:We performed a retrospective, observational study of US adults with ALD using 2001-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2007-2014 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), and 2007-2017 United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry. ALD in the NHANES was defined using clinical laboratory data and self-reported alcohol use, among which fibrosis-4 score of >2.67 defined stage ≥3 fibrosis. Alcoholic cirrhosis (AC) in the NIS was identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. ALD in the UNOS was identified using UNOS coding.Results:From 2001-2002 to 2015-2016, the overall weighted ALD prevalence was stable from 8.8% to 8.1% (P = 0.102), whereas the proportion of ALD with stage ≥3 fibrosis increased from 2.2% (95% CI: 0.4-4.0) to 6.6% (95% CI: 2.0-9.9; P = 0.007) (NHANES). From 2007 to 2014, the number of hospitalizations among patients with AC per 1,000 increased by 32.8%, and the proportion of hospitalizations among the patients with AC with ≥3 cirrhosis complications increased from 11.6% in 2007 to 25.8% in 2014 (Ptrend Discussion:Among these 3 US databases, consistent observations of increasing ALD severity emphasize the urgent need for greater awareness about the consequences of unhealthy alcohol use and interventions aimed specifically at addressing alcohol use disorders.
