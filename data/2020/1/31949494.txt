Objective: The goal of our current study is to assess the immunohistochemical of p53, p21, nm23, and VEGF expression in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis after hepatectomy, as well as the prospective molecular mechanisms of prognostic indicator. Methods: There were 419 HBV-related HCC patients who were from southern China of Guangxi province and were used to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression for these biomarkers in prognosis. A genome-wide expression microarray dataset of HBV-related HCC were obtained from GSE14520. Results: In our study, the expression of p53, p21, and nm23 in cancer tissues of patients with hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma did not affected the clinical outcome of 2 years, 5 years or overall. Patients with high expression of VEGF had a worse overall survival after 2 years of surgery than patients with low expression (adjusted P=0.040, adjusted HR = 1.652, 95% CI = 1.024-2.665). Survival analysis of VEGF in GSE14520 cohort also demonstrated that VEGF mRNA expression also significantly associated with HBV-related HCC OS (adjusted P=0.035, adjusted HR =1.651, 95% CI =1.035-2.634). The prospective molecular mechanisms by co-expression analysis suggested that VEGF might be correlated to regulation of cell proliferation, cell growth and apoptotic process, Rap1 signaling pathway, HIF-1 signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, cell cycle. Whereas the GSEA suggested that VEGF might involve in the regulation of HIF and HIF1A pathway, and TP53 regulation pathway. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that VEGF might be a prognostic indicator of HBV-related HCC, and we also identified the VEGF prospective molecular mechanisms through the whole genome co-expression and GSEA approaches.
