Background:Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a universal problem and its epidemiological data showed variation from place to place. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth and fourth common cancer in worldwide and Egypt, respectively. Egypt ranks the third and 15th most populous country in Africa and worldwide, respectively. The aim of this review is to compare the status of HCC in Egypt to that in the worldwide from different issues; risk factors, screening and surveillance, diagnosis and treatment, prevention, as well as research strategy.Main body:The risk factors for HCC in Egypt are of great importance to be reported. The risk factor for HCC are either environmental- or host/genetic-related risk factors. In the last years, there is a tangible improvement of both screening and surveillance strategies of HCC in Egypt. The unprecedented national screening campaign launched by the end of 2018 is a mirror image of this improvement. While the improvement of the HCC prevention requires the governmental health administration to implement health policies. Although the diagnosis of Egyptian HCC patients follows the international guidelines but HCC treatment options are limited in terms of cost. In addition, there are limited Egyptian reports about HCC survival and relapse. Both basic and clinical HCC research in Egypt are still limited compared to worldwide.Short conclusion:Deep analysis and understanding of factors affecting HCC burden variation worldwide help in customization of efforts exerted to face HCC in different countries especially large country like Egypt. Overall, the presence of a research strategy to fight HCC in Egyptian patients will help in the optimum allocation of available resources to reduce the numbers of HCC cases and deaths and to improve the quality of life.
