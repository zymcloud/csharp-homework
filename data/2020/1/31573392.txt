Background: Appropriate surgical techniques to control hemorrhage and retain residual liver function are key to treatment success for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to evaluate the clinical application of Glissonean pedicle transection with hepatic vein exclusion (HVE). Materials and Methods: Between April 2013 and December 2015, 50 patients underwent surgical resection for HCC and were randomly allocated to receive Glissonean pedicle transection with HVE (Glisson group, n = 25) or Pringle maneuver with intermittent clamping (Pringle group, n = 25). Intraoperative blood loss, blood transfusion, operation time, positive surgical margins, complications (bile leakage, hemorrhage, and ascites), and hospital stay were compared between groups, along with the alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin (TB) levels at baseline and postoperative days 1, 3, and 7. Results: The operation time and range of hepatic resection were comparable between groups. Although both groups had similar preoperative ALT, AST, and TB levels, these levels on postoperative days 1, 3, and 7 were significantly lower in the Glisson group than in the Pringle group (all P < .01). Compared with the Pringle group, the Glisson group had a significantly lower intraoperative blood loss (P < .001), a lower blood transfusion rate (P = .017), lower incidence rates of postoperative hemorrhage (P = .030) and ascites (P = .024), a lower positive surgical margin rate (P = .017), and a shorter length of hospital stay (P < .001). Conclusions: Glissonean pedicle transection with HVE is a safe, simple, and effective procedure for hepatic resection.
