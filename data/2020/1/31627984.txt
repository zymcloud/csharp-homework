Although interferon (IFN)-based therapy has been shown to reduce hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development once patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection achieve sustained virologic response (SVR), IFN-based therapy is limited by its multiple adverse effects, non-oral administration, and unsatisfactory SVR rate. In recent years, IFN-free all-oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have replaced IFN-based therapy as the standard of care for HCV infection worldwide because of the higher SVR rate and lower incidence of adverse effects. By using currently approved DAA regimens, HCV can be eradicated in more than 95% of infected hosts, regardless of their disease severity. Since 2016, the risk of de novo occurrence or recurrence of HCC in hepatitis C patients receiving DAAs has been debatable because of a report addressing an unexpected high early tumor recurrence rate. To solve this important, interesting, yet controversial issue, we thus reviewed the latest and most relevant articles on this subject and proposed recommendations to manage such patients for healthcare providers.
