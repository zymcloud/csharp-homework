Background/aim:This study compared the dose distributions of carbon ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in patients with locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (LAHCC).Patients and methods:A retrospective analysis was conducted in 10 consecutive patients with LAHCC who had undergone C-ion RT. The dose-volume histogram parameters of clinical plans using C-ion RT at 60 Gy and simulated plans using IMRT at 60 Gy and 50 Gy were compared. We measured the percentage of the normal liver volume that received at least 5 Gy (V5), 10 Gy (V10), 20 Gy (V20), 30 Gy (V30), 40 Gy (V40), and 50 Gy (V50).Results:The V5, V10, V20, and the mean liver dose were significantly lower in patients who received 60 Gy of C-ion RT than in those who received 50 or 60 Gy of IMRT.Conclusion:C-ion RT exhibits a better liver dose distribution than IMRT in patients with LAHCC.
