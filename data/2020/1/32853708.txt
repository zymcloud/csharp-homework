Purpose:Previous reports of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) suggest unacceptably high rates of toxicity in patients with Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) B liver disease. We hypothesized that an individualized adaptive treatment approach based on midtreatment liver function would maintain good local control while limiting toxicity in this population.Methods and materials:Patients with CTP-B liver disease and HCC were treated on prospective trials of individualized adaptive SBRT between 2006 and 2018. Patients underwent pre- and midtreatment liver function assessments using indocyanine green. Treatment-related toxicity was defined as a ≥2-point increase in CTP score from pretreatment within 6 months of treatment. In addition, we performed analyses with a longitudinal model to assess changes in CTP score over 12 months after SBRT.Results:Eighty patients with CTP-B (median tumor size, 2.5 cm) were treated: 37 patients were CTP-B-7, 28 were CTP-B-8, and 15 were CTP-B-9. The median treatment dose was 36 Gy in 3 fractions. One-year local control was 92%. In a multivariate model controlling for tumor size, treatment dose, and baseline CTP score, higher treatment dose was associated with improved freedom from local progression (hazard ratio: 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.94-1.00; P = .04). Eighteen patients (24%) had a ≥2-point increase in CTP score within 6 months of SBRT. In a longitudinal model assessing changes in CTP score over 12 months after SBRT, controlling for baseline CTP and tumor size, increasing mean liver dose was associated with larger increases in CTP score (P = .04).Conclusions:An individualized adaptive treatment approach allows for acceptable toxicity and effective local control in patients with HCC and CTP-B liver disease. Because increasing dose may increase both local control and toxicity, further work is needed to optimize treatment in patients with compromised liver function.
