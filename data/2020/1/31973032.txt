Thyroid hormone (T3) and its receptor (TR) are involved in cell metabolism and cancer progression. Hypothyroidism is associated with significantly elevated risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Levels of the glycoprotein alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) are increased in the majority of patients with HCC and may be useful in diagnosis and follow-up. However, the relationship between T3/TR and AFP levels in HCC is currently unclear. The expression profiles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were compared in microarrays of HepG2-TRÎ±1 cells treated with/without T3 and HCC specimens. The effects of T3 on taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) and AFP expression were validated using qRT-PCR. A correlation between TUG1 and AFP was confirmed via RNAi and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) strategies. Finally, overall and recurrence-free survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and confirmed in online datasets. T3/TR treatment reduced TUG1 expression in vitro, resulting in the downregulation of AFP mRNA. Knockdown of TUG1 suppressed cell cycle progression and soft agar colony formation and induced cellular senescence. Our data support the involvement of TUG1 in the T3/TR-mediated suppression of cell growth. AFP mRNA levels showed strong positive correlations with TUG1 and unfavorable prognosis in patients with non-hepatitis B/non-hepatitis C HCC (NBNC-HCC). T3/TR, TUG1, and AFP may potentially serve as effective prognostic markers for NBNC-HCC.
