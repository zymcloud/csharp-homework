Background/purpose:Effective antiviral-therapy can reduce the risk of liver cirrhosis related hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Yet, the difference of hepatocellular carcinoma development in chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C patients with cirrhosis after effective antiviral therapy treatment is unknown. In this study, We comprehensive explored the difference among them.Methods:1363 patients with cirrhosis and hepatitis B virus treated with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs) with completely suppressed virus, and patients with cirrhosis and hepatitis C virus treated with pegylated interferon (peg-IFN)/ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy who achieved sustained virologic response were enrolled.Results:Total 261 developed hepatocellular carcinoma within a median follow-up of 4.25 years. Univariate analysis, patients developed hepatocellular carcinoma tended to be of older age, and had lower platelet counts, were chronic hepatitis B carriers, and had higher serum alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) (â‰¥20 ng/mL), FIB-4 index and APRI scores. Subsequent multivariate analysis revealed older age, lower platelet counts, high AFP levels and chronic hepatitis B carriers were independent risk factors of hepatocellular carcinoma.Conclusion:Our findings identify that chronic hepatitis B patients were with a higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma compared to chronic hepatitis C patients after achieving virological response. Special attention should be paid to those patients.
