Background:Crosstalk between tumors and their microenvironment plays a crucial role in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, there is little existing information about the key signaling molecule that modulates tumor-stroma crosstalk.Methods:Complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray analysis was performed to identify the key molecule in tumor-stroma crosstalk. Subcutaneous xenograft in vivo murine model, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and real-time polymerase chain reaction using HCC cells and tissues were performed.Results:The key molecule, regenerating gene protein-3A (REG3A), was most significantly enhanced when coculturing HCC cells and activated human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) (+8.2 log) compared with monoculturing HCC cells using cDNA microarray analysis. Downregulation of REG3A using small interfering RNA significantly decreased the proliferation of HSC-cocultured HCC cells in vitro and in vivo, and enhanced deoxycholic acid-induced HCC cell apoptosis. Crosstalk-induced REG3A upregulation was modulated by platelet-derived growth factor ββ (PDGF-ββ) in p42/44-dependent manner. REG3A mRNA levels in human HCC tissues were upregulated 1.8-fold compared with non-tumor tissues and positively correlated with PDGF-ββ levels.Conclusions:REG3A/p42/44 pathway/PDGF-ββ signaling plays a significant role in hepatocarcinogenesis via tumor-stroma crosstalk. Targeting REG3A is a potential novel therapeutic target for the management of HCCs by inhibiting crosstalk between HCC cells and HSCs.
