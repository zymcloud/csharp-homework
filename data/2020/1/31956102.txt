To explore and understand the competitive mechanism of ceRNAs in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), we used bioinformatics analysis methods to construct an ICC-related ceRNA regulatory network (ceRNET), which contained 340 lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships based on the RNA expression datasets in the NCBI GEO database. We identified the core regulatory pathway RP11-328K4.1-hsa-miR-27a-3p-PROS1, which is related to ICC, for further validation by molecular biology assays. GO analysis of 44 differentially expressed mRNAs in ceRNET revealed that they were mainly enriched in biological processes including "negative regulation of epithelial cell proliferation" and "positive regulation of activated T lymphocyte proliferation." KEGG analysis showed that they were mainly enriched in the "complement and coagulation cascade" pathway. The molecular biology assay showed that lncRNA RP11-328K4.1 expression was significantly lower in the cancerous tissues and peripheral plasma of ICC patients than in normal controls (p<0.05). In addition, hsa-miR-27a-3p was found to be significantly upregulated in the cancer tissues and peripheral plasma of ICC patients (p<0.05). Compared to normal controls, the expression of PROS1 mRNA was significantly downregulated in ICC patient cancer tissues (p<0.05) but not in peripheral plasma (p>0.05). Furthermore, ROC analysis revealed that RP11-328K4.1, hsa-miR-27a-3p, and PROS1 had significant diagnostic value in ICC. We concluded that the upregulation of lncRNA RP11-328K4.1, which might act as a miRNA sponge, exerts an antitumor effect in ICC by eliminating the inhibition of PROS1 mRNA expression by oncogenic miRNA hsa-miR-27a.
