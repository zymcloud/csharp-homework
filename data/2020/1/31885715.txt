Determining an effective biomarker for predicting the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may improve patient survival rates. The present study aimed to investigate the expression of glucose transporter 3 (GLUT-3) in HCC and to determine its predictive value for the survival of patients with HCC. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect GLUT-3 expression in HCC tissues of 275 and 140 patients with HCC from training and validation cohorts, respectively. The association between GLUT-3 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with HCC, and between GLUT-3 expression and patient survival rates were analyzed. The predictive value of GLUT-3 expression was confirmed using the validation cohort. The results demonstrated that the high GLUT-3 expression in HCC tissues was significantly associated with elevated Î±-fetoprotein level, large tumor size, poor histological differentiation and Tumor-Node-Metastasis stages III and IV (P
