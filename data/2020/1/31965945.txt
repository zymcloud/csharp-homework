Alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases have become a serious concern whole over the world. Both these liver diseases have an identical pathology, starting from simple steatosis to cirrhosis and ultimately to hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment options for alcoholic liver disease (ALD) are still same as it was 50 years ago which includes corticosteroids, pentoxifylline, antioxidants, nutritional support and abstinence; and for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) weight loss, insulin sensitizers, lipid lowering agents and anti-oxidants are the only treatment options. Despite of broad research in understanding the disease pathophysiology, limited treatments are available for clinical use. Some therapeutic strategies based on targeting a specific molecule have been developed to lessen the consequences of disease and are under clinical investigation. Therefore, focus on multiple molecular targets will help to develop an efficient therapeutic strategy. This review comprises of brief overview of pathogenesis of ALD and NAFLD; recent molecular drug targets explored for ALD and NAFLD that may prove to be effective for multiple therapeutic regimens and also clinical status of these promising drug targets for liver diseases.
