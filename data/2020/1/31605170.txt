Background:Despite curative resection, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a high probability of recurrence. We validated the potential role of liver resection (LR) for recurrent HCC.Methods:Patients with intrahepatic recurrence with up to three lesions were included. We compared survival times of patients undergoing their first LR to those of patients undergoing repeated LR. Then, survival times of the patients who had undergone LR and transcatheter chemoembolization (TACE) for recurrent HCC after propensity score matching were compared.Results:After a median follow-up period of 3.1 years (range, 0.2-16.3), median overall survival times were 6.5 years (95% CI 6.0-7.0), 5.7 years (5.2-6.2), and 5.1 years (4.9-7.3) for the first LR (n = 1234), second LR (n = 273), and third LR (n = 90) groups, respectively. Severe complications frequently occurred in the first LR group (p = 0.059). Operative times were significantly longer for the third LR group (p = 0.012). After the first recurrence, median survival times after one-to-one pair matching were 5.7 years (95% CI 4.5-6.5) and 3.1 years (2.1-3.8) for the second LR group (n = 146) and TACE group (n = 146), respectively (p Conclusions:Repeated LR for recurrent HCC is the procedure of choice if there are three or fewer tumors.
