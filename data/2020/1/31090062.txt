Our previous study demonstrated that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein AB (HNRNPAB) is a key gene that facilitates metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular mechanisms behind this relationship are not fully understood. In our study, we utilized long-noncoding RNA (lncRNA) microarrays to identify a HNRNPAB-regulated lncRNA named lnc-ELF209. Our findings from chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicate that HNRNPAB represses lnc-ELF209 transcription by directly binding to its promoter region. We also analyzed clinical samples from HCC patients and cell lines with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions, RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, and found that there is a negative relationship between HNRNPAB and lnc-ELF209 expression. Up/downregulation assays and rescue assays indicate that lnc-ELF209 inhibits cell migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulated by HNRNPAB. This suggests a new regulatory mechanism for HNRNPAB-promoted HCC progression. RNA pull-down and LC-MS/MS were used to determine triosephosphate isomerase, heat shock protein 90-beta and vimentin may be involved in the tumor-suppressed function of lnc-ELF209. Furthermore, we found lnc-ELF209 could stabilize TPI protein expression. We also found that lnc-ELF209 overexpression in HCCLM3 cell resulted in a lower rate of lung metastatic, which suggested a less aggressive HCC phenotype. Collectively, these findings offer new insights into the regulatory mechanisms that underlie HNRNPAB cancer-promoting activities and demonstrate that lnc-ELF209 is a HNRNPAB-regulated lncRNA that may play an important role in the inhibition of HCC progression.
