Sorafenib (SOR) resistance remains a major obstacle in the effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A number of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are responsible for this chemoresistance. This study aimed to reveal the essential function of a recently defined lncRNA, lncRNA-POIR, in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and SOR sensitivity of HCC cells. SOR-induced cytotoxicity was analyzed via cell counting kit-8 and ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assays, whereas immunoblotting and confocal immunofluorescence were used to determine the expression levels of EMT markers. Furthermore, loss- or gain-of-function approaches were used to demonstrate the role of lncRNA-POIR/miR-182-5p on EMT and SOR sensitivity in HCC. The direct interaction between lncRNA-POIR and miR-182-5p was verified using a luciferase reporter assay. We found that knockdown of lncRNA-POIR sensitized HCC cells to SOR and simultaneously reversed EMT. As expected, miR-182-5p was confirmed as the downstream target of lncRNA-POIR. Moreover, miR-182-5p overexpression clearly reversed EMT and promoted SOR-induced cytotoxicity in representative HCC cells, whereas miR-182-5p downregulation played a contrasting role; miR-182-5p knockdown abolished the modulatory effects of lncRNA-POIR siRNA on EMT and SOR sensitivity. Together, these pieces of data suggest that lncRNA-POIR promotes EMT progression and suppresses SOR sensitivity simultaneously by sponging miR-182-5p. Thus, we proposed a compelling rationale for the use of lncRNA-POIR as a promising predictor of SOR response and as a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment in the future.
