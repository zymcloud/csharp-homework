Background:Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) and cytochrome p450 2E1 (CYP2E1) are important alcohol-metabolizing enzymes. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the association of ALDH2 rs671 and CYP2E1 rs2031920 polymorphisms with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) susceptibility in East Asians.Methods:A systematic search strategy was implemented in MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and China Academic Journals databases. Nineteen case-control studies were selected for inclusion. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated through random-effects or fixed-effects models. Subgroup analysis, meta-regression, sensitivity analysis, cumulative meta-analysis, and evaluation of publication bias were performed.Results:The overall meta-analysis did not find a significant association of ALDH2 rs671 and CYP2E1 rs2031920 genotypes with HCC susceptibility in East Asians. In addition, stratified analysis by country, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium status, and source of controls also did not identify any association.Conclusion:The ALDH2 rs671 and CYP2E1 rs2031920 polymorphisms are not associated with HCC susceptibility in East Asians.
