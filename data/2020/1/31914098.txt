Rationale:Liver transplantation (LT) is the preferred surgical option for the treatment of early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In contrast, surgical treatment of progressive HCC metastasized to the spine following LT constitutes a considerable challenge. Here, we report the first case of progressive HCC metastasized to the T12 vertebra after local radiotherapy, treated successfully with en bloc lumpectomy following LT for HCC.Patient concerns:A 40-year-old man who had undergone LT for the treatment of HCC 2 months prior presented to our clinic with symptoms of progressive back pain. Magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) examinations showed a solitary metastasis at T12 without recurrence in the liver or metastasis to other organs.Diagnoses:The patient was diagnosed with HCC metastasized to the T12 vertebra after liver transplantation.Interventions:Local radiation therapy of the T12 vertebra was performed; however, the lesion continued to grow one month after irradiation. Accordingly, the patient was treated with en bloc lumpectomy of the T12 vertebra. After surgery, the patient reported significant pain relief. At 11 months post-surgery, a C4 metastasis with spinal cord compression was revealed by MRI. Multiple grafted liver metastases were also detected by ultrasound along with several lung metastases, which were discovered by X-ray. The patient was treated with a pedicle screw system and a mesh cage filled with frozen autografts for C4 metastasis.Outcomes:The patient died 15 months after liver transplantation due to recurrence in the liver and metastasis to the lung.Lessons:En bloc lumpectomy may be a viable therapeutic option for patients with progressive solitary spinal metastases after LT refractory to radiotherapy. Use of immunosuppressive therapy after LT may significantly inhibit immune function, making patients more susceptible to HCC recurrence and bone metastasis.
