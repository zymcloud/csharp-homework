This study aimed to analyse the predictive value of Model For End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score on medium- and long-term survival in transplanted hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in Brazil. The study was registered with International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under N# 152,363. Inclusion criteria were based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. The search was performed on the indexed databases of Lilacs, SciELO, PubMed, and Cochrane Library, and used as search strategy the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms: ((("MELD Score") OR "Model For End-Stage Liver Disease") AND "Hepatocellular Carcinoma") AND ("Brazil"). We included full-text articles published from January 2006 to October 2019. The initial search found 162 articles. After reading the available abstracts and full texts, 156 articles were excluded, totaling six articles for qualitative analysis. Although the small number of eligible articles was a limiting factor of the study, our results partially corroborated those found in the United States, United Kingdom, and Ireland. In these countries, unlike Brazil, MELD prognostic model has shown a strong association with post-liver transplant (LT) survival. However, the low predictive capacity of the model in medium- and long-term has been similar to the one of our study. The urgency of the development and validation of a post-transplant survival model for patients with HCC is set, improving the organ allocation system in Brazil.
