Background/aims:The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommends ultrasound (US) screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among cirrhotic patients, regardless of body mass index (BMI), every 6 months. We examined US sensitivity for diagnosis of HCC in obese patients.Methods:Liver transplant patients data with HCC in explant was used (January 2012-December 2017). All patients underwent liver US within 3 months of diagnosis of HCC. Number/size of HCC lesions were extracted from radiologic and pathologic reports. Obesity was defined as BMI â‰¥30 kg/m2.Results:One hundred sixteen patients were included. 80% were male, with mean BMI of 31 kg/m2. The most common underlying liver disease was hepatitis C virus (62%). At the time of diagnosis, median number of HCC lesions was 2 (interquartile range [IQR], 1-3), and median size of the largest lesion was 2.5 cm (IQR, 1.75-3.9). Overall sensitivity of US study for detection of HCC was 33% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29-48%). Sensitivity was 77% (95% CI, 62-93%) in patients with BMIConclusion:Sensitivity of US for detection of HCC is significantly lower among obese patients compared to overweight and normal weight patients. These patients may benefit from alternating between US and a different imaging modality.
