Large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies and was mistaked as "advanced and unresectable" . Liver resection is still the best curable treatment for HCC.The resection of large HCC is very difficult, which seriously restrict the progress of liver surgery.Our study proved that solitary large HCC (SLHCC) has unique clinicopathological and molecular biological characteristics.No matter how big the tumor size is, it belongs to early stage if there is no vascular invasion.Liver resection should be aggressively recommended for the patients with SLHCC, in which they can obtain good outcome, with 40% 5-year survival rate.We has also defined the borderline resectable hepatocellular carcinoma, and suggested that strictly master and correctly judge the surgical indications, syntheticly evaluate the surgical safety and patient's tolerability for liver resection.After that, with hands of experienced surgeons, liver resection for SLHCC can be safely and reliablely performed.
