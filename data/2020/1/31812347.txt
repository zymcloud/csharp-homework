Immunotherapy for cancer cells induced by interfering with PD-1/PD-L1 engagement via check-point blockades was initiated by tumour-specific PD-1+ CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) within a tumour mass and eliminate the tumour. Here, we used C57BL/6 (B6) mice implanted with the syngeneic hepatoma cell line Hepa1-6-1, and confirmed that the dendritic cells (DCs) within Hepa1-6-1 tumour mass were tolerogenic with downmodulated co-stimulatory molecules by tumour-derived factors. Although Hepa1-6-1 cells did not prime tumour-specific CTLs within the tumour, specific CTLs primed in the regional lymph nodes seemed to be invaded into the tumour mass. The specific CTLs gained PD-1+ expression when associated with PD-L1+ Hepa1-6-1 cells within the tumour mass. Their cytotoxic activity in vivo was revitalised after intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), indicating that PD-1/PD-L1 engagement within the tumour was abrogated by check-point blockade. Nonetheless, the tolerogenic DCs within the Hepa1-6-1 tumour mass remained tolerogenic even after three shots of PD-1-blockade administration, and the suppressed Hepa1-6-1 growth was revisited. In this study, we show here an excellent therapeutic effect consisting of three injections of anti-PD1 mAb and the sequential administration of the CD1d molecule-restricted ligand α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), an immuno-potent lipid/glycolipid, which converts tolerogenic DCs into immunogenic DCs with upregulated expression of co-stimulatory molecules. The α-GalCer-activated DCs secreted a large amount of IL-12, which can activate tumour-specific CTLs in vivo. The check-point blockade was not sufficiently effective, but the dose needed for tumour eradication was reduced by 90% when tumour-bearing mice were also administered i.p. α-GalCer.
