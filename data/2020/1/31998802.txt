Background:Epigenetic dysregulation via alteration of DNA methylation often occurs during the development and progression of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the past, many patterns of single-gene DNA methylation have been extensively explored in the context of HCC prognosis prediction. However, the combined model of a mixture of CpGs has rarely been evaluated. In the present study, we aimed to develop and validate a CpG-based signature model for HCC patient prognosis.Methods:Data from methylation profiling of GSE73003, GSE37988, and GSE57958 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and 371 HCC patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were downloaded. The 371 HCC patients were randomly divided into a development cohort (N = 263) and a validation cohort (N = 263) and a validation cohort (.Results:Fourteen differential CpGs associated with OS were identified in HCC patients. The MSH, based on these 14 differential CpGs, could effectively divide HCC patients into two distinct subgroups with high risk or low risk of death (P < 0.0001) in the development cohort (26.35 vs 83.18 months, HR = 3.83, 95% CI: 2.56-5.90, P < 0.0001) in the development cohort (26.35 vs 83.18 months, HR = 3.83, 95% CI: 2.56-5.90, P < 0.0001) in the development cohort (26.35 vs 83.18 months, HR = 3.83, 95% CI: 2.56-5.90.Conclusion:The 14-CpG-based signature is significantly associated with OS and may be used as a novel prognostic biomarker for HCC patients.
