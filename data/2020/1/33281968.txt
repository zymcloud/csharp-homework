Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor and is associated with necroinflammation driven by various immune cells, such as dendritic cells, macrophages and natural killer cells. Innate immune cells can directly affect HCC or regulate the T-cell responses that mediate HCC. In addition, innate immune cells and T cells are not isolated, which means the interaction between them is important in the HCC microenvironment. Considering the current unsatisfactory efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with HCC, understanding the relationship between innate immune cells and T cells is necessary. In the present review the roles and clinical value of innate immune cells that have been widely reported to be involved in HCC, including dendritic cells, macrophages (including kupffer cells), neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils and innate lymphoid cells and the crosstalk between the innate and adaptive immune responses in the antitumor process have been discussed. The present review will facilitate researchers in understanding the importance of innate immune cells in HCC and lead to innovative immunotherapy approaches for the treatment of HCC.
