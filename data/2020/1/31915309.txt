Long noncoding RNAs play vital roles in several biological processes, including cell growth and embryonic development. We showed that MACC1-AS1 was overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and tissues. The MACC1-AS1 expression level was dramatically upregulated in HCC samples compared to adjacent normal samples, and 77.5% (31 of 40) of HCC samples showed overexpression of MACC1-AS1. Ectopic MACC1-AS1 expression enhanced cell proliferation and cyclin D1 expression in both SMMC7721 and MHCC-97H cells. Ectopic expression of MACC1-AS1 promoted vimentin, N-cadherin and snail expression and decreased E-cadherin expression in both SMMC7721 and MHCC-97H cells. MACC1-AS1 overexpression also induced cell invasion in the same two cell lines. Furthermore, MACC1-AS1 overexpression enhanced PAX8 expression in HCC cells. The PAX8 level was dramatically increased in HCC samples compared to adjacent normal samples, and 75% (30 of 40) of HCC samples showed overexpression of PAX8. PAX8 expression was positively correlated with MACC1-AS1 expression in HCC samples. MACC1-AS1 overexpression promoted HCC cell proliferation, EMT and invasion through regulating PAX8. These results suggest that MACC1-AS1 acts as an oncogene in the development of HCC.
