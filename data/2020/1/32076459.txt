Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor associated with a poor prognosis. Serum biomarkers of HCC have the potential to improve the diagnosis, provide a means to monitor the tumors, and predict their malignancy. Proteins that are expressed differentially between HCC patients and normal controls have the potential to be biomarkers.Method:Serum samples from 10 confirmed HCC patients and 10 controls were collected. The differentially expressed proteins in the serum were identified using an isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation- (iTRAQ-) based method. Potential serum biomarkers were validated by ELISA in another 20 HCC patients and 20 controls. Their expression data in HCC were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset.Results:A total of 260 proteins were measured in the serum of HCC patients and compared to those in sex- and age-matched normal controls. Forty-one proteins displayed significant changes, with 26 being downregulated and 15 being upregulated. Upregulated proteins included alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) and peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2), and downregulated proteins included paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and C-reactive protein (CRP). We then used ELISA to measure serum levels of A1AT, PRDX2, PON1, and CRP in another 20 patients with HCC and found that only PON1 levels were consistent with the iTRAQ result. In TCGA dataset, PON1 expression was downregulated in HCC tissues (P < 0.001) and low expression of PON1 was associated with poor survival in HCC patients (P < 0.001) and low expression of PON1 was associated with poor survival in HCC patients (.Conclusions:PON1 could act as a biomarker for HCC to assist in the diagnosis of HCC.
