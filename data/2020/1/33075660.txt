The effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) requires development of novel drug formulations that selectively kill HCC cells while sparing healthy liver cells. Here, we designed and investigated HCC-specific peptide, SP94 (SFSIIHTPILPLGGC), decorated smart polymersomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (SP94-PS-DOX) for potent treatment of orthotopic human SMMC-7721 HCC xenografts. SP94-PS-DOX was fabricated by post ligand-modification, affording robust nano-formulations with a diameter of âˆ¼ 76 nm and DOX content of 9.9 wt.%. The internalization of SP94-PS-DOX by SMMC-7721 cells showed a clear dependence on SP94 surface densities, in which 30 % SP94 resulted in ca. 3-fold better cellular uptake over non-targeted control (PS-DOX). In accordance, SP94-PS-DOX exhibited superior inhibition of SMMC-7721 cells to PS-DOX and clinical liposome injections (Lipo-DOX). Notably, a remarkable tumor deposition of 14.9 %ID/g and tumor-to-normal liver ratio of ca. 6.9 was observed for SP94-PS-DOX in subcutaneous SMMC-7721 HCC xenografts. More interestingly, SP94-PS-DOX under 10 mg DOX/kg induced far better therapeutic efficacy toward orthotopic SMMC-7721 HCC models than PS-DOX and Lipo-DOX controls giving substantial survival benefits and little adverse effects. The remarkable specificity and therapeutic outcomes lend SP94-PS-DOX promising for targeted HCC therapy.
