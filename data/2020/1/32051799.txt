Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas or bile duct cancers comprise approximately 10-20% of all cholangiocarcinomas and may present with right upper quadrant pain, weight loss, liver enzyme abnormalities or they may be completely asymptomatic and be picked incidentally on routine abdominal imaging. Typically, hepatocellular carcinomas have been associated with various paraneoplastic syndromes such as hypercalcemia, erythrocytosis, hypoglycemia, diarrhea and skin changes though paraneoplastic syndromes in the setting of cholangiocarcinoma do occur as well. Cholangiocarcinomas are usually associated with dermal paraneoplastic syndromes (Sweet syndrome, porphyria cutanea tarda, acanthosis nigricans, necrotic migratory erythema, erythema multiforme, bullous pemphigoid), hypercalcemia, leukocytosis and limbic encephalitis. We present a case of an 80-year-old man with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma associated with high procalcitonin levels in the absence of infection, paraneoplastic syndromes of hypercalcemia, polycythemia and leukocytosis in the same individual. This constellation of symptoms, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously reported in the scientific literature.
