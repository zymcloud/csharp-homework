Background & aims:There have been conflicting results from studies comparing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) vs those treated with entecavir. We compared the effects of TDF vs entecavir on HCC risk in a large cohort of patients with chronic HBV infection in China.Methods:We performed a retrospective study of consecutive adults with chronic HBV infection who initially received treatment with entecavir or TDF, for at least 6 months, from January 2008 through June 2018. Patients who had cancers or liver transplantation before or within the first 6 months of treatment were excluded. Propensity score weighting and 1:5 matching were used to balance the clinical characteristics between the 2 groups. Fine-Gray model was used to adjust for competing risk of death and liver transplantation.Results:We analyzed data from 29,350 patients (mean age, 52.9 Â± 13.2 years; 18,685 men [63.7%]); 1309 were first treated with TDF (4.5%) and 28,041 were first treated with entecavir (95.5%). TDF-treated patients were younger (mean age, 43.2 years vs 53.4 years) and a lower proportion had cirrhosis (38 patients [2.9%] vs 3822 patients treated with entecavir [13.6%]). At a median follow-up time of 3.6 years after treatment began (interquartile range, 1.7-5.0 years), 8 TDF-treated patients (0.6%) and 1386 entecavir-treated patients (4.9%) developed HCC. Patients' clinical characteristics were comparable after propensity score weighting. TDF treatment was associated with a lower risk of HCC than entecavir treatment after propensity score weighting (weighted subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval 0.16-0.80; P = .013) and 1:5 matching (weighted subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval 0.18-0.84; P = .016).Conclusions:In a retrospective analysis of 29,350 patients with chronic HBV infection in China, treatment with TDF was associated with a lower risk of HCC than treatment with entecavir, over a median follow-up time of 3.6 years.
