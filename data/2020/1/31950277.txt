A method is described for the simultaneous determination of hepatocellular carcinoma-associated microRNA-122 and microRNA-199a/b-3p. This probe consists of two kinds of nanomaterials. The first comprises CdTe@CdS core-shell quantum dots which, on excitation at 375 nm give two emissions, with peak wavelengths at 543 (g-QDs) and at 627 nm (r-QDs). The second comprises gold nanoparticles acting as a quencher. In the absence of the target, g-QD-N1 and r-QD-N2 are stable due to the fluorescence stability. With the addition of microRNA-122 and microRNA-199a/b-3p, g-QD-N1 and r-QD-N2 are conjugated to the surface of AuNP-S1/S2 through base complementary pairing. As a result, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) occurs, resulting in a decrease at 550 nm and 635 nm respectively, which can realize the simultaneous detection of two different microRNAs. Detection is achieved within 50 min. The detection limits (3Ïƒ/k) are 0.2 nM for microRNA-122 and 0.5 nM for microRNA-199a/b-3p. The clinical applicability of the assay was demonstrated by detecting microRNAs in human serum and different cell lysates.
