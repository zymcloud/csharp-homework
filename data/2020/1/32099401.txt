Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third major cause of cancer-related death. Mounting evidence shows that microRNAs play critical roles in the initiation and progression of HCC and may potentially serve as diagnostic markers for HCC.Methods and results:In the present study, we explored the biological effects of miR-885-5p on HCC progression. We performed flow cytometry analyses of miR-885-5p in HCC cell lines and identified miR-885-5p as a recurrence-related microRNA. Overexpression of miR-885-5p significantly inhibited cell migration, invasion, proliferation, angiogenesis and EMT. Then, the correlation of miR-885-5p and AEG1 were confirmed by using luciferase assays, quantitative real-time PCR analysis and Western blotting. It was subsequently confirmed that Astrocyte Elevated Gene1 (AEG1) was a direct target gene of miR-885-5p.Conclusion:miR-885-5p likely acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating AEG1, suggesting that miR-885-5p may be a potential biomarker and can be targeted in therapeutic strategies against HCC in the future.
