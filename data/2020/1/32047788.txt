Background:Spinal metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rare, with an extremely poor prognosis and results in severe pain. Argon-helium cryotherapy is a local ablation method for HCC.Case summary:A 54-year-old man was diagnosed with HCC related to hepatitis B one year ago and underwent surgical tumor resection and tenofovir antiviral treatment. However, a new lesion developed on the right liver after 1 mo. Transarterial chemoembolization was performed four times. One month ago, the patient developed back pain, and metastasis on the 11th thoracic vertebra was detected. Argon-helium cryoablation was performed to treat the right occupancy and metastatic lesion, which immediately alleviated the pain and prolonged survival.Conclusion:The use of argon-helium cryoablation for thoracic vertebrae with metastasis of HCC achieved favorable results.
