To evaluate hepatobiliary-specific contrast agent (CA) mangafodipir trisodium (Mn-DPDP)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting the therapeutic efficacy of the vascular disrupting agent combretastatin A4 phosphate (CA4P) in rats with primary and secondary liver tumors, 36 primary hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) were raised by diethylnitrosamine gavage in 16 male rats, in 6 of which one rhabdomyosarcomas (R1) was intrahepatically implanted as secondary liver tumors. On a 3.0T MR scanner with a wrist coil, tumors were monitored weekly by T2-/T1-weighted images (T2WI/T1WI) and characterized by Mn-DPDP-enhanced MRI. CA4P-induced intratumoral necrosis was depicted by nonspecific gadoterate meglumine (Gd-DOTA)-enhanced MRI before and 12 h after therapy. Changes of tumor-to-liver contrast (ΔT/L) on Mn-DPDP-enhanced images were analyzed. In vivo MRI findings were verified by postmortem microangiography and histopathology. Rat models of primary HCCs in a full spectrum of differentiation and secondary R1 liver tumors were successfully generated. Mn-DPDP-enhanced ΔT/L was negatively correlated with HCC differentiation grade (P
