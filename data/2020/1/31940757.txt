Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with nivolumab and pembrolizumab are promising agents for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but lack of effective biomarkers. We aimed to investigate the potential predictors of response and factors associated with overall survival (OS) for ICI treatment in unresectable HCC patients. Ninety-five patients who received nivolumab or pembrolizumab for unresectable HCC were enrolled for analyses. Radiologic evaluation was based on RECIST v1.1. Factors associated with outcomes were analyzed. Of 90 patients with evaluable images, the objective response rate (ORR) was 24.4%. Patients at Child-Pugh A or received combination treatment had higher ORR. Early alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) >10% reduction (within 4 weeks) was the only independent predictor of best objective response (odds ratio: 7.259, p = 0.001). For patients with baseline AFP â‰¥10 ng/mL, significantly higher ORR (63.6% vs. 10.2%, p < 0.001) and disease control rate (81.8% vs. 14.3%, p < 0.001) were observed in those with early AFP reduction than those without. In addition, early AFP reduction and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade or Child-Pugh class were independent factors associated with OS in different models. In conclusion, a 10-10 rule of early AFP response can predict objective response and survival to ICI treatment in unresectable HCC. ALBI grade and Child-Pugh class determines survival by ICI treatment.
