The liver serves as a central participant in immune system owing to its particular blood supply and large amounts of immune cells, in which macrophages play a significant role in liver homeostasis and disorders. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), membrane-defined nanometer-sized vesicles released by cells in a tightly controlled manner, have attracted intensive research attention as a critical vehicle for cell-cell communication in the pathophysiology of liver. Accumulating evidence has proved that extracellular vesicles are frequently involved in macrophage-mediated biological behaviors. Not only can macrophages produce and secrete EVs containing multifarious cargo themselves to exert immunomodulatory functions, but also macrophages may serve as target cells of EVs from other cells eliciting the alteration of their phenotype and function. Since both macrophage as well as EVs show pleiotropic and central effects in the progression of liver diseases, their roles in adjusting innate immunity of liver often present a crossover. In this review we are dedicated to deciphering the complex immunological network constituted by macrophages and EVs in several common liver diseases, including acute liver injury or failure and a set of chronic liver diseases such as viral hepatitis B and C, metabolic and alcoholic liver diseases, as well as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). From the aspect of immunology, we integrate the mechanism of EVs and hepatic macrophages in the setting of liver diseases and show a promising significance of utilizing this association into clinical immunotherapy.
