Background/purpose:The risk of recurrence after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is high. Apart from nucleos(t)ide analogues therapy, population-based studies suggest statin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aspirin have chemopreventive effect on recurrence. The role of those drugs on HCC recurrence should be delineated.Methods:Consecutive 430 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients undergoing curative resection of HCC were enrolled. The detailed medical records including the use of statin, NSAID and aspirin were reviewed. All the patients had regular image study surveillance after the surgery. Predictors associated with recurrence were analyzed by Cox's proportional hazards models.Results:There were 58.8% patients in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A, and 37.6% had severe liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. Of them, 47 (10.9%) patients had received potential chemoprophylactic agents either at the time of HCC diagnosis or before their HCC recurrence. During a median 50.3 months of follow-up, 54.7% patients experienced recurrence. The median time to recurrence was 15.4 months. In the univariate analysis, aspirin and statins use were significantly associated a low risk of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.18; p = 0.016, and HR: 0.50; p = 0.031, respectively). After adjusting competing factors, large tumor size, severe liver fibrosis, and high alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level were significantly associated with recurrence. Importantly, aspirin use was found to significantly decrease the risk for HCC recurrence with the adjusted HRs of 0.22-0.24 based on the models.Conclusion:Aspirin use may have chemo-preventive effect on recurrence of hepatitis B virus-related HCC after curative resection.
