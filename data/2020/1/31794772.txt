Aims:This study addressed whether endogenous hepatic stem/progenitor (HSP) cells survival were related to the injured signals during liver cirrhosis.Material and methods:Liver cirrhosis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by administering diethylnitrosamine (DEN) in drinking water. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and Masson's trichrome staining were used to identify infiltrative cells and connective tissues, respectively. The inflammatory activity grade and fibrotic stage, represented as G and S respectively, and evaluated by the International Simplified Grading and Staging System (ISGSS). Endogenous HSP cells (Ng2+HSP) were identified by immunofluorescence staining with an anti-neuro/glial antigen 2 (Ng2) antibody. All data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0 and GraphPad Prism 6 and Student's t-test was performed to determine statistical significance. p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Key findings:All mice administered oral DEN developed liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). During the fibrosis period, observed a positive correlation of survival of endogenous HSP (Ng2+HSP) cells with inflammatory activity. As the disease developed into the cirrhotic stage, when lost correlation of endogenous HSP cells with inflammatory activity, revealed a dramatically reduced survival rate of endogenous HSP (Ng2+HSP) cells.Significance:The DEN-induced liver cirrhosis could develop into three time zone of fibrosis, cirrhosis and cancer, and the histological patterns in the model are similar to those described in humans. Dramatic survival and less apoptosis of endogenous HSP (Ng2+HSP) cells was within fibrotic state, where inflammation signals is strong, indicating such time zone (1-6 weeks) during liver cirrhosis is important for mobilizing endogenous HSP-based regeneration.
