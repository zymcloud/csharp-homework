Emerging evidence suggests that oroxylin A exhibits antitumor effects by inducing cell apoptosis. However, the involved molecular mechanisms have not been elucidated. Here we report that the apoptosis induced by oroxylin A was dependent on p62-mediated activation of caspase-8 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Furthermore, oroxylin A also caused p62/SQSTM1 proteolysis at Asp329 by activating caspase-8. Further studies confirm that mutation in p62 (D329H and D329G) was resistant to oroxylin A-mediated p62 cleavage and apoptosis. Due to the absence of the KIR domain that interacts with Keap1, the cleaved p62 reduced the stability of Nrf2, thereby causing oxidative stress and increasing ROS levels. In vivo, p62 similarly contributed to oroxylin A-exerted antitumor effect in xenograft model inoculated SMMC-7721 tumor. In conclusion, our findings indicated that oroxylin A triggered apoptosis through caspase-8 activation and p62/SQSTM1 proteolysis.
