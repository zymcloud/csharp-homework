The two most common primary liver malignancies that radiologists encounter in clinical practice are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). However, there are other less common primary hepatic malignancies that radiologists should be aware of. The correct radiographic and pathologic diagnosis of these entities have important treatment and prognostic implications. In this paper, we review a series of five cases that we have encountered in clinical practice at our institution that were initially thought to be HCC or ICC, but turned out to be a rarer primary hepatic malignancy. We will review the radiographic and pathologic characteristics of each of these rare primary hepatic malignancies as well as discuss the prognosis and treatment for each.
