Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy with a dismal prognosis. It is of great importance to identify biomarkers for the prediction of patients' survival.The mRNA expression level of deoxyribonuclease 1 like 3 (DNASE1L3) and its correlation with survival were accessed in 424 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Its expression level was confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting in 20 pairs of postsurgical specimens. In addition, immunohistochemistry staining of DNASE1L3 was also performed in 113 postoperative samples, using a histochemistry score system. The relationship between patients' survival and DNASE1L3 expression level was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method.DNASE1L3 is downregulated in both mRNA and protein levels in HCC tissues, compared with adjacent normal tissues. 52 of 113 HCC specimens showed positive DNASE1L3 protein expression. Patients with positive DNASE1L3 expression had significantly longer overall survival, compared with patients with negative expression (p = 0.023). However, the DNASE1L3 fails to discriminate progression-free survival (p = 0.134). Multivariate COX analysis revealed that positive DNASE1L3 expression and higher differentiation were significantly associated with better overall survival.This study demonstrated that positive DNASE1L3 expression is an independent prognostic factor for better survival in HCC patients following radical resection.
