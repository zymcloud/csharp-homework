Microwave ablation (MWA) has become a popular therapeutic technique in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) alongside cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation, and liver resection/transplantation in patients with limited tumor burden. Generally well tolerated, and not as invasive as surgery, the technique results in low mortality and complication rates. We report the exceedingly rare complication of hepatic artery thrombosis with subsequent fatal ischemia of the left hepatic lobe in a 64-year-old female with cirrhosis and HCC who underwent MWA.
