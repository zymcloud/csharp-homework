Background:Chronic hepatitis delta is a severe liver disease with rapid progression to cirrhosis. The impact of hepatitis delta virus (HDV)-RNA on disease progression and interferon treatment in a real-world cohort has been barely explored.Aim:To assess the development of clinical events in a cohort of chronic hepatitis delta patients according to the presence or absence of HDV-RNA METHODS: Multicentre study at four academic hospitals in Spain included anti-HDV-positive patients with compensated liver disease with a follow-up â‰¥12 months.Results:Among 2888 HBsAg-positive subjects, 151 (5.2%) tested positive for anti-HDV, and 118 were included (58% men; median age, 49 years; 73% detectable HDV-RNA and 30% cirrhosis, most often in subjects with HDV-RNA). After a median follow-up of 8 years, subjects with initially detectable HDV-RNA were more prone to developing cirrhosis (31% vs 0%, P = .002) and/or liver decompensation (28% vs 3%, P = .019). Mortality rate was 0.44 per 1000 person-months. The probability of a clinical event was 6%, 25%, and 80% according to initial baseline-event-anticipation score. HDV-RNA became undetectable in 21 (24%) subjects either due to interferon or spontaneously (48% vs 52%, P = .29). Liver decompensation was reduced in interferon-treated patients (13% vs 38%, P = .026).Conclusions:Subjects with persistently positive HDV-RNA had a worse prognosis in terms of clinical events. Baseline-event-anticipation score is useful in predicting the risk of developing liver decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma. Interferon was beneficial in reducing liver decompensation, even in the absence of virological response.
