PIN1 is a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase that specifically binds and catalyzes the cis/trans isomerization of the phosphorylated serine or threonine residue preceding a proline (pSer/Thr-Pro) motif of its interacting proteins. Through this phosphorylation-dependent prolyl isomerization, PIN1 is involved in the regulation of various important cellular processes including cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, apoptosis and microRNAs biogenesis; hence its dysregulation contributes to malignant transformation. PIN1 is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). By fine-tuning the functions of its interacting proteins such as cyclin D1, x-protein of hepatitis B virus and exportin 5, PIN1 plays an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis. Growing evidence supports that targeting PIN1 is a potential therapeutic approach for HCC by inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing cellular apoptosis, and restoring microRNAs biogenesis. Novel formulation of PIN1 inhibitors that increases in vivo bioavailability of PIN1 inhibitors represents a promising future direction for the therapeutic strategy of HCC treatment. In this review, the mechanisms underlying PIN1 over-expression in HCC are explored. Furthermore, we also discuss the roles of PIN1 in HCC tumorigenesis and metastasis through its interaction with various phosphoproteins. Finally, recent progress in the therapeutic options targeting PIN1 for HCC treatment is examined and summarized.
