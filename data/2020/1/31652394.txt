Background & aims:Inflammation-based prognostic scores, such as the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS), Prognostic Index (PI), Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR) and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), are correlated with the survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, while remain unclear for recurrent HCC. This study aimed to compare the prognostic value of inflammation-based prognostic scores for post-recurrence survival (PRS) in patients with early recurrent HCC (ErHCC, within 2 years after hepatectomy).Methods:A total of 580 patients with ErHCC were enrolled retrospectively. The association between the independent baseline and the time-dependent variables and PRS was evaluated by cox regression. The prediction accuracy of the inflammation-based prognostic scores was assessed by time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Harrell's concordance index (C-index) analyses.Results:The GPS, mGPS, PI, PNI, NLR, PLR, LMR and SII were all related to the PRS of ErHCC patients, while only the SII (P Conclusions:The SII is a useful prognostic indicator for PRS in patients with ErHCC after hepatectomy and is superior to the other inflammation-based prognostic scores in terms of prognostic ability.
