HCC may recur following surgery or radiofrequency ablation. Proton beam therapy (PBT) is a type of radiotherapy that achieves excellent local control of HCC without severe toxicity. The present study reported the long-term outcome of 3 HCC patients who each received 4 repeat courses of PBT. All patients had a hepatitis B or C viral infection. A total of 14 lesions were treated using a curative PBT protocol and irradiated liver volumes in each treatment were 7-50% of the total liver volume. Liver function in all cases was considerably preserved until the last follow-up and patient survival was 51-107 months from the first PBT with no local recurrence observed in the 14 lesions. The presented cases indicated that repeated PBT is an effective treatment option for recurrent HCC due to reduced liver damage and superior local treatment compared with other treatment options such as transarterial chemoembolization.
