Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects around a quarter of the global population, paralleling worldwide increases in obesity and metabolic syndrome. NAFLD arises in the context of systemic metabolic dysfunction that concomitantly amplifies the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. These interrelated conditions have long been recognized to have a heritable component, and advances using unbiased association studies followed by functional characterization have created a paradigm for unravelling the genetic architecture of these conditions. A novel perspective is to characterize the shared genetic basis of NAFLD and other related disorders. This information on shared genetic risks and their biological overlap should in future enable the development of precision medicine approaches through better patient stratification, and enable the identification of preventive and therapeutic strategies. In this Review, we discuss current knowledge of the genetic basis of NAFLD and of possible pleiotropy between NAFLD and other liver diseases as well as other related metabolic disorders. We also discuss evidence of causality in NAFLD and other related diseases and the translational significance of such evidence, and future challenges from the study of genetic pleiotropy.
