Background:Distant Metastases from Head and Neck Squamous cell carcinomas are uncommon (9-11%) and they are usually found in the lung and less frequently in the liver, kidney and adrenals. Central nervous system (CNS) metastases are extremely rare (2-8%), and they are described mainly in patients who already have extracranial metastases. So there's scarcity of data about their optimal management .Methods and results:A patient presented CNS metastases after having been successfully treated with induction chemotherapy and definitive radiotherapy for a pyriform sinus carcinoma. The patient's work up, treatment and outcome are described.Conclusions:CNS metastases from Head and Neck carcinomas are exceptionally rare. Nevertheless, clinicians should be alert of neurological symptoms in these patients, in order to set up a timely assessment and treatment. Secondarily, given the rarity of this condition, additional research on this topic is warranted in order to improve therapeutic strategies and outcomes of such patients.
