Splicing alterations represent an actionable cancer hallmark. Splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) is a crucial splicing factor that can be targeted pharmacologically (e.g. pladienolide-B). Here, we show that SF3B1 is overexpressed (RNA/protein) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in two retrospective (n = 154 and n = 172 samples) and in five in silico cohorts (n > 900 samples, including TCGA) and that its expression is associated with tumor aggressiveness, oncogenic splicing variants expression (KLF6-SV1, BCL-XL) and decreased overall survival. In vitro, SF3B1 silencing reduced cell viability, proliferation and migration and its pharmacological blockade with pladienolide-B inhibited proliferation, migration, and formation of tumorspheres and colonies in liver cancer cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B, SNU-387), whereas its effects on normal-like hepatocyte-derived THLE-2 proliferation were negligible. Pladienolide-B also reduced the in vivo growth and the expression of tumor-markers in Hep3B-induced xenograft tumors. Moreover, SF3B1 silencing and/or blockade markedly modulated the activation of key signaling pathways (PDK1, GSK3b, ERK, JNK, AMPK) and the expression of cancer-associated genes (CDK4, CD24) and oncogenic SVs (KLF6-SV1). Therefore, the genetic and/or pharmacological inhibition of SF3B1 may represent a promising novel therapeutic strategy worth to be explored through randomized controlled trials.
