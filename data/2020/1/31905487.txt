<b>Background/Aims:</b> The survival rate of gastric cancer (GC) is known to be higher in patients with a family history (FH) of GC. There is an association between a polymorphism in the transforming growth factor-Î²1 (<i>TGFB1</i>) gene and the risk of GC in patients with first-degree relatives with GC. This study was performed to investigate whether a FH affects GC outcomes according to the <i>TGFB1</i> C-509T polymorphism. <b>Methods:</b> <i>TGFB1</i> was genotyped by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method in 1,143 GC patients, including 216 patients (18.9%) with first-degree relatives with GC. <b>Results:</b> The proportion of stage I-II GCs was significantly higher in patients with a FH than in those without a FH of GC (83.8 vs 74.9%, p=0.005). The association between a FH of GC and stage I-II GC was not significant in subgroups divided based on the <i>TGFB1</i> C-509T polymorphism and sex. A FH did not affect the overall survival rate of GC in patient with all stages and each stage. The overall survival rates were not significantly different between patients with the CC and CT/TT genotypes of the <i>TGFB1</i>-509 polymorphism. <b>Conclusions:</b> Patient with a FH of GC had lower cancer stage (I-II) at diagnosis than those without a FH of GC, but there was no significant difference in overall survival between the patients with and without a FH of GC. A FH did not influence the tumor stage or overall survival in patients stratified by the presence of the <i>TGFB1</i> C-509T polymorphism.
