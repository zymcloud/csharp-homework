Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with hilar bile duct tumor thrombus (HBDTT) often mimic hilar cholangiocarcinoma (hilar CC). The purpose of this study is to analyze the Computed Tomography (CT) characteristics of HCC with HBDTT and to identify imaging features to aid its differentiation from hilar CC on enhanced CT.Methods:We retrospectively identified 58 cases with pathologically proved HCC with HBDTT between 2011 and 2018. Seventy-seven cases of pathologically proven hilar CCs were selected during the same period. The clinical features and CT findings of the two groups were reviewed and compared.Results:HCC with HBDTTs are more commonly found in men (87.9% vs 63.6%, p = 0.001) with lower age of onset (49.84 vs 58.61 years; p Conclusions:HCC with HBDTTs are often distinguishable from hilar CCs based on washout during portal venous phase without thickened bile duct wall. HBV infection and serum AFP level facilitate the differentiation.
