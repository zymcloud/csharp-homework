A 79-year-old woman who presented with right hydronephrosis was referred to our hospital. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a right ureteral tumor (cT3N0M0). Right nephroureterectomy and partial cystectomy were performed. Pathological examination revealed small cell carcinoma (mixed type ; INFb, pT3, ly1, v1, u-rt0, ur0, RM0). Cystoscopy showed intravesical recurrence of the tumor 3 months after the surgery. Transurethral resection was performed, and histopathological examination revealed small cell carcinoma (pT2). We recommended postoperative chemotherapy ; however, the patient and her family refused consent for chemotherapy. Liver and lymph node metastases developed, and the patient died 2 months after the transurethral resection.
