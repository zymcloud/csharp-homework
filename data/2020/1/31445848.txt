Background/purpose:The major dose-limiting toxicity of ribavirin is hemolytic anemia. We investigated the incidence, risk factors and impact on virological response of anemia in chronic hepatitis C genotype 2 patients receiving sofosbuvir plus ribavirin therapy.Methods:This was a retrospective real-world analysis of a single center including 293 chronic hepatitis C genotype 2 patients treated with sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 12 weeks. Severe anemia was defined as hemoglobin concentration Results:Treatment was completed in 285 (97%) of patients, of whom one withdrew due to severe anemia. Ribavirin dose reduction was required in 88 (30%) of patients. After excluding those with baseline hemoglobin 12) rate was 93.9% in the per-protocol population. Multivariate analyses showed that history of hepatocellular carcinoma significantly reduced the efficacy of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin therapy (OR = 0.172, p = 0.001). Severe anemia, dose reduction or average dose (mg/kg/day) of ribavirin was not associated with SVR12.Conclusion:Severe anemia was not uncommon during sofosbuvir plus ribavirin therapy for chronic hepatitis C genotype 2 patients. Careful monitoring of anemia is necessary in patients with chronic kidney disease and low baseline hemoglobin level and platelet count.
