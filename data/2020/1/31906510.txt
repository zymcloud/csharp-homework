: In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on miRNAs as therapeutic targets in two cancer types that were frequently described to be driven by miRNAs-melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). By focusing on common microRNAs and associated pathways in these-at first sight-dissimilar cancer types, we aim at revealing similar molecular mechanisms that are evolved in microRNA-biology to drive cancer progression. Thereby, we also want to outlay potential novel therapeutic strategies. After providing a brief introduction to general miRNA biology and basic information about HCC and melanoma, this review depicts prominent examples of potent oncomiRs and tumor-suppressor miRNAs, which have been proven to drive diverse cancer types including melanoma and HCC. To develop and apply miRNA-based therapeutics for cancer treatment in the future, it is essential to understand how miRNA dysregulation evolves during malignant transformation. Therefore, we highlight important aspects such as genetic alterations, miRNA editing and transcriptional regulation based on concrete examples. Furthermore, we expand our illustration by focusing on miRNA-associated proteins as well as other regulators of miRNAs which could also provide therapeutic targets. Finally, design and delivery strategies of miRNA-associated therapeutic agents as well as potential drawbacks are discussed to address the question of how miRNAs might contribute to cancer therapy in the future.
