To assess the safety and clinical outcomes of multi-probe stereotactic radiofrequency ablation (SRFA) for very large (â‰¥8 cm) primary and metastatic liver tumors with curative treatment intent. A retrospective, single center study carried out between 01.2005 and 06.2018. 34 consecutive patients had a total of 41 primary and metastatic liver tumors with a median size of 9.0 cm (8.0-18.0 cm) at initial SRFA. Patients were treated under CT guidance using a 3D navigation system. Endpoints consisted of (i) technical efficacy; primary - requiring one treatment, and secondary - requiring two treatments (ii) complication and mortality rates (iii) local and distant recurrence (LR), (iv) disease free survival (DFS), (v) overall survival (OS). 33/41 tumors were successfully ablated at initial SRFA (80.5% primary technical efficacy rate (PTE)). Four tumors required repeat ablation, resulting in a secondary technical efficacy (STE) rate of 90.2%. Local tumor recurrence (LR) developed in 4 of 41 tumors (9.8%). The 30-day perioperative mortality was 2.3% (1/ 44 ablations). The total major complication rate was 20.5% (9 of 44 ablations). Three of nine (33.3%) major complications, such as pleural effusion, pneumothoraces or perihepatic hemorrhages were relatively easy to treat. The overall survival (OS) rates at 1-, 3-, and 5- years from the date of the first SRFA were 87.1%, 71.8%, and 62.8% for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 87.5%, 70.0% and 70.0% for patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) respectively. Patients with metastatic disease had OS rates of 77.8% and 22.2% at 1- and 3- years. The clinical results of SRFA in this study are encouraging and warrant a prospective multicenter study. SRFA may become one of the best therapeutic choices for a growing number of patients with primary and metastatic liver cancer.
