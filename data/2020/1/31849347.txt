Autophagy is an evolutionarily ancient process whereby eukaryotic cells eliminate disposable or potentially dangerous cytoplasmic material, to support bioenergetic metabolism and adapt to stress. Accumulating evidence indicates that autophagy operates as a critical quality control mechanism for the maintenance of hepatic homeostasis in both parenchymal (hepatocytes) and non-parenchymal (stellate cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells, Kupffer cells) compartments. In line with this notion, insufficient autophagy has been aetiologically involved in the pathogenesis of multiple liver disorders, including alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, we critically discuss the importance of functional autophagy for hepatic physiology, as well as the mechanisms whereby defects in autophagy cause liver disease.
