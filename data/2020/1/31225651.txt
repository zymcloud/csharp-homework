Objectives:To explore the value of ultrasomics in temporal monitoring of tumor changes in response to gene therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma compared with methods according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and modified RECIST (mRECIST).Methods:Hepatocellular carcinoma-bearing mice were injected intratumorally with microRNA-122 (miR-122) mimics and an miR-122 negative control in the treatment and control groups, respectively. The injections were performed every 3 days for 5 times (on days 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12). Before each injection and at the experiment ending, 2-dimensional ultrasound imaging was performed for tumor size measurement with RECIST and computing a quantitative imaging analysis with ultrasomics. To analyze the tumor perfusion by mRECIST, perfusion parameters were analyzed offline based on dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound image videos using SonoLiver software (TomTec, Unterschleissheim, Germany) on day 13. Tumor miR-122 expression was then analyzed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments.Results:Tumors in mice treated with miR-122 mimics demonstrated a mean ± SD 763- ± 60-fold increase in miR-122 levels compared with tumors in the control group. With RECIST, a significant therapeutic response evaluated by tumor size changes was detected after day 9 (days 9, 12, and 13; P .05). Significant different features of the 2-dimensional ultrasound images between the groups were detected by the ultrasomics analysis, and the model could be successfully built. The ultrasomics score values between the groups were statistically significant after day 6 (days 6, 9, 12, and 13; P Conclusions:Ultrasomics revealed significant changes after the second injection of miR-122, showing the potential as an important imaging biomarker for gene therapy.
