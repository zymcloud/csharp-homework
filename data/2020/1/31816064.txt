Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD Ia) is caused by autosomal mutations in glucose-6-phosphatase α catalytic subunit (G6PC) and can present with severe hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis and hypertriglyceridemia. In both children and adults with GSD Ia, there is over-accumulation of hepatic glycogen and triglycerides that can lead to steatohepatitis and a risk for hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma. Here, we examined the effects of the commonly used peroxisomal proliferated activated receptor α agonist, fenofibrate, on liver and kidney autophagy and lipid metabolism in 5-day-old G6pc -/- mice serving as a model of neonatal GSD Ia. Five-day administration of fenofibrate decreased the elevated hepatic and renal triglyceride and hepatic glycogen levels found in control G6pc -/- mice. Fenofibrate also induced autophagy and promoted β-oxidation of fatty acids and stimulated gene expression of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases in the liver. These findings show that fenofibrate can rapidly decrease hepatic glycogen and triglyceride levels and renal triglyceride levels in neonatal G6pc -/- mice. Moreover, since fenofibrate is an FDA-approved drug that has an excellent safety profile, our findings suggest that fenofibrate could be a potential pharmacological therapy for GSD Ia in neonatal and pediatric patients as well as for adults. These findings may also apply to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which shares similar pathological and metabolic changes with GSD Ia.
