Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for 2-3% of all adult malignancies. Clear-cell type RCC is the most common type, accounting for approximately 75% of all renal cancer cases. The most common sites of metastasis include the lung, bone, and liver. Ovarian metastasis of RCC is an exceptionally rare occurrence with only 41 cases reported in the literature with only 11 of these cases involving the bilateral ovaries. Here we present a case of clear-cell RCC arising from the left kidney with metastatic involvement of bilateral ovaries in a 48-year-old woman.
