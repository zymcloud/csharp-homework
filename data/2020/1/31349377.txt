Aim:Lenvatinib (LEN) is a newly approved, multikinase inhibitor for treating unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. In the present study, we investigated the impact of three different criteria for evaluating radiological objective response (OR) on overall survival in real-world data.Methods:Consent for LEN therapy was obtained from 51 patients from April 2018 to March 2019. A total of 40 patients who received a minimal cumulative duration of 4 weeks of LEN were included in the analysis. Enhanced computed tomography scan was performed at baseline and every 4-8 weeks after LEN administration. Overall survival and OR were assessed with three different evaluations, as follows: Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1, modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and Choi criteria.Results:The average observation period for all participants after LEN introduction was 209.4 Â± 77.5 days. The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1, modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and Choi criteria identified 10 of 40 (25.0%), 15 of 40 (37.5%), and 18of 40 (45.0%) patients with OR, respectively. The median overall survival in progressive disease evaluated by each criterion was 227 days. This result was significantly shorter than OR. Furthermore, the cumulative duration of LEN administration (>150 days) represented a significant prognostic factor (HR 0.160. 95% CI 0.039-0.646, P = 0.001).Conclusion:The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1, modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and Choi criteria were useful therapeutic evaluation methods in LEN therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. LEN's appropriate effect evaluation and management might lead to a better prognosis.
