Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most aggressive human cancers. The rising incidence of HCC worldwide and its resistance to pharmacotherapy indicate that the prevention of HCC development may be the most impactful strategy to improve HCC-related morbidity and mortality. Among the broad range of chemopreventive agents, the use of dietary and nutritional agents is an attractive and promising approach; however, a better understanding of the mechanisms of their potential cancer suppressive action is needed to justify their use. In the present study, we investigated the underlying molecular pathways associated with the previously observed suppressive effect of butyrate-containing structured lipids (STLs) against liver carcinogenesis using a rat "resistant hepatocyte" model of hepatocarcinogenesis that resembles the development of HCC in humans. Using whole transcriptome analysis, we demonstrate that the HCC suppressive effect of butyrate-containing STLs is associated with the inhibition of the cell migration, cytoskeleton organization, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), mediated by the reduced levels of RACGAP1 and RAC1 proteins. Mechanistically, the inhibition of the Racgap1 and Rac1 oncogenes is associated with cytosine DNA and histone H3K27 promoter methylation. Inhibition of the RACGAP1/RAC1 oncogenic signaling pathways and EMT may be a valuable approach for liver cancer prevention.
