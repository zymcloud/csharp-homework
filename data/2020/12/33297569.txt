TREM1 and TREM2 are members of the triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) family. Both TREM1 and TREM2 are immunoglobulin superfamily receptors. Their main function is to identify foreign antigens and toxic substances, thereby adjusting the inflammatory response. In the liver, TREM1 and TREM2 are expressed on non-parenchymal cells, such as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, and hepatic stellate cells, and cells which infiltrate the liver in response to injury including monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils. The function of TREM1 and TREM2 in inflammatory response depends on Toll-like receptor 4. TREM1 mainly augments inflammation during acute inflammation, while TREM2 mainly inhibits chronic inflammation to protect the liver from pathological changes. Chronic inflammation often induces metabolic abnormalities, fibrosis, and tumorigenesis. The above physiological changes lead to liver-related diseases, such as liver injury, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, we review the function of TREM1 and TREM2 in different liver diseases based on inflammation, providing a more comprehensive perspective for the treatment of liver-related diseases.
