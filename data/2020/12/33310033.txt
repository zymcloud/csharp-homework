Aims:To investigate the role of cIAP2 in the malignant biological behaviours of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and determine its mechanism of action.Main methods:cIAP2 protein expression was detected via immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 102 HCC specimens and 43 paracancerous liver tissues, and its relationship with clinicopathological features and patient prognosis was analysed. Then, short interfering RNA (siRNA) technology was used to knock down cIAP2 expression in BEL7402 and HepG2 cells. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) and Transwell assays were used to determine cell proliferation and invasion after knockdown of cIAP2 expression. The relationship between cIAP2 and the NF-κB pathway was explored via western blotting (WB) and a dual luciferase reporter system. Finally, nude mouse models of liver cancer were established to detect the effect of cIAP2 on tumourigenicity and the proliferation activity of orthotopic HCC cells.Key findings:cIAP2 expression was significantly increased in HCC tissues and was correlated with intravascular thrombosis in HCC. High cIAP2 expression was correlated with poor patient prognosis. cIAP2 knockdown significantly reduced the proliferation and invasion of BEL7402 and HepG2 cells and the activity of the NF-κB pathway. Animal experiments showed that cIAP2 knockdown reduced the tumourigenicity of HepG2 cells in the liver of nude mice and the proliferation activity of the orthotopic HCC cells.Significance:cIAP2 plays an important role in HCC proliferation and invasion and may exert its effects via the NF-κB signalling pathway.
