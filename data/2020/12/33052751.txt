Aim: To explore the prognostic significance of Syt-7 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the potential mechanisms. Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the expression of Syt-7. Overall survival and disease-free survival were compared between Syt-7 positive and negative groups. The effects of Syt-7 knockdown on BEL-7404 cells were further evaluated. Results: Syt-7 expression was significantly higher in HCC tumorous tissues compared with paracancerous tissues. Syt-7 was closely associated with Î±-fetoprotein tumor size, vascular invasion, tumor node metastasis stage and tumor differentiation. Syt-7 was an independent risk factor for overall survival and disease-free survival. Additionally, Syt-7 knockdown inhibited proliferation and colony formation and induced cell cycle arrest in HCC cells. Conclusion: Syt-7 overexpression forecasts unfavorable prognosis and promotes cell proliferation in HCC.
