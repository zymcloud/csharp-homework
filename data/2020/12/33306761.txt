The current review unfolds the procedural steps and the clinical evidence for yttrium-90 (90Y)-microspheres radioembolization. Radioembolization is part of the loco-regional therapeutic spectrum for liver malignancy and involves the invasive, intra-arterial delivery of microspheres carrying Î²-emitter isotopes in order to destroy cancerous tissue via ionizing radiation. The main steps of the therapeutic process are selection of eligible patients, angiographic workup, simulation scintigraphy, pre-treatment dosimetry, actual treatment and post-treatment imaging/dosimetry. Radioembolization is routinely applied in advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet its role is being investigated even in earlier stages. Prospective, randomized controlled trials did not verify increased overall survival of radioembolization over systemic treatment with sorafenib in HCC; however, it showed survival benefit in certain sub-groups and a favorable toxicity profile with fewer adverse events. Radioembolization is also applied in metastatic colon cancer showing tumoral liver responses, which however did not translate into an overall survival benefit. Data regarding applications of this method in other neoplasms, such as neuroendocrine tumors, breast cancer and melanoma are also presented. There are ongoing clinical trials to define the role of radioembolization within recent treatments algorithms, to determine optimal combinations of this treatment with systemic and targeted therapies and to decide the patients' sub-groups, who will benefit the most.
