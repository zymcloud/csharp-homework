Melatonin plays physiological roles in various critical processes, including circadian rhythms, oxidative stress defenses, anti-inflammation responses, and immunity; however, the current understanding of the role of melatonin in hepatic glucose metabolism is limited. In this study, we examined whether melatonin affects gene expression of the key gluconeogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). We found that melatonin treatment increased PEPCK mRNA levels in rat highly differentiated hepatoma (H4IIE) cells and primary cultured hepatocytes. In addition, we found that melatonin induction was synergistically enhanced by dexamethasone, whereas it was dominantly inhibited by insulin. We also report that the effect of melatonin was blocked by inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK), RNA polymerase II, and protein synthesis. Furthermore, the phosphorylated (active) forms of ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1/2) increased 15 min after melatonin treatment. We performed luciferase reporter assays to show that melatonin specifically stimulated promoter activity of the PEPCK gene. Additional reporter analysis using 5'-deleted constructs revealed that the regulatory regions responsive to melatonin mapped to two nucleotide regions, one between -467 and -398 nucleotides and the other between -128 and +69 nucleotides, of the rat PEPCK gene. Thus, we conclude that melatonin induces PEPCK gene expression via the ERK1/2 pathway at the transcriptional level, and that induction requires de novo protein synthesis.
