The tunable cobalt oxide nanoparticles (CoONPs) are produced due to the phytochemicals present in Rhamnus virgata (RhV) leaf extract which functions as reducing and stabilization agents. The synthesis of CoONPs was confirmed using different analytical techniques: UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamics light scatterings (DLS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy dispersive X-ray, and Raman spectroscopy analyses. Furthermore, multiple biological activities were performed. Significant antifungal and antibacterial potentials have been reported. The in vitro cytotoxic assays of CoONPs revealed strong anticancer activity against human hepatoma HUH-7 (IC50 : 33.25 μg/ml) and hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 (IC50 : 11.62 μg/ml) cancer cells. Dose-dependent cytotoxicity potency was confirmed against Leishmania tropica (KMH23 ); amastigotes (IC50 : 58.63 μg/ml) and promastigotes (IC50 : 32.64 μg/ml). The biocompatibility assay using red blood cells (RBCs; IC50 : 4,636 μg/ml) has confirmed the bio-safe nature of CoONPs. On the whole, results revealed nontoxic nature of RhV-CoONPs with promising biological potentials.
