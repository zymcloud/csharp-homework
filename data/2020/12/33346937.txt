Background & aims:Differentiation antagonizing non-protein coding RNA is associated with various types of neoplasms. Hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma has a high risk of recurrence. Here, we determined the role of differentiation antagonizing non-protein coding RNA in hepatitis C virus-related hepatocarcinogenesis and identified potential therapeutic targets and non-invasive prognostic markers for long-term outcome of hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma after surgical resection.Methods:Differentiation antagonizing non-protein coding RNAs relevant to hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma were identified through comparative RNA-sequencing of tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues in a screening set, and were validated using real-time PCR. Target lncRNAs in tissues and serum exosomes were used to predict the recurrence of hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma after curative surgical resection in a large application cohort from 2005-2012.Results:We confirmed that differentiation antagonizing non-protein coding RNA was upregulated following hepatitis C virus infection and identified as the lncRNA most relevant to hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma in tumor tissues as compared to that in adjacent non-tumor tissues. In 183 hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma patients followed for 10 years after curative HCC resection, the expression level of circulating exosomal differentiation antagonizing non-protein coding RNA was positively associated with HCC recurrence and was the most predictive factor associated with HCC recurrence and mortality (hazard ratio/95% confidence intervals: 7.0/4.3-11.6 and 2.7/1.5-5.1, respectively).Conclusions:Differentiation antagonizing non-protein coding RNA is highly relevant to disease progression of hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma. Our finding indicated that circulating exosomal differentiation antagonizing non-protein coding RNA might serve as a non-invasive prognostic biomarker for hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma.
