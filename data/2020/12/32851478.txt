Background:Calprotectin is a heterodimer formed by S100A8 and S100A9 proteins which are enhanced during hepatic carcinogenesis and the increased expression of both proteins promotes malignant progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. The potential correlation between ascitic Calprotectin and HCC was not studied.Methods:100 patients were stratified into a case group which enrolled 50 patients with cirrhotic ascites and documented HCC and a control group consisted of 50 patients with cirrhotic ascites without HCC. They were evaluated by liver function tests, abdominal ultrasound and routine ascitic fluid examination including ascetic Calprotectin and results were validated in another group (n = 100).Results:Calprotectin level was significantly higher in the HCC group with insignificant difference regarding total cell count, PNLs, ascitic albumin, LDH, CEA and SAAG. It correlated with serum creatinine (r = 0.245, p = 0.014) and number of focal hepatic lesions (r = 0.309, p = 0.002). In the validation group, 28 patients had elevated ascitic Calprotectin of which 21 patients had developed HCC (75%) after a mean period of 3.8 Â± 1.54 months. A cut of value 126 ng/ml was accurate to predict HCC in liver cirrhosis with ascites with a sensitivity of 93.3% specificity 94%, AUC 0.950, Youden's J value = 0.873, p = 0.0001.Conclusion:Ascitic Calprotectin may offer an easy, affordable marker that can predict the early occurrence of HCC.
