Long waiting times due to ongoing organ shortage have led to increased utilization of locoregional therapies (LRTs) to bridge patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to liver transplantation (LT). We performed this study to evaluate the impact of LRTs on post-LT outcomes. We conducted a retrospective study of patients who were transplanted for HCC at Stanford University Hospital between 2008 and 2018 (n = 302). We found that receipt of ≥5 LRTs was an independent and significant predictor of poor overall 5-year survival (58.3% vs. 83.3%; HR 2.26, p = .03), poor recurrence-free 5-year survival (51.9% vs. 80.4%; HR 2.12, p = .03), and was associated with higher rates of recurrence (25.0% vs. 7.4%, p = .001). Moreover, recurrent HCC was more likely to be the cause of death (58.3% vs. 41.7%, p = .04) in patients who received ≥5 LRTs. Also, patients who required ≥5 LRTs showed an overall lower rate of radiological complete response (46.9% vs. 97.8%, p = .001) and were more likely to have more advanced pathological stage tumors in the explant (65.6% vs. 29.6%, p
