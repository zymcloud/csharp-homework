We read with interest the article by Balci et al1 . The authors have to be commended for their enthusiastic efforts in reporting their first successful case of left liver living donor liver transplantation (LL-LDLT) using the so-called RAPID procedure (i.e, first stage consisting in left hepatectomy of the cirrhotic liver followed by left liver graft auxiliary transplantation and second stage consisting in hepatectomy of the remaining right cirrhotic liver) in an adult cirrhotic patient with hepatocellular carcinoma.
