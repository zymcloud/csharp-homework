The role of the Androgen Receptor (AR) expression and its activity in the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains inconclusive. The aim of this study is to analyze the role of the AR expression and its activity as prognostic biomarkers in HCC. Three-hundred and thirty-seven patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (107 females; 59.42 years [SD = 13.0]) were included. To infer AR activity, the expression-profile of previously validated androgen responsive genes (ARGs) was included. AR activity was shown by the AR-Score-21 (21 ARGs) and AR-Score-13 (13 ARGs) that were computed based on the expression of the selected ARGs. Those ARGs whose expression was significantly different between histological grades were used for computing two new AR-Scores. HCC patients with higher AR expression showed a higher median overall survival (OS). AR-Score 21 and AR-Score-13 did not show any association with prognosis. Six of the 21 ARGs of the AR-Score-21 and 7 of the 13 ARGs of the AR-Score-13 showed a significant different expression profile among histological grades. Based on these differences, another two AR-Scores were computed (AR-Score-6 and AR-Score-7). They showed the relative increase of upregulated to downregulated ARGs in high-grade HCC. Higher AR activity inferred by these AR-Scores was associated with worse outcomes. The expression of AR is associated with a better prognosis in HCC. However, the activity of the AR seems to be qualitatively different among histological grades. The AR activity inferred by the shifted ARGs is associated with a worse prognosis in HCC patients.
