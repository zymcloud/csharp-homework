Purpose:To assess the safety and efficacy of transarterial yttrium-90 radioembolization via the cystic artery for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) adjacent to the gallbladder with cystic artery supply.Materials and methods:This retrospective study included 17 patients treated at 4 institutions. Patients with HCC perfused by the cystic artery who received ablative-dose radioembolization were included. Median tumor size was 3.8 cm (range, 2.0-8.8 cm). Fourteen patients (82%) had Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis and 3 (18%) had class B cirrhosis. Adverse events, tumor response, and time to progression were analyzed.Results:Median dose to the tissue perfused by the cystic artery was 340 Gy (range, 200-720 Gy). There were no occurrences of acute cholecystitis warranting invasive intervention. Four patients (24%) experienced transient right upper quadrant pain, with symptom resolution within 3 mo. Six patients (35%) exhibited gallbladder wall edema on follow-up imaging. Two (12%) and 0 grade 3/4 increases in alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin were observed, respectively. Follow-up imaging demonstrated complete response in 13 target tumors (76%) and partial response in 4 (24%). There were no cases of target tumor progression during a median follow-up of 9 mo (range, 3-72 mo).Conclusions:Direct infusion of 90Y microspheres via the cystic artery appears to have an acceptable safety profile, without resulting in acute cholecystitis warranting invasive intervention. In selected patients with HCC in whom other treatments may be contraindicated and the tumor is supplied via the cystic artery, treatment with selective ablative radioembolization can be considered.
