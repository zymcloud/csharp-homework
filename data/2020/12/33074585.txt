Emerging hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been sequentially reported in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) treated with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Homeobox transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR), an oncogene, has been reported to be associated with cancer. We investigated the predictive value of lnc-HOTAIR for HCC surveillance in chronic HCV patients following DAAs therapy. The expression levels of lnc-HOTAIR and ATG-7 genes were measured in 220 with chronic HCV, following a DAAs based therapy for 12 weeks, the patients were followed-up for attentive surveillance of HCC for 12 months after starting DAAs. In terms of lnc-HOTAIR, patients with HCC and high viral load had significantly higher median expression levels of HOTAIR of (68 vs. 24; p = .001) and (94 vs. 52; p = .001), respectively. Moreover, the median expression level of ATG-7 was higher in those who developed HCC (114 vs. 51; p = .001). The expression of lnc-HOTAIR and ATG-7 are significant predictors of the development of HCC in HCV-4 infected patients treated with DAAs, with a cut-off value of 37 and 86, respectively. The increased expression levels of lnc-HOTAIR more than 68 in HCC patients following DAAs were correlated with poorer disease outcomes compared to those with lower expression levels; however, ATG-7 expression levels more than 114 were correlated with worse overall survival but not the progression-free one. We suggest that high expression levels of lnc-HOTAIR could serve as a risk assessment biomarker for HCC before and during DAAs course therapy in Chronic HCV-4 patients, and should be rigorously taken into consideration before DAAs.
