Objective:The purpose of this study was to explore the function of circular ribonucleic acid (circRNA) zinc finger protein 292 (ZNF292) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:The expression of circRNA ZNF292 in Huh-7 cells was knocked down by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and the effect of circRNA ZNF292 knockdown on the proliferation of Huh-7 cells was analyzed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and colony formation assay. Then, flow cytometry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) were adopted to analyze the impacts of circRNA ZNF292 knockdown on the cycle distribution and apoptosis of Huh-7 cells. Besides, the influences of circRNA ZNF292 knockdown on Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway and its downstream molecules were detected via quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting.Results:Compared with those in siRNA-normal control (NC) group, the proliferation of Huh-7 cells was significantly inhibited and their cloning ability was remarkably weakened (pConclusions:Knock downing circRNA ZNF292 leads to cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, thus suppressing cell proliferation and promoting cell apoptosis. The regulatory mechanism of circRNA ZNF292 may involve the regulation of cell cycle and related genes.
