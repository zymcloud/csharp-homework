Background: Involvements of microRNA-22 (miR-22) in cancer have attracted much attention, but its role in diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still largely unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the expression level and the prognostic value of miR-22 in HCC patients.Methods: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to evaluate serum level of miR-22 in 108 HCC patients and 67 healthy controls. The relationship between miR-22 expression level and clinicopathologic characteristics was analysed via chi-square test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was built to estimate the diagnostic value of serum miR-22 in HCC.Results: miR-22 expression was significantly down-regulated in HCC compared to that in healthy controls (p < .05). And the low miR-22 expression was significantly associated with vein invasion (p = .002), TNM stage (p = .013) and high serum levels of AFP (Î±-fetoprotein), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALP (alkaline phosphatase. miR-22 had a high diagnostic value with area under the curve of 0.866 corresponding with a sensitivity of 89.3% and a specificity of 68.9%, respectively.Conclusion: miR-22 expression was down-regulated in HCC patients. Serum miR-22 might be a novel diagnostic marker in HCC.
