Objective:We evaluated the morbidity and mortality after anatomical hepatectomy with the Glissonean pedicle approach, and long-term outcomes in relation to the morbidity in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Summary background data:The mortality, morbidity, and long-term outcomes were evaluated retrospectively.Methods:1953 patients with HCC underwent various anatomical hepatectomies with the Glissonean pedicle approach between 1985 and 2014. The mortality (30-day and 90-day) and morbidity (Clavien-Dindo class IIIa or higher) were evaluated among six 5-year eras (1985-1989, 1990-1994, 1995-1999, 2000-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2014).Results:460 patients (24%) showed morbidity, and the overall 30-day and 90-day mortality rates were 1.8% and 3.3%, respectively. The 30-day (3.9%, 3.0%, 1.8%, 1.3%, 0.3%, 0.5%: p = 0.0074) and 90-day mortality (6.0%, 4.3%, 3.8%, 2.8%, 2.2%, 1.4%: p = 0.0445) significantly improved over the eras. Blood loss >2 L (Odd ratio: 11.808, p = 0.0244) was an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality, and blood loss >2 L (Odd ratio: 4.046, p = 0.0271) and bile leakage (Odd ratio: 2.122, p = 0.0078) were independent risk factors for 90-day mortality on multivariate analysis. Morbidity was significant independent prognostic factors for overall survival (Relative Risk: 2.129, p Conclusions:Anatomical hepatectomy with the Glissonean pedicle approach was achieved safely in patients with HCC. For more safety and longer survival, blood loss, bile leakage, and morbidity should be reduced. Long-term outcomes after anatomical hepatectomy with the Glissonean pedicle approach in patients with HCC have been improved over 30 years with gradually less mortality and morbidity due to decreases in blood loss>2L and bile leakage.
