Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is a crucial physiological and pathological process takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum that usually induced by various intracellular and extracellular factors. It causes multiple diseases, including breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and premature ovarian failure that mainly associates with the ovarian granulosa cells. To effectively alleviate and cure the ERS and following diseases, molecular signaling pathways that are responsible for inducing ERS must be deeply investigated. There are many intracellular pathways to initiate the ERS, among which, detailed molecular mechanism the UFM1-specific ligase 1 (UFL1) gene induced analogous ubiquitylation related pathway is still unclear. However, some researches have reported that the UFL1 gene is responsible for initiating the ERS in the ovarian granulosa cell and premature ovarian failure. In this article, a new, highly possible molecular signaling pathway is proposed and hoping to provide a unique aspect for the following researches about ERS, especially in the ovarian granulosa cell.
