Background & aims:Although the tumor microenvironment plays an important role in tumor growth, it is not fully understood what role hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play in the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) microenvironment.Methods:A high-fat-diet following streptozotocin was administered to HSC-specific Atg7-deficient (GFAP-Atg7KO) or GDF15-dificient (GFAP-GDF15KO) mice. LX-2 cells, a human HSC cell line, were cultured with human hepatoma cells.Results:In the steatohepatitis-based tumorigenesis (STAM) model, GFAP-Atg7KO mice formed fewer and smaller liver tumors than their wild-type littermates. Mixed culture of LX-2 cells and hepatoma cells promoted LX-2 cell autophagy and hepatoma cell proliferation, which were attenuated by Atg7 knockout in LX-2 cells. Hepatoma cell xenograft tumors grew rapidly in the presence of LX-2 cells, but Atg7 knockout in LX-2 cells abolished this growth. RNA-sequencing revealed that LX-2 cells cultured with HepG2 cells highly expressed growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), which was abolished by Atg7 knockout in LX-2 cells. GDF15 knockout LX-2 cells did not show a growth-promoting effect on hepatoma cells either in vitro or in the xenograft model. GDF15 deficiency in HSCs reduced liver tumor size caused by the STAM model. GDF15 was highly expressed and GDF15-positive non-parenchymal cells were more abundant in human HCC compared to non-cancerous parts. Single-cell RNAseq showed that GDF15-positive rates in HSCs were higher in HCC than in background liver. Serum GDF15 levels were high in HCC patients and increased with tumor progression.Conclusions:In the HCC microenvironment, an increase of HSCs that produce GDF15 in an autophagy-dependent manner may be involved in tumor progression.
