Objectives:To assess the inter-reader variability in response assessment for HCC treated with radioembolization (TARE) compared with 3D quantitative criteria (qEASL); and to evaluate their role in prediction of pathological necrosis and clinical outcomes.Materials and methods:57 patients with 77 HCCs who underwent TARE were included. Five radiologists recorded multiple imaging features and assigned mRECIST/LIRADS Treatment Response (TR) categories on post-treatment MRI at 4-6 weeks and 6-9 months after TARE. qEASL categories were assigned by a separate reader. Inter-reader variability between LIRADS TR/mRECIST/qEASL were evaluated and hazards regression was used in predicting clinical outcomes.Results:Inter-reader agreement was fair for mRECIST (K = 0.43 and 0.34 at first and second follow-up respectively); moderate for LIRADS TR (K = 0.48 and 0.53 at first and second follow-up respectively). Inter-criterion agreement was moderate to substantial (r = 0.41-0.65 and r = 0.54-0.60 at first and second follow-up) for mRECIST-qEASL. LIRADS TR correlated well with qEASL for all readers at both follow-ups (K = 0.45-0.78; K = 0.39-0.77 for first and second follow-up). qEASL was the most accurate in predicting Tumor-Free Survival (TFS) on first (HR 2.23 [1.44-3.46], p Conclusions:HCC response assessment following TARE is challenging, resulting in poor to moderate inter-reader agreement for mRECIST, and moderate inter-reader agreement for LIRADS TR response assessment criteria. qEASL outperformed mRECIST criteria for early identification of responders and predicting TFS, suggesting an advantage in volumetric tumor response assessment. LIRADS TR outperformed other criteria in predicting pathological necrosis.
