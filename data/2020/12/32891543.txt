Background and study aims:Many patients are diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the late stage when it is already untreatable. Therefore, there is an increased need for sensitive biomarkers to detect HCC at an earlier stage in high risk patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced cirrhosis. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of soluble cluster of differentiation 26/dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (sCD26/sDPP4) and glypican-3 (GPC3) as serum biomarkers for the early detection of HCV related HCC and compare it with that of the conventional tumor marker serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP).Patients and methods:The study included 80 participants, 30 patients diagnosed with HCV infection without HCC (HCV group), 30 patients diagnosed with HCV- related HCC (HCV group), and 20 healthy volunteers (control group). The serum levels of GPC3 and sCD26 were measured using specific enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) kits, whereas AFP levels were determined using chemiluminescence.Results:The serum levels of both sCD26 and GPC3 were found to be significantly higher in patients with early-stage HCC than in the HCV group, (1450 and 1.16 ng/mL, respectively). sCD26 at a cutoff value of > 1000 ng/ml, showed a high sensitivity (83.3%) and 63.3% specificity with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.811 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of (0.682-0.94). While, the combination of GPC3 and sCD26 exhibited the best diagnostic performance for early-stage-HCC because it increased the sensitivity and specificity (85% and 93.3% respectively), with an AUC of 0.986 and a 95% CI of (0.899-1.00) compared to sCD26 alone.Conclusion:We conclude that serum sCD26 could be a sensitive biomarker for the early detection of HCC among HCV patients. Moreover, the combination of sCD26 and GPC3 increases both the sensitivity and specificity for the early detection of HCV related HCC compared with AFP and could help in the monitoring of HCC in high risk patients with HCV induced cirrhosis.
