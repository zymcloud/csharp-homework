Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem worldwide. Conventional therapies covering either chemotherapy or combination therapy still have sub-optimal responses with significant adverse effects and toxicity. Moreover, tumor cells usually acquire resistance quickly for traditional approaches, limiting their use in HCC. Interest in nanomedicine due to minimal systemic toxicity and a high degree of target-specific drug-delivery have pulled the attention of health scientists in this area of therapeutics.Area covered:The review covers the incidence and epidemiology of HCC, proposed molecular drug targets, mechanistic approach and emergence of nanomedicines including nanoparticles, lipidic nanoparticles, vesicular based nanocarrier, virus-like particles with momentous therapeutic aspects including biocompatibility, and toxicity of nanocarriers along with conclusions and future perspective, with efficient approach to safely cross physiological barriers to reach the target site for treating liver cancer.Expert opinion:Remarkable outcomes have recently been observed for the therapeutic efficacy of nanocarriers with respect to a specific drug target against the treatment of HCC by existing under trial drugs.
