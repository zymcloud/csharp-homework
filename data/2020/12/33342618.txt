Progressive liver fibrosis may result in cirrhosis, portal hypertension and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. We performed a meta-analysis to compare liver fibrosis staging in chronic liver disease patients using 2-D shear wave elastography (2-D SWE) and point shear wave elastography (pSWE). The PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases were searched until May 31, 2020 for studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of 2-D SWE and pSWE in assessing liver fibrosis. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, diagnostic odds ratios and area under receiver operating characteristic curve were estimated using the bivariate random effects model. As a result, 71 studies with 11,345 patients were included in the analysis. The pooled sensitivities of 2-D SWE and pSWE significantly differed for the detection of significant fibrosis (F â‰¥ 2; 0.84 vs. 0.76, p
