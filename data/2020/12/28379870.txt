Objective:The aim of the study was to determine the prognostic impact of co-existence of APC and PIK3CA mutations in patients undergoing preoperative chemotherapy and resection for colorectal liver metastases (CLM).Background:Co-occurring genetic events have been shown to drive carcinogenesis in multiple malignancies.Methods:We identified 396 patients with primary colorectal cancer and known somatic mutation status by next-generation sequencing who underwent hepatectomy for CLM (2005-2015). Survival after hepatectomy in patients with double mutation of APC and PIK3CA and others was analyzed. Predictors of pathologic response and survival were determined. The prognostic value of double mutation was evaluated with a separate cohort of 157 patients with CLM undergoing chemotherapy alone.Results:Forty-five patients had double mutation of APC and PIK3CA; 351 did not. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) after hepatectomy were worse in patients with double mutation (3-year RFS, 3.1% vs 20% [P < 0.001]; 3-year OS, 44% vs 84% [P < 0.001]). Independent predictors of major pathologic response were bevacizumab use (odds ratio [OR] 2.22; P = 0.001), tumor size <3 cm (OR 1.97; P = 0.004), wild-type RAS (OR 2.00; P = 0.003), and absence of double mutation (OR 2.91; P = 0.002). Independent predictors of worse OS were primary advanced T category (hazard ratio [HR] 2.12; P = 0.021), RAS mutation (HR 1.74; P = 0.015), and double mutation (HR 3.09; P < 0.001). In the different medical cohort, patients with double mutation had worse 3-year OS of 18%, compared with 35% without double mutation (P = 0.023).Conclusions:Double mutation of APC and PIK3CA predicts inferior response to preoperative chemotherapy and poor survival in patients with CLM.
