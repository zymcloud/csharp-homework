The rising prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) presents many public health challenges, including a substantial impact on healthcare resource utilization and costs. There are important regional differences in the burden of NAFLD/NASH, and Spain-specific data are lacking. This retrospective, observational study examined the impact of liver disease severity, comorbidities, and demographics on healthcare resource utilization and costs in Spain.NAFLD/NASH patients in the Spanish National Health System's Hospital Discharge Records Database (1/1/2006 to 4/30/2017) were categorized into disease severity cohorts as NAFLD/NASH overall, NAFLD/NASH non-progressors, compensated cirrhosis (CC), decompensated cirrhosis (DCC), liver transplant (LT), or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients were followed from index date until the earliest of 6 months, disease progression, end of coverage, death, or end of study. Within each cohort, pre- and post-index healthcare resource utilization and costs per patient per month (PPPM) were calculated.A total of 8,205 patients (mean age 58.4; 54% male) were identified; 5,984 (72.9%) were non-progressors, 139 (1.7%) progressed to CC, 2,028 (24.7%) to DCC, 115 (1.4%) to LT, and 61 (0.7%) to HCC. Pre-index comorbidity burden was high across disease cohorts, and the frequency of comorbidities increased with disease severity. From pre- to post-index, average length of stay (LOS) increased significantly (23%-41%) as did all-cause PPPM costs (44%-46%), with significantly longer LOS and costs in patients with increasing disease severity.Progression of NAFLD/NASH was associated with significantly higher costs and longer LOS. A coordinated approach is needed to manage resources and costs in Spain.
