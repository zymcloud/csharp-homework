CD45+CD71+ erythroid cells generated through splenic extramedullary erythropoiesis have recently been found to suppress anti-infection and tumor immunity in neonates and adults with malignances. However, their role in tumor microenvironment has not been investigated. In the present study, we found that the number of CD45+CD71+ erythroid cells was significantly elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues compared to that in paratumor region and circulation. Additionally, they were more abundant in HCC tissues compared to some immune suppressive cells as well as CD45-CD71+ erythroid cells. CD45+CD71+ erythroid cells suppressed T cells through generation of reactive oxygen species, IL-10, and TGF-Î² in a paracrine and cell-cell contact manner, and their suppressive effect was stronger than that of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. The abundance of CD45+CD71+ erythroid cells in tumor tissue, as illustrated via immunofluorescence, predicted disease-free survival and overall survival, and its prognostic value was better than that of Cancer of the Liver Italian Program score. This study demonstrated that accumulation of intratumoral CD45+CD71+ erythroid cells in HCC tissues could play a superior immunosuppressive role in tumor microenvironment and may serve as a valuable biomarker to predict recurrence of HCC.
