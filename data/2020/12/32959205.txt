Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is a multifunctional protein that plays a role in chronic liver diseases and fibrogenesis. The present study aimed to investigate the possible association of VAP-1 levels with the severity of disease progression in chronic hepatitis (CH) B and C patients with differing stages of fibrosis (F0-4), CHB/CHC-related cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The VAP-1 concentration in patient sera was determined by ELISA. The VAP-1 levels were compared between the F0 group and the F1, F2, F3, F4, cirrhosis, and HCC groups of CHB patients and between the F1 group and the F2, F3, F4, cirrhosis, and HCC groups of CHC patients. The levels of VAP-1 were significantly increased in CHB patients with progressive stages of fibrosis, with the highest concentration being found in those with stage F4 (severe fibrosis). A statistically significant difference was found between F0 and F4 in patients with CHB, but no statistically significant difference was observed between F1 and F4 in patients with CHC. Interestingly, there was no statistically significant difference in VAP-1 levels between patients with cirrhosis and HCC (either CHB or CHC, independently). Moreover, no relationship was found between VAP-1 and ALT levels in either CHC or CHB patients. In general, the VAP-1 levels were significantly higher in CHB than in CHC patients (P
