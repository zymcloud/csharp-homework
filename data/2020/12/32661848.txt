Introduction:Most of the literature has only reported outcomes on robotic minor non-anatomical hepatectomy. This study was undertaken to analyze and examine the safety, feasibly, and perioperative outcomes of robotic major hepatectomy at our institution.Methods:All patients undergoing robotic major hepatectomy were prospectively followed. Major hepatectomy was defined as a resection of 3 or more segments. Data are expressed as median (mean ± SD).Results:A total of 170 consecutive patients underwent robotic hepatectomies, of which 100 were major resections involving at least 3 segments. The 100 patients were of median 62 (61 ± 13.0) years, and 46% were women. Median BMI was 29 (29 ± 5.9) kg/m2 and median ASA class was 3 (3 ± 0.5). Thirty percent of robotic major hepatectomies were for hepatocellular carcinoma, 28% were for metastatic adenocarcinoma, 9% were for cholangiocarcinoma, and 5% were for metastatic neuroendocrine tumor. Prep time (in the room until incision) was a median 58 min (62 ± 18.4), extraction time (incision until specimen extraction) was 124 min (146 ± 99.5), console time was 198 min (210 ± 123.9), closure time (extraction until dressing placement) was 109 min (131 ± 93.8), operative duration was 246 min (269 ± 123.2), and time under anesthesia was 330 min (353 ± 109.6). Estimated blood loss was 175 ml (249 ± 275.9) and length of stay was 4 days (5 ± 4.3). Seven patients experienced postoperative complications. Thirteen patients were readmitted within 30 days, and one patient died within 30 days.Conclusion:Application of the robotic platform to major hepatectomy is safe and feasible. Our early experience shows that this minimally invasive approach results in excellent short-term outcomes.
