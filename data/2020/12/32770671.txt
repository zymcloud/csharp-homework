Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Lipogenesis has been considered as a critical player in HCC initiation and progression. However, the underlying mechanism is still not fully understood. Here, we identified zinc fingers and homeoboxes 2 (ZHX2), an HCC-associated tumor suppressor, as an important repressor of de novo lipogenesis. Ectopic expression of ZHX2 significantly inhibited de novo lipogenesis in HCC cells and decreased expression of FASN, ACL, ACC1, and SCD1. In accordance with this, ZHX2 was negatively associated with SREBP1c, the master regulator of de novo lipogenesis, in HCC cell lines and human specimens. Results from silencing and overexpression demonstrated that ZHX2 inhibited de novo lipogenesis and consequent HCC progression via repression of SREBP1c. Furthermore, treatment with the SREBP1c inhibitor fatostatin dampened the spontaneous formation of tumors in liver-specific Zhx2 knockout mice. Mechanistically, ZHX2 increased expression of miR-24-3p transcriptionally, which targeted SREBP1c and led to its degradation. In conclusion, our data suggest a novel mechanism through which ZHX2 suppresses HCC progression, which may provide a new strategy for the treatment of HCC.
