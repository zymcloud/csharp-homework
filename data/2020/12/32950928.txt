Background:Currently, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with refractory ascites (RA) have a very poor prognosis, and there are no effective treatments recommended by the guidelines. A treatment strategy that utilizes a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) combined with subsequent antitumor treatment is explored in this study for its feasibility and clinical value.Methods:One month after TIPS, the ascites grade and Child-Pugh scores and stages were reassessed to compare changes in the preoperative indicators.Results:A total of 68 patients from 3 centers were enrolled. After TIPS, the following results were obtained: a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or absent RA response (AR) of 38 [55.9%], 21 [30.9%], and 9 [13.2%], respectively. The control of RA was 86.8%. The median Child-Pugh scores prior to TIPS and one month after TIPS were 8 (IQR 7-9) and 7 (IQR 6-8), respectively. The down, unchanged, and elevated Child-Pugh stages were 26 [38.2%], 36 [53.0%], and 6 [8.8%], respectively. The postoperative Child-Pugh scores were significantly lower than the preoperative (p Conclusion:As a minimally invasive method, TIPS can effectively control ascites and improve Child-Pugh scores and stages. TIPS combined with subsequent anti-tumor therapy is a feasible and effective management for HCC patients with RA.
