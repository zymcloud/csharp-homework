This study aimed to evaluate the risk concerning child population's health because of the occurrence of AFM1 in UHT milk, powdered milk (PM) and infant formulae (IF). Determination of AFM1 was performed in 60 samples and evaluation of the mycotoxin exposure was carried out through the determination of the estimated daily intake (EDI), whereas risk characterization was evaluated with the calculation of the risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) and the Margin of Exposure (MOE). AFM1 ranged from 150 to 1,020 ng/kg, and all the positive samples exceeded the limits stablished by European Community. The EDI for AFM1 ranged according to the age group of the population studied (0-5 years old) from 0.828-2.523, 0-2.113 and 0.029-0.833 ng/kg b.w./day in UHT, PM and IF, respectively. The number of HCC cases associated with AFM1 exposure (0.0015 a 0.0045) was higher than the limit of 0.001 case/100,000. MOE values for AFM1 were 728 to 239, considerably below the security margin of 10,000. These results point to a potential risk to the health of Brazilian child population exposed to AFM1 in dairy products.
