Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor with rapid progression, high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. The objective of our investigation was to explore the prognostic value of CDK5R1 in HCC.Methods:The raw data of HCC raw data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Kruskal-Wallis test and logistic regression were applied to investigate the relevance between the CDK5R1 expression and clinicopathologic characteristics in HCC. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis were employed to examine the association between clinicopathologic features and survival. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was applied to annotate the biological function of CDK5R1.Results:CDK5R1 was highly expressed in HCC tissues. The high expression of CDK5R1 in HCC tissues was significantly associated with tumor status (P=0.00), new tumor event (P=0.00), clinical stage (P=0.00), topography (P=0.00). Elevated CDK5R1 had significant correlation with worse overall survival (OS) (P=7.414e-04), disease-specific survival (DSS) (P=5.642e-04), disease-free interval (DFI) (P=1.785e-05), and progression-free interval (PFI) (P=2.512e-06). Besides, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis uncovered that increased CDK5R1 can independently predict adverse OS (P=0.037, hazard ratio [HR]=1.7 (95% CI [1.0-2.7])), DFI (P=0.007, hazard ratio [HR]=3.0 (95% CI [1.4-6.7])), PFI (P=0.007, hazard ratio [HR]=2.8 (95% CI [1.3-5.9])). GSEA disclosed that notch signaling pathway and non-small cell lung cancer were prominently enriched in CDK5R1 high expression phenotype.Conclusions:Increased CDK5R1 may act as a promising independent prognostic factor of poor survival in HCC.
