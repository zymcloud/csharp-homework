Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, especially in developing countries. Although advances in surgical procedures and targeted medicine have improved the overall survival of patients with HCC, the prognosis is poor. Hence, there is a need to identify novel therapeutic targets for HCC. Here, we report that the expression of RP11-909N17.2, a novel, long, noncoding RNA (lncRNA), is dysregulated in patients with HCC and cell lines. Additionally, this study demonstrated that RP11-909N17.2 facilitates the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells by binding to miRNA-767-3p, a tumor-suppressive microRNA (miRNA). Small integral membrane protein 7 (SMIM7) was identified as the downstream target of miRNA-767-3p. The expression of SMIM7 was upregulated in HCC clinical samples and cell lines. Moreover, SMIM7 was involved in the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells. Furthermore, SMIM7 inhibited the apoptosis of HCC cells, which indicated the oncogenic role of SMIM7 in HCC. The findings of this study suggest that the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory axis, which regulates the pathogenesis of HCC, can be a potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic target for HCC.
