Purpose:Pediatric hepatocellular carcinoma is rarely seen in childhood. It constitutes approximately 1% of childhood solid organ malignancies. Pediatric hepatocellular carcinoma is the second most common malignant liver tumor after hepatoblastoma in children. In this review, we aimed to review the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric hepatocellular carcinoma in the light of the latest literature.Methods:We reviewed the literature in terms of the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric hepatocellular carcinoma.Results:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatoblastoma constitute 0.5-1.5% of all childhood malignant tumors. HCC is responsible for 27% of all liver tumors and 4% of all pediatric liver transplantations. While 99.6% of HCC is seen in adults, only 0.4% of it is seen in pediatric patients. Etiological predisposition and biological behavior are different from adults. In a child with cirrhosis or liver disease, HCC should be suspected in the presence of a high level of AFP and an abnormal nodule on ultrasonography. Hepatoblastoma should be considered first in the differential diagnosis.Conclusion:Treatment of pediatric HCC is challenging. Complete surgical resection is essential for the cure. To this end, different neoadjuvant chemotherapy protocols have been designed to convert non-resectable tumors into resectable tumors. For tumors that cannot be resected, liver transplantation for each patient with childhood HCC should be decided individually.
