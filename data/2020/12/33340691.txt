Accumulating studies revealed the vital role of ion channels in cancers, but the prognosis role of ion channels in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains limited. Here, we developed and validated an ion channel signature for prognostic prediction of HCC patients. In total, 35 differential expressed ion channel genes (DEChannelGs) were identified in HCC and a novel ion channel risk model was established for HCC prognosis prediction using the TCGA cohort, which was validated using the ICGC cohort. Moreover, this risk model was an independent prognostic factor and was associated with the immune microenvironment in HCC. Finally, the mRNA and protein levels of ANO10 and CLCN2 were prominently up-regulated and were related to the poor prognosis of HCC patients. Taken together, these results indicated a novel ion channel risk model as a prognostic biomarker for HCC patients and provided further insight into its immunoregulatory mechanism in HCC progression.
