A new sponge-type hydrogel was obtained by cross-linking hyaluronic acid (HA) and poly(methylvinylether-alt-maleic acid) P(MVE-alt-MA) through a solvent-free thermal method. The sponge-type hydrogel was characterized and checked as a support for cell growth. The influence of concentration and weight ratio of polymers on the morphology and hydrogel stability was investigated. The total polymers concentration of 3% (w/w) and the weight ratio of 1:1 were optimal for the synthesis of a stable hydrogel (HA3P50) and to promote cell proliferation. The swelling measurements revealed a high-water absorption capacity of the hydrogel in basic medium. Diphenhydramine (DPH), lidocaine (Lid) and propranolol (Prop) were loaded within the hydrogel as a model drugs to investigate the ability of drug transport and release. In vitro studies revealed that HA3P50 hydrogel promoted the adhesion and proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2, providing a good support for 3D cell culture to obtain surrogate tumor scaffold suitable for preclinical anti-cancer drug screening.
