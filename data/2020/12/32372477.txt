Highly upregulated in liver cancer (HULC) was initially recognized during the screening of a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-specific gene library. Further studies demonstrated its aberrant upregulation in several other tumor types. The oncogenic roles of this long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) have been verified through expression studies as well as functional studies. Moreover, the results of knockdown experiments have indicated diminished carcinogenic effects of cancer cell line in nude mice following HULC silencing. More recent studies have shown that expression levels of this lncRNA might be used as diagnostic biomarkers in cancer patients. Moreover, mechanistical studies have revealed associations between HULC and two HCC-related viruses namely hepatitis B and C viruses. Taken together, HULC can be regarded as a therapeutic target not only for HCC but also for a variety of human malignancies. In the current review, we summarized the recent literature about the role of HULC in the carcinogenesis and its potential application in cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
