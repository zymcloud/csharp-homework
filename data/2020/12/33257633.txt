HBV infection is a major public health issue that can lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The current study evaluated the prevalence of HBsAg and anti-HBsAb among HIV/AIDS patients in Shiraz, southern Iran. The subjects in this study comprised 251 participants previously confirmed for HIV infection registered at the Shiraz HIV/AIDS center in southern Iran. Peripheral whole blood (5 ml) was obtained from each participant and evaluated for HBsAg and anti-HBs antibodies, utilizing commercial ELISA kits. The 251 participants consisted of 158 (63.5%) males and 91 (36.5%) females. HBsAg and anti-HBsAb were detected in 16 (6.4%) and 117 (46.6%) cases, respectively, while five cases (2%) were positive for both viral markers. No statistically significant association was observed between patients' age, sex, or CD4+ cell count and seropositivity to HBsAg or anti-HBsAb. The findings of the study revealed a relatively high seroprevalence of HBsAg and anti-HBsAb among HIV patients, highlighting the importance of preventive and therapeutic programs in such patients.
