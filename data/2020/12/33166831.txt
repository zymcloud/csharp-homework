Purpose:To define the number of TACE sessions needed to improve patients' overall survival (OS) in different subgroups of unresectable HCC.Methods:This retrospective cohort included 180 patients who got TACE between 2005-2016 as the initial treatment for unresectable HCC. Tumor margin (well- vs. ill-defined) was determined by two radiologists at baseline. Well-defined group was divided into two groups (ADC-responders vs. ADC-nonresponders) based on %ADC change (Î”ADC-cutoff = 25 %). Accordingly, patients were categorized into three groups, ill-defined, well-defined ADC-responders, or well-defined ADC-nonresponders. Cox-analysis was used to compare the survival benefit of multiple TACE in different groups.Results:Ill-defined HCC (n = 108) was associated with worse survival (HR = 1.95,p Conclusion:The survival benefit of sequential TACE sessions varies for different HCC subgroups. There was no significant survival benefit associated with multiple TACE in well-defined lesions responding to the first TACE. The most survival benefit was for ADC-nonresponder well-defined group and it was least for ill-defined HCC group, regardless of ADC-response.
