Until a few decades ago, surgical resection was the only valid option for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, various locoregional modalities including arterial-directed therapy, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and radiotherapy have been recently shown to be effective. RFA is now established as a standard treatment for small localized HCCs, showing oncological results comparable to those of surgical resection in randomized studies. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a modern radiotherapeutic modality that targets tumors with precision and delivers high radiation doses over a short period of time; it has particularly attracted clinical interest after its therapeutic efficacy was found to be similar to that of surgery in early-stage lung cancer. Given its potent disease control capability, SBRT has also been applied to early HCCs and demonstrated promising results in recent studies. It has also been noted for its suitability to treat tumors located in anatomical locations where RFA would be challenging. However, since its effectiveness has not been compared to that of RFA in randomized studies of patients eligible for RFA, the use of SBRT has been debated. This review was conducted to guide physicians from all fields involved in the treatment of early HCC. The therapeutic characteristics and indications of both SBRT and RFA are described, and recent comparative studies between the two modalities are discussed. In addition, we examined the factors that should be considered when selecting the appropriate treatments, and offer our recommendations.
