In this paper, we prepared doxorubicin-loaded folic acid-functionalized pH-sensitive photothermal therapy (PTT) traceable hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DOX-HPCF) as a drug carrier for liver cancer treatment. According to TEM characterization, hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSN) are monodispersed spherical particles with hollow structure. In vitro drug release experiments showed that HPCF exhibited pH-sensitive release. Cell uptake experiments showed that HPCF was successfully absorbed by SMMC-7721 cells. In addition, DOX-HPCF significantly inhibited the proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells, and the near-infrared (NIR) light group showed a more obvious inhibitory effect. In vivo anti-tumor experiments showed that DOX-HPCF-assisted PTT inhibited tumor growth significantly. Therefore, HPCF is a promising photothermotherapy carrier for the treatment of liver cancer.
