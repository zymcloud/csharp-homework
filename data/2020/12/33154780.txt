Hepatocellular carcinoma is a serious public health problem in China. The mortality rate associated with the majority of cancer types has decreased as a result of targeted therapy. However, the mortality rates associated with hepatocellular carcinoma have not improved; therefore, the identification of new molecular targets is required for the development of novel targeted therapies. In the present study, a new molecular target, Rhophilin Rho GTPase-binding protein 2 (RHPN2), was identified. The levels of RHPN2 protein in tumor tissues were assessed via immunohistochemistry, while the mRNA levels were analyzed via reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Additionally, cell viability was tested via MTT analysis. RHPN2 expression was upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues compared with that of matched adjacent normal tissues. More importantly, low expression of RHPN2 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma was associated with an improved prognosis rate compared with patients with high expression. Downregulation of RHPN2 reduced the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and increased the rate of apoptosis, whereas overexpression of RHPN2 demonstrated the opposite effects. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1Î± was implicated in the mechanism of RHPN2. Overall, these data indicated that overexpression of RHPN2 may promote hepatocellular carcinoma.
