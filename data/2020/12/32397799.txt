Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, has increased public concern. Data from previous work have validated that long noncoding RNAs are active participators in the malignant processes of a host of cancers. Small nucleolar RNA host gene 7 (SNHG7) has been revealed to act as a tumor promoter in several cancers and SNHG7 inhibition was revealed to suppress cell invasion in HCC. Nevertheless, the specific role of SNHG7 in HCC deserves deeper exploration. Aim of the Study: This work aimed to uncover the role and the regulatory mechanisms of SNHG7 in HCC. Materials and Methods: The expression of SNHG7 and cyclin mediator 1 (CNNM1) in HCC cells were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The influences of SNHG7 on HCC occurrence were studied by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation, flow cytometry analysis, and Western blot assays. Luciferase reporter assay or RNA immunoprecipitation assay was conducted to confirm the relationship between miR-9-5p and SNHG7 (or CNNM1). Results: SNHG7 was overexpressed in HCC tissues and cell lines. SNHG7 facilitated cell proliferation, while suppressed cell apoptosis in HCC. Moreover, miR-9-5p expression was negatively modulated by SNHG7 and therefore was downregulated in HCC cells. We also found that CNNM1 existed in miR-9-5p induced RNA-induced silencing complex and a series of assays verified that CNNM1 acted as the target gene of miR-9-5p. Consequently, the messenger RNA and protein level of CNNM1 were detected to be inversely regulated by miR-9-5p. Moreover, rescue assays demonstrated that CNNM1 overexpression could countervail the SNHG7 depletion-mediated cellular functions of HCC cells. Conclusions: SNHG7 sponges miR-9-5p to upregulate CNNM1 in promoting HCC progression.
