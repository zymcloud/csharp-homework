Lymphoepithelioma-like hepatic carcinoma (LELC) is a rare distinctive variant of liver cancer with unique epidemiological and pathological characteristics, characterized by dense lymphocyte infiltration.It can be divided into lymphoepithelioma-like hepatocellular carcinoma (LEL-HCC) and lymphoepithelioma-like cholangiocarcinoma (LEL-CC). The diagnosis is mainly based on pathology, and the treatment is mainly surgery. The prognosis of LELC is good, which may be related to a large number of lymphocyte infiltration. The data of LELC is very limited, only a few case reports and small retrospective studies, which needs further exploration and research. Up to now, 67 cases of LEL-HCC and 34 cases of LEL-CC have been reported. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current research situation on LELC in terms of epidemiology, clinical treatment, pathology and research prospects.
