A couple of molecular-targeting medications, such as Lenvatinib, are available for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in addition to Sorafenib in an advanced stage. Approval for the use of immune check-point inhibitors, such as Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab has shifted the paradigm of current HCC treatment, and the monotherapy or in combination with Lenvatinib or Sorafenib has significantly extended overall survival or progression-free survival in a large portion of patients. A combination of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) inhibitor Atezolizumab with a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, Bevacizumab, has recently achieved promising outcome in unresectable HCC patients. Other immunotherapy, such as chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has achieved an evolutional success in hematologic malignancies, and has extended its use in deadly solid tumors, such as HCC. Although there exist various barriers, novel approaches are developed to move potential adoptive T cell therapy strategies, including cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), T cell receptor (TCR) T cells, CAR-T cells, to clinical application.
