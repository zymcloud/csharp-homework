Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), a bioactive component extracted from propolis of honeybee hives, can inhibit hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In order to explore more stable CAPE derivatives, 25 compounds were designed, synthesized, and pharmacologically assessed in vitro and in vivo as anti-tumor agents in HCC. Compounds 8d, 8f, 8l, 8j, and 8k showed favorable antiproliferative activity than other compounds including CAPE in the HCC cell lines. Based on the result of QTRP (Quantitative Thiol Reactivity Profiling), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) were supposed to the targets of 8f, which was confirmed by binding mode analysis. Furthermore, compounds 8f, 8l, 8j, 8k, 8g, and 8h showed potent inhibitory effects against both CSK and EGFR than other derivatives in an ADP-Gloâ„¢ kinase assay. The representative compound, 8f, potently inhibited various tumor growth in murine model including murine hepatocellular carcinoma H22, meanwhile downregulating the EGFR/AKT pathway and enhancing T cell proliferation through inhibition of CSK. Metabolic stability in vitro suggested 8f and 8k were more stable in mouse plasma than CAPE and susceptible to metabolism in liver microsomes. The overall excellent profile of compound 8f makes it a potential candidate for further preclinical investigation.
