The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) signal is related to the continuous amplification of inflammatory pathway. However, it is not clear whether and how HBV can regulated the expression of TREM-1 on monocyte participated in the progression of liver disease. Here, we showed that the expression of TREM-1 on monocyte subsets were increased significantly in HBV related liver cirrhosis group compared with chronic infected group and healthy control group. HBsAg and HBeAg could up-regulated TREM-1 on monocyte by NF-KB pathway, and at least last for 72 h. Increased TREM-1 on monocyte might associated with high level of inflammatory cytokine (TNF-a, IL-1Î² and IL-6) and the activation of LX-2 cells. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the high expression of TREM-1 was related to the poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The level of TREM-1 might help to predict the progression of HBV infected liver disease and treat target to prevent fibrosis progression.
