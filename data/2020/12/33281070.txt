Objective:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Protein kinase D1 (PKD1) is recognized as a key regulator in the progression in several solid cancers, while its clinical role in HCC is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation of PKD1 with clinical features and prognosis in HCC patients.Methods:A total of 218 HCC patients who underwent resection were retrospectively enrolled. PKD1 expression in tumor (N = 218) and adjacent (N = 110) tissues was detected by immunohistochemical staining, scored by a semi-quantitative scoring method ranging from 0 to 12, and further classified as PKD1-, PKD1+, PKD1++ and PKD1+++ for analysis. Meanwhile, patients' clinical features and survival data were acquired from the database.Results:PKD1 was elevated in tumor tissues compared with adjacent tissues. Meanwhile, higher tumor PKD1 was correlated with elevated tumor size, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage, carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA199) level and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level; while no correlation was found in tumor PKD1 with patients' basic features or liver function indexes. Moreover, higher tumor PKD1 was correlated with worse overall survival (OS) in HCC patients, then further validated as an independent predictive factor for worse OS by multivariate Cox's regression model analysis. Additionally, in Child-Pugh stage A, Child-Pugh stage B, BCLC stage 0/A, and BCLC stage B subgroups, higher tumor PKD1 was also correlated with worse OS.Conclusion:Higher PKD1 in tumor tissues correlates with elevated BCLC stage, bigger tumor size, increased CA199 level, higher AFP level and worse OS in HCC patients.
