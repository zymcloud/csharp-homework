Sensitivity amplification strategies in label-free electrochemical immunosensors are mainly limited by redox molecules leaking and degradation of electrical conductivity caused by layers of decoration. Herein, a relatively stable and sensitive label-free electrochemical immunosensor based on a hierarchically flower-like gold microstructures/polyaniline/reduced graphene oxide/prussian blue (HFG/PANI/rGO/PB) composite modified electrode was stepwise fabricated for determination of α-fetoprotein (AFP). In this process, the effect of PANI and rGO on the proposed immunosensor was studied. In detail, PANI/rGO due to the unique electrochemical properties can effectively prevent PB leakage and form a stable sensing platform, which causes sensitive responsiveness and thus a more satisfied detection limit. Meanwhile, the HFG with good biological compatibility can effectively immobilize plenty of antibodies. Under optimal conditions, the HFG/PANI/rGO/PB modified immunosensor exhibited an excellent linearity (0.01 - 30 ng/mL) and a low detection limit (0.003 ng/mL) (S/N = 3), suitable specificity as well as stability and reproducibility towards AFP. The present work offered a promising platform for clinical hepatocellular carcinoma diagnostics.
