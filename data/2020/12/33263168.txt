Ovarian cancer, the most lethal gynecological cancer, is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related deaths in women. A cost-effective and non-invasive early screening method for ovarian cancer is required to reduce the high mortality rate. Saliva is a clinically informative unique fluid, which is useful for novel approaches to prognosis, clinical diagnosis, and monitoring for non-invasive detection of disease. Multimerin1 (MMRN1) is a di-sulfide linked homo-polymeric glycoprotein from EMILIN family. Altered expression of MMRN1 has been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma, cervical cancer, and ovarian cancer. But, its role in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is not clear and well documented. In this study, expression of Multimerin 1 was validated in saliva and tissues of EOC patients and age-matched controls by western blotting, ELISA, RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry. Significant over expression of MMRN1 was observed by western blot and ELISA in saliva samples of EOC patients. The average concentration of MMRN1 in the saliva of healthy controls was 28.7 pg/ml (SE ± 1.76), 42.53 pg/ml (SE ± 4.06) in low grade and 52.91 pg/ml (SE ± 4.24) with p
