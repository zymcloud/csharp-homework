Aims:Immunotherapies represent a new alternative therapeutic approach in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), with promising results when used in combination therapy. The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) to modulate PD-1 and PD-L1 expression profiles in a cohort of surgically treated HCC.Methods:A total of 82 surgically treated HCCs with (n=32) and without (n=50) preoperative TACE were included in the study. Immunohistochemical expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was analyzed and compared according to TACE treatment. Pretreatment biopsies, available in 30 cases (20 with TACE and 10 without), were similarly analyzed. Follow-up data were retrieved from patients' charts.Results:Expression of PD-1 (≥1%) in intratumoral inflammatory cells (ICs) was observed in 46% of HCC while expressions of PD-L1(≥1%) in ICs and in tumor cells (TCs) were observed in 46% and 16%, respectively. A low expression of PD-1 (Conclusion:Our results, showing an increase in PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in HCC following TACE, support the use of TACE in combination with immunotherapy in selected cases to optimize tumor response.
