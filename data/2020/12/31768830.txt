Background:Large, multinodular (> 3 nodules and/or > 3 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not an indication for liver resection based on the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging classification. We hypothesize that microvascular invasion (MVI) is a strong indication for surgery in these patients.Methods:Between December 2009 and December 2010, a retrospective cohort of the patients with BCLC intermediate stage HCC undergoing surgical resection at Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital was analyzed. Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to balance the patients with regard to their baseline characteristics. Survival analysis was performed according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Logistic regression was conducted to identify the predictors of MVI. Risk factors were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards model.Results:Among 323 patients, the MVI-negative group (26.0%) had a more favorable prognosis than did the MVI-positive group (5-year recurrence-free survival: 25.2% vs. 7.8%; 5-year overall survival: 49.5% vs. 24.0%). Similar results were identified after PSM. Compared with MVI-negative patients, MVI-positive patients experienced more early recurrence ( 17.1 Î¼mol/L, alpha fetal protein levels > 400 ng/mL, the presence of > 2 nodules, and the lack of a capsule were independent predictors of MVI.Conclusions:In BCLC intermediate stage HCC, MVI predicted an adverse recurrence pattern and poor prognosis and has the potential to be used as a reference index when deciding whether to operate. Factors predictive of MVI could assist in choosing preoperative treatment and postoperative surveillance.
