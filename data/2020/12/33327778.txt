Chemical investigations of the 75% EtOH extract from the fruits of Crataegus pinnatifida led to the isolation of three undescribed naturally occurring sesquineolignans with two 8-O-4'-type neolignan moieties, cratapinnatifidas A-C (1-3). Their chemical structures were elucidated by the comprehensive spectroscopic analyses (HRESIMS, 1D and 2D-NMR). In the bioactivity assay, their cytotoxic activities against two human hepatoma cell lines (HepG2 and Hep3B) were evaluated and no significant activity was seen with IC50 values ranging from 12.5 to 50.0 Î¼M.
