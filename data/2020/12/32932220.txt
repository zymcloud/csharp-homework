Introduction:Limited data can be found about surgical outcome of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) arising in non-diseased liver. The study aim was to compare short- and long-term outcomes among HCC patients with normal and diseased liver parenchyma, undergoing potentially curative liver resection in a developing country.Materials and methods:From November 2001 until January 2017, 228 patients with HCC underwent curative-intent hepatectomy at the University Clinic for Digestive Surgery. From that number, 190 patients were eligible for analysis. Diseased liver (DL) was present in 112 patients while 78 patients had HCC in non-diseased liver (NDL).Results:Median age, sex, ASA score, the presence of extrahepatic disease and lobar distribution of tumors were similar in both groups. The number of tumors was higher in DL group, while tumor diameter was higher in NDL group. Anatomic liver resection and major liver resections were performed more commonly in NDL than in DL group (66.7 vs 47.4%, p = 0.008; 33.3 vs. 15.2%, p = 0.003). Postoperative morbidity was significantly higher in DL group (p = 0.004). Overall survival was statistically longer in NDL group (p = 0.024). By univariate analysis potential prognostic factors for long-term survival were identified: presence of chronic HCV infection, presence of cirrhosis, Child-Pugh score B and operative time longer than 240 min. The last two were confirmed by multivariate analysis as independent negative prognostic factors for overall survival.Conclusion:Liver resection in patients with HCC arising in non-diseased livers, despite of need for extended hepatectomies, provides favorable long-term prognosis.
