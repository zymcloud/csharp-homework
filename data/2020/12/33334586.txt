A series of new VEGFR-2 inhibitors were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their anti-proliferative activities against hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG-2 cell line). Compound 29b (IC50 = 4.33 ± 0.2 µg/ml) was found to be the most potent derivative as it has showed to be more active than doxorubicin (IC50 = 4.50 ± 0.2 µg/ml) and 78% of sorafenib activity (IC50 = 3.40 ± 0.25 µg/ml). The inhibitory profiles against VEGFR-2 were also assessed for the most promising candidates (16b, 20c, 22b, 24a, 24b, 28c, 28e, 29a, 29b and 29c). Compounds 29b, 29c and 29a exhibited potent inhibitory activities towards VEGFR-2 at IC50 values of 3.1 ± 0.04, 3.4 ± 0.05 and 3.7 ± 0.06 µM, respectively, comparing sorafenib (IC50 = 2.4 ± 0.05 µM). Furthermorer, compound 29b induced apoptosis and arrested the cell cycle growth at G2/M phase. Additionally, in vivo antitumor experiments revealed that compounds 29b and 29c have significant tumor growth inhibition. The test of immuno-histochemical expression of activated caspase-3 revealed that there is a time-dependent increase in cleaved caspase-3 protein expression upon exposure of HepG-2 cells to compound 29b. Moreover, the fibroblastic proliferative index test revealed that compound 29b could attenuate liver fibrosis. Docking studies also supported the results concluded from the biological screening via prediction of the possible binding interactions of the target compounds with VEGFR-2 active sites using the crystal structure of VEGFR-2 downloaded from the Protein Data Bank, (PDB ID: 2OH4) using Discovery Studio 2.5 software. Further structural optimization of the most active candidates may serve as a useful strategy for getting new lead compounds in search for powerful and selective antineoplastic agents.
