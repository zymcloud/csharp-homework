Spider angioma is a benign vascular lesion reminiscent of a spider's body characterized by peculiar dilatation of end vasculature. The lesion is characterized by a central spot and extensions which radiate outward like a spider's body. Spider angiomas may appear as a solitary or multiple lesion that arises on the skin surface of the face, neck, chest, and arms; these lesions have been rarely observed in the sublingual mucosa and in the gut, and to date, they have never been reported in the nasal mucosa. In this article, we report a spider angioma of the nasal cavity found as an occasional finding during a narrow band imaging nasopharyngeal endoscopy in a 70-year-old male patient with hepatitis C virus-related liver cirrhosis and a history of total laryngectomy in 2013 due to laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. The lesion was located in the mucosa of the pavement of the posterior portion of the left nostril; it was painless and asymptomatic.
