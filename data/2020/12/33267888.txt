An increasing number of studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in diverse cellular processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, chromatin remodeling, metabolism and immune escape. Clinically, the expression of MIR22HG is increased in many human tumors (colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, and thyroid carcinoma), while in others (esophageal adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma), it is significantly decreased. Moreover, MIR22HG has been reported to function as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA), be involved in signaling pathways, interact with proteins and interplay with miRNAs as a host gene to participate in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. In this review, we describe the biological functions of MIR22HG, reveal its underlying mechanisms for cancer regulation, and highlight the potential role of MIR22HG as a novel cancer prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target that can increase the efficacy of immunotherapy and targeted therapy for cancer treatment.
