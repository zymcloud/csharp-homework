Introduction and objectives:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the main indications for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). In Brazil, selection criteria for HCC is an expanded version of the Milan Criteria (MC), the so-called "Brazilian Milan Criteria" (BMC). Our aims were to evaluate post-OLT outcomes in patients with HCC and analyze the BMC performance.Materials and methods:We conducted a multicenter, retrospective cohort study, analyzing medical records of 1,059 liver transplant recipients with HCC. Tumor was staged according to MC and BMC and correlated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). We compared the ability of MC and BMC to predict OS and DFS using Delta C-statistic.Results:Post-OLT OS were 63% in five years and HCC recurrence was observed in 8% of patients. At diagnosis, 85% of patients were within MC. Patients within MC at diagnosis and in the explant showed a higher OS and DFS than patients outside MC and within BMC and patients outside both criteria (p Conclusions:In a large Brazilian cohort of HCC patients submitted to liver transplantation, we observed satisfactory overall survival and recurrence rates. However, patients transplanted within the Brazilian expanded criteria had lower OS and DFS when compared to patients within MC, which may generate future discussions regarding the criteria currently used.
