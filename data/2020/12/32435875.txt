It is reported that long noncoding RNA RHPN1-AS1 (lncRNA RHPN1-AS1) functions as an oncogene among multiple types of cancers; however, the effect of lncRNA RHPN1-AS1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is left to be investigated. The main purpose of this work was to study the effects of lncRNA RHPN1-AS1/miR-485-5p system on proliferation, migration, and invasion in HCC and future investigate the latent mechanisms. Our work found that lncRNA RHPN1-AS1 was observably up-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, especially HCCLM3 and SMMC-7721 cells. LncRNA RHPN1-AS1 knockdown decreased the capacity of proliferation, invasion, and migration in HCCLM3 and SMMC-7721 cells, which could be crippled by miR-485-5p inhibitor. Besides, the expression of basigin (BSG) was decreased after lncRNA RHPN1-AS1 silence, indicating the function of lncRNA RHPN1-AS1/miR-485-5p/BSG axis in HCC progression. Our study opens novel insights to help understand the mechanisms of lncRNA RHPN1-AS1/miR-485-5p/BSG axis in HCC progression, which may provide a new therapeutic target for HCC treatment.
