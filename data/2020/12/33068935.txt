China has one of the highest incidence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the world. As most patients are diagnosed with advanced or unretractable HCC, systematic therapy is still the main treatment method for HCC. Currently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are both the chief systematic therapy. And some studies have shown that the combination of TKIs and ICIs is more effective than monotherapy. The purpose of this review is to outline the rationale for the combination between lenvatinib and anti-PD-1(programmed cell death 1) and clinical trials to support this "golden combination". We also discuss the commonly treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and solutions for the patients with HCC who received the combination between lenvatinib and anti-PD-1 antibodies. Finally, we focus on the novel approaches, future perspectives and potential challenges about the combination of TKIs and ICIs.
