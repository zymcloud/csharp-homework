Background:Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) is a therapeutic modality in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or liver metastases. Complications due to SIRT-induced gastric ulcers are seen in less than 5% of patients but there is no consensus for management of this rare side effect. We conducted a systematic review to analyze the efficacy of medical treatment of SIRT-induced ulcers.Methods:This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We developed the research question following the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design (PICOS) format. We identified studies and cases reporting patients with gastric and/or duodenal (=population) ulcers treated with medical therapy with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), antacid, or sucralfate, alone or in combination (=intervention). We did not require that studies include a control group. We included studies reporting the evaluation of the medical and/or surgical treatment (=outcomes).Results:Out of 219 articles, 29 articles were included, resulting in analysis of data for a total of 51 patients who had a SIRT-induced gastric and/or duodenal ulcer treated with medication, surgery, or both. Twenty-eight patients (55%) were reported to have SIRT-induced ulcers that improved after initiation of PPI, antacid, or sucralfate treatment (alone or in combination). Twenty-three patients (45%) were reported to be refractory to medical treatment and surgery was performed in 7 out of 23 patients (30%).Conclusions:About 45% of SIRT-induced gastroduodenal ulcers are refractory to medical treatment with PPI, antacid, or sucralfate, alone or in combination. Surgery is an effective treatment in patients who are refractory to medical treatment and who have intense symptoms.
