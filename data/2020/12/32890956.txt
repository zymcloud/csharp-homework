Introduction:Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is recently emerging treatment modality using radiation from Yttrium-90 through the transarterial approach. It usually is used in the intermediate stage and unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). No touch isolation technique is a way to prevent the spread of tumors by pre-ligating the vessels around the tumor with minimal touch during surgery. We hoped that if we were to use these techniques, we would be able to control all viable tumors before liver transplantation. Then we could get better outcomes even in the advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients.Methods:We performed living donor liver transplantation using no touch isolation technique in the patients who had multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma and extremely high AFP, PIVKA-II level after TARE and conventional TACE.Results:36 years old female patient had liver cirrhosis with hepatitis B virus infection and multiple hepatocellular carcinoma in both lobes. Hepatologist decided to do TARE and additional conventional TACE for viable tumors. After that treatment, AFP and PIVKA-II level were dramatically decreased, we decided to proceed of living donor liver transplantation because the patient's treatment response was extremely good.Conclusions:No touch isolation technique combined with TARE for recipient hepatectomy might be helpful in advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
