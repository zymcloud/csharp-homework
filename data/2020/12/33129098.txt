Liver disease is a global health problem and is a primary cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Specifically, it accounts for approximately two million deaths per year worldwide. The common causes of mortality are the complications of liver cirrhosis, viral hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The mechanism of immune response and infiltration of cellular immunity is essential for promoting hepatic inflammatory, especially when the liver is abundant with lymphocytes and phagocytic cells. The injured and immunity cells secret different types of interleukins (cytokines), which can directly or indirectly amplify or inhibit liver inflammation. Many types of cells can produce interleukin-34 (IL-34) that induces the release of multiple inflammatory factors in patients via interaction with various cytokines. This phenomenon leads to the enlargement of the inflammatory response to liver diseases and induces liver fibrosis. This review highlights the proposed roles of IL-34 in liver diseases and discusses the recent findings of IL-34 that support its emerging role in HCC. Specifically, the facilitating effects of these new insights on the rational development of IL-34 for targeted therapies in the future are explored.
