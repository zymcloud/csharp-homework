Objectives:The American College of Radiology (ACR) contrast-enhanced ultrasound liver imaging reporting and data system (CEUS LI-RADS), which includes diagnostic criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other hepatic malignancies (OM), is increasingly used in clinical practice. This study performed a meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS LI-RADS for differentiating between HCC and OM in high-risk patients.Methods:PubMed, Embase (Ovid), and Cochrane (CENTRAL) were searched for relevant studies. All studies that reported the percentage of HCC and OM in the LI-RADS categories were included. Random-effects models were used to calculate the pooled sensitivity and specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve.Results:Eight studies involving 4215 focal liver lesions were included in the final analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the LR-5 criteria for HCC were 0.71 (95 % CI, 0.69-0.72) and 0.88 (0.85-0.91), respectively, the DOR was 18.36 (7.41-45.52), and the area under the SROC curve (AUC) was 0.8128. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the LR-M criteria for OMs were 0.85 (0.81-0.88) and 0.86 (0.85-0.87), the DOR was 27.82 (11.83-65.40), respectively, and the SROC AUC was 0.9098.Conclusion:The CEUS LI-RADS can effectively distinguish HCC from other hepatic malignancy in high-risk patients based on LR-5 criteria and LR-M criteria. However, further studies are needed for validation due to the limited number of included studies and the potential heterogeneity among the included studies.
