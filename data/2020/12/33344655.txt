The Chinese formula Pien Tze Huang (PZH) has been used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and showed positive clinical effects. However, the antitumor mechanism of PZH in HCC remains unclear. In this study, HCC xenograft Balb/c mice were treated with PZH; then, proteomics detection and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were used to analyze the differentiated phosphorylated proteins in tumor tissues. The results indicated that PZH could inhibit tumor weight by 50.76%. Eighty-four upregulated and 11 downregulated phosphorylated proteins were identified in PZH-treated mice. Twenty signaling pathways were associated with inflammation (including the IL-6 and TNFR1/2 pathways), cancer growth (including the p53 and FAK pathways), and the cell cycle (including the G2/M and G1/S checkpoint regulation pathways). Moreover, TNF-Î±, IL-6, and several typical differentially expressed phosphorylated proteins (such as p-CCNB1, p-FOXO3, and p-STAT3) in tumor tissues, tumor cell viability, and cell cycle arrest assay in vitro further verify the results of IPA. These results revealed that PZH achieved antitumor activity in HCC; the underlying mechanisms of which were mainly through regulating the inflammation-associated cytokine secretion, cancer growth pathways, and induction of G2/M arrest. These data provided the potential molecular basis for PZH to act as a therapeutic drug or a supplement to chemotherapy drugs for human HCC in the future.
