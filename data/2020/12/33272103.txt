Objective:To investigate the mechanism of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) DANCR on the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.Methods:The expression levels of DANCR and miR-125b-5p were measured in normal hepatocytes (LO2) and HCC cell lines by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. HepG2 and Huh-7 cells were transfected with sh-DANCR, the negative control (sh-NC), miR-125b-5p mimic, or mimic NC or cotransfected with sh-DANCR and miR-125b-5p inhibitor. HCC cell proliferation was assessed through CCK8 and plate colony formation assay. Western blot quantified the expression levels of Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, and cleaved-caspase-3. Apoptotic rate was detected as well as migratory and invasive capacities. The implication of the MAPK signal pathway was assessed by detecting the expression levels of p38, ERK1/2, JNK, p-p38, p-ERK1/2, and p-JNK. Interactions between DANCR and miR-125b-5p were detected by dual luciferase reporter assay.Results:In HCC cells, DANCR was highly expressed and miR-125b-5p was decreased. sh-DANCR or miR-125b-5p mimic stimulation reduced HepG2 or Huh-7 cell progression while promoted cell apoptosis evidenced by increased apoptotic rate, elevated levels of Bax and cleaved-caspase-3, and decreased Bcl-2. Moreover, the migration rate and invasiveness of HCC cells were also inhibited by sh-DANCR and miR-125b-5p mimic. Levels of p-p38/p38, p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2, and p-JNK/JNK were suppressed by sh-DANCR and miR-125b-5p mimic. LncRNA DANCR negatively targeted and directly bound to miR-125b-5p. Knockdown of miR-125b-5p could reverse the inhibitory effects of sh-DANCR on HCC cells.Conclusion:In HCC cells, lncRNA DANCR sponges miR-125b-5p and activates MAPK pathway, thus facilitating HCC cell progression.
