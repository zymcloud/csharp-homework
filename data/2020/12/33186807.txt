Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with unmet need for the pharmacological therapy. The functions of ATXN7L3 in HCC progression are not known.Methods:RNA sequence, quantitative real-time PCR, and western blot were performed to detect gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed to detect possible mechanisms. Immunohistochemical stain was performed to examine the protein expression. Colony formation, cell growth curve and xenograft tumor experiments were performed to examine cell growth in vitro and in vivo.Findings:ATXN7L3 functions as a coactivator for ERα-mediated transactivation in HCC cells, thereby contributing to enhanced SMAD7 transcription. ATXN7L3 is recruited to the promoter regions of SMAD7 gene, thereby regulating histone H2B ubiquitination level, to enhance the transcription of SMAD7. A series of genes regulated by ATXN7L3 were identified. Moreover, ATXN7L3 participates in suppression of tumor growth. In addition, ATXN7L3 is lower expressed in HCC samples, and the lower expression of ATXN7L3 positively correlates with poor clinical outcome in patients with HCC.Interpretation:This study demonstrated that ATXN7L3 is a novel regulator of SMAD7 transcription, subsequently participating in inhibition of tumor growth in HCC, which provides an insight to support a previously unknown role of ATXN7L3 in HCC progression.
