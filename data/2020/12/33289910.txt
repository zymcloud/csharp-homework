Background and aims:The liver plays a key role in the storage, metabolism and homeostasis of fat-soluble vitamins. We investigated the relation of Vitamin(Vit)A/D/E serum levels with severity of liver disease and portal hypertension (PHT).Methods:VitA/D/E serum levels were assessed in 234 patients with advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD, i.e. hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] ≥ 6 mmHg). Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, pre-/post-hepatic PHT, TIPS or liver transplantation were excluded.Results:Most patients were male (n = 153; 65%) with a median age of 57.6 (49.7-64.5) years. Thirty-two (14%) patients had HVPG 6-9 mmHg, 66 (28%) 10-15 mmHg, and 136 (58%) ≥ 16 mmHg, respectively. VitD deficiency (25-OH-vitamin-D 1.05 µmol/L) VitA levels, while 58 (25%) had mild (0.70-1.04 µmol/L), 71 (30%) moderate (0.35-0.69 µmol/L), and 42(18%) severe(10 µmol/L; OR 3.62; 95%CI 1.61-8.14; p = 0.002) were independently associated with VitA deficiency.Conclusion:VitA and VitD but not VitE deficiencies are highly prevalent in ACLD. VitA deficiency strongly correlates with hepatic dysfunction, PHT and bile acid levels and is associated with decompensated ACLD.Trial registration number:NCT03267615.
