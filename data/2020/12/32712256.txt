Purpose:Through this multi-institutional study, we aimed to retrospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for intrahepatic recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods and materials:Between 2005 and 2017, 709 patients with 835 HCCs underwent SBRT; those treated with repeated SBRT were eligible. The median prescribed dose was 40 Gy in 5 fractions.Results:Eighty-one patients with 189 tumors underwent repeated SBRT (≥ 2 courses [median 2 times; range, 2-5 times]). The median follow-up periods from the first to the second SBRT were 41.5 (range, 12-99) and 20 (range, 1-81) months, respectively. The median interval between the first and second SBRT was 18 (range, 3-74) months. The 5-year local recurrence rate was 6.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3%-13.4%). The 5-year overall survival (OS) and liver-related death rates from the first SBRT were 60.4% (95% CI, 47.0%-73.8%) and 32.9% (95% CI, 20.3%-46.0%), respectively, and the 3-year rates from the second SBRT were 61.0% (95% CI, 49.9%-75.2%) and 34.5% (95% CI, 20.6%-48.9%), respectively. The frequency of grade 3 toxicity was not significantly different between the first and second SBRT (first: 11% [95% CI, 5.2%-20%]; second: 15% [95% CI, 7.9%-24%]; P = .48). Among 39 patients with no intrahepatic recurrence for 1 year after the first and second SBRT, the deterioration in liver function after the first and second SBRT was not significantly different; the albumin-bilirubin score increased 1 year after the first versus second SBRT (first, 0.143 ± 0.23; second, 0.195 ± 0.38; P = .48). Multivariate analysis revealed that the intrahepatic recurrence-free interval was the only significant factor for OS.Conclusions:Repeated SBRT for intrahepatic recurrent HCC resulted in high local control with safety and a satisfactory OS comparable with that of other curative local treatments for patients with well-preserved liver function.
