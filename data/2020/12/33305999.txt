Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health care burden that can lead to chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. We conducted this study to identify the association between interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene rs1800796 (-572G/C) polymorphism and the risk of chronic HBV infection in adults. A total of 1,048 participants including 518 cases and 530 controls were recruited for this study. The Mass Array time-of-flight mass spectrometer was applied for single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1800796 genotyping. There was a significant correlation between genotype CG in rs1800796 and chronic HBV infection in the Chinese Han population (odds ratio [OR] = 0.759, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.586-0.983, p = 0.04), which was also observed at allele G (OR = 0.800, 95% CI: 0.657-0.975, p = 0.02). Furthermore, significant differences in the â‰¤45 years old group (CC vs. CG+GG, OR = 0.616, 95% CI: 0.413-0.918, p = 0.02) and in the male group (CC vs. CG+GG, OR = 0.666, 95% CI: 0.483-0.920, p = 0.01) were found in the subgroups analysis. Our data revealed a significant association of IL-6 rs1800796 with the risk of chronic HBV infection in the Chinese Han population; meanwhile, age and gender are two coordinative risk factors, which provides new clues for the study of susceptibility of chronic HBV infection in adults.
