Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is different from other solid tumors because it is commonly associated with the occurrence of intrahepatic metastasis. Additionally, the liver, unlike other organs, is the main site of coagulation and fibrinolytic factor production. Therefore, it was speculated that coagulation and fibrinolytic factors could be associated with intrahepatic metastasis of HCC. Do the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems protect HCC cells against anoikis during infiltration and metastasis? Conversely, do the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems lead to immune escape of HCC cells by affecting the immune microenvironment of patients? The current review aimed to present a number of novel hypotheses for the treatment of HCC by exploring the mechanisms of coagulation and fibrinolytic factors in the regulation of cancer growth.
