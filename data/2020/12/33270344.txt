Aims:Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance indicates a "functional cure" in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (CHB). However, several cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development have been reported after HBsAg seroclearance. We evaluated the potential of HBsAg and hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg), measured by the ultra-highly sensitive assays, in cases with HCC development after HBsAg seroclearance.Methods:We enrolled 17 patients with CHB who achieved HBsAg seroclearance, defined by the conventional assay using Architect HBsAg QT kit (5 HCC patients and 12 non-HCC patients). HBsAg and HBcrAg were measured in their stored serum samples using ultra-highly sensitive assays featuring "immunoassay for total antigen including complex via pretreatment (iTACT)" technology.Results:All 5 patients who developed HCC were positive for HBsAg or HBcrAg by iTACT-HBsAg or iTACT-HBcrAg at all follow-up points. HBcrAg levels in the HCC group, using iTACT-HBcrAg, were significantly higher than those in the non-HCC group at HBsAg seroclearance (3.6 LogU/mL (2.8-4.2) vs. 2.6 (Conclusions:Residual low viral antigen might predict HCC development even if HBsAg seroclearance was achieved according to a conventional assay. The results suggest that iTACT assays of HBsAg and HBcrAg would be useful for monitoring CHB patients. (239 words).
