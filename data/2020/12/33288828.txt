The prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a research hotspot. This study aimed to incorporate important factors obtained from SEER database to construct and validate a nomogram for predicting the cancer-specific survival (CSS) of patients with HCC and ICC. We obtained patient data from SEER database. The nomogram was constructed base on six prognostic factors for predicting CSS rates in HCC patients. The nomogram was validated by concordance index (C-index), the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration curves. A total of 3227 patients diagnosed with HCC (3038) and ICC (189) between 2010 and 2015 were included in this study. The C-index of the nomogram for HCC patients was 0.790 in the training cohort and 0.806 in the validation cohort. The 3- and 5-year AUCs were 0.811 and 0.793 in the training cohort. The calibration plots indicated that there was good agreement between the actual observations and predictions. In conclusion, we constructed and validated a nomogram for predicting the 3- and 5-year CSS in HCC patients. We have confirmed the precise calibration and excellent discrimination power of our nomogram.
