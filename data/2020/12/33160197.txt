Purpose:To investigate the diagnostic performance of two-dimensional shear-wave elastography (2D-SWE) in hepatocellular carcinoma patients with chronic hepatitis B adapted to hepatectomy comparing to serum liver fibrosis models.Method:100 patients with chronic hepatitis B who first diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma and had undergone 2D-SWE measurements before the hepatectomy were included. The performance of 2D-SWE and serum models in the diagnosis of liver fibrosis was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.Results:The areas under ROC (AUCs) for 2D-SWE, Forns score, aspartate transaminase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis 4 Score (FIB-4) were 0.983, 0.757, 0.745, 0.710 in the diagnosis of significant fibrosis (F â‰¥ 2) respectively, and 0.896, 0.718, 0.626, 0.575 in the diagnosis of cirrhosis (F = 4) respectively. The AUCs for 2D-SWE in the diagnosis of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis were significantly higher than those for the serum fibrosis models (p 0.05) with those of APRI and FIB-4 while in the diagnosis of cirrhosis (F = 4), they are significantly higher (p Conclusions:2D-SWE is a reliable method for preoperative noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis in HCC patients with CHB, with notably higher diagnostic accuracy than serum liver fibrosis models.
