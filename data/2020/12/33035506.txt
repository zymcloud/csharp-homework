Natural compounds have been confirmed as one of the most feasible solutions for hard-to-treat cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Erianin, a natural bibenzyl compound from Dendrobium chrysotoxum, has been recently discovered with anticancer property in cancer cells. However, the roles and the molecular mechanisms of erianin in HCC remain unknown. The present study evaluates the effect of erianin on human HCC cells by inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptotic-related cell death and hampering tumorigenicity. Furthermore, it was found that erianin could cause irreparable DNA damage, induce G2/M arrest and deregulate mitotic regulators. It was also observed that many cells with damaged DNA induced by erianin could overcome G2/M arrest and enter mitosis, leading to abnormal mitosis, and subsequently mitotic catastrophe and apoptotic-related cell death. The present study confirmed that erianin could be a potential antitumor agent for HCC clinical treatment.
