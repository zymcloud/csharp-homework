Hepatitis C virus infection is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Many studies agree that interferon (IFN)-based antiviral therapy can reduce the risk of HCC recurrence in patients with chronic hepatitis C who have achieved a sustained virological response (SVR). The recent introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAA) has resulted in excitingly high SVR rates. However, as an IFN-free regimen, DAAs only exert antiviral activity without an immune response. The benefit of DAA-based regimens for HCC recurrence in patients with cirrhosis and following successful curative treatment remains controversial. Additionally, the time span between curative-intent therapy and the DAA regimen is an independent risk factor for HCC recurrence, irrespective of the DAA response. HCC patients who are eligible for potentially curative therapy by liver resection or ablation should defer DAA therapy; however, the accurate timing remains unclear. In this study, we reviewed the timing of DAA initiation after curative treatment and its effect on the recurrence of related HCC.
