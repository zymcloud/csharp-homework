Cancer stem cells are considered to be tumor-initiating cells. To explain the initiation or progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we previously established a culture system that may enrich hepatic cancer stem-like cells (HCSCs). However, the regulatory mechanisms by which HCSCs acquire stem cell properties remain unclear. In the present study, three pairs of HCSCs and case-matched human HCC cells were analyzed by high-throughput screening, and novel biomarkers and pathways for the regulation of HCSCs were identified. The results led to the identification and stratification of 406 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), among which 73 GO terms were found to be significantly associated with DEGs in HCSCs, and only complement and coagulation cascade pathways were identified during the development of HCSCs. By combining the results of the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses, it was revealed that 7 genes were downregulated in the complement and coagulation cascade pathways, and 7 miRNAs were predicted to target several downregulated genes involved in these pathways. The results may contribute toward hepatic cancer stem cell studies and novel drug research for HCC treatment.
