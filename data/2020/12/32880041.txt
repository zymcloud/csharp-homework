Purpose:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver tumor. Only about one third of them are eligible for curative treatments like liver transplantation. Various interventional oncologic treatment options could be employed for some of the HCC patients outside the acceptable liver transplantation criteria to make them suitable for transplantation by downstaging and keeping them inside the criteria by bridging to transplantation.Methods:We reviewed the literature by the terms of downstaging and bridging therapy for liver transplantation.Results:About only 30% of the patients are suitable for curative procedures like transplantation at the time of diagnosis of HCC. Even the Milan Criteria is expanded or new criteria are defined, still there are many patients who need downstaging to be eligible for transplantation. There are different procedures in interventional oncology for primary and metastatic liver lesions. Radioembolization (RE) is one of the locoregional therapies which is more effective than others for downstaging and bridging for liver transplantation.Conclusion:Downstaging by RE is an effective and reasonable method for unresectable HCC cases initially beyond established criteria for liver transplantation by selecting suitable and favorable tumor biology.
