Liver dysfunction is always accompanied by lipid metabolism dysfunction. Apolipoprotein M (apoM), a member of the apolipoprotein family, is primarily expressed and secreted from the liver. apoM is the main chaperone of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a small signalling molecule associated with numerous physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. In addition to transport, apoM also influences the biologic effects of S1P. Most recently, numerous studies have investigated the potential role of the apoM-S1P axis in a variety of hepatic diseases. These include liver fibrosis, viral hepatitis B and C infection, hepatobiliary disease, non-alcoholic and alcoholic steatohepatitis, acute liver injury and hepatocellular carcinoma. In this review, the roles of apoM and S1P in the development of hepatic diseases are summarized, and novel insights into the diagnosis and treatment of hepatic diseases are discussed.
