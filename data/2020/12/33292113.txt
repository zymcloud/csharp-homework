Background:Infectious diseases constantly represent the source of sickness as well as mortality in human beings. Herbal applications in human life through using plants for antibacterial and anticancer activity have shown the potential medicinal outcome.Objectives:To evaluate the antibacterial and anticancer activities of the crude extract of Matricaria aurea.Materials and methods:The antibacterial activity of the crude flowers of M. aurea extract was examined against reference and clinical bacterial strains by agar well diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations were determined by micro broth dilution assays using MH broth. Herbal extract was employed over human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7), hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG-2) and colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (HCT-116) to optimize cancer cells proliferation by SRB assay.Results:The data has shown that the extract from M. aurea had significant antimicrobial activity against the tested microorganisms. The plant extract showed higher antibacterial activity against the reference strain of Streptococcus pyogenes. The MIC and MBC varied between 0.38-12.5 mg/ml and 3.1-200 mg/ml respectively. Synergy study elucidated the significant bacteriostatic effect of M. aurea extract on S. aureus and S. saprophyticus. The data of SRB assay deliver the potential anticancer activity through cell death.Conclusion:This study delivers innovative information that M. aurea possessed excellent bio-activities against pathogenic microbes and cancer cells, which drive attention for further research to explore the active components responsible for biological efficacies.
