Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presenting with macroscopic bile duct tumor thrombus (BDTT) is an uncommon event. The role of a curative hepatic resection and associated long-term outcomes remain controversial. In addition the necessity for bile duct resection is still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes of hepatectomy with a selective bile duct preservation approach for HCC with BDTT in comparison to outcomes without BDTT.Methods:A total of 22 HCC with BDTT patients who had undergone curative hepatic resection with a selective bile duct preservation approach at our institute were retrospectively reviewed. These were compared to group of 145 HCC without BDTT patients. The impact of curative surgical resection and BDTT on clinical outcomes and survival after surgical resection were analyzed.Results:All HCC with BDTT cases underwent major hepatectomy vs. 32.4% in the comparative group. Bile duct preservation rate was 56.5%. The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of HCC with BDTT patients in comparison to the HCC without BDTT group were 81.8%, 52.8% and 52.8% vs. 73.6%, 55.6% and 40.7% (P=0.804) respectively. Positive resection margin, tumor size ≥5 cm and AFP ≥200 IU/mL were significant risk factors regarding overall survival. However, it is unclear whether presence of a bile duct tumor thrombus has an adverse impact on either recurrence free survival or overall survival.Conclusions:Bile duct obstruction from tumor thrombus did not necessarily indicate an advanced form of disease. Tumor size and AFP had greater impact on long-term outcomes than bile duct tumor thrombus. Major liver resection with a selective bile duct preserving approach in HCC with BDTT can achieve favorable outcomes comparable to those of HCC without BDTT in selected patients.
