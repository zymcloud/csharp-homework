Purpose:Bibliometric analysis is a quantitative assessment of the academic literature in a particular field. The aim of our study was to characterize the 100 top-cited articles regarding transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:The 'Web of Science' database was used to identify the leading articles regarding TACE for HCC. We determined the top 100 articles according to citations and performed an analysis on year of publication, authorship, department affiliation, publishing journal, institution and country of origin, subject matter and article type.Results:The top-cited articles received between 92 and 2254 citations (median 283.4). The top 100 papers were published in 32 journals between 1983 and 2016. Cancer, Radiology and Hepatology published the most articles (n = 40). Internal medicine was the department affiliation of the first author in 49%. The country providing the most highly cited articles was Japan (n = 24).Conclusion:We performed an analysis of the 100 top-cited articles dealing with TACE for HCC, presenting a detailed list of the most influential and historically significant papers. Japan was the country that produced the most top-cited articles, highlighting its key contribution to this field of the literature.
