Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a myeloid neoplasm with inflammatory properties. There are few published reports of adult LCH with liver involvement, which is still poorly understood, but shows high morbidity and mortality. We report a case of a 37-year-old woman suffering from hepatitis C showing a LCH affecting the lung as well as the liver. Consistent with histology, we found an early stage of a proliferative/granulomatous phase of hepatobiliary LCH, whereas pulmonary findings showed a nodular stage of adult pulmonary LCH. Although hepatocellular carcinoma is a common malignancy in patients suffering from hepatitis C, it is crucial to keep in mind differential diagnosis for newly appearing liver lesions.
