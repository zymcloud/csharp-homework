Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors, and high recurrence and metastasis are the major obstacles to successful treatment of HCC. Traditional Chinese medicine has little known and unique advantages in the treatment of HCC. Previous studies have confirmed that Chinese herbal formula Qingrejiedu (clears away heat and toxins), Huoxuehuayu (promotes blood flow to remove stasis) and Fuzhengguben (strengthens healthy qi and root) (QHF) has a significant effect on patients with advanced HCC, improves the quality of life and prolongs the survival time of patients significantly. In this study, we investigated the effect of QHF on proliferation, migration and invasion of human high metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HCCLM3 and its underlying mechanism. The results from our in vitro experiments showed that QHF has the ability to inhibit the proliferation by inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and induce apoptosis. Moreover, QHF can also inhibit migration and invasion of HCCLM3 cells and the expression of the p-c-Met protein in HCCLM3 cells was down-regulated. c-Met is closely related to the metastasis of HCC, then we constructed a stable transfected cell line HepG2-met with high expression of c-Met by transfection. Further study in vivo revealed that c-Met gene will promote the growth of tumors and lung metastases in nude mice, and QHF intervention can reduce tumor lung metastases by inhibiting the HGF/c-Met signaling pathway. In conclusion, our study reveals that QHF can inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCCLM3, and this effect may be related to inhibiting HGF/c-Met signaling pathway.
