Aims:Iron is an important metal ion as a biocatalyst on the other hand iron overload causes various diseases. Iron overload can result in fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma with various pathophysiological mechanisms, including oxidative damage in the liver. Therefore; in this study the effects of ozone and selenium -whose antioxidant properties are known- were evaluated in liver injury induced by iron overload.Materials and methods:Iron overload model was provided by intraperitoneal administration of 88 mg/kg iron dextrate for 4 weeks. After iron dextran administration, ozone and selenium administrations were made for 3 weeks. From the obtained blood and tissue samples total oxidant status (TOS) and total antioxidant status (TAS) were determined and histopathological examination was performed in liver tissue samples.Key findings:In rats with iron overload, the lowest mean serum TOS was observed in the selenium administration group. The highest tissue TOS means and the lowest tissue TAS means were determined in the group in which ozone and selenium were administrated together. When histopathological data were evaluated, the presence of increased apoptosis in the ozone group compared to the iron group (p = 0.019) and selenium group (p = 0.019) was noted. Similarly, increased periportal inflammation (p = 0.001) and fibrosis (p = 0.005) were observed in the ozone group compared to the selenium group.Significance:In iron-induced liver damage, ozone was thought to be effective by decreasing ROS, but contrary to expectations, it was observed that it may negatively affect the picture by showing synergistic effect. However, the effects of selenium on both serum and tissue levels are promising.
