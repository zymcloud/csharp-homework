Purpose:To evaluate whether the recalculation of lung shunt fraction (LSF) is necessary prior to next-stage or same lobe repeat radioembolization.Materials and methods:Retrospective chart review was performed for patients who underwent radioembolization between February 2008 and December 2018. Eighty of 312 patients had repeat mapping angiograms and LSF calculations. A total of 160 LSF calculations were made using planar imaging (155, [97%]) and single-photon emission computed tomography (5 [3%]) technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin hepatic arterial injection imaging. The mean patient age was 61.8 years Â± 12.7; 69 (86%) patients had metastatic disease and 11 (14%) had hepatocellular carcinoma.Results:Patients had a median LSF of 5% (interquartile range [IQR] 3%-9%) with a median absolute difference of 1.25 (IQR 0.65-3.4) and a median of 76 days (IQR 42.5-120 days) between repeat LSF calculations. There was a median change in LSF of 0.2% between mapping studies (P = .11). There was no statistical significance between the repeat LSFs regardless of the arterial distribution (P = .79) or between tumor types (P = .75). No patients exceeded lung dose limits using actual or predicted prescribed dose amounts. The actual median lung dose was 2.6 Gy (IQR 1.8-4.4 Gy, maximum = 20.5) for the first radioembolization and 2.0 Gy (IQR 1.3-3.7 Gy, maximum = 10.1) for the second radioembolization.Conclusions:No significant difference in LSF was identified between different time points and arterial distributions within the same patient undergoing repeat radioembolization. In patients who receive well under 30-Gy lung dose for the initial treatment and a 50-Gy cumulative lung dose, repeat radioembolization treatments in the same patient may not require a repeat LSF calculation.
