Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a heterogeneous malignancy closely related to metabolic reprogramming. We investigated how CTNNB1 mutation regulates the HCC metabolic phenotype and thus affects the prognosis of HCC. We obtained the mRNA expression profiles and clinicopathological data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the International Cancer Genomics Consortium (ICGC) and the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE14520 and GSE116174). We conducted gene set enrichment analysis on HCC patients with and without mutant CTNNB1 through TCGA dataset. The Kaplan-Meier analysis and univariate Cox regression analysis assisted in screening metabolic genes related to prognosis, and the prognosis model was constructed using the Lasso and multivariate Cox regression analysis. The prognostic model showed good prediction performance in both the training cohort (TCGA) and the validation cohorts (ICGC, GSE14520, GSE116174), and the high-risk group presented obviously poorer overall survival compared with low-risk group. Cox regression analysis indicated that the risk score can be used as an independent predictor for the overall survival of HCC. The immune infiltration in different risk groups was also evaluated in this study to explore underlying mechanisms. This study is also the first to describe an metabolic prognostic model associated with CTNNB1 mutations and could be implemented for determining the prognoses of individual patients in clinical practice.
