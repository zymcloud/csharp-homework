Blockade of the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been shown to be effective in halting the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Antrodia cinnamomea is a well-known indigenous medicine used by Taiwanese aboriginal tribes. However, its effect on NASH remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the mechanistic insight of Antrodia cinnamomea extract (ACE) in both in vitro and in vivo models of NASH. Murine RAW264.7 macrophages and human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells were treated with the indicated concentration of ACE 30 minutes prior to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 h. Levels of inflammatory markers, NLRP3 inflammasome, components, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers were analyzed by Western blotting. For the in vivo experiments, male C57BL/6 mice weighing 21-25 g were fed a methionine/choline deficient (MCD) diet along with vehicle or ACE (100 mg/kg) for 10 consecutive days. The serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) levels of the mice were measured. The liver tissues from the mice underwent histological analysis (hematoxylin and eosin staining), and the levels of inflammatory markers, NLRP3 inflammasome components, and autophagy-related proteins were evaluated. ACE significantly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vitro and in vivo. In addition, ACE attenuated the severity of MCD-induced steatohepatitis, reduced the levels of oxidative stress markers, and ameliorated inflammatory responses, but restored autophagic flux. Based on these findings,Antrodia cinnamomea could be developed into an anti-non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/NASH agent.
