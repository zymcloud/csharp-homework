Objectives: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by elevated in oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines, which enhance destructive effects of the tumor. Therefore, we conducted this study to investigate the protective effects of sodium ascorbate against thioacetamide-induced HCC in rats through studying its effect on the apoptotic pathway in rats. In addition, in vitro activity of sodium ascorbate was investigated on HepG2 and compared with cisplatin.Methods: HCC was experimentally induced by injecting rats with 200 mg/kg thioacetamide intraperitoneally twice weekly for 16 weeks. Part of HCC rats was concomitantly treated with 100 mg/kg sodium ascorbate intraperitoneally during the 16-week period. Hepatic tissues were used for the determination of NFκB, Nrf2, TNF-α, caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9.Results: Sodium ascorbate significantly attenuated HCC-induced reduction in the expression of NrF2 associated with a reduction in concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion. In addition, sodium ascorbate blocked HCC-induced increase in the expression of NFκB and TNF-α. Sodium ascorbate slightly increased the activity of caspase-3, -8 and -9 in vitro but inhibited their activities in vivo.Conclusion: In spite of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of sodium ascorbate, it produced selective cytotoxic activity via direct activation of the apoptotic pathway in cancer cells without affecting the apoptotic pathway in normal hepatic cells.
