Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the main histological subtype of liver malignancy with poor prognosis. A growing body of evidence showed that Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are related to HCC tumorigenesis and progression. In this study, we investigated the function and regulation of circ-0038718 in HCC. We found that circ-0038718 was frequently elevated in HCC specimens and cell lines. High expression levels of circ-0038718 were correlated with unfavorable prognosis in HCC patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated that knockdown of circ-0038718 attenuated HCC cell proliferation and metastatic abilities, while overexpression of circ-0038718 resulted the converse effect. Silencing circ-0038717 inhibited HCC xenograft tumor development in vivo. Mechanistically, circ-0038718 acted as the sponge of tumor-suppressive miR-139-3p to regulate HCC progression. Rescue experiments suggested the oncogenic activity of circ-0038718 was partially exerted via modulating miR-139-3p expression. Inhibition of miR-139-3p abrogated the regulatory effect of circ-0038718 in HCC cells. In summary, our results unveiled that circ-0038718 could serve as an crucial regulator of HCC progression and provide a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment.
