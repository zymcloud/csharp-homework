Background:Radiotherapy is the most common regimen for treating human cancers; however, ionizing radiation (IR) has hazardous effects on metabolically active organs such as the liver.Aim:This study aimed to investigate the possible protective (prophylactic and therapeutic) action of taurine against liver damage induced by gamma irradiation at different time intervals as well as the mechanisms by which taurine could provide its potential amelioration actions.Methods:In this study, 90 adult male rats (∼150 g) were randomly divided into five groups. Group 1 is the control group, group 2 received an oral daily dose (500 mg/kg) of taurine for two weeks, group 3 was exposed to a whole-body single dose of γ-irradiation (6 Gy), and groups 4 and 5 received taurine before or after γ-irradiation, respectively. Six rats from each group were sacrificed after 1, 2, and 3 weeks.Results:Over the period of the 3 weeks studied, there were significant increases in MDA, NO, TNF-α, and cytochrome-c levels and ALT, caspases-9 and -3 activities and significant decreases in GSH, SOD, CAT, and GPx in the irradiated group when compared with the relevant control. The liver of irradiated rats showed dilatation in the central and portal veins, edema, and degenerated hepatocytes.Conclusions:Taken together, IR caused maximum devastation in the liver 2 weeks after exposure as shown by elevation of the inflammatory and apoptotic markers and reducing the antioxidants. Taurine was able to alleviate the deleterious biochemical and histological effects whether given before or after IR. The magnitude of the observed protective effects was in both cases very similar.
