Patients with early stage hepatocellular carcinoma have good prognosis and are treated with curative intent. Although this cohort of patients is generally defined by limited tumor burden, good liver function, and preserved functional status, there remains utility in further stratification to optimize overall survival and limit post-operative morbidity and mortality. Transplant, resection, ablation, transarterial radioembolization, and transarterial chemoembolization, either as monotherapy or in combination, may play a crucial role in treating this cohort of patients depending on a multitude of factors. In this section, we review each treatment modality and provide general guidelines for patient selection.
Early stage hepatocellular carcinoma; radiation lobectomy; radiation segmentectomy; transarterial chemoembolization; transarterial radioembolization.
