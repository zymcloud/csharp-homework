Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been verified to have essential regulatory roles in diverse human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we aimed to explore the roles of circ_0001445 in HCC. Herein, circ_0001445 was decreased and miR-942-5p was increased in HCC tissues and cells. Circ_0001445 overexpression or miR-942-5p inhibition repressed cell cycle process, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and glycolysis in HCC cells. Mechanistically, circ_0001445 could promote ALX4 expression through targeting miR-942-5p. Moreover, miR-942-5p overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of circ_0001445 on HCC cell progression. The effect of miR-942-5p on HCC cell development was rescued following the elevation of ALX4. In addition, circ_0001445 overexpression restrained tumorigenesis in vivo. In conclusion, circ_0001445 played a negative role in HCC progression by modulating miR-942-5p/ALX4 axis, which might provide a novel target for HCC therapy.
