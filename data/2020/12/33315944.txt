The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of acute kidney injury (AKI) on the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). A total of 347 HCC patients with Child-Pugh class A and pre-TACE serum creatinine (SCr) ≤1.5 mg/dL undergoing TACE as an initial therapy 2000-2014 were analyzed. Overall survival with related risk factors including AKI was investigated. We assessed AKI based on the International Club of Ascites (ICA)-AKI criteria. The mean age was 60.9 years. Of 347 patients, death was observed in 109 patients (31.4%). The mean SCr levels at pre-TACE, one day, two months, and four months after TACE were 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, and 1.1 mg/dL, respectively. The AKI within four months after TACE developed in 37 patients (11%). The AKI stages were non-AKI in 310 (89%), stage 1 in 10 (3%), stage 2 in 10 (3%), and stage 3 in 17 patients (5%). Multivariable analysis showed that the risk factors for overall survival were serum albumin ≤3.5 g/dL (hazard ratio [HR] 1.58, p = 0.027), BCLC stage B (HR 2.07, p = 0.008), BCLC stage C (HR 3.96, p
