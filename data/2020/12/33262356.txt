We aimed to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of HCC in HCV patients in the US and China. 795 HCV RNA + patients without HCC from University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) in the US and 854 from Peking University Health Sciences Center (PUHSC) in China were prospectively followed for a median of 3.2 and 4.0 years, respectively. 45.4% UMHS and 16.2% PUHSC patients had cirrhosis. 57.6% UMHS and 52.0% PUHSC patients achieved SVR. 45 UMHS and 13 PUHSC patients developed HCC. Cumulative incidence of HCC at 5 years was 7.6% in UMHS and 1.8% in PUHSC cohort (P
