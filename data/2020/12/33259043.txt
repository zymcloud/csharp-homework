Introduction:While tumor burden (TB) has been associated with outcomes among patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, the role of overall TB in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) remains poorly defined.Methods:Patients undergoing curative-intent resection of ICC between 2000 and 2017 were identified from a multi-institutional database. The impact of TB on overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was evaluated in the multi-institutional database and validated externally.Results:Among 1101 patients who underwent curative-intent resection of ICC, 624 (56.7%) had low TB, 346 (31.4%) medium TB, and 131 (11.9%) high TB. OS incrementally worsened with higher TB (5-year OS; low TB: 48.3% vs medium TB: 29.8% vs high TB: 17.3%, p Conclusion:Overall TB dictated prognosis among patients with resectable ICC. TB may be used as a tool to help guide post-resection treatment strategies.
