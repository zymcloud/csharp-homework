An 82-year-old Japanese man with alcoholic liver cirrhosis was referred to our hospital for treatment of advanced esophageal cancer. A protruding tumor was endoscopically observed in the middle thoracic esophagus, and pathological findings of the biopsy specimens revealed a squamous cell carcinoma. The clinical tumor staging was stage II (T3N0M0). The patient received two courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and nedaplatin. After the treatments, computed tomography showed significant reductions in the size of the target tumor. However, radical esophagectomy was not performed because the patient refused major invasive treatments. Instead, endoscopic resection was performed using a combination of polypectomy and endoscopic submucosal resection (ESD). To prevent bleeding during endoscopic treatment, we applied a detachable snare to the base of the tumor and cut the stalk using by an SB knife Jr, without hemorrhage. The pathohistology of the resected specimen was positively showed cancer cells on the margin of the esophageal carcinoma stalk. At 4 weeks after the initial operation, an additional ESD was successfully performed, which pathologically led to radical removal. The patient survived for more than 18 months after beginning the initial treatment. We describe a successful treatment using endoscopic resection after chemotherapy for advanced esophageal cancer with high surgical treatment risks.
