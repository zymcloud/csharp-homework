Background and objectives:Precise prognostic prediction for an individual hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient before and after liver resection is important. We aimed to establish simple prognostic models to predict disease-free survival (DFS) for these patients.Methods:Six hundred and ninety-eight HCC patients with liver resections were reviewed. Preoperative (model 1) and postoperative (model 2) nomogram-based scoring systems were constructed by multivariate analyses, and DFS was estimated.Results:Among 698 patients, 490 (70.2%) patients had tumor recurrence at a median follow-up of 84.4 months. Risk factors of tumor recurrence in model 1 included viral hepatitis, platelet count, albumin, indocyanine green retention rate, multiplicity of tumor, and radiologic total tumor volume (TTV). Prognostic variables identified in model 2 were viral hepatitis, platelet count, multiplicity of tumor, cirrhosis, microvascular invasion, and pathologic TTV. By nomogram in model 1, the patients were classified into three groups with 5-year DFS of 61.0%, 35.7%, and 21.1%, respectively (P Conclusion:Based on nomogram models, DFS for the patients who had liver resection for HCC can be predicted before liver resection and re-assessed after liver resection.
