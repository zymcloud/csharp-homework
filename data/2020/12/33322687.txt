Epidemiology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) showed a correlation between incidence and geographical-relevant risk factors. This study aims to compare the distributions of cancer stem cells (CSC) in two distant populations in Asia and Europe. We analyzed 52 and 43 selected HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy in Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) and Trieste (Italy). Each patient sample consisted of HCC, peri-HCC, and non-tumoral (distal) tissue. Demographic data were recorded together with clinical findings. The protocol for the collection of tissue samples and RNA was standardized in both laboratories and gene expression analysis was performed in a single laboratory with identical PCR conditions. Baseline data showed comparable laboratory findings between the two cohorts. mRNA distribution showed a comparable pattern of all CSC markers analyzed with the expression of CD90 progressively increasing from distal and peri-HCC to be highest in HCC (p < 0.001), confirmed by immunofluorescence data. CD90 mRNA distribution was related to HBV-related HCC and a tumor diameter less than 5 cm. Patients with high tumoral CD90 mRNA had a shorter time (p < 0.05) to tumor recurrence compared to patients with lower CD90. This comparative study showed that CD90 mRNA expressions are comparable between Eastern and Western HCC cases.
