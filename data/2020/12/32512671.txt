Background/aim:This study aimed to investigate the effect of clinical and pathological indicators at the time of the diagnosis on overall survival in patients recently diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer.Materials and methods:The study population consisted of patients who were diagnosed at the Faculty of Medicine at Isparta Süleyman Demirel University Hospital between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2017 and presented to the medical oncology outpatient clinic.Results:A total of 518 patients were evaluated, including 260 patients with squamous cell carcinoma, 207 patients with adenocarcinoma, 50 patients with non-small cell lung cancer-not otherwise specified, and 1 patient with large cell carcinoma. The average life expectancy was found to be 11.50 ± 1.40 months in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, 12.60 ± 1.59 months in patients with adenocarcinoma, and 8.70 ± 1.87 months in the other patients. The estimated 5-year relative survival rate for non-small cell lung cancer was 8% (7% for men and 18% for women). In the multivariate analysis, sex being male (HR, 2.41; P < 0.001), a performance status >2 (HR, 1.70; P < 0.001), the stage of cancer (HR, 1.37; P = 0.045), the presence of bone or liver metastasis (HR, 1.44, P = 0.009, HR, 1.57; P = 0.016, respectively), and the patient not having received radiotherapy (HR, 3.25; P < 0.001) or chemotherapy (HR, 1.85; P = 0.001) were defined as statistically significant predictive factors that reduced the overall survival.Conclusions:In this study, sex, stage, performance status, the presence of liver or bone metastases, and treatment had an effect on overall survival.
