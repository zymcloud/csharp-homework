Background:To improve therapy outcome of Yttrium-90 selective internal radiation therapy (90Y SIRT), patient-specific post-therapeutic dosimetry is required. For this purpose, various dosimetric approaches based on different available imaging data have been reported. The aim of this work was to compare post-therapeutic 3D absorbed dose images using Technetium-99m (99mTc) MAA SPECT/CT, Yttrium-90 (90Y) bremsstrahlung (BRS) SPECT/CT, and 90Y PET/CT.Methods:Ten SIRTs of nine patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were investigated. The 99mTc SPECT/CT data, obtained from 99mTc-MAA-based treatment simulation prior to 90Y SIRT, were scaled with the administered 90Y therapy activity. 3D absorbed dose images were generated by dose kernel convolution with scaled 99mTc/90Y SPECT/CT, 90Y BRS SPECT/CT, and 90Y PET/CT data of each patient. Absorbed dose estimates in tumor and healthy liver tissue obtained using the two SPECT/CT methods were compared against 90Y PET/CT.Results:The percentage deviation of tumor absorbed dose estimates from 90Y PET/CT values was on average -2 ± 18% for scaled 99mTc/90Y SPECT/CT, whereas estimates from 90Y BRS SPECT/CT differed on average by -50 ± 13%. For healthy liver absorbed dose estimates, all three imaging methods revealed comparable values.Conclusion:The quantification capabilities of the imaging data influence 90Y SIRT tumor dosimetry, while healthy liver absorbed dose values were comparable for all investigated imaging data. When no 90Y PET/CT image data are available, the proposed scaled 99mTc/90Y SPECT/CT dosimetry method was found to be more appropriate for HCC tumor dosimetry than 90Y BRS SPECT/CT based dosimetry.
