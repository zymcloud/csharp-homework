Hepatic sclerosed hemangioma is a rare benign liver tumor that originated from hepatic cavernous hemangioma; however, the process of its formation has been unclear. We herein present the patient of a histologically proven hepatic sclerosed hemangioma that showed drastic changes in diagnostic images in a short period. A 56-year-old man was referred to our hospital for the treatment of suspicious hepatocellular carcinoma with hepatitis C, approximately 2 cm in diameter in liver segment 8. Initially, the tumor manifested as early entire enhancement with mildly delayed washout in contrast-enhanced ultrasonography; however, it manifested as continuous peripheral enhancement with the central non-enhanced area after 1 month in various diagnostic images. He completely quit drinking and smoking 1 month preoperatively. No special symptoms and signs were found to suggest tumor ischemia. Anatomical resection of segment 8 was completed. Histological examination confirmed the final diagnosis of common type hepatic sclerosed hemangioma, derived from atypically enhancing cavernous hemangioma. No signs of impaired blood flow were observed in both diagnostic images and histological examination. Sclerosing changes in hepatic cavernous hemangioma may be completed in a relatively short time with no apparent reason.
