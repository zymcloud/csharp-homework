Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which affects both adults and children, is the most common liver disorder worldwide. NAFLD is characterized by excess fat accumulation in the liver in the absence of significant alcohol use. NAFLD is strongly associated with obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, as well as specific genetic polymorphisms. Severe NAFLD cases can further progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or cardiovascular complications. Here, we describe the pathophysiological features and critical genetic variants associated with NAFLD. Recent advances in genome-engineering technology have provided a new opportunity to generate in vitro and in vivo models that reflect the genetic abnormalities of NAFLD. We review the currently developed NAFLD models generated using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) genome editing. We further discuss unique features of CRISPR/Cas9 and Cas9 variants, including base editors and prime editor, that are useful for replicating genetic features specific to NAFLD. We also compare advantages and limitations of currently available methods for delivering genome-editing tools necessary for optimal genome editing. This review should provide helpful guidance for selecting "good fit" genome-editing tools and appropriate gene-delivery methods for the successful development of NAFLD models and clinical therapeutics.
