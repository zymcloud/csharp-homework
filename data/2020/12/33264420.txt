MicroRNAs play an important role in the modulation of the immune system. T helper 17 (Th17) cells are involved in the modulation of the tumour microenvironment. However, the function of miRNA in Th17 cells in the tumour microenvironment is unclear. In this study, we analysed miR-132 expression in Th17 cells and assessed the function of miR-132 on Th17 cell differentiation. In addition, the effect of miR-132 on Th17 cells in the tumour microenvironment, especially hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), was confirmed. CD4+ IL-17 âˆ“ cells were isolated from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumour tissues. The expression of miR-132 was higher in CD4+ IL-17 + cells than in CD4+ IL-17- cells. Human primary CD4+ T cells were used for Th17 cell differentiation. Compared with primary CD4+ T cells, Th17 cells expressed high levels of miR-132. During Th17 cell differentiation, a miR-132 mimic and inhibition were applied. After treatment with the miR-132 mimic, the differentiation of Th17 cells accelerated, showing a a higher percentage of Th17 cells and the expression and secretion of IL-17 and IL-22. Smad nuclear interacting protein 1 (SNIP1), as one of the targets of miR-132, decreased during Th17 cell differentiation-related Th17 differentiation and IL-17 expression. The conditioned medium of miR-132-overexpressing Th17 cells could increase the activation of the HSCs, which strongly promoted HCC cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In summary, miR-132 positively regulates Th17 cell differentiation and improves the function of Th17 on HSCs for their tumour-promoting effects.
