Taccalonolide A has been reported to have anti-tumour efficiency. However, the underlying mechanism for taccalonolides A therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still obscure. Cell viability was evaluated by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. Protein expression of B cell lymphoma (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 associated X (Bax), sonic hedgehog (Shh), Smoothened (Smo) and Gli family zinc finger 1 (Gli1) was analyzed by western blot. The expression of Shh, Smo and Gli1 mRNA was determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results showed that taccalonolide A inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, and improved the cytotoxicity of sorafenib in HCC cells. The expressions of Shh, Smo, Gli1 mRNA and protein were decreased after taccalonolide A treatment. More importantly, activation of the Shh pathway attenuated taccalonolide A-induced inhibition on cell viability and promotion on apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in HCC. Also, activation of the Shh pathway neutralized the effect of taccalonolide A on sorafenib cytotoxicity in HCC. We clarified that taccalonolide A suppressed cell viability facilitated apoptosis, and improved the cytotoxicity of sorafenib in HCC by inhibition of the activation of the Shh pathway, providing alternative treatments for HCC.
