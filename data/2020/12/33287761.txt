Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignancy with high incidence and mortality rates worldwide. Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) are huge family of dehydrogenase enzymes and associated with the prognosis of various cancers. However, comprehensive analysis of prognostic implications related to ADHs in HCC is still lacking and largely unknown.Methods:The expression profiles and corresponding clinical information of HCC were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Wilcoxon signed-rank test was employed to evaluate the expression of ADHs. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to investigate the association between clinicopathological characteristics and survival. GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enrichment analyses were performed and visualized using R/BiocManager package.Results:We found that the expression of ADH1A, ADH1B, ADH1C, ADH4, and ADH6 was significantly downregulated in HCC samples compared to normal liver samples. Our univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses results showed that high expression of ADH1A, ADH1B, ADH1C, ADH4, and ADH6 was considered as an independent factor with an improved prognosis for the survival of HCC patients. Moreover, our Kaplan-Meier analysis results also revealed that high expression of AHD1A, ADH1B, ADH1C, ADH4, and ADH6 was significantly associated with good survival rate in HCC patients. In addition, GO, KEGG, and GSEA analyses unveiled several oncogenic signaling pathways were negatively associated high expression of ADHs in HCC.Conclusion:In the present study, our results provide the potential prognostic biomarkers or molecular targets for the patients with HCC.
