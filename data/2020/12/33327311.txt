Background:Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL) are common primary liver cancers worldwide. Liver stem cells have biopotential to differentiate into either hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, the phenotypic overlap between LIHC and CHOL has been acceptable as a continuous liver cancer spectrum. However, few studies directly investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms between LIHC and CHOL.Method:To identify the candidate genes between LIHC and CHOL, three data series including GSE31370, GSE15765 and GSE40367 were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and function enrichment analyses were performed. The protein-protein interaction network (PPI) was constructed and the module analysis was performed using STRING and Cytoscape.Results:A total of 171 DEGs were identified, consisting of 49 downregulated genes and 122 upregulated genes. Compared with CHOL, the enriched functions of the DEGs mainly included steroid metabolic process, acute inflammatory response, coagulation. Meanwhile, the pathway of KEGG enrichment analyses showed that the upregulated gene(s) were mainly enriched complement and coagulation cascades, cholesterol metabolism and PPAR signaling pathway, while the downregulated gene(s) were mainly enriched in ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, bile secretion. Similarly, the most significant module was identified and biological process analysis revealed that these genes were mainly enriched in regulation of blood coagulation, acute inflammatory response, complement and coagulation cascades. Finally, two (ITIH2 and APOA2) of 10 hub genes had been screened out to help differential diagnosis.Conclusion:171 DEGs and two (ITIH2 and APOA2) of 10 hub genes identified in the present study help us understand the different molecular mechanisms between LIHC and CHOL, and provide candidate targets for differential diagnosis.
