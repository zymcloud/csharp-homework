Neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) has been reported to be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the function and associated molecular mechanisms of NEU1 in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC have not been well investigated. In the present study, the expression of NEU1 mediated by HBV and HBV core protein (HBc) was measured in hepatoma cells. The expression of NEU1 protein was detected via immunohistochemical analysis in HBV-associated HCC tissues. The role of NEU1 in the activation of signaling pathways and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the proliferation and migration of hepatoma cells mediated by HBc was assessed. We found that NEU1 was upregulated in HBV-positive hepatoma cells and HBV-related HCC tissues. HBV promoted NEU1 expression at the mRNA and protein level via HBc in hepatoma cells. Mechanistically, HBc was able to enhance the activity of the NEU1 promoter through NF-ÎºB binding sites. In addition, through the increase in NEU1 expression, HBc contributed to activation of downstream signaling pathways and EMT in hepatoma cells. Moreover, NEU1 facilitated the proliferation and migration of hepatoma cells mediated by HBc. Taken together, our findings provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the oncogenesis mediated by HBc and demonstrate that NEU1 plays a vital role in HBc-mediated functional abnormality in HCC. Thus, NEU1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in HBV-associated HCC.
