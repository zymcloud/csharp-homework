Background:The effects of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) on survival and recurrence rates after curative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remain controversial.Methods:This retrospective, multicenter study involved Child-Pugh class A patients within the Milan criteria who had a first diagnosis of HCC and survived 6 months or longer after undergoing hepatectomy or radiofrequency ablation (RFA). The DAA-treated group (DAA group) included 56 patients, and the DAA-untreated group (untreated group) included 261 patients. The study was conducted using the propensity score-matched (1:2) DAA group and untreated group, 56 and 112 patients, respectively.Results:The survival rate at 48 months in the DAA group and the untreated group was 91.0% and 68.7%, respectively, showing significantly better survival in the DAA group (HR: 0.33; 95% CI 0.13-0.84; p = 0.021). The recurrence rate at 48 months was 36.7% and 66.7%, respectively, showing a significantly lower recurrence rate in the DAA group (HR, 0.46; 95% CI 0.27-0.77; p = 0.003). The median albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score at 3 years post-HCC treatment was - 2.84 in the DAA group and - 2.34 in the untreated group. The ALBI score showed a significant improvement from baseline to 3 years post-HCC treatment (p = 0.001), whereas that in the untreated group showed a significant decline (p = 0.040).Conclusions:DAAs after HCC treatment prevents deterioration of hepatic functional reserve and significantly improves both recurrence and survival rates.
