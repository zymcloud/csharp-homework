Bisphenols (BPs) are environmental pollutants with relevant DNA damage in human population; however, they are generally inactive in standard mutagenicity assays, possibly due to insufficient metabolic activation. In this study, induction of micronuclei and double-strand DNA breaks by BPA, BPF, and BPS in Chinese hamster V79-derived cell lines expressing various human CYP enzymes and a human hepatoma (C3A) (metabolism-proficient) cell line were investigated. Molecular docking of BPs to human CYPs indicated some substrate-enzyme potentials, including CYP1A1 for each compound, which did not induce micronuclei in V79-derived cell lines expressing human CYP1A2, 2E1, or 3A4 but became positive in human CYP1A1-expressing (V79-hCYP1A1) cells. In V79-hCYP1A1 and C3A cells, all compounds induced double-strand DNA breaks and micronuclei formation, which were blocked/significantly attenuated by 1-aminobenzotriazole (CYP inhibitor) or 7-hydroxyflavone (selective CYP1A1 inhibitor). Coexposure of C3A cells to pentachlorophenol (sulfotransferase 1 inhibitor) or ketoconazole (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A inhibitor) potentiated micronuclei induction by each compound, with thresholds lowered from 2.5-5.0 to 0.6-1.2 Î¼M. Immunofluorescence staining of centromere protein B with micronuclei formed in C3A cells by each compound indicated pure clastogenic effects. In conclusion, BPs are potently clastogenic in mammalian cells, which require activation primarily by human CYP1A1 and are negatively modulated by phase II metabolism.
