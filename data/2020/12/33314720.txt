Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common metastatic tumours. Tumour growth and metastasis depend on the induction of cell proliferation and migration by various mediators. Here, we report that the A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase (ADAM) 8 is highly expressed in murine HCC tissues as well as in murine and human hepatoma cell lines Hepa1-6 and HepG2, respectively. To establish a dose-dependent role of different ADAM8 expression levels for HCC progression, ADAM8 expression was either reduced via shRNA- or siRNA-mediated knockdown or increased by using a retroviral overexpression vector. These two complementary approaches revealed that ADAM8 expression levels correlated positively with proliferation, clonogenicity, migration and matrix invasion and negatively with apoptosis of hepatoma cells. Furthermore, the analysis of pro-migratory and proliferative signalling pathways revealed that ADAM8 expression level was positively associated with expression of Î²1 integrin as well as with the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Src kinase and Rho A GTPase. Finally, up-regulation of promigatory signalling and cell migration was also seen with a proteolytically inactive ADAM8 mutant. These findings reveal that ADAM8 is critically up-regulated in hepatoma cells contributes to cell proliferation and survival and furthermore induces pro-migratory signalling pathways independently of its proteolytic activity. By this, ADAM8 can promote cell functions most relevant for HCC growth and metastasis.
