Purpose:To evaluate the clinical implications of initial and best responses during repeated transarterial chemoembolization procedures for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:This study included 726 patients who received a diagnosis of intermediate-stage HCC with Child-Pugh class A liver function between 2007 and 2016, and who were treated with transarterial chemoembolization as the first-line treatment. Evaluation of treatment response was based on the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors. Overall survival (OS) was compared between response categories after implementation of landmark analysis.Results:Of the 726 patients, an objective response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) was observed as the initial response in 78.1% of patients. Regarding the best response during the transarterial chemoembolization series, 87.2% of patients were overall responders. The median OS of initial responders (n = 483) was not significantly different from that of subsequent responders at the 1-year landmark (stable disease [SD] after first transarterial chemoembolization but CR or PR after repeated transarterial chemoembolization; n = 61; 46.2 vs 40.1 months, respectively; P = .145). Likewise, the median OS of initial CR patients (n = 326) was not significantly different from that of the subsequent CR group (n = 126) at the 1-year landmark (PR or SD after first transarterial chemoembolization but CR after repeated transarterial chemoembolization; 53.4 vs 46.3 months, respectively; P = .455). Multivariate Cox analyses showed that the objective responses, the initial responses (hazard ratio [HR], 0.638; P = .001), and the best responses (HR, 0.304; P Conclusions:Both the initial and best responses during repeated transarterial chemoembolization were significantly associated with OS in patients with intermediate-stage HCC and preserved liver function.
