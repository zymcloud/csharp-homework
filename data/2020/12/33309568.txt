Background:The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-related hepatocellular carcinoma (NAFLD-HCC) has increased parallelly with that of metabolic syndrome. This study aimed to compare the clinical and survival outcomes of NAFLD-HCC and HBV-related HCC(HBV-HCC).Methods:The medical records of patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC at Severance Hospital between 2005 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Occult HBV infection was identified by nested PCR. Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to minimize lead-time bias caused by the lack of surveillance in NAFLD patients. Surgical and oncologic outcomes were compared between the two groups.Results:There were 32 patients (7%) with NAFLD-HCC, 200 (46%) with HBV-HCC, and 194 (44%) with HBV/NAFLD-HCC (HBV and NAFLD). Before PSM, cirrhosis was more frequently detected in HBV-HCC patients (55% vs 15%,p Conclusion:Patients with NAFLD-HCC were less likely to have underlying cirrhosis but more likely to have larger tumors at the time of diagnosis than patients with HBV-HCC. The OS of patients with NAFLD-HCC appeared to be worse than that of patients with HBV-HCC. Therefore, active HCC surveillance is recommended in patients with metabolic syndrome for the early detection of HCC.
