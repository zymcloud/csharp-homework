In this research, a novel polysaccharide (PCP) was extracted from Pleurotus citrinopileatus and purified by Sephadex G-150 gel column, and its antitumor activity was investigated using the model H22 tumor-bearing mice. PCP was found to be composed of arabinose, galactose, glucose, xylose, mannose and glucuronic acid in a proportion of 0.66: 14.59: 10.77: 1: 0.69: 0.23 with average molecular weight of 7.30 × 105 Da. Further analysis suggested that PCP was a pyranose with α-type and β-type glycosidic residues. The antitumor assays in vivo indicated that PCP could effectively suppress H22 solid tumor growth, protect immune organs and improve inflammation and anemia. Besides, Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining and JC-1 staining demonstrated that PCP could induce apoptosis of H22 hepatoma cells. The PI staining assay revealed that PCP induced H22 hepatoma cells apoptosis by arresting cell cycle in S phase. These results suggest that the polysaccharide from Pleurotus citrinopileatus possesses potential value in the treatment of liver cancer.
