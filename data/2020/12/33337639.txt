Goal:This study aims to evaluate the quality of online hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) resources by using a validated tool to determine the strengths and limitations of hepatocellular carcinoma Web sites designed for patient education.Background:In recent years, online health information-seeking behavior has become more prevalent. Meanwhile, hepatocellular carcinoma incidence rates have also increased. However, there is currently limited literature assessing the quality of online hepatocellular carcinoma information.Materials and methods:The term "hepatocellular carcinoma" was searched using the search engine Google and the meta-search engines Dogpile and Yippy. A validated rating tool was used to assign quality scores to 100 Web sites based on the domains of Web site affiliation, accountability, interactivity, structure and organization, readability, and content quality. Overall quality scores were tallied for all Web sites.Results:Noncommercial hepatocellular carcinoma Web sites received significantly higher overall quality scores compared with their commercial counterparts. Overall, 30% of the Web sites identified their author(s), 42% cited sources, and 33% were updated within the past 2 years. The majority of Web sites utilized at least 1 interactive feature and 4 structural tools. Average readability was at a grade 11.8 level using the Flesch-Kincaid grading system, which is significantly higher than the recommended grade 6 level. Definition and treatment were the most commonly covered topics, while prevention and prognosis were the least commonly covered.Conclusions:The quality of online hepatocellular carcinoma information is highly variable. Health care professionals should be aware of its limitations and be proactive in guiding patients to reliable resources.
