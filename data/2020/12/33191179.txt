Accumulating evidence has indicated that inflammation is required for the initiation and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The annexin family protein, which has a highly similar structure, has been demonstrated to participate in pro- or anti-inflammatory regulation in the developing of tumours. However, the potential effects of ANXA3 in the immune microenvironment of HCC remain unknown. In present study, we found that increased ANXA3 expression is associated with a higher infiltrated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (iNLR) in HCC. Moreover, HCC patients with a high iNLR and high ANXA3 expression confer the highest risk of death. ANXA3 can be detected in both cell lysates and culture supernatants. However, the secretory ANXA3 did not directly regulate the iNLR. Further study demonstrated that ANXA3 upregulated the iNLR by inducing chemokine CXCL8 and CCL25 release from HCC cells. We further confirmed that ANXA3 promotes tumourigenesis and detected the same associations between ANXA3 and the iNLR or chemokines in vivo. Our findings indicate that ANXA3 regulates the chemokine to remodel the iNLR and promotes tumourigenicity in HCC. These results further expanded our understanding of ANXA3 in the microenvironment of HCC and might provide novel targets for the investigation of molecular treatments for HCC patients.
