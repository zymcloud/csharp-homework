Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major threat to global public health, which can result in many acute and chronic liver diseases. HBV, a member of the family Hepadnaviridae, is a small enveloped DNA virus containing a circular genome of 3.2 kb. Located upstream of the S-open-reading frame of the HBV genome is the pre-S region, which is vital to the viral life cycle. The pre-S region has high variability and many mutations in the pre-S region are associated with several liver diseases, such as fulminant hepatitis (FH), liver cirrhosis (LC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In addition, the pre-S region has been applied in the development of several pre-S-based materials and systems to prevent or treat HBV infection. In conclusion, the pre-S region plays an essential role in the occurrence, diagnosis, and treatment of HBV-related liver diseases, which may provide a novel perspective for the study of HBV infection and relevant diseases.
