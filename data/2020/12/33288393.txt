Background & aims:Whether chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients during immune-tolerant (IT) phase are at low risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still controversial. We performed a multicenter study to determine their long-term prognosis.Methods:Untreated IT group included patients 6 log10IU/mL, and ALT level < 40 U/L, using age and HBV-DNA criteria by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guideline. Cumulative HCC risk of untreated IT group (n=194) was compared to HBeAg-positive patients undergoing antiviral therapy according to the practice and reimbursement guidelines (treated HBeAg[+] group, n=454). Patients with history of cirrhosis or HCC at baseline were excluded.Results:During follow-up (median 62.1 months), HCC did not develop in any patient among untreated IT group, whereas the cumulative probability of HCC at 3, 5, and 9 years in the treated HBeAg(+) group was 0.5%, 0.7%, and 1.3%, respectively (p=0.203). Ninety-seven patients among untreated IT group entered immune-active phase, of whom 86 (88.7%) started antiviral treatment. A high normal ALT level (20-39 U/L) was associated with an increased risk of a phase change, compared to ALT Conclusions:No actual HCC risk during untreated IT phase defined by age and HBV-DNA criteria of the AASLD guideline exists, supporting their diagnostic validity from the perspective of long-term prognosis. Further validation studies are required.
