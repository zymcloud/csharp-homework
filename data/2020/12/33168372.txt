Purpose:To determine the frequency and possible causative factors of benign biliary stricture after radioembolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:This retrospective study comprised 232 patients with HCC who underwent yttrium-90 radioembolization between October 2015 and September 2019. Benign biliary stricture was defined as biliary ductal dilatation of segmental or lobar biliary ducts on follow-up images. Clinical and radiologic characteristics were compared using χ2 test or independent t test.Results:Mean target perfused tissue dose was 224.6 Gy ± 106.8 (median, 205.7 Gy; range, 47.0-694.7 Gy). Of 232 patients, 15 (6.5%) had benign biliary stricture, which was detected from 3 weeks to 10.3 months (mean, 3.9 months; median, 3.2 months). Whereas 5 patients did not have any symptoms or signs associated with benign biliary stricture, 10 patients had cholangitis and/or laboratory abnormality requiring biliary drainage procedures and intravenous antibiotic therapy. Selective radioembolization through a caudate artery was performed in 55 (23.7%) patients. The incidence of benign biliary stricture was 16.4% (9/55) and 3.4% (6/177) in patients with and without selective radioembolization through a caudate artery, respectively (P = .002).Conclusions:Benign biliary stricture following yttrium-90 radioembolization may be common among patients receiving selective treatment via a caudate artery.
