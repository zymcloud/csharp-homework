Early studies indicated that the androgen receptor (AR) might play important roles in the regulating of the initiation and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its linkage to the surrounding macrophages and their impacts on the HCC progression remain unclear. Here we found that macrophages in liver cancer might function via altering the microRNA, miR-92a-2-5p, in exosomes to decrease liver cancer cells AR expression, which might then lead to increase the liver cancer cells invasion. Mechanism dissection revealed that miR-92a-2-5p from the exosomes could target the 3'UTR of AR mRNA to suppress AR translation, altering the PHLPP/p-AKT/β-catenin signaling to increase liver cancer cells invasion. Preclinical studies demonstrated that targeting this newly identified signaling with miR-92a-2-5p inhibitors led to suppress liver cancer progression. Together, these findings suggest that macrophages in the liver cancer tumor microenvironment may function via exosomes to regulate liver cancer progression, and targeting this newly identified macrophages/exosomes-miR-92a-2-5p/AR/PHLPP/p-AKT/β-catenin signaling may help in the development of novel treatment strategies to better suppress liver cancer progression.
