Background/aim:The prognosis of cholangiolocarcinoma, a rare malignant liver tumor derived from hepatic progenitor or stem cells, is considered relatively good; however, it frequently recurs. We herein present the diagnosis, histological findings, and treatment of cholangiolocarcinoma.Case report:A 65-year-old woman with a large liver tumor (70 mm in diameter) was referred. Hepatocellular carcinoma was suspected based on strong early enhancement and delayed washout by enhanced computed tomography. The patient underwent curative left tri-sectionectomy. Histologically, she was diagnosed with pure cholangiolocarcinoma in a slightly fibrous liver. Three metachronous recurrent lesions (all â‰¤10 mm in diameter) were found between fifteen and twenty months after the initial hepatectomy. One lesion and the remaining two lesions were treated with hepatectomy and radiofrequency ablation, respectively. Two years after the initial diagnosis, she was doing well without recurrence.Conclusion:Repeated hepatectomy and radiofrequency ablation might be useful for small intrahepatic recurrences of cholangiolocarcinoma.
Cholangiolocarcinoma; liver resection; radio-frequency ablation.
