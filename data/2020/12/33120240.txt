Purpose:This study was designed to preoperatively predict microvascular invasion (MVI) of solitary small hepatocellular carcinoma (sHCC) by quantitative analysis of Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced hepatobiliary phase (HBP) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Method:Sixty-one patients, 19 with and 42 without histologically confirmed MVI following hepatic resection for solitary sHCC (≤ 3 cm), were preoperatively examined with Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. The regions of interest (ROIs) of the hepatic lesions were manually delineated on the maximum cross-sectional area in the HBP images and used to calculate the lesion boundary index (LBI) and marginal gray changes (MGC). Histogram analysis was performed to measure standard deviations (STD) and coefficients of variation (CV). Correlations between quantitative parameters and MVI were evaluated and differences between MVI positive and negative groups were assessed.Results:The average LBI (0.85 ± 0.07) and MGC (0.48 ± 0.27) values of the negative group were significantly higher (p Conclusions:Quantitative analysis of HBP images is useful for predicting MVI and beneficial to clinicians in making decisions before treatment.
