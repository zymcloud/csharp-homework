Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite advances in systemic therapies, patient survival remains low due to late diagnosis and frequent underlying liver diseases. HCC diagnosis generally relies on imaging and liver tissue biopsy. Liver biopsy presents limitations because it is invasive, potentially risky for patients and it frequently misrepresents tumour heterogeneity. Recently, liquid biopsy has emerged as a way to monitor cancer progression in a non-invasive manner. Tumours shed content into the bloodstream, such as circulating tumour cells (CTCs), circulating nucleic acids, extracellular vesicles and proteins, that can be isolated from biological fluids of patients with HCC. These biomarkers provide knowledge regarding the genetic landscape of tumours and might be used for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. In this review, we summarize recent literature on circulating biomarkers for HCC, namely CTCs, circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), RNA, extracellular vesicles and proteins, and their clinical relevance in HCC.
