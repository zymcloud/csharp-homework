Thermal ablation is a standard therapy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Contemporary ablation devices are imperfect, as they lack tumor specificity. An ideal ablation modality would generate thermal energy only within tumoral tissue. Furthermore, as hyperthermia is known to influence tumor immunity, such a tumor-specific ablation modality may have the ability to favorably modulate the tumor immune landscape. Here we show a clinically relevant thermal ablation modality that generates tumor-specific hyperthermia, termed molecularly targeted photothermal ablation (MTPA), that is based upon the excellent localization of indocyanine green to HCC. In a syngeneic rat model, we demonstrate the tumor-specific hyperthermia generated by MTPA. We also show through spatial and transcriptomic profiling techniques that MTPA favorably modulates the intratumoral myeloid population towards tumor immunogenicity and diminishes the systemic release of oncogenic cytokines relative to conventional ablation modalities.
