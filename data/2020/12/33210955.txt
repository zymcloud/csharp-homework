Background: Transarterial therapies are routinely used for the locoregional treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the impact of clinical parameters (i.e. injection location, particle size, particle density etc.) and patient-specific conditions (i.e. hepatic geometry, cancer burden) on the intrahepatic particle distribution (PD) after transarterial injection of embolizing microparticles is still unclear. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) may help to better understand this impact. Methods: Using CFD, both the blood flow and microparticle mass transport were modeled throughout the 3D-reconstructed arterial vasculature of a patient-specific healthy and cirrhotic liver. An experimental feasibility study was performed to simulate the PD in a 3D-printed phantom of the cirrhotic arterial network. Results: Axial and in-plane injection locations were shown to be effective parameters to steer particles toward tumor tissue in both geometries. Increasing particle size or density made it more difficult for particles to exit the domain. As cancer burden increased, the catheter tip location mattered less. The in vitro study and numerical results confirmed that PD largely mimics flow distribution, but that significant differences are still possible. Conclusions: Our findings highlight that optimal parameter choice can lead to selective targeting of tumor tissue, but that targeting potential highly depends on patient-specific conditions.
