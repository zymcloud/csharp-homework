Aim:The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of ramucirumab treatment under real-world conditions and to clarify the role of albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score in predicting outcomes.Methods:Between June 2019 and May 2020, a total of 16 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with ramucirumab in Gunma Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital and its affiliated hospitals was included.Results:The median age was 71 (interquartile range [IQR] 65-74) years old, and 12 patients (75.0%) were male. The modified ALBI (mALBI) grade was 1, 2a, and 2b at baseline in 4 (25.0%), 3 (18.8%), and 9 patients (56.3%), respectively. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage was intermediate and advanced stage in 1 (6.3%) and 15 patients (93.8%), respectively. The serum α-fetoprotein at baseline was 4,911 (IQR 2,091-17,377) ng/mL. The disease control rate in patients with mALBI grade1 + 2a was significantly higher than in those with mALBI grade 2b (100 vs. 28.6%, p = 0.028). The patients with mALBI grade 1 + 2a had a significantly better overall survival (OS) and longer progression-free survival (PFS) than those with mALBI grade 2b (median OS 6.7 vs. 3.0 months; p = 0.036, median PFS 7.5 vs. 1.4 months; p = 0.002). The number of cycles of ramucirumab treatment was significantly correlated with the ALBI score (r = -0.452, p = 0.030). The patients with mALBI grade 1 + 2a showed a low incidence of adverse events (AEs) and discontinuation due to AEs.Conclusions:Advanced HCC patients with mALBI grade 1 + 2a may be a good indication for ramucirumab treatment.
