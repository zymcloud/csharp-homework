Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease, with an estimated rising prevalence, in concert with the epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is not fully elucidated. Besides weight gain and insulin resistance, many other factors seem to contribute, including adipokines, gut microbiota and genetic predisposition. The disease starts as hepatic steatosis, which may proceed to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); if fibrosis is added, the risk of cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma is augmented. Liver biopsy is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis and staging of NAFLD; the early use of reliable and easily applied diagnostic tools, such as noninvasive biomarkers, is needed to identify patients at different-preferably early-stages of disease however. Whilst lifestyle modification is the first step to manage NAFLD, there is poor compliance, leading to the need of drug therapy. Accordingly, a variety of medications is under investigation. Given the multifaceted pathophysiology of NAFLD, probably, a combination of approaches in an individualized basis may be a more appropriate management. This review summarizes evidence on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD.
