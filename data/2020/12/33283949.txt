H3K9 methyltransferase (G9a) and its relevant molecule GLP are the SET domain proteins that specifically add mono, di and trimethyl groups on to the histone H3K9, which lead to the transcriptional inactivation of chromatin and reduce the expression of cancer suppressor genes, which trigger growth and progress of several cancer types. Various studies have demonstrated that overexpression of H3K9 methyltransferase G9a and GLP in different kinds of tumors, like lung, breast, bladder, colon, cervical, gastric, skin cancers, hepatocellular carcinoma and hematological malignancies. Several G9a and GLP inhibitors such as BIX-01294, UNC0642, A-366 and DCG066 were developed to combat various cancers; however, there is a need for more effective and less toxic compounds. The current molecular docking study suggested that the selected new compounds such as ninhydrin, naphthoquinone, cysteamine and disulfide cysteamine could be suitable molecules as a G9a and GLP inhibitors. Furthermore, detailed cell based and preclinical animal studies are required to confirm their properties. In the current review, we discussed the role of G9a and GLP mediated epigenetic regulation in the cancers. A thorough literature review was done related to G9a and GLP. The databases used extensively for retrieval of information were PubMed, Medline, Scopus and Science-direct. Further, molecular docking was performed using Maestro Schrodinger version 9.2 software to investigate the binding profile of compounds with Human G9a HMT (PDB ID: 3FPD, 3RJW) and Human GLP MT (PDB ID: 6MBO, 6MBP).
