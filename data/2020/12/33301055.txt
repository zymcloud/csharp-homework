Background:Lenvatinib is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor that exhibits an antitumor effect on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An established strategy that involves surgery and usage of lenvatinib for advanced HCC remains elusive.Case presentation:A 58-year-old male patient with advanced HCC and untreated hepatitis B was referred to our hospital. The tumor at the right lobe was 10 cm in diameter with right portal vein thrombus. Because of the possible lung metastasis and concern about the remaining hepatic function after extended right hepatectomy, lenvatinib was initiated before surgery. After the confirmation of a sharp decrease of tumor markers during the 3-week lenvatinib therapy, only a right portal vein transection was done leaving the enlargement of the left lobe for improved post-hepatectomy liver function while lenvatinib therapy was continued. The laparotomy revealed that the tumor was invading the right diaphragm. After 7 weeks of lenvatinib administration after right portal vein transection, an extended right hepatectomy with resection of the tumor-invaded diaphragm was successfully done. The lung nodules that were suspected as metastases had disappeared. The patient has been doing well without any sign of recurrence for 1 year.Conclusion:The strategy involving the induction of lenvatinib to conversion hepatectomy including the portal vein transection was effective for advanced HCC.
