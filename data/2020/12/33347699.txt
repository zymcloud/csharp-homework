Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer death in Egypt. There is still a risk for HCC development even after eradicating hepatitis C virus (HCV) by direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Chitinase-3-like protein1(CHI3L1),a biomarker for predicting many diseases, plays an essential role in inflammation, angiogenesis, and antiapoptosis. Tolloid-like protein 1 (TLL1) may be involved in hepatic fibrogenesis and carcinogenesis.Objectives:Determining the role and combined effect of CHI3L1 (rs880633), TLL1 (rs1503298), and an intergenic (rs597533) polymorphisms on the risk of developing HCC in Egyptian patients after achieving SVR by DAAs.Subjects and methods:Blood samples were collected from 68 HCC patients, 77 non-HCC subjects and 80 healthy controls. The DNA was extracted and analyzed for rs880633, rs1503298 and rs597533 using Genotyping TaqManTM assay.Results:A significant difference in genotypes and alleles frequencies was observed in both (rs880633) and (rs597533) between HCC group as compared to healthy control and also as compared to the non-HCC group. However, regarding to (rs1503298) genotypes and alleles between the HCC and non-HCC groups, there were no significant differences. Combined polymorphism in more than one gene simultaneously showed a higher risk to HCC after SVR than an individual locus.Conclusion:Both allelic and genotypic variations of the CHI3L1 gene (rs880633) and an intergenic (rs597533) seemed to be significant predictors confirming a great risk for HCC susceptibility in Egyptian patients achieved SVR. Patients with a polymorphism in more than one gene showed an increased risk to HCC after SVR rather than individual locus. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
