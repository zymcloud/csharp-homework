Increasing evidence has suggested the crucial role cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in the biology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a lethal malignancy with high morbidity and mortality. Hence, this study explored the modulatory effect of the putative cyclin-dependent kinase 11B (CDK11B)-mediated ubiquitination on HCC stem cells. The expression of CDK11B, SAM pointed domain-containing ETS transcription factor (SPDEF) and DOT1-like histone lysine methyltransferase (DOT1L) was determined by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis in HCC tissues and cells. The interaction among CDK11B, SPDEF, miR-448, and DOT1L was analyzed by Co-IP, ubiquitination-IP and ChIP assays, whereas their effects on the biological characteristics of HCC stem cells were assessed by sphere formation and colony formation assays. An in vivo xenograft tumor model was developed for validating the regulation of CDK11B in oncogenicity of HCC stem cells. We characterized the aberrant upregulation of CDK11B and downregulation SPDEF in HCC tissues and cells. CDK11B degraded SPDEF through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, whereas SPDEF could bind to the miR-448 promoter and inhibit the expression of DOT1L by activating miR-448, whereby promoting self-renewal of HCC stem cells. Knockdown of CDK11B attenuated the self-renewal capability of HCC stem cells and their oncogenicity in vivo. These findings highlighted that blocking the CDK11B-induced degradation of SPDEF and enhancing miR-448-dependent inhibition of DOT1L may delay the progression of HCC by restraining self-renewal capability of HCC stem cells, representing novel targets for HCC management.
