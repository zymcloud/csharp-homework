Tumour mutation burden (TMB) and the immune microenvironment (IME) are reportedly associated with immunotherapy responses, but this relationship remains unclear in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We classified HCC patients in the liver hepatocellular carcinoma cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas into low- and high-TMB groups and evaluated differences in immune infiltrates. Additionally, differentially expressed genes in the low- and high-TMB groups were identified, and functional analyses were conducted. A risk score model was constructed based on three differentially expressed immune genes (DEIGs). The Tumor Immune Estimation Resource database was utilized to analyse how the IME was affected by the three hub DEIGs. Finally, a prognostic nomogram combining risk scores and stages was established and externally validated with the International Cancer Genome Consortium and GSE14520 cohorts. High-TMB (top 20%) patients exhibited a worse prognosis (P = 0.017). Follicular helper cells (P = 0.001) and activated natural killer cells (P = 0.003) were enriched in high-TMB patients, while resting dendritic cells (P = 0.002) were enriched in low-TMB samples. A risk score model was generated with three hub DEIGs (CCR7, STC2 and S100A9) to predict overall survival in HCC cohorts. Moreover, copy number variations mainly reduced infiltration levels. The nomogram performed better than the risk score model in the training and validation datasets. Higher TMB was associated with IME diversification and worse prognosis in HCC. Mutations in three hub TMB-associated DEIGs correlated with lower immune cell infiltration.
