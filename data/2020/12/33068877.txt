Background & aims:Population based studies on the epidemiology of HCC are scarce. We aimed to compare CG (cirrhotic HCC group) with NCG (non-cirrhotic HCC group), analyze incidence, etiology and survival among patients diagnosed in Iceland in a population-based cohort. A previous study from Iceland (1984-1998) showed an incidence of HCC of 1.1/100.000, mostly with NCG.Methods:A nationwide, population based retrospective study. Information on patients with HCC during 1998-2017 was obtained and medical records viewed.Results:Overall 152 patients with HCC were identified. The mean incidence was 1.7/100.000 and increased by 8% annually. Alcohol and hepatitis C combined was more common as a risk factor in CG than in the NCG (13 % vs. 2%, p = 0.03). Tumor size was larger in NCG (11 cm vs 5 cm, p Conclusions:A major increase in the incidence of patients with HCC has occurred. The non-cirrhotic HCC presented with larger size tumors, lower proportion of portal vein thrombosis and were more likely to be surgical candidates, although not affecting prognosis. Diagnosis by surveillance in patients with cirrhosis has increased and the survival of those patients is better compared to others.
