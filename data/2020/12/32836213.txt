Objective:The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the outcome of LR-3 and LR-4 without arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE), and identify which features could predict LR-5 progression on serial Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI follow-up.Methods:Forty-nine cirrhotic patients with 55 LR-3 and 19 LR-4 without APHE were evaluated. Observations were classified as decreased, stable or increased in category at follow-up. Observation size and LI-RADS major and ancillary features were evaluated.Results:Seventeen/fifty-five (31%) LR-3 and 8/19 (42%) LR-4 progressed to LR-5 at follow-up. Baseline LI-RADS major and ancillary features were not significantly different among LR-3 and LR-4. A diameter â‰¥ 10 mm significantly increased LR-5 progression risk of LR-3 (OR = 6.07; 95% CI: 0.12; 60.28]; P Conclusion:LR-3 and LR-4 without APHE were often downgraded or remained stable in category on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI follow-up.
