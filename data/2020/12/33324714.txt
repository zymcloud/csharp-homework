Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a syndrome characterized by excessive immune activation. Timely diagnosis can be challenging, and prompt treatment is the only hope for survival. We present an adult patient with a history of alcohol dependence, who presented with fatigue, bilateral lower extremity edema, and orange-colored urine. Clinical workup revealed abnormal liver function tests, elevated ferritin, cytopenia, and lymphadenopathy. Eventually, he was diagnosed with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. This case report encourages gastroenterologists to maintain a high index of suspicion when a patient presents with liver failure, hyperferritinemia, and cytopenia because they may be the first healthcare professionals to evaluate these patients.
