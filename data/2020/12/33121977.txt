Mallory-Denk Bodies (MDBs) are prevalent in a variety of liver diseases including alcoholic hepatitis (AH) and are formed in mice livers by feeding DDC. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are considered as emerging new gene regulators, which participates in many functional activities through diverse mechanisms. We previously reported the mechanisms involved in the formation of liver MDBs in mouse model and in AH livers where MDBs had formed. To investigate the regulation of mRNAs expression and the probable role of lncRNAs in AH livers with MDBs, RNA-Seq analyses was further conducted to determine the mRNA and lncRNA expression profiles of the AH livers compared with the normal livers. It showed that different lncRNAs have different information contribution degrees by principal component analysis, and the integrated analysis of lncRNA-mRNA co-expression networks were linked to endocytosis, cell cycle, p53 signaling pathways in the human. Based on the co-expression networks, we identify 36 mRNAs that could be as potential biomarkers of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To our knowledge, this is the first report on the regulatory network of lncRNAs associated with liver MDB formation in human, and these results might offer new insights into the molecular mechanisms of liver MDB formation and the progression of AH to HCC.
