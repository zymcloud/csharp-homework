The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been confirmed in cancers through binding specific mRNAs to invade human cells. Therefore, the aim of this study described here was to develop and validate novel SARS-CoV-2 proteins binding human mRNAs (SPBRs) signature to predict overall survival (OS) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using multivariate Cox regression analysis, a set of SPBRs was identified to establish a multigene signature in the Cancer Genome Atlas repositories cohort. Furthermore, a nomogram was established based on the signature and clinical risk factors to improve risk stratification for individual patients. External validation was performed in the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) cohort. A six-SPBR signature was built to classify patients into two risk groups using a risk score with different OS in two cohorts (all p < 0.0001). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated the signature was an independent predictor of HCC. Moreover, the signature presented an excellent diagnostic power in differentiating HCC and normal tissues. Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that high-risk group was closely enriched in cell cycle, DNA replication, microRNAs in cancer, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. The novel signature demonstrated great clinical value in predicting the OS for patients with HCC, and will provide a good reference between cancer research and SARS-CoV-2 and help individualized treatment in HCC.
