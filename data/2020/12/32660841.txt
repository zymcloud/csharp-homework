Background:Despite efficacy in HCV eradication, direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy has raised controversies around their impact on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence. Herein we reported the first Australian data on HCC incidence in DAA-treated HCV patients with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis.Methods:We conducted a retrospective single center study of DAA-treated HCV patients with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis from April 2015 to December 2017. Patients with prior HCC were included if they had complete response to HCC treatment.Results:Among 138 patients who completed DAA therapy, 133 (96.4%) achieved sustained virologic response (median follow-up 23.8 months). Ten had prior HCC and 5/10 (50.0%) developed recurrence, while de novo HCC developed in 7/128 (5.5%). Median time from DAA to HCC diagnosis was 34 weeks in recurrent HCC vs. de novo 52 weeks (P = 0.159). In patients with prior HCC, those with recurrence (vs. without) had shorter median time between last HCC treatment and DAA (12 vs. 164 weeks, P Conclusions:Our study demonstrates a high incidence of recurrent HCC in HCV patients with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis treated with DAA. Factors associated with HCC development post-DAA were more advanced liver disease, failed SVR12 and prior HCC, with higher rates of recurrence in those who started DAA earlier.
