The aim of the present study was to retrospectively analyze clinical outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) treated with yttrium-90 radioembolization stratified by Milan PVTT score according to PVTT extension, tumor burden, and bilirubin levels. Seventy patients were included and classified into good (n = 15; 21.4%), intermediate (n = 33; 47.1%), and dismal (n = 22; 31.4%) prognostic groups. Median overall survival durations were 24.6 mo, 13 mo (hazard ratio = 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-9.7; P = .016), and 5.9 mo (hazard ratio = 4.1; 95% CI, 1.4-13.4; P = .0096), respectively. The Milan score represents an easy tool to select patients with HCC with PVTT who may benefit from radioembolization.
