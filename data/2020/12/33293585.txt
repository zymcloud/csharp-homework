Stemness factors control microRNA expression in cancer stem cells. Downregulation of miR-100 and miR-125b is associated with tumor progression and prognosis of various cancers. Comparing miRNA profiling of patient-derived tumorsphere (TS) and adherent (2D) hepatocellular carcinoma cells, miR-100 and miR-125b are identified to have association with stemness. In TS cells, miR-100 and miR-125b were downregulated comparing to 2D cells. The finding was reproduced in Hep3B cells. Overexpression of stemness factors NANOG, OCT4 and SOX2 by introduction of gene constructs in Hep3B cells suppressed these two miRNA expression levels. Treatment of chromeceptin, an IGF signaling pathway inhibitor, decreased numbers of TS and inhibited the AKT/mTOR pathway. Stable cell line of miR-100 and miR-125b overexpression decreased IGF2 expression and inhibited tumor growth in the xenograft model. In conclusion, miR-100 and miR-125b have tumor suppressor role in hepatocellular carcinoma through inhibiting IGF2 expression and activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway.
