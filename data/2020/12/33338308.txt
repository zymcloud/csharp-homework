Background:Noninvasive techniques for liver fibrosis diagnosis are very important for clinician especially in high risk patients for liver biopsy. We further explored the diagnostic accuracy of FibroScan, FIB-4, and APRI in identifying liver fibrosis and assess their predictive role for esophageal varices in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Total 380 patients who underwent surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma were included based on retrospective study design. Liver fibrosis was pathologically diagnosed using the Ishak scoring system. Liver stiffness parameters were measured using FibroScan. APRI and FIB-4 were calculated. Among those, 121 patients who received esophagogastroduodenoscopic examination underwent variceal evaluation.Results:For liver cirrhosis diagnosis with FibroScan, the optimal cutoff values for the patients with HCC overall, left HCC, and right HCC were 8.85, 11.75, and 8.70 KPa (the accuracy were 78.7%, 78.4% and 79.2% separately). They had high areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.84, 0.84, and 0.85. The combined FibroScan, APRI, and FIB-4 had very high specificity (more than 92%) for cirrhosis diagnosis. The optimal cutoff liver stiffness values for the diagnosis of varices were all 11.2 kPa. For predicting varices, the optimal cutoff values of FIB-4 and APRI were 2.64 and 0.71, their accuracy were 64.3% -78.4%, 69.4% and 72.7% separately.Conclusions:FibroScan, FIB-4, and APRI have moderate accuracy for liver fibrosis diagnosis and esophageal varices prediction in patients with hepatoma. This is a study of these noninvasive techniques applied in specific hepatoma patients and with inevitable limitations and need future more studies for validation.
