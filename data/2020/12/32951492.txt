Several epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated genes (EAGs) have been confirmed to correlate with the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Herein, we explored the value of EAGs in the prognosis of HCC relying on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. A total of 200 EMT-associated genes were downloaded from the Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) website. Moreover, 96 differentially expressed EAGs were identified. Using Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, we forecasted the potential molecular mechanisms of EAGs. To identify prognostic EAGs, Cox regression was used in developing a prognostic risk model. Then, the Kaplan-Meier and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to validate the prognostic significance of the model. A total of 5 prognostic correlated EAGs (P3H1, SPP1, MMP1, LGALS1, and ITGB5) were screened via Cox regression, which provided the basis for developing a novel prognostic risk model. Based on the risk model, patients were subdivided into high-risk and low-risk groups. The overall survival of the low-risk group was better compared to the high-risk group (P Abbreviations: HCC: hepatocellular carcinoma; TCGA: The Cancer Genome Atlas; EMT: epithelial-mesenchymal transition; EAGs: EMT-associated genes; GSEA: gene set enrichment analysis; GO: Gene Ontology; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; PPI: protein-protein interaction; TF: transcription factor; ROC: receiver operating characteristic; K-M: Kaplan-Meier; AUC: the area under the ROC curve; FDR: false discovery rate; TNM: Tumor size/lymph nodes/distance metastasis.
