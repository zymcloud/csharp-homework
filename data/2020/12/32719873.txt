Purpose:This study aims to examine the burden of primary liver cancer in 185 countries in 2018.Methods:The estimates of incidence, mortality and prevalence of primary liver cancer were procured from GLOBOCAN 2018. The development status of a country was measured using the human development index-a composite indicator of income per capita, education and life expectancy.Results:Globally, primary liver cancer resulted in an estimated 781 631 deaths at age-standardized mortality rate of 8.5/100 000, and 841 080 cases were estimated to be diagnosed in 2018. Males accounted for 596 574 cases and 548 375 deaths, which is more than twice the burden of primary liver cancer in females (cases: 244 506; deaths: 233 456). The global age-standardized incidence rate was 9.3/100 000 in 2018, varying from Morocco (1.1/100 000) to Mongolia (93.7/100 000). There were remarkable variations in terms of age-standardized mortality rate, too, which ranged from 1/100 000 in Nepal to 75.4/100 000 in Mongolia. East Asia was the top region contributing 55.6% of global cases and 54.7% of global deaths.Conclusions:Since majority of the primary liver cancer burden pertains to hepatocellular carcinoma and screening approaches are yet to be fully proven, the policy focus must be on prevention approaches through the hepatitis-B vaccine, early detection of hepatitis-C infection, reduced alcohol consumption, obesity control, reduced aflatoxin exposure and containment of other modifiable risk factors.
