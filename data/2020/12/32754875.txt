Doxorubicin (Dox) is a widely neoplasm chemotherapeutic drug with high incidences of cardiotoxicity. Prodigiosin (PG), a red bacterial pigment from Serratia marcescens, has been demonstrated to potentiate Dox's cytotoxicity against oral squamous cell carcinoma cells through elevating Dox influx and identified as a Dox enhancer via PG-induced autophagy; however, toxicity of normal cell remains unclear. This study is conducted to evaluate putative cytotoxicity features of PG/Dox synergism in the liver, kidney, and heart cells and further elucidate whether PG augmented Dox's effect via modulating Dox metabolism in normal cells. Murine hepatocytes FL83B, cardio-myoblast h9c2, and human kidney epithelial cells HK-2 were sequentially treated with PG and Dox by measuring cell viability, cell death characteristics, oxidative stress, Dox flux, and Dox metabolism. PG could slightly significant increase Dox cytotoxicity in all tested normal cells whose toxic alteration was less than that of oral squamous carcinoma cells. The augmentation of Dox cytotoxicity might be attributed to the increase of Dox-mediated ROS accumulation that might cause slight reduction of Dox influx and reduction of Dox metabolism. It was noteworthy to notice that sustained cytotoxicity appeared in normal cells after PG and Dox were removed. Taken together, moderately metabolic reduction of Dox might be ascribed to the mechanism of increase Dox cytotoxicity in PG-induced normal cells; nevertheless, the determination of PG/Dox dose with sustained cytotoxicity in normal cells needs to be comprehensively considered.
