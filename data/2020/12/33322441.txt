Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for the maintenance, metastasis, and relapse of various tumors. The effects of CSCs on the tumorigenesis of HCC are still not fully understood, however. We have recently established two new rat HCC cell lines HTC and TW-1, which we isolated from diethylnitrosamine-induced rat liver cancer. Results showed that TW-1 expressed the genetic markers of CSCs, including CD133, GSTP1, CD44, CD90, and EpCAM. Moreover, TW-1 showed higher tolerance to sorafenib than HTC did. In addition, tumorigenesis and metastasis were observed in nude mice and wild-type rats with TW-1 xenografts. Finally, we combined highly expressed genes in TW-1/HTC with well-known biomarkers from recent HCC studies to predict HCC-related biomarkers and able to identify HCC with AUCs > 0.9 after machine learning. These results indicated that TW-1 was a novel rat CSC line, and the mice or rat models we established with TW-1 has great potential on HCC studies in the future.
