Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality and the only cancer for which the incidence and mortality are on the rise. Sensitive and specific screening and diagnostic approaches, robust staging regimens, multidisciplinary tumor boards, and patient/family education and engagement in the shared decision-making process help to identify a patient's optimal treatment options. Locoregional therapies have been the mainstay for treating intermediate-stage disease, but they are finding special applications for early and advanced disease. This review discusses the diagnosis of HCC, current accepted staging models, and treatment of HCC, with a focus on locoregional therapies.
