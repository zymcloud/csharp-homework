Introduction:Digital intelligent technology represented by three-dimensional (3D) visualization technology and surgical navigation system may provide preoperative and intraoperative anatomical information more accurately than CT and MRI [1]. Besides, the fusion of 3D model with surgical visual field through surgical navigation system may also compensate for the defects of visual fields and tactile sense to some extent in laparoscopic liver surgery [2].Video:A 49-year-old male patient with a tumor mainly located at the left inner area of liver and oppressing the middle hepatic vein (MHV). We formulated preoperative planning by using the Medical Image 3D Visualization System (MI3DVS, software copyright No: 2008SR18798) [3]. It was acknowledged that the right hepatic vein (RHV) was strong enough to drain the right anterior hepatic sector. Ultimately, 3D laparoscopic extended left hepatectomy with resection of the MHV was selected as the optimal operation scheme for the patient due to the RHV would avoid hepatic venous congestion in segment V and VIII after resection of the MHV, and more liver parenchyma than left trisegmentectomy would be retained. The operation was performed under assistance of the Laparoscopic Hepatectomy Navigation System (LHNS, software copyright No. 2018SR840555) [4].Results:The total operation time was 180 min, estimated blood loss of 200 ml. The final histopathological diagnosis showed an 8*6*6-cm-sized hepatocellular carcinoma. And the patient was discharged on postoperative day 6 without any complications.Conclusion:Digital intelligent technology may be helpful to formulate preoperative planning and identify intraoperative important anatomical structures in 3D laparoscopic extended left hepatectomy with resection of the MHV.
