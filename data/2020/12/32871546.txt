Background:Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities are assumed to negatively affect treatment and outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our aim was to investigate the interaction of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic factors with stage of disease and type of treatment facility in receipt of treatment and overall survival (OS) of patients with HCC.Methods:All patients with primary HCC in the US Safety-Net Collaborative database (2012-2014) were included. Patients were categorized into "safety-net" or "tertiary referral center" based on where they received treatment. Socioeconomic factors were determined at the zip-code level and included median income and percent of adults who graduated from high-school. Primary outcomes were receipt of treatment and OS.Results:On MV Cox regression, neither race/ethnicity, median income, nor care provided at a SNH were associated with decreased OS (all p > 0.05). Independent predictors of decreased OS included lack of insurance (HR 1.34), less educational attainment (HR 1.59) higher MELD score (HR 1.07), higher stage at diagnosis (II:HR 1.34, III:HR 2.87, IV:HR 3.23), and not receiving treatment (HR 3.94) (all p Conclusions:There is no intrinsic or direct association of race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or being treated at select safety-net hospitals with worse outcomes. Poor liver function, no insurance, and advanced stage of presentation are the main determinants of not receiving treatment and decreased survival.
