Synergistic photochemical therapy with high performance and weak side effects is of great importance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment, therefore ingenious construct of nano-based therapy agents with accurate drug delivery and high photothermal conversion efficiency is of critical to the cancer therapy. Herein, an organic-inorganic hybrid nanomaterial (MGO@CD-CA-HA) has been constructed successfully by coating the Î²-cyclodextrin-cholic acid-hyaluronic acid polymer (CD-CA-HA) onto the Fe3O4-graphene oxide (MGO). The MGO@CD-CA-HA revealed satisfactory multiple-targeted features including the cholic acid supplied hepatic-target, CD44-receptor target of hyaluronic acid and magnetic target of Fe3O4. Meanwhile, the hydrophobic antitumor drug camptothecin (CPT) was easily loaded by MGO@CD-CA-HA to form the MGO@CD-CA-HA/CPT nanocomposite, and the maximum theoretical adsorption capacity can reach 847.4 mg/g. Based on the facile photothermal response of MGO, the near-infrared radiation (808 nm) induced local hyperthermia was directly generated the apoptosis of tumor cells while triggered the release of CPT. Comparing with other kinds of cancer cells and normal hepatocyte cells, this PCT system provides a significant inhibitory effect for the liver cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, the synergistic photochemical therapy presented the strong antitumor effect (the tumor inhibition rate > 90 %) in vivo. Thus, this study provided a promising multiple-targeted nanocarrier for chemo-photothermal combination therapy of liver cancer.
