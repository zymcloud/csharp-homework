Background/aim:In chronic liver disease, various immune cell subsets exert pro or anti-tumour effects by releasing reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS). Here, we evaluated the oxidative and nitrosative pattern in peripheral blood leukocyte subpopulations of early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients compared with HCC-free cirrhotic patients.Materials and methods:Venous blood samples from 18 HCC-free cirrhotic patients and 17 early stage HCC patients were collected to determine ROS, RNS and reduced glutathione levels in isolated leukocytes analyzed by flow cytometry.Results:Intracellular levels of ROS and glutathione were higher in lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils from HCC patients as well as mitochondrial superoxide in neutrophils and monocytes whereas intracellular levels of nitric oxide were lower in lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils.Conclusion:Early HCC alters intracellular levels of ROS and RNS of some circulating leukocytes subsets. This finding may represent a potential area of interest concerning the development of new treatments and prognostic markers.
