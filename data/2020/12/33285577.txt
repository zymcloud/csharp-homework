Since the introduction of robot-assisted surgery, increasingly complex operations have been performed with this technique. Robot-assisted operations are also of increasing importance in hepatobiliary surgery. With articulated and scaled movements in a three-dimensional surgical field, permit precise preparation, as is needed for major hepatic resection. This video demonstrates the feasibility and precision of completely robotic surgery in right hemihepatectomy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of segments V - VIII in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The patient was 72 years old for the operation, with concomitant marked metabolic syndrome.
