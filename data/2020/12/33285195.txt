Background:In patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), macrovascular invasion (MVI) is associated with a poor prognosis. The purpose of this study is to describe long-term outcomes of patients with HCC and MVI treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).Methods:Patients with HCC and MVI who were treated with SBRT from January 2003 to December 2016 were analyzed. Patients who had extrahepatic disease or previous liver transplant were excluded. Demographical, clinical, and treatment variables were analyzed.Results:128 eligible patients with HCC and MVI were treated with SBRT. Median age was 60.5 years (39 to 90 years). Baseline Child-Pugh (CP) score was A5 in 67%, A6 in 20%. Median SBRT dose was 33.3 Gy (range: 27 to 54 Gy) in 5 fractions. Local control at 1 year was 87.4% (95% CI 78.6 to 96.1%). Median overall survival (OS) was 18.3 months (95% CI 11.2 to 21.4 months); ECOG performance status >1 (HR:1.85, p=0.0138) and earlier treatment era (HR: 2.20, p=0.0015) were associated with worsening OS. In 43 patients who received sorafenib following SBRT, median OS was 37.9 months (95% CI 19.5 to 54.4 months). Four patients developed GI bleeding possibly related to SBRT at 2 to 8 months, and 27% (31/112 evaluable patients) had worsening of CP class at three months after SBRT.Conclusions:SBRT was associated with encouraging outcomes for patients with HCC and MVI, especially in those patients who received sorafenib after SBRT. Randomized phase III trials of SBRT with systemic and/or regional therapy are warranted and ongoing.
