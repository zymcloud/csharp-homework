Intrahepatic biloma is a rare complication of radiofrequency ablation (RFA). When present, it can only be conservatively managed. Here, we report the case of a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma complicated by an intractable biloma after RFA. The biloma could not be managed via percutaneous catheter drainage and antibiotic administration for over 3 months. The intractable biloma was finally cured using percutaneous transhepatic portal vein embolization. The present case demonstrates a useful treatment option for intractable biloma after RFA.
