A 73-year-old man presented with multiple liver nodules on an abdominal echogram. Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT) showed multiple nodules in his anterior and posterior mediastinum, and liver. Following thymothymectomy with lymph node dissection, the liver nodules were completely resected. Finally, he was diagnosed with combined thymic tumor (small cell carcinoma and type B3 thymoma) with multiple mediastinal lymph nodes and liver metastases by type B3 thymoma. Follow-up PET-CT scan revealed multiple rib and celiac lymph node metastases, six courses of chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) were administered, and the patient survived without any recurrence for 15 years after initial surgery.
