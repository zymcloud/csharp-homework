Background:Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is a promising serum biomarker in cancer diagnosis. However, literature on the diagnostic value of the lncRNA for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is scant.Methods:The expression of ST8SIA6-AS1 in serum and HCC cell lines was detected by real-time PCR (RT-PCR). We then analyzed the relationship between clinicopathological characteristics and serum ST8SIA6-AS1 expression. In addition, we performed the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under curve (AUC) analyses to determine the diagnostic ability of serum ST8SIA6-AS1.Results:Our data demonstrated an up-regulation of ST8SIA6-AS1 in 77 HCC patients and HCC cell lines. Besides, clinicopathological analysis revealed that ST8SIA6-AS1 corresponds with tumor stages and metastasis, thus might be used for monitoring the HCC progress. Importantly, the ROC analysis demonstrated that ST8SIA6-AS1 yields a superior diagnostic ability. Compared with Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) alone, a combination of ST8SIA6-AS1 and AFP may achieve more reliable diagnostic results.Conclusions:Together, our results demonstrate that serum ST8SIA6-AS1 is a promising serum diagnostic bio-marker for HCC.
