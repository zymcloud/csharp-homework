Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant primary cancer with high mortality. Previous studies have demonstrated that RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are involved in the biological processes of cancers, including hepatocellular cancer.Methods:In this study, we aimed to identify the clinical value of RNA-binding proteins for hepatocellular carcinoma. We obtained gene expression and clinical data of hepatocellular carcinoma patients from the TCGA and ICGC databases. The prognostic value of RBP-related genes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and their function were studied by comprehensive bioinformatics analyses. The gene signature of SMG5, EZH2, FBLL1, ZNF239, and IGF2BP3 was generated by univariate and multivariate Cox regression and LASSO regression analyses. We built and verified a prognostic nomogram based on RBP-related genes. The gene signature was validated by the ICGC database. The expression of RBP-related genes was validated by the Oncomine database, the Human Protein Atlas and Kaplan-Meier plotter.Result:Most RBP-related genes were significantly different in cancer and normal tissues. The survival of patients in the different groups was significantly different. The gene signature showed good performance for predicting the survival of HCC patients by having a better area under the receiver operating characteristic curve than other clinicopathological parameters.Conclusion:Gene signatures based on RNA-binding proteins can be independent risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
