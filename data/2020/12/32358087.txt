In randomized clinical trials, no survival benefit has been observed for selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) over sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to assess, through a metaanalysis, whether overall survival (OS) with SIRT, as monotherapy or followed by sorafenib, is noninferior to sorafenib and to compare safety profiles for patients with advanced HCC. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library up to February 2019 to identify randomized clinical trials comparing SIRT, as monotherapy or followed by sorafenib, with sorafenib monotherapy among patients with advanced HCC. The main outcomes were OS and frequency of treatment-related severe adverse events (â‰¥grade 3). The per-protocol population was the primary analysis population. A noninferiority margin of 1.08 in terms of hazard ratio was prespecified for the upper boundary of 95% confidence interval for OS. Prespecified subgroup analyses were performed. Results: Three randomized clinical trials, involving 1,243 patients, comparing sorafenib with SIRT (SIRveNIB and SARAH) or SIRT followed by sorafenib (SORAMIC), were included. After randomization, 411 of 635 (64.7%) patients allocated to SIRT and 522 of 608 (85.8%) allocated to sorafenib completed the studies without major protocol deviations. Median OS with SIRT, whether or not followed by sorafenib, was noninferior to sorafenib (10.2 and 9.2 mo [hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-1.05]). Treatment-related severe adverse events were reported in 149 of 515 patients (28.9%) who received SIRT and 249 of 575 (43.3%) who received sorafenib only (P < 0.01). Conclusion: SIRT as initial therapy for advanced HCC is noninferior to sorafenib in terms of OS and offers a better safety profile.
