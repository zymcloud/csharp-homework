Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignancy characterized by neoangiogenesis, which is an augmented production of proangiogenic factors by the tumor and its adjacent infected cells. These dysregulated angiogenic factors are the therapeutic targets in anti-angiogenic drug development. The signaling pathway of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGFR-2 is crucial for controlling the angiogenic responses in endothelial cells (ECs). In this study, we carried out a rational drug design approach wherein we have identified the novel orally bioavailable compound VS 8 as a potent VEGFR-2 inhibitor, which remarkably suppresses hVEGF and hVEGFR-2 expression in HUVECs and exhibits significant anti-angiogenic effects in CAM assay. Besides, VS 8 significantly induces apoptosis in HCC cell line (Hep G2). Later we examined its effectiveness against CD44+ and CD133+ CSCs. Here, VS 8 was found to be active against CSCs, and adequate for the cessation of the cell cycle at 'G0/G1' and 'S' phase in CD44+ and CD133+ CSCs respectively. Factually, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induces invasion and migration of HCC cells, which results in the metastasis. Therefore, we studied the effect of VS 8 on EMT markers using flow cytometry, which suggested that VS 8 significantly upregulates E-cadherin (epithelial biomarker) and downregulates vimentin (mesenchymal biomarker). Further, VS 8 downregulates the expression of EMT-inducing transcription factors (EMT-TFs), i.e., SNAIL. Altogether, our findings indicate that VS 8 could be a promising drug candidate for cancer therapy.
