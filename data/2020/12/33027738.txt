HCV NS3, a non-structural hepatitis C viral protein is used as one of the potential targets for inhibition by direct-acting antivirals. It is known that the success rate for HCV genotype-1 treatment remained very high, however, treatment of genotype-3a (GT-3a), is still quite challenging. In the current study, the HCV GT-3a full-length NS3 gene was amplified and sequenced. The complete nucleotide sequence was translated into the amino acid sequence and homology models of HCV-NS3 GT-3a were generated by HCV-NS3 genotype-1b as a template. The objective of the study was to screen novel therapeutic hits from large databases. For this aim, various small molecule databases including, BindingDB (∼45.000 compounds), NCI (∼265.000 compounds), and Specs-SC (∼212.000 compounds) were used. Firstly, all of the compounds were screened using binary-QSAR models from the MetaCore/MetaDrug server, and compounds were filtered based on therapeutic activity predictions by the anti-viral QSAR model. Filtered molecules were used in 26 different toxicity QSAR models and active non-toxic compounds were identified. These selected molecules were then used in docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations studies at the binding cavities of the NS3 protease domain of the GT-3a. Results were compared with known inhibitors and novel molecules are proposed against HCV-NS3 GT-3a. These molecules have high ligand efficiencies as compared to the reference molecules suggesting a better alternate to the existing suite of inhibitors. Thus, this study will be a step ahead in the development of new potential compounds as antiviral drugs for the GT-3a target.
