Background:There is currently no consensus regarding the relative applicability of minimally invasive treatment, including radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in patients with a single small peripheral hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and compensated cirrhosis. This study investigated the clinical outcomes of MIS and RFA for single subcapsular HCC ≤ 2 cm in patients with compensated cirrhosis.Methods:In this retrospective study, we enrolled 75 patients who had a single subcapsular HCC ≤ 2 cm along with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis and a preoperative platelet count ≥ 100 k/μl. These patients underwent RFA (n = 39) or MIS (n = 36) between 2010 and 2016. Clinical outcomes including disease-free survival (DFS), survival without recurrence beyond the Milan criteria (RBM), and overall survival (OS) were compared.Results:The 7-year DFS rates in the MIS and RFA groups were 86.1% and 35.9% (p Conclusions:MIS was associated with a better 7-year OS, RBM, and DFS among patients with single subcapsular HCC ≤ 2 cm, Child-Pugh A liver function, and no clinically significant portal hypertension when compared to those who underwent percutaneous RFA.
