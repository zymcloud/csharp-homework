Introduction and objectives:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death around the world. Despite improvement in the prevention and treatment of HCC, the clinical prognosis is still poor with increasing mortality. Non-coding RNAs play pivotal roles in HCC oncogenesis, but the detailed mechanism is poorly known. Therefore, the functions and interaction of lncRNA NORAD and miR-211-5p in HCC was investigated in this study.Methods:Quantitative real-time PCR method was used to analyze the expression of NORAD and miR-211-5p in clinical HCC tissues and cultured cell lines. Knockdown of NORAD and overexpression of miR-211-5p were then carried in HCC cells. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis and luciferase report assays were further employed to analyze the interaction between miR-211-5p and NORAD or FOXD1.Results:Increased lncRNA NORAD and decreased miR-211-5p expression were first detected in HCC compared with the peritumorial area. Further studies showed that knockdown of NORAD or overexpression of miR-211-5p impaired the proliferation, migration and angiogenesis of HCC cells. Mechanistically, we found that NORAD functions as a sponge for miR-211-5p. Moreover, it was revealed that decreased miR-211-5p induced the expression of FOXD1 as well as its downstream target VEGF-A, thereby contributes to enhanced angiogenesis of HCC.Conclusion:Elevated NORAD works as a sponge for miR-211-5p in HCC, thus release the inhibition effect of the latter on its downstream target FOXD1 and VEGF-A, which finally promotes angiogenesis. These results provide new insights into the interaction between NORAD and miR-211-5p in HCC and their potential usage as targets for the development of novel therapeutics against HCC.
