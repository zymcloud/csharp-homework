Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors with a low survival rate. The identification of mechanisms underlying the development of HCC helps uncover cellular and molecular targets for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of HCC. Golgi protein 73 (GP73) level is upregulated in HCC patients and potentially can be a therapeutic target. Despite many studies devoted to GP73 as a marker for HCC early diagnosis, there is little discussion about the function of GP73 in HCC tumorigenesis. Given the poor response to currently available HCC therapies, a better understanding of the role of GP73 in HCC may provide a new therapeutic target for HCC. The current paper summarizes the role of GP73 as a diagnostic marker as well as its roles in liver carcinogenesis. Its roles in other types of cancer are also discussed.
