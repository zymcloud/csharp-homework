Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have confirmed to participate in diverse biological functions in cancer. However, the expression patterns of circRNAs on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. In the present study, we clarified that hsa_circRNA_104348 was dramatically upregulated in HCC tissues and cells. Patients with HCC displaying high hsa_circRNA_104348 level possessed poor prognosis. Has_circ_104348 facilitated proliferation, migration, and invasion, meanwhile suppressed apoptosis of HCC cell. Furthermore, hsa_circRNA_104348 directly targeted miR-187-3p, could regulate miR-187-3p to affect proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of HCC cells, and may have effect on Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover, RTKN2 could be a direct target of miR-187-3p. In addition, knockdown of hsa_circRNA_104348 attenuated HCC tumorigenesis and lung metastasis in vivo. Taken together, these findings indicated that circular RNA hsa_circRNA_104348 might function as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to promotes HCC progression by targeting miR-187-3p/RTKN2 axis and activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
