Purpose:No consensus exists regarding the most appropriate staging system to predict overall survival (OS) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in surgical candidates. Thus, we aimed to determine the prognostic ability of eight different staging systems in a European cohort of patients undergoing liver resection for HCC.Methods:Patients resected for HCC between 2010 and 2019 at our institution were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. Likelihood ratio (LR) χ2 (homogeneity), linear trend (LT) χ2 (discriminatory ability), and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC, explanatory ability) were used to determine the staging system with the best overall prognostic performance.Results:Liver resection for HCC was performed in 160 patients. Median OS was 39 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 32-46 months) and median RFS was 26 months (95% CI: 16-34 months). All staging systems (BCLC, HKLC, Okuda, CLIP, ITA.LI.CA staging and score, MESH, and GRETCH) showed significant discriminatory ability regarding OS, with ITA.LI.CA score (LR χ2 30.08, LT χ2 13.90, AIC 455.27) and CLIP (LR χ2 28.65, LT χ2 18.95, AIC 460.07) being the best performing staging systems.Conclusions:ITA.LI.CA and CLIP are the most suitable staging system to predict OS in European HCC patients scheduled for curative-intent surgery.
