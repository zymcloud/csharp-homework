Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer. Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases that regulate many cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and metabolism. SIRT (silent information regulator)-1, 5, 6 and 7, members of the mammalian Sirtuin family of proteins (SIRT1-SIRT7), are involved in carcinogenesis, prognosis, metastasis, and chemical resistant of HCC. These proteins act through the deacetylation of tumor suppressor or oncogenic factors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small non-coding RNAs that down regulate gene expression by targeting the 3'-untranslated region of miRNAs. MiRNAs can function as tumor suppressors or as oncogenes and are involved in progression, differentiation, apoptosis and drug resistance of tumor cells. The focus of this review is to delineate the relationship between some microRNAs and their target, Sirtuins, and to present an overview of their function in HCC as currently understood.
