Two new polycyclic pyrroloquinazoline alkaloids with unprecedented skeleton, anisulcusines A (1) and B (2), along with four known compounds (3-6), were identified from the aerial parts of Anisotes trisulcus (Forssk.) Nees. To our knowledge, anisulcusines A and B are the first polycyclic pyrroloquinazoline alkaloids that possess a unique N-methyl-1,2-dihydro-1'H-spiro[benzo[d][1,3]oxazine moiety. The chemical structures of the new compounds were elucidated through extensive spectroscopic analyses and high-resolution mass spectroscopy. Anisulcusine B (2) exerted moderate cytotoxic effect on cultured human hepatoma (HuH7) cells, whereas compounds 1 and 3-5 exhibited mild cell proliferative or growth stimulatory activity. HIGHLIGHTS Two new polycyclic pyrroloquinazoline alkaloids from Anisotes trisulcus. Structures were elucidated on the basis of 1D- and 2D-NMR and HR-ESI-MS spectra. Compound (2) exerted moderate cytotoxic effect against human hepatoma (HuH7) cells. Compounds (1, 3-5) exhibited mild cell proliferative or growth stimulatory activity.
