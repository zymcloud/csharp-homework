Background:Some people living with hepatitis C virus (HCV) with sustained virological response (SVR) develop hepatic complications. Liver stiffness (LS) predicts clinical outcome in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with active HCV coinfection, but information after SVR is lacking. We aimed to analyze the predictive ability of LS at SVR for liver complications in people living with HIV/HCV with advanced fibrosis treated with direct-acting antivirals (DAA).Methods:In sum, 640 people living with HIV/HCV fulfilling the following criteria were included: (i) Achieved SVR with DAA-including regimen; (ii) LS â‰¥ 9.5 kPa before therapy; and (iii) LS measurement available at SVR. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a liver complication-hepatic decompensation or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-or requiring liver transplant after SVR.Results:During a median (Q1-Q3) follow-up of 31.6 (22.7-36.6) months, 19 (3%) patients reached the primary endpoint. In the multivariate analysis, variables (subhazard ratio [SHR] [95% confidence interval]) associated with developing clinical outcomes were: prior hepatic decompensations (3.42 [1.28-9.12]), pretreatment CPT class B or C (62.5 [3.08-1246.42]) and MELD scores (1.37 [1.03-1.82]), CPT class B or C at SVR (10.71 [1.32-87.01]), CD4 cell counts Conclusions:LS at the time of SVR after DAA therapy predicts the clinical outcome of people living with HIV/HCV with advanced fibrosis. These results suggest that LS measurement may be helpful to select candidates to be withdrawn from surveillance programs.
