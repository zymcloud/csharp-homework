Fibronectin, a matrix glycoprotein aberrantly expressed in various tumor cells, is a known candidate biomarker for the early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we investigated whether serum fibronectin levels could predict tumor recurrence in patients with early-stage HCC after curative treatment. A total of 83 patients who showed complete response after initial curative treatment were included. The levels of serum fibronectin at baseline and 4-6 weeks after initial treatment were analyzed with regard to their associations with recurrence. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to construct a prognostic nomogram. Baseline fibronectin levels were not significantly correlated with tumor size, number, stage, and serum Î±-fetoprotein levels. However, decrease in serum fibronectin levels after treatment was significantly associated with reduced HCC recurrence in multivariate logistic regression (odds ratio, 0.009; p
