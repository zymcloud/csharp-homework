Background/aim:The current literature conjectures that oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in younger patients is an entirely separate entity with a different risk profile. We aimed to uncover the potential risk factors of OSCC and evaluated the long-term outcome in such patients.Patients and methods:This hospital-based case-control study included 40 patients with OSCC and 40 controls under the age of 46 years. Survival was analyzed via Kaplan-Meier estimates, including a follow-up of up to 24.3 years.Results:The patients with OSCC were prone to smoking and drinking heavily and even suffered secondary organ damage to the lungs and the liver at this young age. Early diagnosed as well as surgically treated patients had superior 5-year recurrence-free and overall survival.Conclusion:Young patients with OSCC were found to have a traditional risk profile. Secondary organ damage to the liver and the lungs might be considered as a risk indicator. The meticulous screening of every age group with this risk profile is key to early diagnosis and acceptable treatment results.
