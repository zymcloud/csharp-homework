Background:Papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) represents the second most common histologic subtype of renal cell carcinoma and comprises 2 subtypes. Prognosis for type 2 is associated with poor clinical outcome. Current guidelines are based on phase II trials, phase III trials in patients with clear cell histology, or retrospective data.Case description:To our knowledge, we describe for the first time a case of a patient with heavily pretreated metastatic pRCC who benefited from the combination of lenvatinib plus everolimus for more than 2 years.Conclusion:According to immunohistologic and biological findings in our patient both on primary tumor and liver metastasis, we hypothesize that selected patients with metastatic pRCC, progressed to standard/available treatments (including angiogenic drugs, mTOR inhibitors, and immunotherapy) and dissociated response to everolimus, could benefit from adding lenvatinib to everolimus.
