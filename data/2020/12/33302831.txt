Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the primary liver cancer that has shown a high incidence and mortality rate worldwide among several types of cancers. A large variety of chemotherapeutic agents employed for the treatment has a limited success rate owing to their limited site-specific drug targeting ability. Thus, there is a demand to develop novel approaches for the treatment of HCC. With advancements in nanotechnology-based drug delivery approaches, the chal-lenges of conventional chemotherapy have been continuously decreasing. Nanomedicines constituted of lipidic and poly-meric composites provide a better platform for delivering and open new pathways for HCC treatment. A score of nanocar-riers such as surface-engineered liposomes, nanoparticles, nanotubes, micelles, quantum dots, etc. has been investigated in the treatment of HCC. These nanocarriers are considered to be highly effective clinically for delivering chemotherapeutic drugs with high site-specificity ability and therapeutic efficiency. The present review highlights the current focus on the application of nanocarrier systems using various ligand-based receptor-specific targeting strategies for the treatment and management of HCC. Moreover, the article has also included information on the current clinically approved drug therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment and updates of regulatory requirements for approval of such nanomedicines.
