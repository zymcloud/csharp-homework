Objective:Tumor location is a critical factor for determining technical success and local recurrence following percutaneous ablation of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the safety and outcome measures of percutaneous microwave ablation (pMWA) for HCCs Methods:Retrospective review included 81 patients who underwent pMWA for HCCs Results:Mean follow-up period was 3.4 months (range 1-7). There was no major complication in both the groups; two patients had a mild perihepatic hemorrhage in the difficult location group which was managed conservatively. There was no difference between the groups in the overall technical efficacy rate (84.9% vs 91.7%, p = 0.294), LTP rate (4.4% vs 2.2%. p = 0.57) or complication rate (4.6% vs 0%, p = 0.177).Conclusion:Our data suggest that there is no significant difference in technical efficacy, LTP or complication rates for MWA in both difficult and normal locations.Advances in knowledge:With proper patient selection, pre-procedural planning and appropriate technique, pMWA is feasible, safe, and effective for small HCCs in difficult location with an acceptable range of complications.
