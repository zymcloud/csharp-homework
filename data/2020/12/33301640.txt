Circulating tumor cell (CTC) analysis holds great potential to be a non-invasive solution for clinical cancer management. A complete workflow that combined CTC detection and single-cell molecular analysis is required. We developed the ChimeraX速 -i120 platform to facilitate negative enrichment, immunofluorescent labeling, and machine learning-based identification of CTCs. Analytical performances were evaluated and a total of 477 participants were enrolled to validate the clinical feasibility of ChimeraX速 -i120 CTC detection. We analyzed copy number alteration profiles of isolated single cells. The ChimeraX速 -i120 platform had high sensitivity, accuracy, and reproducibility for CTC detection. In clinical samples, an average value of > 60% CTC-positive rate was found for five cancer types (i.e., liver, biliary duct, breast, colorectal, and lung), while CTCs were rarely identified in blood from healthy donors. In hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with curative resection, CTC status was significantly associated with tumor characteristics, prognosis, and treatment response (all P<0.05). Single-cell sequencing analysis revealed that heterogeneous genomic alteration patterns resided in different cells, patients, and cancers. Our results suggest that the use of this ChimeraX速 -i120 platform and the integrated workflow has validity as a tool for CTC detection and downstream genomic profiling in the clinical setting.
