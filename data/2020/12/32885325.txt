Oxidative stress (OS) and insulin resistance (IR) induced by hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, are involved in the development of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) complications and progression to hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of pegylated interferon alpha (IFNα) + ribavirin (PegIFNα+RVB) or sofosbuvir + NS5A inhibitor (SOF+InNS5A) on IR and the components of OS. HCV was genotyped in 20 CHC patients grouped by treatment with either PegIFNα+RVB (n = 10) or SOF+InNS5A (n = 10). The treatment's effect on OS-induced damage to lipids (HNE-HDL), proteins (advanced glycation end products [AGEs]), and DNA (8-OHdG) as well as the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-2, TNFα, IFNγ), ALT, AST, GSH and platelets was determined. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity as well as IR, determined by the HOMA1-IR index, was evaluated. The HCV genotypes (GT) found were GT1b (45%), GT1a (30%), GT2b (20%), and GT2a (5%). Viral RNA became undetectable by week 12 with SOF+InNS5A in 100% of the cases and with PegIFNα+RVB in 70% of the cases. After viral RNA became undetectable, regardless of treatment and GT, a significant increase in the platelet concentration and SOD activity was observed, whereas ALT, insulin, and IR decreased (p
