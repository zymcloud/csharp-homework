Vincristine sulfate (VCR), a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent, kills cancer cells as well as the normal cells for its cytotoxicity. But it is still unclear whether it can exert therapeutic effect on untreated cancer cells by changing the supernatant of cancer cells. Here, we explored the subsequent cascade effects of the supernatant of cancer cells that were transiently treated with VCR on untreated tumor cells and its responsible mechanisms. VCR and three different hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines were used for an experiment. The experiment was conducted in vitro to eliminate the body's internal factors and the effects of the immune system. The results suggested that drug-free tumor supernatant (TSN) could promote the differentiation, repress the transcription of liver cancer stem cell's markers and the proliferation in SMMC-7721, Bel-7402 and Huh7 cells. Furthermore, we found that the TSN could abolish YAP1 transcriptional activity to inhibit the proliferation and increase the transcriptional activity of HNF4Î± to promote the differentiation in SMMC-7721 and Bel-7402 cells. In conclusion, the TSN could inhibit the proliferation and induce differentiation in different HCC cells.
