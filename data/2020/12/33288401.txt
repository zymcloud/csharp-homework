Background/purpose:Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is increasingly being used instead of surgical resection for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor measuring ≦2 cm. However, the long-term outcomes of RFA, especially in comparison to surgical resection, are still debated. We compared the outcomes of surgical resection and RFA in patients with a solitary HCC tumor measuring ≦2 cm from a 10-year cohort study.Methods:From Jan 2006 to Dec 2016, 156 patients with a resectable HCC measuring ≦2 cm who underwent surgical resection (n = 83) or RFA (n = 73) at the Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation were enrolled. Patient characteristics, overall survival (OS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were retrospectively examined, and comparisons were made between the two groups and through subgroup analyses.Results:The 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 7-year OS outcomes were comparable between the surgical resection group and the RFA group (P = 0.193), but the surgical resection group had significantly higher 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, 7-year, and 10-year RFS than the RFA group (P = 0.018). Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with lower age, Child-Turcotte-Pugh score, or albumin-bilirubin score before treatment had better OS, and patients with an HCV infection or receiving RFA treatment had higher HCC recurrence rates.Conclusion:The liver reserve determined the long-term OS of patients with an HCC tumor ≦ 2 cm, and surgical resection offered better RFS than RFA (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04525833.).
