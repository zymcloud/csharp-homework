Fumonisin B1 (FB1), a Fusarium-produced mycotoxin, is found in various foods and feeds. It is a well-known liver carcinogen in experimental animals; however, its role in genotoxicity is controversial. The current study investigated FB1-triggered changes in the epigenetic regulation of PTEN and determined its effect on DNA damage checkpoint regulation in human liver hepatoma G2 (HepG2) cells. Following treatment with FB1 (IC50: 200 ÂµM; 24 h), the expression of miR-30c, KDM5B, PTEN, H3K4me3, PI3K, AKT, p-ser473-AKT, CHK1, and p-ser280-CHK1 was measured using qPCR and/or Western blot. H3K4me3 enrichment at the PTEN promoter region was assayed via a ChIP assay and DNA damage was determined using an ELISA. FB1 induced oxidative DNA damage. Total KDM5B expression was reduced, which subsequently increased the total H3K4me3 and the enrichment of H3K4me3 at PTEN promoters. Increased H3K4me3 induced an increase in PTEN transcript levels. However, miR-30c inhibited PTEN translation. Thus, PI3K/AKT signaling was activated, inhibiting CHK1 activity via phosphorylation of its serine 280 residue preventing the repair of damaged DNA. In conclusion, FB1 epigenetically modulates the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling cascade, preventing DNA damage checkpoint regulation, and induces significant DNA damage.
