Objective:Immune checkpoint inhibitors are approved to treat multiple cancers. We report life-threatening hepatic failure in 2 consecutive patients with Cushing syndrome that were treated with ketoconazole (KTZ) in combination with 2 different programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors, Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab.Methods:The first patient suffered from corticotroph pituitary carcinoma and the second from metastatic adrenal cortical carcinoma. They were both treated with KTZ for tumor-associated hypercortisolism.Results:Hepatic function was normal on KTZ prior to initiation of PD-1 inhibitors, after which they rapidly developed severe hepatic dysfunction. In both cases, liver biopsy was consistent with drug-induced hepatic injury. Liver function fully recovered on discontinuing KTZ and the PD-1 inhibitors along with methylprednisone therapy.Conclusion:Antifungal azole therapy is commonly used in oncology patients who may be co-treated with PD-1 inhibitors. Although the specific combination of KTZ and PD-1 inhibitors to treat Cushing syndrome may be relatively uncommon, we recommend careful monitoring of hepatic function using a combination PD-1 inhibitors and azole antifungal agents, especially KTZ, due to the potential of life-threatening hepatic failure.
