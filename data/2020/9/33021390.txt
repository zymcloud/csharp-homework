Aim: To develop robust and accurate prognostic biomarkers to help clinicians optimize therapeutic strategies. Materials & methods: Differentially prognosis-related autophagy genes were identified by bioinformatics analysis method. Results: Seven prognosis-related autophagy genes were more significantly related to the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that these genes were mainly enriched in the autophagy pathway. BIRC5, HSPB8 and TMEM74 exhibited significant prognostic value for HCC. Besides, the risk score and BIRC5 have significant significance with clinicopathological significance of HCC. Conclusion: The research has identified a number of prognosis-related autophagy genes that associated with the survival and clinical stage of HCC. In addition, the prognostic model can be used to calculate the patient's risk score and these prognosis-related autophagy genes might serve as therapeutic targets.
