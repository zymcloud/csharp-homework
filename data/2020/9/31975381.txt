Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still one of the major malignant tumours with poor prognosis. The chromosome 19 microRNA cluster (C19MC) is the largest miRNA cluster, and its functions and regulatory mechanisms remain unclear in HCC. We extracted data from 373 HCC samples and 50 non-tumour samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. The differential expression levels and methylation levels of C19MC as well as the correlation between them were analysed. We evaluated the correlation between the expression levels of C19MC and the clinical features. We further performed prognostic analysis for C19MC and analysed the bioinformatic function. C19MC had upregulated expression levels and promoter hypomethylation in HCC. A significant negative correlation between the high expression and low methylation level of C19MC was obtained. In addition, the positive correlation between the expression levels of C19MC and the tumour grade, tumour stage and T-stage is shown. Three miRNAs (mir-512-1, mir-516a-1, mir-519a-2) were negatively associated with overall survival on the basis of the Kaplan-Meier analysis and the 3-miRNA signature was significant for the prognostic assessment of HCC. A bioinformatic enrichment analysis suggested that the target genes of the 3 miRNAs may be associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways related to cancer invasion. In summary, our novel study demonstrated that the hypomethylation of promoters upregulates the expression levels of C19MC and that C19MC may represent a potential new candidate for the diagnosis and therapy of HCC.
