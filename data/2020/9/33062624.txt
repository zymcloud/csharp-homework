The management of localized hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is complex and requires multidisciplinary consideration. In times of crisis when resources are limited and the health of patients might be compromised, as is the case with COVID-19, a strategic approach that takes into account tumor characteristics, patient factors, and available treatment options can optimize patient outcomes while balancing resource utilization. Herein, we detail our group's management strategy for patients with localized HCC during the global pandemic that carefully considers individual patient needs and those of the institutional workforce, the local healthcare system, and the greater patient community we serve.
