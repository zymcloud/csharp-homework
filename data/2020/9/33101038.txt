Despite advances in interventional procedures and chemotherapeutic drug development, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide with a Â® microbubbles which are clinically approved as an ultrasound contrast agent were used for both imaging and cavitation treatment. A genetically engineered mouse model was bred and used as a physiologically relevant preclinical analog to human HCC. It was observed that image-guided and targeted microbubble cavitation resulted in selective disruption of the tumor blood flow and enhanced doxorubicin uptake and penetration. Histology results indicate that no gross morphological damage occurred as a result of this process. The combination of these effects may be exploited to treat HCC and other challenging malignancies and could be implemented with currently available ultrasound scanners and reagents.
