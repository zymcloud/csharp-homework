Thymoma is the most common tumor of the anterior mediastinum. Routine imaging methods such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging often lead to misdiagnosis between thymoma and other thymic abnormalities. Therefore, urgently needed is to develop a new diagnostic strategy. Here we identify interleukin-8 (IL-8) as a biomarker for auxiliary diagnosis of thymoma. We find that IL-8 levels in naïve T cells are markedly elevated in patients with thymoma compared to those with other thymic tumors. IL-8 levels in naive T cells are significantly decreased after surgical resection in thymoma patients, and rise again when thymoma recurs. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis shows that IL-8 evaluation performs well in thymoma identification, with high specificities and sensitivities. We also observe significant clinical relevance between IL-8 levels in naïve T cells and clinicopathological features. In conclusion, our study suggests that IL-8 is a biomarker for thymoma identification and recurrence surveillance.
