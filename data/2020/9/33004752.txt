Context:Microwave ablation (MWA) has been proven as a promising method to treat solid tumors.Aims:This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ultrasound (US)-guided MWA for treating adrenal metastasis and to explore the factors affecting survival.Settings and design:This was a retrospective study performed on patients treated at our department.Subjects and methods:A total of 43 patients with adrenal metastasis (22 hepatocellular carcinoma, eight renal cell carcinoma, five non-small cell lung cancer, four colorectal cancer, three liposarcoma, and one malignant fibrous histiocytoma) were enrolled. All patients were treated at our department at least once. The treatment protocol for each patient, the technique used, and the survival details were recorded.Statistical analysis used:Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 26.0 software.Results:Technical success was achieved in all cases. MWA was a safe technique for treating all types of metastasis. No major complications were observed. The pathology of adrenal lesions was the significant risk factor contributing to overall survival (OS) (P = 0.040). The 1-year and 3-year OS rates for all patients were 0.828 and 0.389, respectively.Conclusions:Percutaneous US-guided MWA is safe and effective in terms of local control and survival of adrenal metastasis.
