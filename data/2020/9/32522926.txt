Methotrexate-related lymphoproliferative disorder (MTX-LPD) is known to be a side effect of MTX, but its involvement in the liver has been rarely reported. We herein report a 70-year-old woman with autoimmune hepatitis and rheumatoid arthritis who developed multiple liver tumors. We initially considered that she had developed rapid-growing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the cirrhotic liver based on imaging tests. A tumor biopsy and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization were thus performed. The tumors were then diagnosed as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma pathologically and considered to be MTX-LPD. This case indicates that MTX-LPD should be considered even in cirrhotic patients with liver tumors resembling HCC.
