Chronic Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection poses a significant global health burden. Although, effective treatment and vaccinations against HBV are available, challenges still exist, particularly in the development of curative therapies. The dynamic nature and unique features of HBV such as viral variants, integration of HBV DNA into host chromosomes, and extrahepatic reservoirs are considerations towards understanding the virus biology and developing improved anti-HBV treatments. In this review, we highlight the importance of these viral characteristics in the context of treatment and oncogenesis. Viral genotype and genetic variants can serve as important predictive factors for therapeutic response and outcomes in addition to oncogenic risk. HBV integration, particularly in coding genes, is implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, we will discuss emerging research that has identified various HBV nucleic acids and infection markers within extrahepatic sites (lymphoid cells). Intriguingly, the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-associated HBV variants and viral integration within the lymphoid cells may contribute towards the development of extrahepatic malignancies. Improved understanding of these HBV characteristics will enhance the development of a cure for chronic HBV infection.
