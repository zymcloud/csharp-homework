Objectives:To compare diagnostic performances of current guidelines for the diagnosis of HCC in LT candidates using gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI (Gd-EOB-MRI).Methods:Eighty-one patients (119 HCCs and 35 non-HCCs) who underwent preoperative Gd-EOB-MRI and subsequent LT were included. Per-lesion imaging diagnoses of HCCs were made using four different guidelines (American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD), European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL), and Korean Liver Cancer Association-National Cancer Center (KLCA-NCC) guidelines, and patient allocation was determined according to Milan criteria (MC). Comparisons of per-lesion sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of patient allocation between guidelines were performed using logistic regression with generalized estimating equations.Results:For diagnosis of HCC, AASLD guideline showed highest specificity (97.4%), followed by EASL and KLCA-NCC guidelines (92.1% and 92.1%, p > 0.99 and = 0.15, respectively, in comparison to AASLD), while the specificity of APASL guideline was significantly lower than that of AASLD guideline (78.9% vs. 97.4%, p = 0.006). APASL and KLCA-NCC guidelines (75.9% and 65.6%) showed significantly higher sensitivities than AASLD/EASL guidelines (34.5% and 38.8%, respectively; all ps Conclusion:For the diagnosis of HCCs using Gd-EOB-MRI, AASLD guideline provided the highest specificity, followed by EASL, KLCA-NCC, and APASL guidelines with statistically significant difference with only APASL guideline. KLCA-NCC guideline provided the most accurate selection of unsuitable LT candidates.Key points:• AASLD/LI-RADS showed the highest specificity, followed by EASL and KLCA-NCC guidelines. • APASL and KLCA-NCC guidelines allowed more sensitive diagnoses of HCCs. • KLCA-NCC more accurately classified patients not appropriate transplantation candidates than EASL.
