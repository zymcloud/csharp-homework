Background and aim:Since the advent of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, the total eradication of hepatitis C virus has been achievable with the recovery of hepatic reserve after achievement of sustained virologic response (SVR). Hence, here, we examined the factors affecting the recovery of hepatic reserve.Methods:We followed up 403 patients (male: 164, female: 239; genotype 1: 299, genotype 2: 104; median age: 69 years) for at least 3 years after they achieved SVR to DAA therapy. Of these patients, 75 (18.6%) had a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Biochemical tests were periodically performed, and the hepatic reserve was evaluated based on the albumin-bilirubin grade. We examined background factors such as age, biochemical test results, HCC occurrence and portosystemic shunt by computed tomography.Results:At the start of treatment, the albumin-bilirubin grades were grades 1, 2, and 3 in 241, 157, and 5 patients, respectively, and 3 years later, 117 of 162 (72%) patients with grade 2 or 3 improved to grade 1. Multivariate analysis identified the HCC occurrence after achievement of SVR (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.08, P Conclusion:Our results demonstrate that hepatic reserve could be improved even in elderly patients over a long course of time.
