Objective: To investigate the clinical value of glypican-3 (GPC3) detection in the diagnosis and therapy-monitoring of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: From March 2018 to May 2019, the patients with HCC were enrolled as the experimental group(n=166)from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Centre, while the specimens from health control group(n=94) and benign control group (n=50) were analyzed. The serum of GPC3 and alpha fetoprotein (AFP)levels were respectively detected by ELISA and chemiluminescence. GPC3 detections combined with AFP etc. in accuracy of HCC diagnosis were explored by using Logistic regression analysis. Results: The serum GPC3 level in patients with HCC ［0.210 (0.048, 0.801)mg/L］ ［Median (quartile Q1, Q3)］ was significantly higher than those in healthy controls ［0.029(0.019, 0.052)mg/L］ and benign controls ［0.033(0.021, 0.043) mg/L］ (Z=-7.69, P<0.001).The serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and AFP were significantly different among the three groups (Z=-7.02, -6.85, -8.36 respectively, P<0.001). Among the serological indicators, it was related to ALT and AST (Z=-3.77, -4.09 respectively, P<0.001).The Cut-off level of GPC3 was determined as 0.077 mg/L by ROC curve. The sensitivity of the combined detection of serum GPC3 with AFP for HCC was up to 87.82%, the specificity was 77.86%, the negative predictive value was 84.29%, and the positive predictive value was 82.53%.The HCC-GPC3 model was constructed by using Logistic regression analysis. The area under the ROC curve was 0.882, the total sensitivity was 91.10%, and the total specificity was 72.73%. Further analysis showed that the serum GPC3 of patients with HCC was significantly lower ［0.454(0.019, 0.286) mg/L］ than that before surgery［0.608(0.039, 0.554）mg/L］(Z=-7.32, P<0.001). Conclusion: The detection of serum GPC3 can be applied to aid diagnosis and therapy-monitoring of HCC.The combination of GPC3 and AFP can improve the diagnostic efficiency of HCC.
