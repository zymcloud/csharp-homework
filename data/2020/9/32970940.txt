Scope:Obesity increases intracellular lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, which can induce non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). With progression of NAFLD, a sizable fraction of patients develop non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), eventually leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The mechanism involved in obesity-induced NAFLD remains unclear. Free fatty acids and high-fat diets, which induce hepatocyte senescence, are major risk factors for NAFLD. Therefore in this study, the mechanism of lipotoxicity-induced hepatocyte senescence is investigated.Methods and results:The mice are fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and BNL CL.2 cells are treated with palmitate acid (PA) to establish in vivo and in vitro models of lipotoxicity, respectively. SA-Î²-gal staining is used to analyze the positively stained senescent hepatocytes. The results show that both PA and HFD induce cellular senescence. Real-time-PCR quantitative analysis reveals that miR-34a is significantly upregulated in the liver tissues of the HFD mice and in the PA-treated BNL CL.2 cells. Western blotting analysis shows that cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (CDKN1, also known as p21) is upregulated, while cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) is downregulated. Further investigation of the mechanism reveals that CDK6 is a target of miR-34a, which binds to the 3' UTR of CDK6 and inhibits its expression.Conclusion:The findings reveal that miR-34a is upregulated in a high-fat environment in the liver, and induces hepatocyte senescence by targeting CDK6. The miR-34a-CDK6 signaling axis may promote NAFLD development in a high-fat environment and therefore represents a potential target for NAFLD therapy.
