Purpose:The objective of this study was to determine whether pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) could predict survival outcomes and liver toxicity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR).Methods and materials:In this retrospective study we collected pretreatment NLR of HCC patients treated with SABR between December 2007 and August 2018 and determined its association with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and radiation-related liver toxicity defined as an increase in the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score by ≥2 within 3 months after SABR in the absence of disease progression.Results:A total of 153 patients with a median follow-up of 13.3 months were included. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found that an NLR ≥2.4 was optimum (area under the curve, 0.762; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.682-0.841, P Conclusions:NLR is an objective and ubiquitous inflammatory marker that can predict OS and liver toxicity in HCC patients undergoing SABR. NLR could be a useful biomarker for patient risk stratification and therapeutic decision-making.
