Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are considered for use in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) refractory to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). The aim of the present retrospective study was to identify factors associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and to evaluate the indications for lenvatinib treatment in patients with intermediate-stage HCC refractory to TACE using a data-mining analysis. A total of 171 patients with intermediate-stage HCC refractory to TACE were included. All patients were classified into three groups according to their HCC treatment: Lenvatinib (n=45), sorafenib (n=53) and TACE (n=73) groups. PFS time was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed using a log-rank test. Factors associated with PFS time were evaluated using multivariate and decision-tree analyses. The median PFS time was 5.8, 3.2 and 2.4 months in the lenvatinib, sorafenib and TACE groups, respectively (P
