Long-term overall survival (OS) after liver resection for non-cirrhotic hepatocellular carcinoma (NCHCC) has been reported recently. The aim of this study was to review outcomes systematically and analyze risk factors for survival after surgical resection for HCC without cirrhosis. A literature search was performed of the PubMed and Embase databases for papers published between January 1995 and October 2012, which focused on hepatic resection for HCC without underlying cirrhosis. Cochrane systematic review methodology was used for this review. Outcomes were OS, operative mortality and disease-free survival (DFS). Pooled hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using the random effects model for parameters considered as potential prognostic factors. Totally, 26 retrospective case series were eligible for inclusion. The 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rate after surgical resection of NCHCC ranged from 62% to 100%, 46.3%-78.0%, and 30%-64%, respectively. The corresponding DFS rates ranged from 48.7% to 84%, 31.0%-66.0%, and 24.0%-58.0%, respectively. Five variables were related to poor survival: multiple tumors (HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.25-2.11); larger tumor size (HR 2.66, 95%CI 1.69-3.63); non-clear resection margin (R0 resection) (HR 3.52, 95%CI 1.63-5.42); poor tumor stage (HR 2.61, 95%CI 1.64-3.58); and invasion of the lymphatic vessels (HR 4.85, 95%CI 2.67-7.02). In sum, hepatic resection provides excellent OS rates for patients with NCHCC, and results have tended to improve recently. Risk factors for poor prognosis comprise multiple tumors, lager tumor size, non-R0 resection and invasion of the lymphatic vessels.
