Background:We previously reported that perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion (PABT) did not affect long-term survival after radical resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to investigate the effects of PABT on the prognosis of HCC patients with different stage tumors.Methods:Patients with primary HCC who underwent curative liver resection between 2003 and 2012 were retrospectively enrolled and divided into the early-stage (stage I) and non-early-stage (stages II, III and IV) groups. The impacts of PABT on the long-term prognosis of patients in different groups after resection were investigated using propensity score matching (PSM) and multivariable Cox regression analyses.Results:We enrolled 426 HCC patients, including 53 matched pairs of patients with early-stage tumors and 51 matched pairs of patients with non-early-stage tumors. Survival analyses of the patients with early-stage tumors showed that the recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates of the transfusion group were significantly worse than those of the nontransfusion group both before and after PSM. Multivariable Cox analyses identified that PABT was an independent predictor of RFS and OS of the patients with early-stage tumors. However, survival analyses of the propensity-matched patients with non-early-stage tumors showed no significant differences in RFS and OS rates between the transfusion and nontransfusion groups (p = 0.296; p = 0.472).Conclusions:This study demonstrates that PABT has negative impacts on the long-term prognosis of patients with early-stage tumors after radical resection of HCC but has no impact on the long-term prognosis of patients with non-early-stage tumors.
