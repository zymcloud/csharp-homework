Several studies reported a central role of the endothelin type A receptor (ETAR) in tumor progression leading to the formation of metastasis. Here, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor effects of the FDA-approved ETAR antagonist, Ambrisentan, which is currently used to treat patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. In vitro, Ambrisentan inhibited both spontaneous and induced migration/invasion capacity of different tumor cells (COLO-357 metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, OvCar3 ovarian carcinoma, MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma, and HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia). Whole transcriptome analysis using RNAseq indicated Ambrisentan's inhibitory effects on the whole transcriptome of resting and PAR2-activated COLO-357 cells, which tended to normalize to an unstimulated profile. Finally, in a pre-clinical murine model of metastatic breast cancer, treatment with Ambrisentan was effective in decreasing metastasis into the lungs and liver. Importantly, this was associated with a significant enhancement in animal survival. Taken together, our work suggests a new therapeutic application for Ambrisentan in the treatment of cancer metastasis.
