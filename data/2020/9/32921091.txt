Background:This study aimed to identify the incidence, risk factors, and survival outcome associated with brain metastases (BM) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients using a large-scale population-based cancer registry database.Methods:Between 2010 and 2016, patients with BM from HCC were included using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. The risk and prognostic factors for BM were recognized by multivariate logistic and Cox regression model analysis. The overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of HCC patients with BM were assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank tests.Results:A total of 141 (0.33%) HCC patients detected with BM were included for analysis. Younger age, tumor pathological undifferentiation, no surgery, radiation therapy, no chemotherapy, synchronous bone, or lung metastases were positively associated with BM in the HCC cohort. The median OS and CSS of the BM patients were 3 months, while the corresponding survival time in HCC patients without BM was 13 and 23 months. Black race, tumor pathological undifferentiation, absence of chemotherapy, and concomitant lung metastases were independently associated with the worse survival.Conclusions:Although the overall prognosis of patients with BM from HCC was extremely poor, a list of homogeneous and heterogeneous risk factors were found to be significantly associated with the occurrence and prognosis of BM in HCC patients. These relevant factors may provide more valuable references for individualized treatment in clinical practice.
