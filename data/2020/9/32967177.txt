Minocycline is a tetracycline compound with pleiotropic pharmacological properties. In addition to its antibacterial action, it shows many non-antimicrobial effects, including an anti-cancer activity. The anti-cancer action was confirmed in studies on ovarian carcinoma cells, hepatocellular carcinoma cells, glioma cells, or acute myeloid leukemia cells. Malignant melanoma remains a serious medical problem despite the extensive knowledge of the disease. The low effectiveness of the standard treatment, as well as the resistance to therapy, result in high mortality rates. This work aimed to investigate the potential and mechanisms of anti-melanoma action of minocycline. Human skin melanotic melanoma cell line COLO 829 was used in the study. The obtained results showed that minocycline decreased cell viability and inhibited the growth of melanoma cells, proportional to the drug concentration as well as to the time of incubation. The EC50 values were calculated to be 78.6 µM, 31.7 µM, and 13.9 µM for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, respectively. It was observed that treated cells had a disturbed cell cycle and significantly changed morphology. Moreover, minocycline caused a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in cells with a low level of reduced thiols. Finally, it was found that the anti-melanoma effect of minocycline was related to the induction of apoptosis. The drug activated caspases 8, 9, and 3/7 as well as increased the number of annexin V-positive cells. The presented results show that minocycline possesses anti-melanoma potential.
