Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and one of the main causes of cancer-related deaths. HCC is mainly promoted by chronic viral hepatitis B and C, alcohol, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) induced by obesity, as well as several genetic diseases of the liver. Due to the intricacy and heterogeneity of risk factors, microenvironment and genetic alterations associated with HCC, the dissection of molecular players and cellular processes underlying tumor development is still challenging.
