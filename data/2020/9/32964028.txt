Background:The microliposome maintenance (MCM) complex, MCM2-7, is revealed to be involved in multiple cellular processes and plays a key role in the development and progression of human cancers. However, the MCM complex remains poorly elaborated in hepatic carcinoma (HCC).Methods:In the study, we found the mRNA and protein level by bioinformatics. We also explored the prognostic value, genetic alteration, interaction network, and functional enrichment of MCM2-7. The MCM expression and correlation among these MCMs in HCC cell lines were identified by western blot.Results:MCM2-7 was significantly increased in HCC tissues compared to normal liver tissues. The high level of MCM2-7 had a positive correlation with poor prognosis. However, MCM2-7 alterations were not correlated with poor OS. MCMs were both increased in HCC cell lines compared to the normal hepatocyte cell line. Furthermore, the positive correlation was found among MCMs in HCC cell lines.Conclusions:The MCM complex was increased in HCC tissues and cell lines and negatively correlated with prognosis, which might be important biomarkers for HCC.
