Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) plays an important role in the management of patients treated with ablation therapies, in the diagnostic, therapeutic and monitoring phases. Compared to contrast-enhanced computed tomography and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, CEUS presents several advantages in imaging HCC, including real time imaging capability, high sensitivity for tumor vascularity, absence of renal toxicity, no ionizing radiation, repeatability of injections, good compliance by the patient and low cost. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the role of CEUS in the management of the patients with HCC treated with ablation therapies and describe how in our protocol CEUS is integrated with the other imaging modalities such as contrast-enhanced computed tomography and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.
