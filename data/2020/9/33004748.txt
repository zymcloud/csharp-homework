Context:Macroscopic vascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains challenging to treat.Aims:The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)-apatinib therapy with TACE treatment alone in HCC patients with macrovascular invasion, using propensity score matching (PSM).Settings and design:Matched paired comparison between the TACE-apatinib and TACE alone group using 1:2 PSM was utilized.Subjects and methods:Between 2013 and 2019, 378 patients receiving TACE-apatinib or TACE alone were included based on specific selection criteria.Statistical analysis used:Multivariate Cox regression models were used to determine the independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS).Results:Of the patients included, 40 (12.5%) received TACE-apatinib treatment and 280 (87.5%) received TACE alone. Tumor sizes of patients in the TACE-apatinib group were more frequently classified as small (Conclusions:TACE combined with apatinib may result in superior OS compared to TACE therapy alone for HCC patients with macrovascular invasion.
