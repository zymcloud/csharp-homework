Introduction:To evaluate impact of urbanicity and household income on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence among US adults.Methods:HCC incidence was evaluated by rural-urban geography and median annual household income using 2004-2017 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data.Results:Although overall HCC incidence was highest in large metropolitan regions, average annual percent change in HCC incidence was greatest among more rural regions. Individuals in lower income categories had highest HCC incidence and greatest average annual percent change in HCC incidence.Discussion:Disparities in HCC incidence by urbanicity and income likely reflect differences in risk factors, health-related behaviors, and barriers in access to healthcare services.
