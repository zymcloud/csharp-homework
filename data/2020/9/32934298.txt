Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks fourth in cancer-related mortality worldwide. N1-methyladenosine (m1A), a methylation modification on RNA, is gaining attention for its role across diverse biological processes. However, m1A-related regulatory genes expression, its relationship with clinical prognosis, and its role in HCC remain unclear. In this study, we utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas-Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC) database to investigate alterations within 10 m1A-related regulatory genes and observed a high mutation frequency (23/363). Cox regression analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were used to explore the association between m1A-related regulatory genes expression and HCC patient survival and identified four regulators that were remarkably associated with HCC patient prognosis. Additionally, an independent cohort from International Cancer Genome Consortium was studied to validate our discoveries and found to be consistent with those in the TCGA dataset. In terms of mechanism, gene set enrichment analysis linked these four genes with various physiological roles in cell division, the MYC pathway, protein metabolism, and mitosis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis revealed that PI3K/Akt signaling pathway had potential relevance to m1A-related regulatory genes in HCC. These findings indicate that m1A-related regulatory genes may play crucial roles in regulating HCC progression and be exploited for diagnostic and prognostic purposes.
