Purpose:To evaluate whether a three-phase dynamic contrast-enhanced CT protocol, when combined with a deep learning model, has similar accuracy in differentiating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from other focal liver lesions (FLLs) compared with a four-phase protocol.Methods:Three hundred and forty-two patients (mean age 49.1 Â± 10.5 years, range 19-86 years, 65.8% male) scanned with a four-phase CT protocol (precontrast, arterial, portal-venous and delayed phases) were retrospectively enrolled. A total of 449 FLLs were categorized into HCC and non-HCC groups based on the best available reference standard. Three convolutional dense networks (CDNs) with the input of four-phase CT images (model A), three-phase images without portal-venous phase (model B) and three-phase images without precontrast phase (model C) were trained on 80% of lesions and evaluated in the other 20% by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and confusion matrix analysis. The DeLong test was performed to compare the areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) of A with B, B with C, and A with C.Results:The diagnostic accuracy in differentiating HCC from other FLLs on test sets was 83.3% for model A, 81.1% for model B and 85.6% for model C, and the AUCs were 0.925, 0.862 and 0.920, respectively. The AUCs of models A and C did not differ significantly (p = 0.765), but the AUCs of models A and B (p = 0.038) and of models B and C (p = 0.028) did.Conclusions:When combined with a CDN, a three-phase CT protocol without precontrast showed similar diagnostic accuracy as a four-phase protocol in differentiating HCC from other FLLs, suggesting that the multiphase CT protocol for HCC diagnosis might be optimized by removing the precontrast phase to reduce radiation dose.
