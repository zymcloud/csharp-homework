Background:To compare the efficacy of three types of palliative therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), including transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) monotherapy, sorafenib alone and their combination.Methods:The databases of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were retrieved. The odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to investigate the binary variables, and the standardised mean difference (SMD) with its 95% CI was employed to evaluate the continuous variables. All statistical tests were performed by using Stata/SE, version 12.0.Results:Thirty-one clinical studies, containing 5125 unique cases of patients with advanced HCC, were included. There were significant improvements in overall survival (OS) (pooled SMD = 2.54; 95% CI 1.74-3.34) and time to progression (TTP) (pooled SMD = 2.49; 95% CI 0.87-4.12) of the patients after receiving the combination therapy of TACE and sorafenib, compared to TACE monotherapy, and the OS in the combined treatment cohort was also longer than that in the sorafenib-alone cohort (pooled SMD = 2.92; 95% CI 1.72-4.13). The combination therapy group in comparison to the TACE group benefited a significantly increased overall response rate (ORR) (pooled OR = 2.61; 95% CI 1.43-4.77), 1-year (pooled OR = 2.96; 95% CI 1.71-5.14) and 2-year (pooled OR = 1.64; 95% CI 1.18-2.28) survival rates and reduced disease progression rate (DPR) (pooled OR = 0.47; 95% CI 0.33-0.68); in parallel, the ORR in the group was also significantly higher than that in the sorafenib-alone group (pooled OR = 3.62; 95% CI 1.28-10.22), although without a difference in the DPR (pooled OR = 0.28; 95% CI 0.05-1.48). In addition, we discovered that the 1-year (pooled OR = 1.39; 95% CI 0.84-2.29) and 2-year (pooled OR = 1.70; 95% CI 0.69-4.18) survival rates in the TACE monotherapy cohort were not significantly different to those in the sorafenib-alone cohort.Conclusion:The combination therapy is more effective than monotherapy in improving the prognostic outcomes of patients with advanced HCC. Therefore, we recommend it as the preferred treatment intervention for those patients.
