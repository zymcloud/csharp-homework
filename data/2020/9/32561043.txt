We developed a mixing medical device by attaching Shirasu porous glass Millipore membrane to prepare water-in-oil-in-water (WOW) emulsion in a shorter time to be applied as 10B-entrapped WOW emulsion for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. Single-dose toxicity studies by intra-arterial injection of 10BSH-entrapped WOW were performed in rabbits and pig, and no side effects were observed. We hope to proceed to the preclinical and clinical studies for further evaluation of 10B compound as multidisciplinary treatments for HCC.
