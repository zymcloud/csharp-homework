We report on clinical outcomes in patients with oligometastatic uterine cancer treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Twenty-seven patients with 61 lesions were treated with SBRT. Median follow-up was 16.9 months. Local control was achieved in 49/61 (80.3%) lesions. One-year local-progression-free survival and overall survival were 75.9% and 65.4%. Lesions with favorable response were smaller than lesions with unfavorable response (p = .007). Liver lesions were less likely to achieve favorable response (p = .0128). There were no grade 3 or 4 events. Treatment with SBRT can provide excellent local control in oligometastatic uterine cancer with minimal toxicity.
