Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection represents a major global health problem, affecting an estimated 257-291 million persons worldwide and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality because of clinical complications, such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite existing resources for vaccination, screening, and treatment, the burden of chronic HBV remains significant within the United States (US). Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) have articulated formal hepatitis elimination plans, although an updated assessment of the epidemiology and prevalence of chronic HBV is needed to inform these initiatives. The Chronic Liver Disease Foundation (CLDF), a nonprofit 501(c)(3) educational organization dedicated to raising awareness of liver disease, partnered with a panel of leading US hepatologists to conduct an updated literature review to develop a contemporary HBV prevalence range estimate. Panel members researched and evaluated the peer-reviewed literature on HBV prevalence and, in May 2019, discussed their findings during a live HBV epidemiology workshop. The panel proposed an overall estimated prevalence for chronic HBV infection in the US of 1.59 million persons (range 1.25-2.49 million). This review provides a summary of the workshop findings and conclusions, which may serve to inform future initiatives focused on HBV screening and prevention in the US.
