Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, affecting men to women at a ratio of about 4:1. Risk factors, characteristics, and outcomes for HCC in women in the United States remain poorly understood; therefore, we aim to explore gender differences further.Methods:Patients diagnosed with HCC between January 2000 and June 2014 at 5 large centers were identified. Clinical information, tumor characteristics, and survival data were extracted manually. The presence of underlying cirrhosis was assessed based on published criteria.Results:Of 5,327 patients with HCC in our cohort, 1,203 (22.6%) were women. There were important differences in the underlying etiology of liver disease between the 2 genders (P Discussion:The frequency of underlying nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and noncirrhotic HCC were significantly higher in women than men in this large cohort. Women presented with less-advanced HCC and had a greater overall survival. Further investigation is warranted to explore potential mechanisms and implications for these gender differences, especially with noncirrhotic HCC (see Visual Abstract, Supplementary Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/AJG/B535).
