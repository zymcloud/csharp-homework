A 70-year-old female was found to have multiple hepatic cysts at her annual checkup. In the posterior segment of the right lobe of the liver, an 81 Ã— 67 mm circular cystic lesion was detected by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cyst revealed a solid component. The cyst had a capsule-like structure and non-uniform fluid accumulation suggested bleeding. Since the lesion was enlarged and malignancy could not be ruled out, it was surgically resected. Histopathologically, reticular fibers of the liver were seen in necrotic tissue and the lesion was diagnosed as a bleeding hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The non-cancerous liver tissue showed non-cirrhotic steatohepatitis. This was an unusual presentation of HCC.
