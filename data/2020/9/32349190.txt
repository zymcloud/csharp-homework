The utility of primary culture originated from the residual aspiration specimens to predict outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma patients receiving curative treatment was investigated. A total of 105 American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM stage I or II patients were included. The culture results were determined at the 28th of culture and were divided into rapid proliferation of cancer cells alone, rapid proliferation of both cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts, rapid proliferation of cancer-associated fibroblasts alone, slow proliferation, and no outgrowth of plating specimens. Our results showed that outgrowths of cultured cells from plated particles were achieved in 98.1% of patients. Sixty-nine patients (65.7%) showed rapid proliferation of cultured cells (11 rapid proliferation of cancer cells alone, 17 rapid proliferation of both cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts, and 41 rapid proliferation of cancer-associated fibroblasts alone). There was no significant difference in the incidence of recurrence or survival between patients with normal and abnormal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C, TNM stage I and stage II, histological high-grade and low-grade hepatocellular carcinoma, and between patients treated by operative resection and local abrasion. Only patients with rapid proliferation of cancer cells Â± rapid proliferation of cancer-associated fibroblasts showed significantly higher incidence of recurrence than patients with other growth types (P = .0482), but there was no significant difference in survival between two groups. In conclusion, primary culture using this method is clinically feasible and can be applied to predict recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma patients receiving curative treatment.
