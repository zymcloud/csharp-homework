Splenosis is defined as the autotransplantation of viable splenic tissue throughout various anatomic compartments. Intrahepatic splenosis (IHS) is rare and diagnosis is often challenging. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review on IHS. A literature review was performed on PubMed database. Fifty-six articles with 59 reported cases were included. The majority of the patients were male (n = 49, 83.1%). Median age was 51 years. Risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) included hepatitis B (n = 8, 13.6%) and cirrhosis (n = 12, 20.3%). The majority of the patients were asymptomatic (62.7%) and did not have risk factors for HCC (55.9%). We report a diagnostic triad for IHS: 1) previous history of abdominal trauma or splenectomy, 2) absence of risk factors for liver malignancy and 3) typical imaging features. Non-invasive diagnostic tests such as technetium-99m-tagged heat-damaged red blood cell scintigraphy are useful in diagnosis. Malignancy should be ruled out in the presence of risk factors for HCC.
