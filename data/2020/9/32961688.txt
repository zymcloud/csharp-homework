Background and aims:HCV eradication by direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) reduces de novo hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence in cirrhosis; however, contrasting evidence about beneficial or detrimental effects still exists in patients who have already developed HCC.Methods:we investigated whether sofosbuvir and daclatasvir modulate cell proliferation, invasion capability and gene expression (RNA-seq) in HCC-derived cell lines, hypothesizing possible off-target effects of these drugs. Results observed in HCC cell lines were validated in non-HCC cancer-derived cell lines and a preliminary series of human HCC tissues by qPCR and IHC.Results:DAAs can affect HCC cell proliferation and migration capability by either increasing or reducing them, showing transcriptomic changes consistent with some unexpected drug-associated effects. Off-target gene modulation, mainly affecting ribosomal genes, mitochondrial functions and histones, points to epigenetics and proliferation as relevant events, consistent with matched phenotypic changes. A preliminary validation of in vitro findings was performed in a restricted cohort of HCC patients previously treated with DAAs, with immunohistochemical correlations suggesting DAA-treated HCCs to be more aggressive in terms of migration and epidermal-to-mesenchymal transition.Conclusions:Our findings suggested the possible occurrence of off-target effects ultimately modulating cell proliferation and/or migration and potentially justified previous findings showing some instances of particularly aggressive HCC recurrence as well as reduced incidence of recurrence of HCC following treatment with DAAs.
