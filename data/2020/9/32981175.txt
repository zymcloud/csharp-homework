Background:Transcatheter Arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the first-line option for the intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Guidelines do not define the number of TACE sessions to be repeated before stopping treatment and switching to sorafenib.Methods:We retrospectively analysed 76 patients aged ≥65 years who were treated by multiple TACE sessions (re-TACE group; N = 36 patients) or one TACE session followed by sorafenib (TACE/Sorafenib group; N = 40 patients). The primary outcome was the overall survival (Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test).Results:Median overall survival was 320 days (range: 70-420 days) in re-TACE subgroup and 285 days (range: 50-368 days) in TACE/Sorafenib subgroup without significant differences between the two groups (log-rank test P = .72; HR = 0.87; 95% IC 0.41-1.87). The survival rate at one year was 43.6% and 32% in the re-TACE and in the TACE/sorafenib groups (P = .12), respectively. Subgroup analysis by gender, number of nodules at baseline and etiology of liver cirrhosis was performed but no differences were found. No statistical difference was observed in the frequency of side effects, but sorafenib was associated with severe diarrhoea in most patients requiring dose reduction.Conclusion:In our study including HCC patients aged ≥65 years, no differences in survival rate and side effects were found between patients Retreated with further TACE sessions and patients with treatment stage migration to sorafenib after first TACE failure. We included in our analysis a small study population; therefore, larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.
