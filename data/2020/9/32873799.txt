Mongolia has the highest incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the world, but its causative factors and underlying tumor biology remain unknown. Here, we describe molecular characteristics of HCC from 76 Mongolian patients by whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing. We present a comprehensive analysis of mutational signatures, driver genes, and molecular subtypes of Mongolian HCC compared to 373 HCC patients of different races and ethnicities and diverse etiologies. Mongolian HCC consists of prognostic molecular subtypes similar to those found in patients from other areas of Asia, Europe, and North America, as well as other unique subtypes, suggesting the presence of distinct etiologies linked to Mongolian patients. In addition to common driver mutations (TP53, CTNNB1) frequently found in pan-cancer analysis, Mongolian HCC exhibits unique drivers (most notably GTF2IRD2B, PNRC2, and SPTA1), the latter of which is associated with hepatitis D viral infection. These results suggest the existence of new molecular mechanisms at play in Mongolian hepatocarcinogenesis.
