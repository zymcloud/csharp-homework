Natural products have a significant role in the development of new drugs, being relevant the pentacyclic triterpenes extracted from Olea europaea L. Anticancer effect of uvaol, a natural triterpene, has been scarcely studied. The aim of this study was to understand the anticancer mechanism of uvaol in the HepG2 cell line. Cytotoxicity results showed a selectivity effect of uvaol with higher influence in HepG2 than WRL68 cells used as control. Our results show that uvaol has a clear and selective anticancer activity in HepG2 cells supported by a significant anti-migratory capacity and a significant increase in the expression of HSP-60. Furthermore, the administration of this triterpene induces cell arrest in the G0/G1 phase, as well as an increase in the rate of cell apoptosis. These results are supported by a decrease in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2, an increase in the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, together with a down-regulation of the AKT/PI3K signaling pathway. A reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in HepG2 cells was also observed. Altogether, results showed anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effect of uvaol on hepatocellular carcinoma, constituting an interesting challenge in the development of new treatments against this type of cancer.
