Cases of extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma are mostly adenocarcinomas and extrahepatic bile duct squamous cell carcinomas are rare. We report here a case of choledochal squamous cell carcinoma in a young woman who underwent surgery and chemotherapy. The woman presented with abdominal discomfort. A physical examination showed tenderness in the upper abdomen. Laboratory tests showed elevated direct bilirubin, total bilirubin, and C-reactive protein levels. Abdominal computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a cystic-solid mixed soft tissue mass in the common bile duct. Pain symptoms in the patient were not relieved and surgical treatment was performed. Postoperative pathological results showed a choledochal cyst complicated by squamous cell carcinoma. The patient was treated by biliary intestinal anastomosis followed by chemotherapy. However, the patient developed liver metastasis and recurrence at a 6-month follow-up. Primary congenital bile duct cysts with squamous cell carcinoma are extremely rare. Surgical resection is the main treatment option for choledochal squamous cell carcinoma. Postoperative chemoradiotherapy can be used, but the efficacy is poor and chemotherapy does not significantly prolong the patient's survival.
