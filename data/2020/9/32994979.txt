Background:Inflammation is a recognized concomitant of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its indices are prognostically useful.Aims:To evaluate two commonly used inflammatory indices, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), to examine their relationship to maximum tumor diameter (MTD) and to survival.Methods:A database of 1024 prospectively-accrued HCC patients was examined, who had full baseline tumor parameter data, including CT scan information on HCC size and whose survival was known. Analyses of NLR and PLR were correlated to MDT and to survival. NLR and PLR cutoffs were calculated from receiver operator characteristic curves.Results:Every MTD pair had significantly different PLR values, for MTD groups of groups 3.02) and PLR (â‰¤6.82/>6.82) groups, showed significance for PLR, p = 0.034 and approaching significance for NLR, p = 0.057.Conclusions:MTD pairs down to
CT, computerized axial tomography; HCC; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; MTD, maximum tumor diameter; NLR; NLR, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; PLR; PLR, platelet lymphocyte ratio; Survival.
