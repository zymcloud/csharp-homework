A 76-year-old man, who experienced prostate cancer biochemical relapse after 12 years from radical prostatectomy, underwent abdominal CT scan for restaging purposes, negative for metastases, and then C-choline PET/CT. The only finding was an area of focal uptake of radiotracer between the intestinal loops and the abdominal wall; after resection, the lesion demonstrated to be a metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), for which the patient had undergone liver resection 2 years earlier. This case proves that abnormal foci of C-choline uptake in the peritoneum in HCC patients have to be kept in mind as possible sites of HCC-metastases.
