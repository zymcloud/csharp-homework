Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met pathway is implicated in embryogenesis and organ development and differentiation. Germline or somatic mutations, chromosomal rearrangements, gene amplification, and transcriptional upregulation in MET or alterations in autocrine or paracrine c-Met signalling have been associated with cancer cell proliferation and survival, including in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and associated with disease progression. HGF/c-Met pathway has been shown to be particularly relevant in tumors with bone metastases (BMs). However, the efficacy of targeting c-Met in bone metastatic disease, including in RCC, has not been proven. Therefore, further investigation is required focusing the particular role of HGF/c-Met pathway in bone microenvironment (BME) and how to effectively target this pathway in the context of bone metastatic disease.
