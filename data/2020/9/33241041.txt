Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and the methods for its treatment have shown limited efficacy. There is an urgent need to explore the underlying mechanism that are involved in hepatocarcinogenesis, contributing to find various signal molecular targets for HCC diagnosis, prevention and therapy. Recently, Various studies have illustrated protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type D (PTPRD) is an important tumor-suppressor gene that is down-regulated in HCC and this downregulation occurs through its promoter hypermethylation. PTPRD is involved in the progression, migration, apoptosis, invasion and immune suppression of HCC. Also, PTPRD participates in several vital cellular signaling pathways, including PTPRD, signal transduction and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3), JAK, PTPRD, Î²-catenin, TCF, along with the PTPRD-CXCL8 axis, the PTPRD/phosphatidylinositol3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and the PTPRD/PD-1/programmed death receptor ligand-1 (PD-L1) axis, thus playing an essential role in HCC. Therefore, PTPRD can be considered as a novel therapeutic target for HCC, and PTPRD-targeted therapeutics in combination with methylation inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors and alternative targeted drugs maybe an innovative treatment method for HCC. However, clinical research of PTPRD-targeted therapies in HCC is greatly limited and tremendous efforts are strongly urged to evaluate its clinical performance in HCC. In this review, we summarized the physiological function and the significant effects of PTPRD and performed a comprehensive analysis of PTPRD-targeted strategies for HCC.
