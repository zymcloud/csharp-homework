Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is currently the first indication of liver transplantation (LT) in Europe and Asia-Pacific region and the third in USA. HCC recurrence is the main complication affecting short- and medium-term outcome after LT.Methods:A total of 433 consecutive adult recipients transplanted for HCC between 2000 and 2017 (mean age: 57.8 ± 8.5 years; 83.8% were males) with a mean follow-up of 74.6 ± 58.6 months were included. Patients had to meet Milan criteria and since 2014, AFP score to be listed. Patients with HCC recurrence were classified into early (≤ 2years) and late recurrence (> 2years) and were retrospectively reviewed.Results:Patients who developed recurrence (75 patients, 17%) had more tumors outside Milan and UCSF criteria, high AFP score and microvascular invasion at pathology. Early recurrence developed in 46 patients (61.3%); the overall 5 and 10-year survival rates of these patients from time of LT were 6.7% and 0%, which were significantly lower than those with late recurrence respectively 64.0% and 27.1% (p50mm) in the explant (HR=1.277; p=0.045) as independent predictors of early recurrence.Conclusion:Improving the prediction of early HCC recurrence could optimize patient selection for LT, potential adjuvant therapy with new targeted drugs and hence improve long-term survival.
