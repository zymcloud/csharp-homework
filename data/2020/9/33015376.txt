A major challenge in hepatitis C research is the detection of early potential for progressive liver disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that regulate gene expression and can be biomarkers of pathological processes. In this study, we compared circulating miRNAs identified in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients presenting two extremes of liver disease: mild/moderate fibrosis and cirrhosis. The patients in the cirrhosis group subsequently developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We identified 163 mature miRNAs in the mild/moderate fibrosis group and 171 in the cirrhosis group, with 144 in common to both groups. Differential expression analysis revealed 5 upregulated miRNAs and 2 downregulated miRNAs in the cirrhosis group relative to the mild/moderate fibrosis group. Functional analyses of regulatory networks (target gene and miRNA) identified gene categories involved in cell cycle biological processes and metabolic pathways related to cell cycle, cancer, and apoptosis. These results suggest that the differentially expressed circulating miRNAs observed in this work (miR-215-5p, miR-483-5p, miR-193b-3p, miR-34a-5p, miR-885-5p, miR-26b-5p and miR -197-3p) may be candidates for biomarkers in the prognosis of liver disease.
