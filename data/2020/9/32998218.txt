Keratin 19 (K19) is a cancer stem cell marker expressed by a subpopulation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), associated with tumor aggressiveness. We evaluated the prognostic value of serum K19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1), in comparison or in combination with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin-K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II), in patients with HCC. A total of 160 patients (28F/132M; median age 62, range 44-86 years) with a new diagnosis of HCC and available serum samples collected at tumor diagnosis were analyzed retrospectively. Median overall survival (OS) after HCC diagnosis was 35.1, 95% CI 27.1-70.5 months. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that CYFRA 21-1 > 2.7 ng/mL (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.39, p < 0.001), AFP > 20 ng/mL (HR = 2.27, p = 0.007), and PIVKA-II > 200 mAU/mL (HR = 2.17, p = 0.020) were independent predictors of OS. The combination of biomarkers positivity allowed us to stratify patients with HCC into four risk categories associated with a progressively lower survival probability (log-rank test, p < 0.001). CYFRA 21-1 resulted an independent prognostic factor of patients with HCC and its combination with AFP and PIVKA-II might be useful to tailor personalized treatment strategies.
