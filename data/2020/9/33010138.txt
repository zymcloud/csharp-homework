This study aimed to develop sorafenib loaded magnetic microspheres for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. To achieve this goal, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) were synthesised and encapsulated in alginate microspheres together with an antineoplastic agent, sorafenib. In the study, firstly SPIONs were synthesised and characterised by dynamic light scattering, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Then, alginate-SPIONs microspheres were developed, and further characterised by electron spin resonance spectrometer and vibrating sample magnetometer. Besides the magnetic properties of SPIONs, alginate microspheres with SPIONs were also found to have magnetic properties. The potential use of microspheres in hyperthermia treatment was then investigated and an increase of about 4Â°C in the environment was found out. Drug release studies and cytotoxicity tests were performed after sorafenib was encapsulated into the magnetic microspheres. According to release studies, sorafenib has been released from microspheres for 8 h. Cytotoxicity tests showed that alginate-SPION-sorafenib microspheres were highly effective against cancerous cells and promising for cancer therapy.
