Background:A strong association between chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and hepatic steatosis has been reported. However, the influence of steatohepatitis on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination remains unclear.Aim:To evaluate the development of HCC after HCV cure using a new steatohepatitis-related biomarker.Methods:This cohort study analysed the prospective database of 290 CHC patients without a history of HCC who achieved HCV elimination by direct-acting antivirals. We calculated the FibroScan-aspartate aminotransferase (FAST) score 12 weeks after the end of treatment (pw12). The risk of HCC was analysed using the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model.Results:HCV genotype (GT)1 was most prevalent at 72.4%, followed by GT2 (26.6%). Median follow-up period was 4.2 years (IQR 3.1-4.5). The cumulative HCC incidence for a FAST score â‰¥ 0.35 was significantly higher than that for a FAST score Conclusions:Steatohepatitis-related biomarkers with the FAST score are helpful for predicting the development of HCC after HCV elimination.
