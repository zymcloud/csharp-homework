Background:It has reported that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) exerted regulatory functions by targeting specific genes through a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) pathway. LncRNA OIP5-AS1 has been identified as a tumor-enhancer in several tumor types. Nonetheless, its molecular mechanism in HCC remains to be masked.Aim of the study:This study was aimed at exploring whether and how OIP5-AS1 exert functions in HCC.Methods:qRT-PCR and western blot were employed for detecting gene expression. CCK-8, colony formation and EdU assays were implemented to evaluate the proliferative ability of HCC cells. Caspase-3 activity and flow cytometry analyses were implemented to determine cell apoptosis and cell cycle distribution. RNA pull down, ChIP, RIP and luciferase reporter assays explored the interplays between molecules.Results:YY1 was upregulated in HCC cells, and silenced YY1 restrained HCC cell proliferation in vitro and hampered tumor growth in vivo. Later, we discovered that miR-300 could regulate WNT pathway via targeting YY1. Furthermore, OIP5-AS1 was identified as the sponge of miR-300 and promoted cell growth in HCC. Importantly, YY1 transcriptionally activate OIP5-AS1 in turn. Rescue experiments indicated that miR-300 inhibition or YY1 overexpression abrogated the inhibitive effect of OIP5-AS1 silencing on the malignant growth of HCC cells.Conclusions:OIP5-AS1/miR-300/YY1 feedback loop facilitates cell growth in HCC by activating WNT pathway.
