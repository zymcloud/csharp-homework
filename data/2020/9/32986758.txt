Objective:This study aimed to compare the efficacy between bipolar radiofrequency ablation (RFA), using twin internally cooled wet (TICW) electrodes, and switching monopolar RFA, using separable clustered (SC) electrodes, in the treatment of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after locoregional treatment.Materials and methods:In this single-center, two-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled study, we performed a 1:1 random allocation on eligible patients with recurrent HCC after locoregional treatment, to receive TICW-RFA or SC-RFA. The primary endpoint was the minimum diameter of the ablation zone per unit ablation time. Secondary endpoints included other technical parameters, complication rate, technical success and technique efficacy, and clinical outcomes.Results:Enrolled patients were randomly assigned to the TICW-RFA group (n = 40) or SC-RFA group (n = 37). The two groups did not show significant differences in the primary endpoint, the minimum diameter of the ablation zone per unit ablation time was 2.71 ± 0.98 mm/min and 2.61 ± 0.96 mm/min in the TICW-RFA and SC-RFA groups, respectively (p = 0.577). Total RF energy delivery (11.75 ± 9.04 kcal vs. 22.61 ± 12.98 kcal, p Conclusion:In this single-center randomized controlled study from a Korean tertiary referral hospital, TICW-RFA demonstrated similar therapeutic efficacy and safety profile for recurrent HCC after locoregional treatment compared with SC-RFA.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03806218).
