Background and aims:All published meta-analyses failed to demonstrate that preoperative transarterial chemoembolization improves the clinical outcomes of patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The present study aimed to investigate the utility of systemic inflammatory cells as a tumor biology marker predicting therapeutic benefit of neoadjuvant transarterial chemoembolization in patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma.Materials and methods:We retrospectively investigated 441 hepatocellular carcinoma patients who underwent curative resection. Among 441 patients, 73 patients underwent preoperative transarterial chemoembolization, and 368 patients did not. We compared recurrence-free survival and overall survival between transarterial chemoembolization plus sequential resection group and resection only group. We analyzed whether pretreatment neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio demonstrates survival benefit in each groups.Results:No significant difference was observed in recurrence-free or overall survival between both groups. In the transarterial chemoembolization plus sequential resection group, the 5-year overall survival in patients with high neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (â‰¥1.6) was significantly lower than that in patients with low neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (78.4% and 100%, P = 0.027). High neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio was associated with vascular invasion (P = 0.033).Conclusion:Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio can be considered as a predictive factor of long-term survival and used to identify patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma who benefit from neoadjuvant transarterial chemoembolization.
