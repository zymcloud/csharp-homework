Background: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has synergistic properties when combined with ablative therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Objective: To compare outcomes for inoperable HCC between TACE with percutaneous thermal ablation (T-TA) and TACE with stereotactic body radiotherapy (T-SBRT) using propensity-score-weighted cohorts. Methods: This retrospective study included 190 patients with a single inoperable HCC treated from 2007 to 2018 by either T-SBRT (n=90) or T-TA (n=100). The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS) and hepatotoxicity (defined as Child Pugh elevation of â‰¥ 2 within two to six months post-treatment). Fine-Gray competing risk models with propensity score weighting and transplantation as the competing risk factor were used to model OS and PFS. Results: The median follow-up time was 48.2 months. OS and PFS were both significantly higher for T-TA (77% and 76%, respectively, at 2 years) than T-SBRT (49% and 50%, respectively, at 2 years) in the propensity weighted multivariate model (OS: subdistributed hazard ratio [sHR] 2.70, p<0.001; PFS: sHR: 1.71, p=0.016). Treatment-related hepatotoxicity occurred in 9% for T-TA vs. in 27% for T-SBRT (p=0.010). For the subset of patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer A HCC and Child-Pugh A cirrhosis (T-SBRT [n=36], T-TA [n=55] T-TA), OS (p=0.108) and PFS (p=0.189) were not significantly different between the two treatment modalities. Conclusion: Compared to T-SBRT, T-TA demonstrated superior OS and PFS, possibly from lesser hepatotoxicity. The two strategies did not differ in OS and PFS in patients with the earliest-stage HCC and preserved liver function. Clinical impact: Across all patients, T-TA may be superior to T-SBRT for inoperable HCC.
