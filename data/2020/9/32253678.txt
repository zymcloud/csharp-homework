Background:Liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) offers a chance of cure, although survival is often limited. The actual 3-year survival and its associated prognostic factors have not been reported.Methods:A nationwide database of HCC patients with PVTT who underwent liver resection with 'curative' intent was analyzed. The clinicopathologic characteristics, the perioperative, and survival outcomes for the actual long-term survivors were compared with the non-long-term survivors (patients who died within 3 years of surgery). Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were performed to identify predictive factors associated with long-term survival outcomes.Results:The study included 1590 patients with an actuarial 3-year survival of 16.6%, while the actual 3-year survival rate was 11.7%. There were 171 patients who survived for at least 3 years after surgery and 1290 who died within 3 years of surgery. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that total bilirubin > 17.1 μmol/l, AFP > 400 ng/ml, types of hepatectomy, extent of PVTT, intraoperative blood loss > 400 ml, tumor diameter > 5 cm, tumor encapsulation, R0 resection, liver cirrhosis, adjuvant TACE, postoperative early recurrence (Conclusion:One in nine HCC patients with PVTT reached the long-term survival milestone of 3 years after resection. Major hepatectomy, controlling intraoperative blood loss, R0 resection, adjuvant TACE, and 'curative' treatment for initial recurrence should be considered for patients to achieve better long-term survival outcomes.
