Background:There is currently no effective treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and chemotherapy has little effect on long-term survival of HCC patients, largely due to the cancer stem cell (CSC) chemoresistance of HCC.Methods:We constructed a small-molecule nanometer-sized prodrug (nanoprodrug) loaded with salinomycin (SAL) for the treatment of HCC. SAL was encapsulated by the prodrug LA-SN38 (linoleic acid modified 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin) to construct a self-assembled nanoprodrug further PEGylated with DSPE-PEG2000. We characterized this codelivered nanoprodrug and its antitumor activity both in vitro in human HCC cell lines and in vivo in mice.Results:Delivery of the SAL- and LA-SN38-based nanoprodrugs effectively promoted apoptosis of HCC cells, exerted inhibition of HCC tumor-sphere formation as well as HCC cell motility and invasion, and reduced the proportion of CD133+ HCC-CSC cells. In nude mice, the nanoprodrug suppressed growth of tumor xenografts derived from human cell lines and patient.Conclusion:Our results show that SAL-based nanoprodrugs are a promising platform for treating patients with HCC and a novel strategy for combination therapy of cancers.
