In this study, few different evaluation concepts were used for the assessment of genotoxic potential at the stretch of the Danube River identified as a significant hotspot of pollution originated through the untreated wastewaters. Three sites were chosen: one site upstream of the wastewater outlet in Novi Sad (Serbia), one at the outlet of wastewaters, and one site few kilometer downstream. Ex situ approach comprised prokaryotic SOS/umuC test on Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1005 and comet assay on human hepatoma cell line (HepG2). In situ approach was based on the active monitoring (cage approach) using freshwater mussels Sinanodonta woodiana and fish Cyprinus carpio. The comet and micronucleus assays were selected for evaluation of DNA damage in mussel haemocytes and fish blood cells. Within the ex situ part of the study, our results indicated that the eukaryotic model system is more sensitive compared to the prokaryotic one. In situ bioassays are recommended for obtaining a better insight into ecosystem status and in the case of our study the complete insight of genotoxic pressure. However, the choice of animals as bioindicators also has a significant impact on the quality of the obtained information. Differential response between fish and mussels was observed at the highly polluted site suggesting possible involvement of additional protective mechanism such as valve closure in mussels.
