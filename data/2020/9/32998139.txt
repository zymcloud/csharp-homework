Introduction:It remains unclear whether TERT promoter mutation (TERT C228T) in serum cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is useful for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Methods:In this retrospective study, we analyzed the relationships between TERT C228T in serum cfDNA and levels of AFP and PIVKAII in 57 Japanese patients with histopathologically confirmed NAFLD background, consisting of 36 patients with HCC and 21 without HCC. We also examined the liver-related survival rate and HCC recurrence rate after the initial treatment for HCC. TERT C228T was detected using a highly sensitive method based on wild-type blocking PCR (detection limit in excess of 0.7% mutant-type DNA).Results:In all of the 57 patients, multivariate analysis identified TERT C228T positive as significant determinant of primary HCC. In the 36 patients with HCC, the percentage of patients positive for TERT C228T was 63.9%. The percentage of patients positive for TERT C228T with normal AFP and PIVKAII was 35.3%. The positive predictive value and specificity for prediction of BCLC stage 0 or A were both high. In 6 patients, TERT C228T was repeatedly negative during follow-up but became positive at the time of HCC diagnosis. Four patients who underwent HCC surgical resection had well-differentiated solitary HCC measuring Conclusions:Our results highlight the superiority of TERT C228T in serum cfDNA compared with AFP and PIVKAII in the early diagnosis of primary HCC in NAFLD patients.
