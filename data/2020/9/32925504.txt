Aim:Chronic hepatitis B patients positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) with high serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels but normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels may develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, ways to risk stratify are limited.Methods:A retrospective cohort of 651 HBeAg positive, adult patients with high serum HBV DNA levels (>7 log IU/ml) but normal or mildly elevated ALT levels (Results:Age and FIB-4 index were independent factors associated with HCC development. When stratified, 5- and 10-year cumulative HCC incidence rates were 0 and 2.0% for patients aged Conclusion:In patients with high HBV DNA but normal ALT levels, age and FIB-4 index could effectively stratify HCC risk, indicating that these parameters may guide management plans for this population.
