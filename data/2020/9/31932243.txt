Background:Optimal treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) beyond the Milan criteria (MC) is debated. The aim of the study was to assess overall-survival (OS) and disease-free-survival (DFS) for HCC beyond MC when treated by trans-arterial-chemoembolization (TACE) or surgical resection (SR).Method:between 2005 and 2015, all patients with a first diagnosis of HCC beyond MC(1 nodule>5 cm, or 3 nodules>3 cm without macrovascular invasion) were evaluated. Analyses were carried out through Kaplan-Meier, Cox models and the inverse probability weighting (IPW) method to reduce allocation bias. Sub-analyses have been performed for multinodular and single large tumors compared with a MC-IN cohort.Results:226 consecutive patients were evaluated: 118 in SR group and 108 in TACE group. After IPW, the two pseudo-populations were comparable for tumor burden and liver function. In the SR group, 1-5 years OS rates were 72.3% and 35% respectively and 92.7% and 39.3% for TACE (p = 0.500). The median DFS was 8 months (95%CI:8-9) for TACE, and 11 months (95%CI:9-12) for SR (p 5 cm and multinodular disease had comparable OS and DFS as Milan-IN group (p > 0.05).Conclusion:Surgery allowed a better control than TACE in patient bearing HCC beyond MC. This translated into a significant benefit in terms of DFS but not OS.
