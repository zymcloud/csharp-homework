Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of the cancer-related death in the world. Human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) have been characterized with a pluripotency, low immunogenicity and no tumorigenicity. Especially, the immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects of hAMSCs make them suitable for treating HCC. Here, we reported that hAMSCs administrated by intravenous injection significantly inhibited HCC through suppressing cell proliferation and inducing cell apoptosis in tumour-bearing mice with Hepg2 cells. Cell tracking experiments with GFP-labelled hAMSCs showed that the stem cells possessed the ability of migrating to the tumorigenic sites for suppressing tumour growth. Importantly, both hAMSCs and the conditional media (hAMSC-CM) have the similar antitumour effects in vitro, suggesting that hAMSCs-derived cytokines might be involved in their antitumour effects. Antibody array assay showed that hAMSCs highly expressed dickkopf-3 (DKK-3), dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3). Furthermore, the antitumour effects of hAMSCs were further confirmed by applications of the antibodies or the specific siRNAs of DKK-3, DKK-1 and IGFBP-3 in vitro. Mechanically, hAMSCs-derived DKK-3, DKK-1 and IGFBP-3 markedly inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis of Hepg2 cells through suppressing the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway and IGF-1R-mediated PI3K/AKT signalling pathway, respectively. Taken together, our study demonstrated that hAMSCs possess significant antitumour effects in vivo and in vitro and might provide a novel strategy for HCC treatment clinically.
