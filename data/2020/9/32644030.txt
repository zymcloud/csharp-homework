Background: WHO has set target to reduce mortality attributable to hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) by 65% by 2030, with 2015 as baseline. We aimed to describe the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) baseline mortality from liver diseases, as defined by WHO Core-10 indicator through ICD-10 codes, and estimate mortality attributable to HBV and HCV.Methods: Age-standardised mortality rates per 100,000 for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, ICD-10 C22.0), chronic liver disease (CLD, ICD-10 K72-K75) and chronic viral hepatitis B and C (CHB/CHC, ICD-10 B18.1-B18.3) were calculated by gender, age-group and country using 2015 Eurostat data. Because aetiology fraction (AF) estimates were lacking for HCC and CLD as defined by C10, number of deaths in EU/EEA countries in 2015 from liver cancer (ICD-10 C22) and 'cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases' (ICD-10 B18-B18.9, I85-I85.9, I98.2, K70-K70.3, K71.7, K74-K74.9, K75.2, K75.4-K76.2, K76.4-K76.9 and K77.8) were adjusted by corresponding AF estimates from Global Burden of Disease publications.Results: In 2015, there were wide variations across countries in mortality rates from HCC, CLD and CHB/CHC. A 2015 mortality baseline of 63,927 deaths attributable to HBV and HCV is proposed, that includes 55% of liver cancer and 45% of 'cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases' deaths.Conclusions: The HBV and HCV attributable mortality in the EU/EEA is high. Greater efforts are needed to identify HBV and HCV infections at an early stage and link cases to care to reduce mortality from liver diseases. Country-specific AF estimates are needed to accurately estimate HBV, HCV associated mortality.
