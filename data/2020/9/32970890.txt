Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was reported as a poor prognostic factor among liver transplantation. However, donor AAC is not enough discussed. We analyzed the impact of the donor AAC level on graft function on outcomes following living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). A total of 133 consecutive patients who had undergone LDLT were divided into two groups (non-AAC group and AAC group) according to their donor AAC level by plain computed tomography. The rate of postoperative biliary complications (BC) was significantly higher in AAC group (N = 17) than in non-AAC group (N = 116; HR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.32-5.83; P = 0.0008). The Cox proportional hazards regression model revealed that donor AAC (HR, 4.15; 95% CI, 1.93-8.97; P = 0.0003) and right lobe graft (HR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.41-5.61; P = 0.003) increased the risk of BC. Conversely, splenectomy (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.16-0.92; P = 0.03) decreased the risk of BC after LDLT independently. The long-term survival was also significantly worse in AAC group than in non-AAC group (HR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.04-4.89; P = 0.04). Donor AAC was an independent prognostic factor for BC among patients undergoing LDLT. Although further investigations are needed to verify our results, the levels of donor AAC could be a useful tool to identify the risks of BC and predict better outcomes following LDLT.
