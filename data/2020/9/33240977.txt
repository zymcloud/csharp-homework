Background:The present study analyzed whole-lesion histogram parameters from intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) to explore the clinical value of IVIM histogram features in the differentiation of liver lesions.Methods:In this retrospective study, 33 cases of hepatic hemangioma (HH), 22 cases of hepatic cysts (HC), and 34 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were underwent IVIM-DWI (b =0-600 s/mm2), which were confirmed pathologically and clinically. The data were processed by IVIM model to obtain the following quantitative indicators: perfusion fraction (f), slow diffusion coefficient (D), and pseudo-diffusion coefficient (or fast diffusion coefficient, D*). The region of interest in the largest solid part of the lesion was delineated for histogram analysis of the correlation between tissue image and lesion type. The relevant histogram parameters were obtained and statistically analyzed. The characteristic histogram parameters for HH, HC, and HCC were compared to find significantly different parameters. The diagnostic efficacies of these parameters for HH, liver cysts, and HCC were assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.Results:There were significant differences in the maximum diameter, maximum value, minimum value, mean, median, standard deviation, uniformity, skewness, kurtosis, volume, 10th percentile (P10) of D, and 90th percentile (P90) of D between the three groups (PConclusions:A multiparametric histogram from IVIM-DWI magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an effective means of identifying HH, HC, and HCC that provides valuable reference information for clinical diagnosis.
