Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) belongs to the most prevalent and deadliest cancers worldwide. It can be attributed to well-defined risk factors (mainly chronic viral hepatitis and alcoholic/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) leading to liver cirrhosis, a premalignant condition for the development of preneoplastic hepatocellular lesions and finally liver cancer. By applying strict morphological criteria and a panel of immunohistological markers, early HCC can be differentiated from its precursor lesions and other highly differentiated hepatocellular lesions even in most biopsy specimens. Integrative characterization led to the association of histological features and molecular subgroups of human HCC. This potentially relevant clinical development was recognized by the recently updated WHO classification of liver cancer resulting in the introduction of several HCC subtypes. These are characterized by a distinct combination of histological and molecular features, biological behavior, and clinical characteristics, allowing for a distinction from other HCC without specified features. Whether this development sets the corner stone for precision oncology of human HCC patients must be monitored.
