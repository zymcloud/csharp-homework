Ferroptosis is a recently discovered form of programmed cell death, but its regulatory mechanisms are not fully understood. In the current study, we reported that the BRD7-P53-SLC25A28 axis played a crucial role in regulating ferroptosis in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Upon exposure to ferroptosis inducers, bromodomain-containing protein 7 (BRD7) protein expression was remarkably increased through the inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated BRD7 knockout conferred resistance to HSC ferroptosis, whereas specific BRD7 plasmid-mediated BRD7 overexpression facilitated HSC ferroptosis. Interestingly, the elevated BRD7 expression exhibited to promote p53 mitochondrial translocation via direct binding with p53 N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD), which may be the underlying mechanisms for BRD7-enhanced HSC ferroptosis. Site-directed mutations of serine 392 completely blocked the binding of BRD7 to p53, and, in turn, prevented p53 mitochondrial translocation and HSC ferroptosis. Importantly, mitochondrial p53 interacted with solute carrier family 25 member 28 (SLC25A28) to form complex and enhanced the activity of SLC25A28, which could lead to the abnormal accumulation of redox-active iron and hyperfunction of electron transfer chain (ETC). SLC25A28 knockdown impaired BRD7-or p53-mediated ferroptotic events. In mice, erastin treatment ameliorated pathological damage of liver fibrosis through inducing HSC ferroptosis. HSC-specific blockade of BRD7-P53-SLC25A28 axis could abrogate erastin-induced HSC ferroptosis. Of note, we analyzed the effect of sorafenib on HSC ferroptosis in advanced fibrotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma receiving sorafenib monotherapy. Attractively, BRD7 upregulation, p53 mitochondrial translocation, combination of SLC25A28 and p53, and ferroptosis induction occurred in primary human HSCs. Overall, these findings reveal novel signal transduction and regulatory mechanism of ferroptosis, and also suggest BRD7-P53-SLC25A28 axis as potential targets for liver fibrosis.
