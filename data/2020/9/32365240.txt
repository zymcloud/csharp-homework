The use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is associated with a risk of renal dysfunction. We investigated whether TDF is associated with the deterioration of renal function in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) requiring frequent computed tomography (CT) evaluations and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) sessions, when compared to entecavir (ETV). Between 2007 and 2017, 493 patients with HBV-related HCC were enrolled. The number of CT evaluations and TACE sessions were collected through 3 years of follow-up. The median age of the study population (373 men and 120 women; 325 with ETV and 168 with TDF) was 56.5 years. TDF was significantly associated with a serum creatinine increase (≥25% from the baseline; unadjusted hazard ratio [uHR] = 1.620) and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reduction ( .05). After adjustment, TDF use was independently associated with the increased risk of eGFR reduction (adjusted HR [aHR] = 1.945; P = .023), whereas CT evaluation ≥4 times/year was independently associated with the increased risk of serum creatinine increase (aHR = 2.898), eGFR reduction (aHR = 3.484) and CKD progression (aHR = 1.984) (all P
