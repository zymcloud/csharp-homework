Background:Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is extensively used in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the efficacy of TACE is usually limited to secondary tumor hypoxia and hypoxia-related tumor angiogenesis.Methods:In this study, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres (SOR-CAT-PLGA MSs) encapsulating sorafenib (SOR) and catalase (CAT) were prepared by double-emulsion solvent diffusion method. Sorafenib inhibits tumor angiogenesis, and catalase decomposes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to generate oxygen in the tumor.Results:In vitro and in vivo, SOR -CAT-PLGA MSs could significantly improve the efficacy of hepatic artery embolization in the treatment of rabbit VX2 liver tumors, regulate tumor hypoxia and immunosuppressive microenvironment, then achieved near-complete and rapid necrosis of liver tumors.Conclusions:The application of new SOR -CAT-PLGA MSs in hepatic artery chemoembolization of rabbit VX2 liver tumor is a promising approach to improve the therapeutic effect of liver tumors and has a broad clinical application prospect.
