Hepatocellular adenomas (HA) are rare benign liver tumors known to affect mainly women of reproductive age taking oral contraception. They can be complicated by hemorrhage or malignant transformation to hepatocellular carcinoma, especially when the size of the lesion exceeds 5 cm. Magnetic resonance imaging is the most specific tool for the non-invasive characterization of HA. The discovery of mutations underlying different specific HA phenotypes has allowed the establishment of a molecular classification that modified the management of this pathology.
