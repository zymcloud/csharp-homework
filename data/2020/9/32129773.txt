Objectives:Our goal was to evaluate the effect of antiviral therapy on hepatocellular carcinoma incidence for cirrhotic patients with lower hepatitis B virus DNA levels.Methods:Consecutive cirrhosis patients from a US cohort (n = 381) and 408 patients from a Taiwan cohort were enrolled. Patients were classified into a low (Results:Except for hepatitis B e antigen, baseline characteristics were similar for both hepatitis B virus DNA groups. Antiviral therapy significantly reduced hepatocellular carcinoma incidence in cirrhotic patients with hepatitis B virus DNA â‰¥20 IU/ml at 5-years (12.2% vs. 22.8%) and 10-years (23.3% vs. 37.2%) (P = 0.0018). For cirrhotic patients with hepatitis B virus DNA Conclusion:Antiviral therapy was associated with a 57% reduction in hepatocellular carcinoma incidence in chronic hepatitis B patients with cirrhosis and hepatitis B virus DNA as low as 20 IU/ml (but no lower). However, hepatocellular carcinoma incidence remained substantial, regardless of hepatitis B virus DNA levels and treatment status, highlighting the need for ongoing hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance for all cirrhotic hepatitis B virus patients.
