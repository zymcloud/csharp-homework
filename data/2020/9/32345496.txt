Introduction:Although hepatectomy is the mainstay of curative therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), post-operative complications remain high. Presently there is conflicting data on the impact of morbidity on oncologic outcomes. We sought to identify predictors for the occurrence of post-hepatectomy complications, as well as to analyse the impact on overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS).Materials and methods:We performed a retrospective review of 888 patients who underwent resection for HCC from 2001 to 2016 in our institution.Results:A total of 237 patients (26.7%) developed 254 complications of Clavien-Dindo Grade â‰¥2. Hepatitis B (p = 0.0397), elevated ASA score (p = 0.0002), higher platelet counts (p = 0.0277), raised pre-operative APRI scores (p = 0.0105) and bloodloss (p Conclusion:Post-operative morbidity affected both short-term and OS outcomes after hepatectomy for HCC. Hepatitis B, higher ASA scores, elevated preoperative APRI and increased blood loss were found to predict a higher likelihood of developing complications. This may potentially be mitigated by careful patient selection and adopting strict measures to minimise intraoperative bleeding.
