Background:Liver transplantation (LTX)is a lifesaving- effective protocol for patients suffering end stage liver disease (ESLD) and its complications post HCV infection. Recurrence of disease is a frequent clinical complication that is observed in patients undergoing LTX. Cytokines play a central role in the immunological events occurring after the surgery.Methods:Using Allelic Discrimination PCR, the allelic variation G174C of IL-6 gene was investigated. The abundance of IL6- mRNA and plasma IL6 cytokine levels were evaluated by using qRT-PCR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) respectively in 76 liver transplant recipients recruited from Al Sahel teaching hospital, Ministry of Health and Population Cairo Egypt within the period between June 2015 and October 2017.Results:The frequencies of IL-6 GG genotype and the G allele were significantly detected more in LTX recipients who experienced HCV recurrence versus those who did not suffer recurrence when compared to healthy controls (P = 0.001) and (P = 0.006), respectively. On the contrary, levels of IL-6 related transcripts in PBMC's of recurrent patients were indifferent from non-recurrent patients and healthy controls (P â‰¥ 0.124). Interestingly, the circulating IL-6 protein in plasma was significantly elevated in recurrent as compared to the non-recurrent recipients (P = 0.002).Conclusion:HCV recurrence post liver transplantation occur more frequently in patients with -174 G/G IL-6 genotype and elevated plasma IL-6 levels.
