Numerous studies have suggested that dysregulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) contributed to the development and progression of many cancers. lncRNA OIP5 antisense RNA 1 (OIP5-AS1) has been reported to be increased in several cancers. However, the roles of OIP5-AS1 in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) remain to be investigated. In this study, we demonstrated that OIP5-AS1 was upregulated in LIHC tissue specimens and its overexpression was associated with the poor survival of patients with LIHC. Furthermore, loss-of function experiments indicated that OIP5-AS1 promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, binding sites between OIP5-AS1 and hsa-miR-26a-3p as well as between hsa-miR-26a-3p and EPHA2 were confirmed by luciferase assays. Finally, a rescue assay was performed to prove the effect of the OIP5-AS1/hsa-miR-26a-3p/EPHA2 axis on LIHC cell biological behaviors. Based on all of the above findings, our results suggested that OIP5-AS1 promoted LIHC cell proliferation and invasion via regulating the hsa-miR-26a-3p/EPHA2 axis.
