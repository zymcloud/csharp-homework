Interstitial Ultrasound-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (USgHIFU) therapy has the potential to deliver ablative treatments which conform to the target tumor. In this study, a robot-assisted US-navigation platform has been developed for 3D US guidance and planning of conformal HIFU ablations. The platform was used to evaluate a conformal therapeutic strategy associated with an interstitial dual-mode USgHIFU catheter prototype (64 elements linear-array, measured central frequency f = 6.5 MHz), developed for the treatment of HepatoCellular Carcinoma (HCC). The platform included a 3D navigation environment communicating in real-time with an open research dual-mode US scanner/HIFU generator and a robotic arm, on which the USgHIFU catheter was mounted. 3D US-navigation was evaluated in vitro for guiding and planning conformal HIFU ablations using a tumor-mimic model in porcine liver. Tumor-mimic volumes were then used as targets for evaluating conformal HIFU treatment planning in simulation. Height tumor-mimics (ovoid- or disc-shaped, sizes: 3-29 cm3) were created and visualized in liver using interstitial 2D US imaging. Robot-assisted spatial manipulation of these images and real-time 3D navigation allowed reconstructions of 3D B-mode US images for accurate tumor-mimic volume estimation (relative error: 4 ± 5%). Sectorial and full-revolution HIFU scanning (angular sectors: 88-360°) could both result in conformal ablations of the tumor volumes, as soon as their radii remained ≤ 24 mm. The presented US navigation-guided HIFU procedure demonstrated advantages for developing conformal interstitial therapies in standard operative rooms. Moreover, the modularity of the developed platform makes it potentially useful for developing other HIFU approaches.
