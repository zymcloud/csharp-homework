Aim:This study aimed to investigate the predictive power of the combination of Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII) and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade in prognosis outcomes of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after thermal ablation.Materials and methods:This retrospective study was reviewed and approved by our institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. According to the Milan criteria, a total of 405 treatment-na√Øve patients with clinicopathologically confirmed HCC were enrolled who subsequently underwent thermal ablation from 2011 to 2016. The outcomes of overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were statistically analyzed.Results:The median follow-up time of this study was 45.1 months (range, 1.3-83.2 months). After thermal ablation in patients with SII-ALBI Grades 1, 2, and 3, the cumulative 5-year OS rates were 81.7%, 63.2%, and 26.9%; the 5-year CSS rates were 82.4%, 67.5%, and 26.9%; and the 5-year RFS rates were 49.3%, 44.6%, and 25.3%, respectively (all P Conclusion:Elevated preablation SII-ALBI is associated with shorter OS, CSS, and RFS in patients with early-stage HCC. Our indicator showed the potential to be a supplement tool for patients with negative AFP during follow-up.
