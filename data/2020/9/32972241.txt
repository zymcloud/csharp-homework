This study aimed to investigate the impact of ginger extract (GE) loaded into chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) in enhancing cytotoxicity and reducing cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin (DXN) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) induced mice. DXN and GE were loaded into CNPs and cytotoxicity of loaded and unloaded drugs against HepG2 cells was evaluated. HCC was induced in male albino mice by injection of diethylnitrosamine (DINA). Mice were divided into eight groups (n = 15): (1) normal control, (2) DINA, (3) CNPs, (4) free DXN, (5) CNPs DXN, (6) free GE, (7) CNPs GE, and (8) CNPs DXN + CNPs GE. Both GE and DXN loaded into CNPs showed a greater decline in cell viability of HepG2 cells than the unloaded forms. GE CNPs displayed pronounced anticancer activity In Vivo through apoptosis, greater down-regulation of multidrug resistance 1, enhancement of anti-oxidant activity and depletion of vascular endothelial growth factor content in liver tissues. GE CNPs in combination with DXN CNPs showed nearly normal hepatic lobule architecture and the greatest increase in apoptotic cell count. Co-treatment group had decreased cardiac malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-Î± and serum activity of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. Combination of GE CNPs and DXN CNPs might be a potentially effective therapeutic approach for HCC.
