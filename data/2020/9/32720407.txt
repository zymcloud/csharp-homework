Background and aims:Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) has been repeatedly shown as an effective method of controlling acute hemorrhage. Arterial access for TAE in the emergent setting is typically trans-femoral, though other routes are routinely used. The presence of abnormal vasculature such as an aortic dissection increases the difficulty of TAE.Case report:This report details a case of acute hemorrhage likely from a ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma in which the celiac artery originated from the false lumen of a type B aortic dissection.Conclusion:The false lumen was catheterized via left radial artery access and the bleeding hepatic arterial branch was successfully embolized.
