Background and aims:Outcomes of persons with chronic HBV infection in the era of antiviral therapy are not well characterized. We determined the incidence and factors associated with clinical outcomes in a multiethnic, North American cohort of adults with chronic HBV infection, who were not on antiviral therapy at enrollment.Methods:Adults with chronic HBV infection, not receiving antiviral therapy, and without a history of decompensation, HCC or OLT were prospectively followed. Participants with known HIV, HCV or HDV coinfection were excluded. During follow-up, treatment could be initiated per standard of care. Clinical outcomes included: incident cirrhosis, decompensation, HCC, OLT and HBV-related death.Results:Among 1418 participants analyzed, 51.5% were women, median age 41.1 years, 75% Asian, 10% white, 13% black, 24% HBeAg(+), and 1.5% cirrhosis at baseline. During the study, 274 started treatment, 83 had an ALT flare, 118/330 initially HBeAg(+) became HBeAg(-), and 90/1329 became HBsAg(-). After 6641 person-years follow-up, 8 participants (4/21 with baseline cirrhosis) had 12 clinical outcomes (2 decompensation, 5 HCC, 2 OLT, 3 HBV-related deaths) and 19/1397 had incident cirrhosis. 21/26 participants had first outcome before treatment, none had become HBsAg(-) while 5/9 HBeAg(+) had become HBeAg(-) at time of first outcome. Cumulative percentage of clinical outcomes was 16% at year 4 in participants with baseline cirrhosis, and 2% (including incident cirrhosis) at year 7 in those without.Conclusions:Incidence of adverse outcomes was low in this closely monitored large cohort of North American adults with predominantly inactive, non-cirrhotic chronic HBV. Our data highlight the benefits of HBsAg loss and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment to prevent cirrhosis and other complications of chronic HBV infection.
