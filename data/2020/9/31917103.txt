Background:Few studies have assessed the relationship between serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and yttrium-90 (Y-90) radioembolization response in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The objective of the study was to evaluate whether peri-procedural serum AFP was correlated with Y-90 therapy response in HCC.Methods:Patients undergoing Y-90 radioembolization with glass microspheres (TheraSphereâ„¢) for HCC between 2006 and 2013 at a single center were evaluated. The relationship between AFP and 6-month radiographic improvement (complete or partial response by modified RECIST criteria), overall (OS), and disease-specific survival (DSS) were analyzed.Results:Seventy-four patients underwent a total of 124 Y-90 infusions. Median age was 65 years, median AFP was 37 ng/mL (range: 2-112,593 ng/mL) and median model for end-stage liver disease score was 6.2 (range:1.8-11.2). Increased AFP was not associated with radiographic improvement (odds ratio (OR) = 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.75-1.30, p = 0.92). Median OS was 15.2 months and was increased in patients with low AFP compared to high AFP (30.8 months vs. 7.8 months, p Conclusion:Pre-infusion AFP independently predicted survival after Y-90 treatment for HCC, but not radiographic response, and can help guide treatment decisions.
