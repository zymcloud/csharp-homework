An accurate preoperative evaluation of the hepatic function and application of portal vein embolization in selected patients have helped improve the safety of major hepatectomy. In planning major hepatectomy, however, several issues remain to be addressed. The first is which cut-off values for serum total bilirubin level and prothrombin time should be used to define post-hepatectomy liver failure. Other issues include what minimum future liver remnant (FLR) volume is required; whether the total liver volume measured using computed tomography or the standard liver volume calculated based on the body surface area should be used to assess the adequacy of the FLR volume; whether there is a discrepancy between the FLR volume and function during the recovery period after portal vein embolization or hepatectomy; and how best the function of a specific FLR can be assessed. Various studies concerning these issues have been reported with controversial results. We should also be aware that different strategies and management are required for different types of liver damage, such as cirrhosis in hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangitis in biliary tract cancer, and chemotherapy-induced hepatic injury.
