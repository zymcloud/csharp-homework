Introduction and objectives:About 250 million people around the world are chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Those people are at risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. The HBV genome is organized as a minichromosome in the infected hepatocyte and is associated with histones and non-histone proteins. In recent years, many groups have investigated the transcriptional regulation of HBV mediated by post-translational modifications on the histones associated with the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Our aim is to investigate the role of the histone variant H3.3.Materials and methods:An in vitro HBV replication model system based on the transfection of linear HBV genome monomeric molecules was used. We then either ectopically expressed or reduced the levels of H3.3, and of its histone chaperone HIRA. Viral intermediates were quantified and the level of H3K4me3 using Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was measured.Results:Histone variant H3.3 ectopically expressed in cells assembles into the viral cccDNA, correlating with increasing levels of the active histone mark H3K4me3 and HBV transcription. The opposite results were found upon diminishing H3.3 levels. Furthermore, the assembly of H3.3 into the cccDNA is dependent on the histone chaperone HIRA. Diminishing HIRA levels causes a reduction in the HBV intermediates.Conclusions:Histone variant H3.3 positively regulates HBV transcription. Importantly, the characterization of the viral chromatin dynamics might allow the discovery of new therapeutic targets to develop drugs for the treatment of chronically-infected HBV patients.
