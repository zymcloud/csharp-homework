Purpose:To evaluate the effects of hepatic artery embolization (HAE) on the expression of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) in an orthotopic rat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) model.Materials and methods:A rat HCC model was established in Sprague-Dawley rats with the RH7777 cell line. Six animals each were assigned to receive HAE or sham treatment. Liver tissues were harvested 24 h after the procedure. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to compare expression of PD-L1 and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α in the intratumoral and peritumoral regions and normal liver tissue. In vitro cell culture study was performed for 24 h under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and protein expression of PD-L1 and HIF-1α and the effects of HIF-1α inhibitors were assessed.Results:IHC showed that PD-L1- and HIF-1α-positive areas were significantly larger in the HAE group vs the sham group in intratumoral (P = .006 and P 2 = 0.551; P < .001). In vitro cell culture study revealed that protein expression of PD-L1 and HIF-1α were significantly higher when cells were incubated under hypoxic vs normoxic conditions (P = .028 and P = .010, respectively). PD-L1 expression was suppressed significantly when the HIF-1α inhibitor rapamycin was added to the culture medium (P = .024).Conclusions:HAE enhances intratumoral and peritumoral PD-L1 expression in a rat HCC model. The HIF-1α pathway is a possible mechanism underlying increased intratumoral PD-L1 expression after HAE.
