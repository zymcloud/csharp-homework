There are >1.5 billion people with chronic liver disease worldwide, causing liver diseases to be a significant global health issue. Diffuse parenchymal liver diseases, including hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, metabolic diseases, and hepatitis cause chronic liver injury and may progress to fibrosis and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. As early diagnosis and treatment of these diseases impact the progression and outcome, the need for assessment of the liver parenchyma has increased. While the current gold standard for evaluation of the hepatic parenchymal tissue, biopsy has disadvantages and limitations. Consequently, noninvasive methods have been developed based on serum biomarkers and imaging techniques. Conventional imaging modalities such as ultrasound, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging provide noninvasive options for assessment of liver tissue. However, several recent advances in liver imaging techniques have been introduced. This review article focuses on the current status of imaging methods for diffuse parenchymal liver diseases assessment including their diagnostic accuracy, advantages and disadvantages, and comparison between different techniques.
