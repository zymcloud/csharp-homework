Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption exacerbates diffuse axonal injury (DAI), but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Inactivation or deletion of erythropoietin-producing hepatoma (EPH) receptor A2 (EphA2) attenuated BBB damage and promoted tight junction formation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of EphA2 in the protection of BBB integrity and the relevant mechanisms involved in a rat model of DAI. Blocking activation of the EphA receptor by EphA2-Fc ameliorated axonal injury, cell apoptosis, and glial activation, protected BBB integrity and increased expression of the tight junction-associated proteins ZO-1, claudin-5 and occludin-1. In vitro BBB models established by human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) were subjected to oxygen deprivation (OGD). Treatment with EphrinA1, which activates EphA2, exacerbated the OGD-induced destruction of permeability and integrity of the BBB models by reducing the expression of tight junction-associated proteins. However, inhibition of Rho-associated coiled coil-containing protein kinases 1 and 2 (ROCK1 and 2) abrogated all of the effects of EphrinA1 on the BBB models in vitro. In conclusion, we provide evidence that EphA2 plays an important role in the destruction of BBB integrity by decreasing the expression of tight junction proteins through the ROCK pathway.
