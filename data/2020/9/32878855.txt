A 62-year-old man with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma presented with ST elevation myocardial infarction had received one dose of nivolumab 3 weeks prior. Cardiac catheterisation was negative for obstructive coronary artery disease. He was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit due to ventricular arrhythmias and markedly elevated troponin T levels. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed severely depressed left ventricular ejection fraction of 18% (normal 55%-70%) with mid and apical ballooning consistent with takotsubo syndrome (TTS). Intravenous glucocorticoids were administered due to suspicion for superimposed myocarditis. Cardiac MRI 3 days later showed mid-myocardial and subepicardial delayed enhancement in the inferior and lateral walls as well as apex indicative of myopericarditis. He clinically improved on steroids and was discharged with outpatient follow-up. This case highlights major cardiac complications that may arise with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. In addition, it emphasises the importance of assessing for concomitant myocarditis even when initial imaging suggests TTS.
