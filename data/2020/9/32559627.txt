Hydrazinocurcumin (HZC), a curcumin analogue, serves as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer and lung cancer. In this study, we investigate the role and mechanism of HZC in regulating HepG2 cell apoptosis and tumorigenicity, and its synergistic effects with 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu). HepG2 cells were treated with HZC and/or 5-Fu to analyze the possible synergistic effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle distribution in vitro using EdU staining, Hoechst staining and flow cytometry, respectively. For mechanistic investigation we used pic, a phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) inhibitor, and in other studies assessed the expression pattern of PTEN and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway-related genes. Additionally, we tested in vivo effects of HZC and 5-Fu treatment on growth of HepG2 cell tumors in nude mice. We found that HZC or 5-Fu induced apoptosis and repressed proliferation of HepG2 cells by upregulating the expression of PTEN and disrupting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway activation. Moreover, HZC had a higher pro-apoptotic effect than 5-Fu. HZC and 5-Fu induced HepG2 cell apoptosis and inhibited their tumorigenicity in vivo. Inhibition of PTEN expression activated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and reversed the protective effects of HZC or 5-Fu. Thus, HZC and 5-Fu increase PTEN, which blocks the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, ultimately inducing HepG2 cell apoptosis. Importantly, the synergistic combination of HZC and 5-Fu may present promising strategy for the treatment of HCC.
