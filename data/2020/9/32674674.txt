Picrosirius red (PSR) staining is generally used to evaluate liver fibrosis; however, PSR sometimes causes nonspecific nuclear staining. In this study, we evaluated the ability of phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) pretreatment to prevent nonspecific nuclear staining by PSR. In a manual evaluation of 27 non-tumor samples from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, nonspecific nuclear staining was observed in 3.7% of PMA-treated specimens, compared with 85.2% of untreated specimens. Conversely, computer-assisted image analysis (CAIA) identified nonspecific nuclear staining in 0% of PMA-treated samples, vs 44.4% of untreated samples. Surprisingly, after mounting, PMA-treated specimens exhibited a blue tinge because of molybdenum blue (MB) production following sunlight exposure or virtual slide scanning. Using UV cut film, MB production induced by sunlight exposure was prevented; however, the film did not prevent MB production during virtual slide scanning. Moreover, only blue light-emitting diode exposure resulted in a blue tinge in PMA solution. Our data indicated that PMA pretreatment is effective for evaluating liver fibrosis using CAIA. Meanwhile, improvements in virtual slide scanning protocols would directly improve the quality of PMA-pretreated specimens subjected to CAIA.
