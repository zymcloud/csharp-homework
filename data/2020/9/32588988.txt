Background:Dishevelled (DVL) family members are crucial to Wnt-induced signaling transduction, and their expression is highly correlated with the progression of multiple malignant cancers. However, the expression profiles and exact prognostic values of DVLs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been explored until now.Methods:The expression of DVL isoforms was assessed using the Oncomine, HCCDB and UALCAN databases. The prognostic roles of DVLs were further evaluated using the GEPIA database. The relationship between the expression of DVLs and immune infiltration of HCC was investigated using the Timer and ImmuCellAI tools. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were built and enrichment analyses were conducted.Results:We found that the expression levels of DVL2 (OMIM accession number: 602151) and DVL3 (OMIM accession number: 601368) were upregulated in HCC tissues as revealed by the Oncomine and HCCDB databases. Additionally, the expression of DVLs tended to be associated with advanced clinical features in the UALCAN database. Prognostic analysis revealed that the expression levels of DVL1 (OMIM accession number: 601365) and DVL3 were remarkably associated with a poor prognosis in HCC patients. The results also revealed that the DVL expression level was correlated with the infiltration levels of multiple immune cells. By constructing the PPI network and enrichment analyses, the DVL1-3 gene was identified to interact with 20 key genes and participate in several pathways.Conclusion:In summary, DVL2 and DVL3 are highly expressed in HCC, and DVL1 and DVL3 are related to a poor prognosis, which might be used as candidate targets for targeted therapy and reliable prognostic biomarkers in HCC.
