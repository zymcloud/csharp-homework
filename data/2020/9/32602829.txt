Appropriate imaging is imperative in evaluating children with a primary hepatic malignancy such as hepatoblastoma or hepatocellular carcinoma. For use in the adult patient population, the American College of Radiology created the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) to provide consistent terminology and to improve imaging interpretation. At present, no similar consensus exists to guide imaging and interpretation of pediatric patients at risk for developing a liver neoplasm or how best to evaluate a pediatric patient with a known liver neoplasm. Therefore, a new Pediatric Working Group within American College of Radiology LI-RADS was created to provide consensus for imaging recommendations and interpretation of pediatric liver neoplasms. The article was drafted based on the most up-to-date existing information as interpreted by imaging experts comprising the Pediatric LI-RADS Working Group. Guidance is provided regarding appropriate imaging modalities and protocols, as well as imaging interpretation and reporting, with the goals to improve imaging quality, to decrease image interpretation errors, to enhance communication with referrers, and to advance patient care. An expanded version of this document that includes broader background information on pediatric hepatocellular carcinoma and rationale for recommendations can be found in Appendix E1 (online).
