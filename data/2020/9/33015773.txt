Objective:The purpose of this paper was to explore roles and significance of transcriptional repressor GATA binding 1 (TRPS1) in the process of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and clinicopathological parameters of HCC patients, respectively.Patients and methods:The expression of TRPS1 was detected by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. Chi-square test was used to investigate the association between TRPS1 and clinicopathological parameters of HCC patients. SiRNA was designed to suppress the expression of TRPS1. Moreover, transwell assay and cell cycle analysis were adopted to determine the invasion ability and proliferation ability of HCC cells.Results:It was demonstrated that TRPS1 was abnormally over-expressed in HCC tissues and cells, and was closely associated with the vascular invasion, tumor size, and TNM stage of HCC patients. Besides, the results indicated that the inhibition of TRPS1 in HCC cells could impede the cell invasion ability and proliferation ability.Conclusions:TRPS1 plays a key role in the development of HCC and is closely associated with the clinicopathological parameters of HCC patients. Hence, it is proposed that TRPS1 may serve as a novel prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment.
