Background:Genetic variants of IFNL4 and PDCD1 genes have been shown to influence the spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We investigated the IFNL4 rs12979860 and the PDCD1 polymorphisms in 734 HCV-positive patients, including 461 cases with liver disease of varying severity and 273 patients with lymphoproliferative disorders to determine association of these genes with patient's outcome.Methods:Expression levels of PDCD1 mRNA encoded by haplotypes were investigated by quantitative PCR in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Flow cytometry was used to detect PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1.Results:The frequency of IFNL4 rs12979860 C/T or T/T genotypes was significantly higher in patients with HCV-related diseases than blood donors (PConclusion:Collectively, our data indicate an important contribution of IFNÎ»4 expression to the development of HCV-related HCC and an epistatic contribution of IFNL4 and PDCD1 in MC.
