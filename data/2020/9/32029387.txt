Primary hepatic malignancies in non-cirrhotic liver include a wide spectrum of tumors, which are classified based on their cells of origin. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary malignant tumor, followed by intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Beside these tumors, other primary malignancies in the non-cirrhotic liver are quite rare. Accurate diagnosis is often difficult with imaging alone and biopsy with further histopathological analysis is often necessary. However, many of these tumors exhibit suggestive or characteristic imaging features due to their different cellular components, allowing radiologists to suggest the correct diagnosis. Thus, the aim of this article is to provide an overview of imaging presentation of primary malignant liver tumors that develop in the non-cirrhotic liver, including potential differential diagnoses. Such knowledge is essential as it may contribute to accurate radiological diagnosis and improved patient outcome.
