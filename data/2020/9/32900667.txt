Background and aim:Behavior of HCC that developed after DAAs therapy for HCV infection is still debated. In this study we aim to compare characteristics and pattern of de novo HCC in cirrhotic HCV patients who were treated and untreated with DAAs.Patients and methods:This study included 160 cirrhotic HCV patients presented with de novo HCC during the period of December 2017 to December 2018. Patients were divided into two groups, group A included 80 patients who received DAAs and group B included 80 patients who were not exposed to DAAs. The characteristics of HCC in both groups were compared using BCLC Staging System.Results:The size of the largest lesion was 47mm±26 in group A and 41mm±27 in group B with statistically significant difference between both groups (p=0.03). No other significant differences existed regarding number, site, or total tumor size and most of the lesions were solid in both groups. Portal vein thrombosis and extrahepatic spread detected in 16 and 11 patients in group A, while in group B the number was 17 and 9 patients respectively (p=0.83 and 0.06). No significant differences between groups in type of intervention done, BCLC staging (p=0.4), or survival.Conclusion:Although CHCV patients treated with DAAs had larger de novo HCC lesions than untreated patients, there was no difference in BCLC staging or in aggressive behavior between both groups.
