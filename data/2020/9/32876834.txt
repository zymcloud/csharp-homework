Objectives:To investigate the potential of decreasing the number of scans and associated radiation exposure involved in CT liver perfusion (CTLP) dynamic studies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) assessment.Methods:Twenty-four CTLP image datasets of patients with HCC were retrospectively analyzed. All examinations were performed on a modern CT system using a standard acquisition protocol involving 35 scans with 1.7 s interval. A deconvolution-based or a standard algorithm was employed to compute ten perfusion parametric maps. 3D ROIs were positioned on 33 confirmed HCCs and non-malignant parenchyma. Analysis was repeated for two subsampled datasets generated from the original dataset by including only the (a) 18 odd-numbered scans with 3.4 s interval and (b) 18 first scans with 1.7 s interval. Standard and modified datasets were compared regarding the (a) accuracy of calculated perfusion parameters, (b) power of parametric maps to discriminate HCCs from liver parenchyma, and (c) associated radiation exposure.Results:When the time interval between successive scans was doubled, perfusion parameters of HCCs were found unaffected (p > 0.05) and the discriminating efficiency of parametric maps was preserved (p Conclusions:Doubling the interscan time interval may considerably reduce radiation exposure from CTLP studies performed for HCC evaluation without affecting the diagnostic efficiency of perfusion maps generated with either standard or deconvolution-based mathematical model.Key points:• CT liver perfusion for HCC diagnosis/assessment is not routinely used in clinical practice mainly due to the associated high radiation exposure. • Two alternative acquisition protocols involving 18 scans of the liver were compared with the standard 35-scan protocol. • Increasing the time interval between successive scans to 3.4 s was found to preserve the accuracy of computed perfusion parameters derived with a standard or a deconvolution-based model and to reduce radiation exposure by 48.5%.
