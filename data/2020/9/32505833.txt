Chronic infection of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has long been recognized as a major risk factor in the initiation and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), contributing to over half the cases of HCC worldwide. Transformation of the liver with HBV infection to HCC mainly results from long-term interaction between HBV and the host hepatocytes via a variety of mechanisms, including HBV DNA integration, prolonged expression of the viral HBx regulatory protein and/or aberrant preS/S envelope proteins, and epigenetic dysregulation of tumor suppressor genes. While there have been several failures in the development of drugs for HCC, the immune-tolerant microenvironment of this malignancy suggests that immunotherapeutic agents could provide benefits for these patients. This is supported by recent data showing that immunotherapy has promising activity in patients with advanced HCC. In this review, we provide an overview of HBV-induced HCC and recent immune based approaches for the treatment of HCC patients.
