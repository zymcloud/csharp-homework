Application of silver nanoparticles serves as a new approach in cancer treatment due to its unique features. Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using plant is advantageous since they are easily accessible, nontoxic and produce quicker reaction compared to other methods. To evaluate the cytotoxicity, mechanism of cell death and DNA damage of biosynthesized Catharanthus roseus-silver nanoparticles on human liver cancer (HepG2) cells. The antiproliferative activity of Catharanthus roseus‑silver nanoparticles was measured using MTT assay. The cytotoxic effects were further evaluated by measuring nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The mechanism of cell death was determined by annexin-FITC/propidium iodide, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and cell cycle assays. The assessment of DNA damage was evaluated using Comet assay method. The uptake of the nanoparticles were evaluated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Catharanthus roseus‑silver nanoparticles has inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells in a time-dependent manner with a median IC50 value of 3.871 ± 0.18 μg/mL. The concentration of nitrite and ROS were significantly higher than control. The cell death was due to apoptosis associated with MMP loss, cell cycle arrest, and extensive DNA damage. TEM analysis indicated the presence of free nanoparticles and endosomes containing the nanoparticles. The findings show that Catharanthus roseus‑silver nanoparticles have produced cytotoxic effects on HepG2 cells and thus may have a potential to be used as an anticancer treatment, particularly for hepatocellular carcinoma.
