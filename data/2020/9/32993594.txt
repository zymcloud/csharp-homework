Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an inflammation-related cancer, where nonresolving inflammation contributes to its development and progression. Peripheral inflammatory cells have been shown to be associated with the prognosis of various types of cancer. The present study investigated the utility of pretreatment peripheral inflammatory cells in the prognosis of patients with HCC.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed data regarding peripheral inflammatory cell, and patient and tumor characteristics from patients with HCC who were diagnosed between November 2008 and March 2018. Baseline data, including peripheral inflammatory cell counts, were recorded before treatment. The relationships between overall survival (OS) and study variables were assessed.Results:A total of 1681 patients who were diagnosed with HCC were included. In univariate and multivariate analyses, individual neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte cell counts were found as independent indicators of poor OS. High neutrophil (≥3100 × 106/L) and, monocyte (≥470 × 106/L) counts and low lymphocyte counts (< 1640 × 106/L) significantly associated with reduced OS (p < 0.05). Neutrophil and, monocyte cell counts rose and lymphocyte counts decreased in association with advancing the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage (P < 0.001).Conclusions:Pretreatment peripheral neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes are independently associated with outcomes of patients with HCC. These cells provides a noninvasive, low-cost, easy, and reproducible biomarker that can be used in routine clinical practice to predict the prognosis of patients with HCC.
