Background:Prealbumin is a more sensitive serum biomarker in reflecting liver function and nutritional status than albumin, because of its shorter half-life and its characteristics that could hardly be affected by supplemental venous infusion of albumin or blood transfusion. This study aimed to identify whether preoperative prealbumin level was associated with postoperative mortality and morbidity after hepatic resection for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:From a Chinese multicenter database, patients who underwent hepatic resection for HCC were divided into the low and normal prealbumin groups by using 17 mg/dL as the cut-off level for serum prealbumin taken within a week before surgery. Using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses, independent predictors associated with postoperative 30-day and 90-day mortality, 30-day overall and major morbidity, and postoperative hepatic insufficiency were identified.Results:Among 1356 patients, 409 (30.2%) had a low preoperative prealbumin level. Postoperative 30-day and 90-day mortality, and 30-day overall and major morbidity in the low prealbumin group were significantly higher than the normal prealbumin group (2.9% vs. 0.5%, 5.1% vs. 1.5%, 35.7% vs. 18.4%, and 14.4% vs. 6.5%, respectively, all P Conclusions:Preoperative prealbumin level could be used to predict postoperative morbidity and mortality for patients treated with hepatic resection for HCC.
