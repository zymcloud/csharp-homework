Background:Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The primary causes of liver cancer include hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), alcohol consumption, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and other factors.Aims:The objective of this study was to evaluate the global and sex-, age-, region-, country-, and etiology-related liver cancer burden, as well as the trends in liver cancer caused by different etiologies.Methods:The causes of liver cancer from 1990 to 2017, including global, regional, and national liver cancer incidence, mortality, and etiology, were collected from the Global Burden of Disease study 2017, and the time-dependent change in the trends of liver cancer burden was evaluated by annual percentage change.Results:The global liver cancer incidence and mortality have been increasing. There were 950,000 newly-diagnosed liver cancer cases and over 800,000 deaths in 2017, which is more than twice the numbers recorded in 1990. HBV and HCV are the major causes of liver cancer. HBV is the major risk factor of liver cancer in Asia, while HCV and alcohol abuse are the major risk factors in the high sociodemographic index and high human development index regions. The mean onset age and incidence of liver cancer with different etiologies have gradually increased in the past 30 years.Conclusions:The global incidence is still rising and the causes have national, regional, or population specificities. More targeted prevention strategies must be developed for the different etiologic types in order to reduce liver cancer burden.
