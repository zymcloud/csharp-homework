Objective: To construct apoptosis-stimulating of p53 protein 2 (ASPP2) gene knockout mice using diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced liver cancer model to study the biological functions of ASPP2. Methods: The sgRNA oligonucleotides were constructed, and ASPP2 knockout mice were prepared with the CRISPR/Cas9 system. PCR and sequencing methods were used to identify the genotypes of F0 and F1 generations and their progeny. DEN was used to induce ASPP2+/- mice to establish liver cancer model. Results: PCR and sequencing results showed that ASPP2 gene was successfully knocked out in F0 generation mice. The genotype of F1 generation mice was accorded with ASPP2+/- and had obtained stable heredity. The success rate of DEN-induced liver cancer model (7/8 and 3 / 8) of ASPP2 + /-mice obtained by self-hybridization of F1 generation was significantly higher than that of wild-type mice. Conclusion: ASPP2 knockout mice were successfully constructed based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The success rate of DEN-induced liver cancer model of ASPP2 knockout mice was significantly higher than that of the wild-type mice.
