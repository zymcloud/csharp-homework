Allogeneic-HCT (allo-HCT), while potentially curative, can result in significant complications including graft versus host disease (GVHD). Prior studies suggest that metabolic syndrome may be one risk factor for GVHD. We hypothesized that hepatic steatosis on pre-HCT computed tomography (CT) scans may be a marker for development of GVHD and poor outcomes in allo-HCT. In this retrospective study, we reviewed the pre-HCT CT scans and transplant outcome data of patients who underwent allo-HCT at Duke University Medical Center from 2009 to 2017. The presence of steatosis was confirmed using CT attenuation measurements. We then assessed the association between pre-HCT hepatic steatosis and HCT-related outcomes including GVHD. 80 patients who had pre-HCT CT scans were included in the study. Pre-transplant hepatic steatosis was associated with the development of chronic GVHD (OR 4.2, p = 0.02), but was not associated with acute GVHD (OR 1.3, p = 0.7), non-relapse mortality (p = 0.81) or overall survival (p = 0.74). Based on this single center retrospective study, pre-transplant hepatic steatosis is associated with development of chronic GVHD. Further, prospective study with other imaging modalities including non-contrasted CT scans is needed to determine if this association is reproducible.
