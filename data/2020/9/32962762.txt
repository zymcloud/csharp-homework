Recently, radiomic texture quantification of tumors has received much attention from radiologists, scientists, and stakeholders because several results have shown the feasibility of using the technique to diagnose and manage oncological conditions. In patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, radiomics has been applied in all stages of tumor evaluation, including diagnosis and characterization of the genotypic behavior of the tumor, monitoring of treatment responses and prediction of various clinical endpoints. It is also useful in selecting suitable candidates for specific treatment strategies. However, the clinical validation of hepatocellular carcinoma radiomics is limited by challenges in imaging protocol and data acquisition parameters, challenges in segmentation techniques, dimensionality reduction, and modeling methods. Identification of the best segmentation and optimal modeling methods, as well as texture features most stable to imaging protocol variability would go a long way in harmonizing HCC radiomics for personalized patient care. This article reviews the process of HCC radiomics, its clinical applications, associated challenges, and current optimization strategies.
