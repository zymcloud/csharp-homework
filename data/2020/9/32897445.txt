Background/aims:Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography (TE) has shown promising results for prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatic decompensation in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). However, whether prognostic performance of TE differs according to etiology or type of outcome remains further clarification.Methods:Performance of LSM for the prediction of HCC and hepatic decompensation was analyzed in a cohort of 4026 patients with asymptomatic CLD.Results:During median 4.5 years of follow-up (range 3.0-6.2 years), liver-related events (LRE) were observed in 196 patients (166 with HCC, 45 with hepatic decompensation, and 15 with both). In the multivariate analysis, LSM was independent factor associated with LRE and showed high AUROC (0.78). When stratified by type of outcome and etiology of liver disease, LSM showed high AUROC for the prediction of HCC for patients with non-viral hepatitis (0.89), while it showed relatively low AUROC for the prediction of HCC for patients with viral hepatitis (0.75). For the prediction of hepatic decompensation, LSM showed high AUROC for patients with both viral- and non-viral hepatitis (0.90, 0.90, respectively).Conclusions:LSM showed powerful prognostic role for the prediction of LRE in patients with CLD. Notably, HCC risk was not negligible in patients with viral hepatitis who showed LSM value
