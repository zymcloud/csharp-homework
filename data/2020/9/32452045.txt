In the present study, we investigated whether the immortalized chicken hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, leghorn male hepatoma (LMH), had a comparable aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) response to primary chicken embryonic hepatocytes (CEHs) when used in a well-established assay for chemical screening and prioritization. The LMH cells were grown as 2-dimensional (2D) confluent cells and 3D spheroids to determine the optimal cell culture states for chemical screening. Cytochrome P450 1A4 and 1A5 (CYP1A) activity and gene expression were compared between CEHs and LMH cells grown in 2 culture states following exposure to the dioxin-like compound 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-126). The CYP1A activity was measured using the ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay, and changes in mRNA expression associated with the AhR pathway were determined using a custom-designed polymerase chain reaction array. Among LMH cell culture states (i.e., 2D vs 3D), EROD induction was observed only in 3D LMH spheroids. Similarly, 3D spheroids had the greatest number of changes in AhR-related genes compared with confluent cells. Overall, these results suggest that LMH cells grown as 3D spheroids have a metabolic and gene expression profile that is comparable to that of CEH, and may represent a suitable animal-free alternative for in vitro screening of chemicals.
