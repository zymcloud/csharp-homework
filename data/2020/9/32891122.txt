Background:Excision Repair Cross-Complementation group 6-like (ERCC6L) has been shown to exhibit carcinogenic effect in several malignant tumors. However, the function and molecular mechanism of the ERCC6L in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been investigated extensively.Methods:Immunohistochemistry analyses were used to detect ERCC6L expression in a HCC tissue microarray, and the Chi-square test was used to assess the correlation between ERCC6L expression and patients' clinicopathological features. shRNA was used to down-regulation ERCC6L expression in HCC cell lines. MTT assay, plate clone formation assay, flow cytometry, caspase 3/7 activity and migration assays were performed to evaluate the impact of ERCC6L on HCC cells in vitro. Nude mice xenograft models were used to assess the role of ERCC6L in vivo. The regulatory of mechanism of PI3K/AKT pathway was evaluated by western blotting.Results:ERCC6L was highly expressed in HCC tissue compared with tumor adjacent tissues in 90 paired samples. ERCC6L expression positively correlated with gender, tumor encapsulation, and pathological stage. Patients with low ERCC6L expression had significantly longer OS than those with high ERCC6L expression. Knockdown of ERCC6L expression significantly inhibited proliferation, invasion and metastasis in vitro and tumor growth in vivo, and it promoted cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Mechanistic analyses revealed that PI3K/AKT and NF-ÎºB signaling pathway were inhibited by silencing ERCC6L.Conclusion:These results demonstrate that ERCC6L plays a critical role in HCC progression, and thereby might be a potential therapeutic target for HCC patients.
