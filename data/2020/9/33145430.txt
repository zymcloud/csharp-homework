Aim of the study:Hepatotropic viruses cause metabolic disturbances such as insulin resistance and hepatosteatosis. Moreover, metabolic factors, such as insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, increase the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with virus-related liver cirrhosis. Cytokines secreted by the adipose tissue (adipokines) may be implicated in these metabolic disturbances, but there is little evidence regarding the role of adipokines in virus-related cirrhosis and HCC. Thus, we studied whether serum concentrations of selected adipokines were altered in patients with virus-related liver cirrhosis, including patients with HCC.Material and methods:We included 43 patients with liver cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C. Of these patients, 36 had HCC and 7 did not have any malignant lesions. In addition to routine clinical and laboratory variables, we analyzed serum concentrations of betatrophin, insulin, vaspin, visfatin, and irisin.Results:Compared with healthy controls, patients with HCC had significantly increased vaspin concentrations and significantly reduced irisin concentrations. Compared with controls, patients with virus-related cirrhosis, with or without HCC, had significantly increased concentrations of insulin and betatrophin. The serum visfatin concentration was non-significantly higher in patients with virus-related cirrhosis than in controls. None of the studied adipokines was a significant predictor of HCC. Serum concentrations of the studied adipokines were not related to cirrhosis severity or HCC stage.Conclusions:Metabolic parameters, including serum adipokine concentrations, are altered in patients with virus-related liver cirrhosis. Adipokines might be related to the HCC risk in these patients.
