Background and aims:Since there is a shortage of liver donors, we investigated recurrence patterns and outcomes after liver resection (LR) to determine the feasibility of salvage liver transplantation (SLT).Methods:We analyzed 468 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within the Milan criteria (MC) who were mainly associated with Hepatitis B virus infection (76.3%) and had undergone curative LR as an initial treatment.Results:The overall survival (OS) rates were 86.6% and 67.4% at 5 and 10 years after LR, respectively. During a median follow-up of 59 months, 211 patients experienced recurrences including 175 (37.4%) within MC and 36 (7.7%) beyond MC. Survival was lowest in patients with beyond MC-recurrence followed by within MC- and no-recurrence groups (26.5%, 86.6%, and 94.7% at 5 years, respectively, PConclusion:Curative LR achieved a 5-year survival of>85% in patients with transplantable HCC, but early SLT after recurrence within MC is advocated because of poor survival and high risk of progression thereafter. Further, prophylactic LT could be considered for those with high risk of recurrence.
