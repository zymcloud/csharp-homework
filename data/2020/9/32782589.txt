Endothelial progenitor cell (EPC)-induced angiogenesis activity is enhanced in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the contributing factors remain unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the factors influencing the number of EPCs and circulating progenitor cells (CPCs), as well as the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) and CD34, in patients with HCC. The expression levels of VEGFR-2 and CD34 were assessed in 72 HCC tumor and matched adjacent tissue microarrays by immunohistochemistry. The associations between VEGFR-2 or CD34 expression in tumors, clinicopathological characteristics and overall survival rates were analyzed. The number of EPCs and CPCs were analyzed in the peripheral blood of patients with HCC. In this study, high expression levels of VEGFR-2 and CD34 were detected in the tumor tissues of 41 (56.9%) and 44 (61.1%) patients, respectively. VEGFR-2 expression was significantly associated with tumor size (P
