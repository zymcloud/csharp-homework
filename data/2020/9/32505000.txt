Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal human malignancies. Chemotherapeutic agents, such as sorafenib and lenvatinib, can improve the outcomes of HCC patients. Nevertheless, chemoresistance has become a major hurdle in the effective treatment of HCC. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including mircoRNAs (miRNAs), long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), have been demonstrated to participate in the onset and progression of HCC. Moreover, multiple lines of evidence have indicated that ncRNAs also play a pivotal role in HCC drug resistance. ncRNAs can regulate drug efflux and metabolism, glucose metabolism, cellular death pathways, and malignant characteristics in HCC. A deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for ncRNA-mediated drug resistance in HCC will provide new opportunities for improving the treatment of HCC. In this review, we summarize recent findings on the molecular mechanisms by which ncRNAs regulate HCC chemoresistance, as well as their potential clinical implications in overcoming HCC chemoresistance.
