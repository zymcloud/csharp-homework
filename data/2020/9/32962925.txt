Rationale and objectives:To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine risk factors for hypervascularization in hepatobiliary phase (HBP) hypointense nodules without arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Pubmed and EMBASE databases were searched up to May 7, 2020. Studies which evaluated radiologic and clinical risk factors for hypervascularization in HBP hypointense nodules without APHE were included. Hazard ratios were meta-analytically pooled using random-effects model. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed using Quality in Prognostic Studies (QUIPS) tool.Results:Sixteen studies with 934 patients were included. HBP hypointense nodules without APHE with baseline size greater than 10 mm, T2 hyperintensity, and restricted diffusion showed risk for hypervascularization with pooled HRs of 2.95 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.94-4.20), 4.21 (95% CI, 1.15-15.40), 5.83 (95% CI, 1.42-23.95), respectively. Previous HCC history contributed to hypervascularization of the nodules with hazard ratio of 2.06 (95% CI, 1.23-3.44). T1 hyperintensity, intralesional fat, Child-Pugh Class B, sex, alfa-fetoprotein, hepatitis B or C infection were not significant risk factors for hypervascularization (p â‰¥0.05). Study quality was generally moderate.Conclusion:HBP hypointense nodules without APHE on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI with baseline size greater than 10 mm, T2 hyperintensity, restricted diffusion and previous hepatocellular carcinoma history pose higher risk for hypervascularization. Proper patient management in patients with HBP hypointense nodules without APHE on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI may need to be tailored according to these risk factors.
