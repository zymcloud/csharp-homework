Bone is a frequent site for the occurrence of metastasis of thyroid cancer (TC). TC with bone metastasis (TCBM) is associated with skeletal-related events (SREs), with poor prognosis and low overall survival (OS). Therefore, it is necessary to develop a predictive nomogram for prognostic evaluation. This study aimed to construct an effective nomogram for predicting the OS and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of TC patients with BM. Those TC patients with newly diagnosed BM were retrospectively examined over a period of 6 years from 2010 to 2016 using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. Demographics and clinicopathological data were collected for further analysis. Patients were randomly allocated into training and validation cohorts with a ratio of âˆ¼7:3. OS and CSS were retrieved as research endpoints. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed for identifying independent predictors. Overall, 242 patients were enrolled in this study. Age, histologic grade, histological subtype, tumor size, radiotherapy, liver metastatic status, and lung metastatic status were determined as the independent prognostic factors for predicting the OS and CSS in TCBM patients. Based on the results, visual nomograms were separately developed and validated for predicting 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS and CSS in TCBM patients on the ground of above results. The calibration, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision curve analysis (DCA) also demonstrated the reliability and accuracy of the clinical prediction model. Our predictive model is expected to be a personalized and easily applicable tool for evaluating the prognosis of TCBM patients, and may contribute toward making an accurate judgment in clinical practice.
