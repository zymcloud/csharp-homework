Background:The clinical significance of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1)-targeted immunotherapy in Chinese patients is understudied. We thus aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors with toripalimab, camrelizumab or sintilimab for Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in a real-life cohort.Methods:We analysed hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCC patients treated with toripalimab, camrelizumab, or sintilimab in a retrospective single-center cohort from November 2018 to June 2020. Efficacy was evaluated with objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to tumor progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS). Safety data were also recorded.Results:Seventy patients were finally included in the analysis: 23 were treated with toripalimab, 33 with camrelizumab, and 14 with sintilimab. The mean duration of follow-up was 44.7 (95% CI: 39.9-49.6) weeks and the mean cycles of PD-1 at cutoff were 8.3Â±8.0 for all patients. The ORR and DCR for the whole cohort were 30% and 72.9%, respectively. Overall, 25 (35.7%) patients had radiological disease progression and 10 (14.3%) patients died during follow-up. Median PFS, median TTP, and median OS had not yet been reached. Most frequent drug-related adverse events (AEs) were rash (27.1%), hypertension (18.6%), fatigue (17.1%), diarrhea (17.1%), paresthesia (15.7%), and nausea (15.7%).Conclusions:Our findings suggest that (I) PD-1 targeted immunotherapy with toripalimab, camrelizumab, or sintilimab yielded a promising outcome in Chinese HBV patients with HCC and that (II) immunotherapy was well tolerated generally and had manageable side effects. This approach thus warrants further popularization and application in clinical practice.
