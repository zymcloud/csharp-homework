Anatomical liver resection (ALR) is the preferred oncological approach for the treatment of primary liver malignancies, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The demarcation line (DL) is formed by means of selective vascular occlusion and is used by surgeons to guide ALR. Emerging intraoperative technologies are playing a major role to enhance the surgeon's vision and ensure a precise oncologic surgery. In this article, a brief overview of modalities to assess the DL during ALRs is presented, from the established conventional techniques to future perspectives.
