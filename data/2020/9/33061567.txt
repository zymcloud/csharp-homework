Introduction:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key modulators for gene expression via inducing translational repression or target gene degradation. miR-133a-3p was reported to stimulate or inhibit cancer progression but its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be explored.Methods:Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was utilized to explore miR-133a-3p expression level in HCC cells. Dual-luciferase activity reporter assay was used to validate the direct interaction between miR-133a-3p and coronin-like actin-binding protein 1C (CORO1C). In addition, we analyzed the expression levels of miR-133a-3p and CORO1C in HCC tissues and normal tissues on the UCALAN website. Functional assays including cell counting kit-8 assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry analysis and transwell invasion assay were conducted to explore the biological functions of miR-133a-3p in HCC.Results:miR-133a-3p was found to have downregulated expression in HCC tissues and cells. Meanwhile, we showed that low miR-133a-3p levels were correlated with poorer overall survival of HCC patients. Overexpression of miR-133a-3p suppressed HCC cell growth and invasion but promoted cell apoptosis via targeting CORO1C.Discussion:Our results revealed a novel mechanism of miR-133a-3p in regulating HCC progression and provided evidence that miR-133a-3p functions as a tumor suppressor in HCC.
