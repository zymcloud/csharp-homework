Introduction:Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians living in remote locations suffer disproportionately from chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Defining the temporospatial epidemiology of the disease-and assessing the ability of local clinicians to deliver optimal care-is crucial to improving patient outcomes in these settings.Methods:The demographic, laboratory and radiology findings in all patients diagnosed with CHB after 1990, and presently residing in remote Far North Queensland (FNQ), tropical Australia, were correlated with their management and clinical course.Results:Of the 602 patients, 514 (85%) identified as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, 417 (69%) of whom had Torres Strait Islander heritage. Among the 514 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, there were only 61 (12%) born after universal postnatal vaccination was introduced in 1985. Community CHB prevalence varied significantly across the region from 7/1707 (0.4%) in western Cape York to 55/806 (6.8%) in the Eastern Torres Strait Islands. Although 240/602 (40%) are engaged in care, with 65 (27%) meeting criteria for antiviral therapy, only 43 (66%) were receiving this treatment. Among 537 with complete data, 32 (6%) were cirrhotic, of whom 15 (47%) were engaged in care and 10 (33%) were receiving antiviral therapy. Only 64/251 (26%) in whom national guidelines would recommend hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance are receiving screening, however, only 20 patients have been diagnosed with HCC since 1999.Conclusion:Vaccination has had a dramatic effect on CHB prevalence in FNQ in only a generation. However, although engagement in care is the highest in Australia, this is not translating into initiation of antiviral therapy in all those that should be receiving it, increasing their risk of developing cirrhosis and HCC. New strategies are necessary to improve the care of Indigenous Australians living with CHB to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this preventable disease.
