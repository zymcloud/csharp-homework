Objective:Novel hepatoprotective strategies are needed to improve clinical outcomes during liver surgery. There is mixed data on the role of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC). We investigated RIPC in partial hepatectomy for primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:This was a Phase II, single-center, sham-controlled, randomized controlled trial (RCT). The primary hypothesis was that RIPC would reduce acute liver injury following surgery indicated by serum alanine transferase (ALT) 24 h following hepatectomy in patients with primary HCC, compared to sham. Patients were randomized to receive either four cycles of 5 min/5 min arm cuff inflation/deflation immediately prior to surgery, or sham. Secondary endpoints included clinical, biochemical and pathological outcomes. Liver function measured by Indocyanine Green pulse densitometry was performed in a subset of patients.Results:24 and 26 patients were randomized to RIPC and control groups respectively. The groups were balanced for baseline characteristics, except the duration of operation was longer in the RIPC group. Median ALT at 24 h was similar between groups (196 IU/L IQR 113.5-419.5 versus 172.5 IU/L IQR 115-298 respectively, p = 0.61). Groups were similar in secondary endpoints.Conclusion:This RCT did not demonstrate beneficial effects with RIPC on serum ALT levels 24 h after partial hepatectomy.
