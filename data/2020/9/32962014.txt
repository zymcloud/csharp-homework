New anticancer ruthenium(II/III) complexes [RuCl2(DMSO)2(Hapbim)] (1) and [RuCl3(DMSO) (Hapbim)] (2) (Hapbim = 2-aminophenyl benzimidazole) have been synthesized and characterized, and their chemotherapeutic potential evaluated. The interaction of the compounds with DNA was studied by both UV-Visible and fluorescence spectroscopies, revealing intercalation of both the Hapbim ligand and the Ru complexes. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the compounds was tested on human breast cancer (MCF7), human colorectal cancer (Caco2), and normal human liver cell lines (THLE-2), with compound (2) the most potent against cancer cells. The cytotoxic effect of (2) is shown to correlate with the ability of the Ru(III) complex to induce apoptosis and to cause cell-cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Notably, both compounds were inactive in the noncancerous cell line. The anticancer effect of (2) has also been studied in an EAC (Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma) mouse model. Significantly, the activity of the complex was more pronounced in vivo, with removal of the cancer burden at doses that resulted in only low levels of hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. An apoptosis mechanism was determined by the observation of increased Bax and caspase 3 and decreased Bcl2 expression. Furthermore, (2) decreased oxidative stress and increased the levels of antioxidant enzymes, especially SOD, suggesting the enhancement of normal cell repair. Overall, compound (2) shows great potential as a chemotherapeutic candidate, with promising activity and low levels of side effects.
