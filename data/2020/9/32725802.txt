Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), an oncogene, is a commonly up-regulated epigenetic factor in human cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma deletion gene 1 (DLC1) is an antioncogene that is either expressed at low levels or not expressed in many malignant tumours. Curcumin is a promising anticancer drug that has antitumour effects in many tumours, but its mechanism of action is unclear. Our research demonstrated that EZH2 was up-regulated in breast cancer (BC) tissues and cells, whereas DLC1 was down-regulated, and the expression of EZH2 and DLC1 was negatively correlated in BC. By analysing the characteristics of clinical cases, we found that positive expression of EZH2 and negative expression of DLC1 may be predictors of poor prognosis in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Moreover, knockdown of EZH2 expression restored the expression of DLC1 and inhibited the migration, invasion and proliferation, promoted the apoptosis, and blocked the cell cycle of MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, we found that curcumin restored the expression of DLC1 by inhibiting EZH2; it also inhibited the migration, invasion and proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells, promoted their apoptosis and blocked the cell cycle. Finally, xenograft tumour models were used to demonstrate that curcumin restored DLC1 expression by inhibiting EZH2 and also inhibited the growth and promoted the apoptosis of TNBC cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that curcumin can inhibit the migration, invasion and proliferation, promote the apoptosis, block the cycle of TNBC cells and restore the expression of DLC1 by inhibiting the expression of EZH2.
