Halofuginone (HF) from Dichroa febrifuga has shown therapeutic potential in hepatocellular, lung and colorectal cancer cell models. Evidence has also indicated that HF plays roles in caustic induced esophageal strictures and oxidative injury. However, the role of HF in esophageal squamous carcinoma (ESCC) remains unclear. In this study, we investigated HF actions and mechanisms during ESCC cell apoptosis. We observed different HF concentrations (5, 10 and 20 nM) inhibited ESCC cell survival in a time and dose-dependent manner. HF treatment markedly induced KYSE-30 and TE-1 cell apoptosis, and caspase-3 activity. Apoptosis related protein Bax expression was dramatically increased, whereas Bcl-2 levels were reduced in KYSE-30 and TE-1 cells, after HF exposure. Also, we showed that HF treatment induced DNA damage by promoting γH2AX, pATM and pATR expression. HF treatment also reduced hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and forkhead box class O 3a (FOXO3a) expression in KYSE-30 and TE-1 cells. We also showed that HF inhibited FOXO3a expression, but this was dependent on HIF-1α inhibition. Finally, FOXO3a overexpression reversed HF induced cell survival inhibition, cell apoptosis and DNA damage. FOXO3a knockdown enhanced the effects of HF on cell survival, cell apoptosis and DNA damage. In summary, HF plays inhibitory roles in ESCC cell apoptosis, via HIF-1α-FOXO3a-dependent signaling. These data support the notion that HF could act as an effective therapeutic reagent towards ESCC.
