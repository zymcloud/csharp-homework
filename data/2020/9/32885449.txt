Background:Stromal and immune cells play important roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and progression. However, tools for predicting the prognosis of patients with HCC based on stromal and immune scores are not well established. We aimed to develop nomograms that predicted the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients after radical surgery.Methods:Basic information of 251 patients were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Multivariate Cox analyses identified variables predicting the prognosis of patients. DFS and OS nomograms were constructed based on the stromal and immune scores of the training group and verified in the well-matched test group.Results:An intermediate stromal score (hazards ratio [HR] = 3.177; P Conclusion:Nomograms based on the stromal and immune scores favorably predicted the DFS and OS of patients with HCC after radical surgery.
