Nowadays, exposure to infectious diseases caused by pathogenic viruses has become one of the major human concerns in health fields. In the meantime, hepatitis viruses are associated with health problems, especially in liver tissue. So far, several types of these viruses have been known including: HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HEV, and HGV. Nevertheless, it seems that hepatitis C is the major viral infection among all of the hepatitis infections. The cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are known as the most important pathological complications of this virus, from which seven genotypes have been identified. However, among these genotypes, the incidence rate of genotypes 1 and 3 is more than others. In this review, we have investigated the relationship between all HCV genotypes and therapeutic responses against them. Regarding heterogeneity between hepatitis C genotypes, it is not possible to access an effective vaccine against this virus, and treatment is the only applicable strategy. Response to treatment is different among genotypes, and it has resulted that each genotype has a specific therapeutic regimen of itself. Therefore, it seems that determination of hepatitis C genotype, as a key tool, is essential in controlling therapeutic regimen, improving local control programs and eventually producing an effective vaccine.
