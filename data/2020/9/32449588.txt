Background & aims:Regorafenib demonstrated a clinical benefit for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) in the phase III RESORCE trial. Considering the heterogeneity of uHCC and discrepancies in its characteristics between prospective trials and daily practice, real-life evidence is necessary.Methods:This multicentre, retrospective analysis was performed by the Korean Cancer Study Group. In total, 440 patients who received regorafenib between January 2017 and November 2019 were identified in nine tertiary referral hospitals in Korea.Results:All patients received prior sorafenib, and the median time-to-progression (TTP) on sorafenib was 3.9 months (range, 0.2-71.6). Regorafenib was used as the second, third and fourth to seventh lines of therapy in 305 (69.3%), 115 (26.1%) and 20 (4.5%) patients respectively. According to the RECIST v1.1, the overall response rate was 7.7% (n = 34), and the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.2 (95% CI, 2.8-3.5) and 12.1 (95% CI, 9.7-14.5) months respectively. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) were given in 115 patients (26.1%) prior to regorafenib. There were no differences in PFS and OS with regorafenib according to the prior use of ICIs (PFS, P = .61; OS, P = .63). The occurrence of hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) was associated with a better OS (P Conclusions:The real-life clinical outcomes of regorafenib for patients who progressed on prior systemic therapy including ICIs were consistent with the phase III trial results. HFSR was significantly associated with better OS with regorafenib.
