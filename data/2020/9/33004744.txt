Purpose:We aimed to compare the outcomes of microwave ablation (MWA) alone with those of transarterial chemoembolization combined with MWA (TACE-MWA) for Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) Stage B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to identify the prognostic factors associated with the two treatments.Materials and methods:This retrospective study was conducted in 150 BCLC Stage B HCC patients from April 2006 to November 2017. Of these, 88 patients were treated with MWA alone while 62 with TACE-MWA. Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to adjust for imbalances in clinical parameters. Procedure-related complications, local tumor progression (LTP), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed.Results:Before PSM, the maximal tumor diameters were 6.0 ± 1.0 cm and 6.7 ± 1.3 cm in the TACE-MWA and MWA groups, respectively, with a significant difference (P = 0.002); a significant difference was also detected in α-fetoprotein level (P = 0.013). After PSM, no difference was found in the two parameters (P = 0.067, 0.470). Before and after PSM, no difference was detected in the procedure-related complications (P = 0.803 vs. 1.000, P = 1.000 vs. 1.000), RFS (P = 0.786 vs. 0.689), and OS (P = 0.684 vs. 0.929). Tumor size and α-fetoprotein level were independent influencing factors for OS before and after PSM (P = 0.009, 0.023), while tumor size (D > 7) was an independent risk factor for poor OS (P = 0.011). Tumor number was an independent risk factor for RFS before and after PSM (P = 0.007 vs. P = 0.008). A significant difference was detected in LTP between the two groups with single tumor before and after PSM (P = 0.059 vs. P = 0.006).Conclusions:The MWA alone group had RFS and OS comparable to that of the TACE-MWA group. TACE-MWA was effective in controlling LTP in patients with a single tumor.
