Sulfiredoxin 1 (SRXN1) is a pivotal regulator of the antioxidant response in eukaryotic cells. However, the role of SRXN1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is far from clear. The present study aims to elucidate whether SRXN1 participates in tumorigenesis and metastasis of HCC and to determine the molecular mechanisms. We found that SRXN1 expression was up-regulated in HCC tissue samples and correlated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. We also observed that SRXN1 knockdown by transient siRNA transfection inhibited HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Overexpression of SRXN1 increased HCC cell migration and invasion. B-cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2) was identified as a downstream target of SRXN1. Mechanistic studies revealed that SRXN1-depleted reactive oxygen species (ROS) modulated migration and invasion of HCC cells. In addition, the ROS/p65/BTG2 signalling hub was found to regulate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which mediates the pro-metastasis role of SRXN1 in HCC cells. In vivo experiments showed SRXN1 promotes HCC tumour growth and metastasis in mouse subcutaneous xenograft and metastasis models. Collectively, our results revealed a novel pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic function of SRXN1 in HCC. These findings demonstrate a rationale to exploit SRXN1 as a therapeutic target effectively preventing metastasis of HCC.
