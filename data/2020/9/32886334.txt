Background:CyberKnife stereotactic body radiation therapy (CK-SBRT) has been applied to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients for several years. The study aim was to compare the efficacy of hepatic resection (HR) and CK-SBRT in naive small hepatocellular carcinoma (sHCC) patients with hepatitis virus-related cirrhosis using a 5-year follow-up study.Materials and methods:This retrospective cohort study included 317 naive sHCC patients (246 men and 71 women) with hepatitis B or C virus cirrhosis who were treated with HR (n = 195) or CK-SBRT (n = 122) from November 2011 to December 2015. Cumulative overall survival (OS) rates and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier method.Results:After the propensity score-matched analysis, 104 patients were selected from each group for further analysis. The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 96.2%, 89.4%, 85.5% and 70.7% in the HR group and 93.3%, 89.4%, 83.7% and 71.0% in the CK-SBRT group, respectively. The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year PFS rates were 78.8%, 64.3%, 56.4% and 47.3% in the HR group and 84.5%, 67.8%, 58.9% and 49.0% in the CK-SBRT group, respectively. No significant difference was found between the two groups in the OS and PFS rates (OS, p = 0.673; PFS, p = 0.350). No death occurred due to the toxicity or complications of HR or CK-SBRT.Conclusion:CK-SBRT could be an effective alternative to HR for sHCC naive patients with hepatitis-related cirrhosis, especially if patients have higher CP scores and lower PLT counts. PLT counts should be factored into survival evaluation of HCC treatment.
