Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains the most common malignant cancer worldwide. Numerous studies have indicated that C‑type lectin domain family 4 member M (CLEC4M) is associated with tumor progression; however, the biological functions of CLEC4M in HCC have not been investigated. In the present study, CLEC4M overexpression was observed to be associated with a favorable patient overall, relapse‑free, progression‑free and disease‑specific survival by using the KMplot™ database. The present study then concentrated specifically on the functions of CLEC4M by performing cell counting kit‑8 proliferation, 5‑Ethynyl‑2'‑deoxyuridine and flow cytometric assays. CLEC4M overexpression inhibited proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in Huh7 and PLC/PRF/5 cells. Furthermore, the results demonstrated by using western blotting that CLEC4M overexpression inhibited the Janus kinase 1/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway, which is involved in various types of tumors including HCC. In conclusion, the present study reported that CLEC4M may be considered as a novel indicator of HCC and may provide a theoretical basis for improving the survival of patients with HCC.
