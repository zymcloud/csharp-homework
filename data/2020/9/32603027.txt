Primary malignant liver tumors are rare but all require surgical resection as part of therapy with curative intent. A minority of patients have resectable tumors at diagnosis. Chemotherapy has a therapeutic role in hepatoblastoma but only one-third of patients have resectable disease at diagnosis. Two children with hepatoblastoma and suboptimal responses to initial chemotherapy received therapy with transarterial radioembolization utilizing yttrium-90 (TARE-Y90) and had significant response leading to resection and remission. The role of TARE-Y90 needs to be studied further to define its use in primary pediatric liver neoplasms.
