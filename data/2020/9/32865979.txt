HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (known as statins) are commonly prescribed worldwide for the management of coronary heart disease and the underlying dyslipidemia. This class of drugs has been shown to infer a significant decrease in the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Only recently though have the beneficial effects of statins in other diseases such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis been highlighted. Importantly, also, multiple studies have revealed that statin use was associated with lower cancer-associated mortality across multiple types of cancers. This work aims to review those studies with a particular focus on liver cancer. We also provide a review of the proposed mechanisms of action describing how statins can induce chemo-preventive and antitumor effects.
