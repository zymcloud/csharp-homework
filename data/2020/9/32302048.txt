Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks the sixth position among various cancers worldwide. Recent research shows that natural and dietary compounds possess many therapeutic effects. Citral is a monoterpene aldehyde that contains geranial and neral. The present study was considered to study the role of citral against N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA)-induced HCC via modulation of antioxidants and xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes in vivo. NDEA-alone-administered group II animals profoundly showed increased tumor incidence, reactive oxygen species, liver marker enzyme levels, serum bilirubin levels, tumor markers of carcinoembryonic antigen, Î±-fetoprotein, proliferative markers of argyrophilic nucleolar organizing regions, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expressions, phase I xenobiotic-metabolic enzymes and simultaneously decreased antioxidants, and phase II enzymes levels. Citral (100 mg/kg b.w.) treatment significantly reverted the levels in group III cancer-bearing animals when compared to group II cancer-bearing animals. In group IV animals, citral-alone administration did not produce any adverse effect during the experimental condition. Based on the results, citral significantly inhibits the hepatocellular carcinogenesis through restoring the antioxidants and phase II xenobiotic-enzyme levels; thereby, it strongly proves as an antiproliferative agent against rat HCC.
