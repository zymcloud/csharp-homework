Aberrant activation of histone deacetylases (HDACs) is one of the causes of tumor cell transformation in many types of cancer, however, the critical HDAC responsible for the malignant transformation remain unclear. To identify the HDAC related to the dedifferentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, we investigated the expression profile of HDACs in differentiated and undifferentiated hepatoma cells. We found that HDAC9, a member of the class II HDAC, is preferentially expressed in undifferentiated HCC cells. Analysis of 373 HCC patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database revealed that the expression of HDAC9 mRNA positively correlated with the markers of mesenchymal phenotype and stemness, and conversely, negatively correlated with hepatic differentiation markers. HDAC9 was transcriptionally upregulated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-induced HCC cells treated with TGF-Î². Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of HDAC9 in undifferentiated HCC cells showed decreased sphere-forming activity, which indicates an ability of anchorage-independent cell growth and self-renewal. We also showed that aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A3 (ALDH1A3) was downregulated in HDAC9-suppressing cells, and ALDH inhibitor disulfiram significantly decreased the sphere formation of undifferentiated HCC cells. Together, our data provide useful information for the development of HDAC9-specific inhibitors for the treatment of HCC progression.
