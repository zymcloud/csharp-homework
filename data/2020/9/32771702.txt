Purpose:To assess the impact of iterative reconstructions on image quality and detectability of focal liver lesions in low-energy monochromatic images from a Fast kV-Switching Dual Energy CT (KVSCT) platform.Methods:Acquisitions on an image-quality phantom were performed using a KVSCT for three dose levels (CTDIvol:12.72/10.76/8.79 mGy). Raw data were reconstructed for five energy levels (40/50/60/70/80 keV) using Filtered Back Projection (FBP) and four levels of ASIR (ASIR30/ASIR50/ASIR70/ASIR100). Noise power spectrum (NPS) and task-based transfer function (TTF) were measured before computing a Detectability index (d') to model the detection task of liver metastasis (LM) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as function of keV.Results:From 40 to 70 keV, noise-magnitude was reduced on average by -68% ± 1% with FBP; -61% ± 3% with ASIR50 and -52% ± 6% with ASIR100. The mean spatial frequency of the NPS decreased when the energy level decreased and the iterative level increased. TTF values at 50% decreased as the energy level increased and as the percentage of ASIR increased. The detectability of both lesions increased with increasing dose level and percentage of ASIR. For the LM, d' peaked at 70 keV for all reconstruction types, except for ASIR70 at 12.72 mGy and ASIR100, where d' peaked at 50 keV. For HCC, d' peaked at 60 keV for FBP and ASIR30 but peaked at 50 keV for ASIR50, ASIR70 and ASIR100.Conclusions:Using percentage of ASIR above 50% at low-energy monochromatic images could limit the increase of noise-magnitude, benefit from spatial resolution improvement and hence enhance detectability of subtle low contrast focal liver lesions such as HCC.
