Aim:The number of patients with fatty liver disease (FLD) is increasing globally. Ethanol consumption in FLD is known to be associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the effects of alcohol consumption on the occurrence of multiple HCCs remain unclear. We explored the relationship between the daily ethanol intake and the HCC number.Methods:This single-center retrospective study enrolled 114 patients without viral or immune hepatitis undergoing first-line HCC treatment who had been diagnosed with FLD by abdominal ultrasonography or a liver biopsy at the same time as or before HCC detection. We categorized patients into four groups according to the daily alcohol consumption (Results:The risk of multiple HCCs was significantly higher in the high-intermediate ethanol intake with FLD (HR 2.89, 95% CI 1.04-8.02, P = 0.042) and alcoholic fatty liver disease (HR 3.14, 95% CI 1.07-9.22, P = 0.037) groups than in the others. A multivariate analysis showed that a daily ethanol intake â‰¥40 g was associated with a significantly increased risk of multiple HCCs (HR 2.82, 95% CI 1.16-6.88, P = 0.023).Conclusions:Our findings suggest that a high daily ethanol intake might lead to multiple hepatocarcinogenesis in patients with FLD.
