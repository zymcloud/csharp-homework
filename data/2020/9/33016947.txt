Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the most common modality for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at the intermediate stage. TACE is typically performed via transfemoral access (TFA). However, transradial access (TRA) is preferred in coronary artery interventions due to decreased complications and mortality. Whether the advantages of TRA can be applied to TACE required investigation. Patients receiving TRA TACE at a single center were retrospectively enrolled for study. Procedural details, technical success, radial artery occlusion (RAO) rate, and access site-related bleeding complications were evaluated. From October 2017 to October 2018, 112 patients underwent 160 TRA TACE procedures. The overall technical success rate was 95.0% (152/160). The rate of crossover from TRA to TFA was 1.9%. No access site-related bleeding complications were found in any cases. Asymptomatic RA occlusion occurred in three patients (2.7%). Compared with TFA, TRA can increase safety and patient satisfaction while decreasing access site-related bleeding complications. Moreover, TRA interventions can benefit patients with advanced age, obesity, or a high risk of bleeding complications.
