Liver tumor-initiating cells (T-ICs) contribute to tumorigenesis, progression, recurrence and drug resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the underlying mechanism for the propagation of liver T-ICs remains unclear. In the present study, our finding shows that miR-96 is upregulated in liver T-ICs. Functional studies revealed that forced miR-96 promotes liver T-ICs self-renewal and tumorigenesis. Conversely, knockdown miR-96 inhibits liver T-ICs self-renewal and tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, miR-96 downregulates TP53INP1 via its mRNA 3'UTR in liver T-ICs. Furthermore, the miR-96 expression determines the responses of hepatoma cells to sorafenib treatment. Analysis of patient cohorts and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) further demonstrate that the miR-96 may predict sorafenib benefits in HCC patients. Our findings revealed the crucial role of the miR-96 in liver T-ICs expansion and sorafenib response, rendering miR-96 as an optimal target for the prevention and intervention of HCC.
