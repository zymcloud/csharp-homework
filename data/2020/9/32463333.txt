Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a lethal cancer in the digestive system. microRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to participate in PC progression. In this context, we, thus, aimed to explore the mechanism of miR-382 in epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and lymph node metastasis in PC in relation to Anxa3 and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Gene expression data sets GSE16515, GSE71989, and GSE32676 were screened out, with the findings showing the significance of miR-382 and annexin A3 (Anxa3) in PC. A total of 115 PC patients were selected for determination of miR-382 and Anxa3 expression with lowly expressed miR-382 and highly expressed Anxa3 found via RT-quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis. Additionally, negative correlation was found between miR-382 and Anxa3 in PC. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and in situ hybridization results confirmed that miR-382 negatively regulated Anxa3. miR-382 targeted Anxa3 and suppressed PC progression by blocking the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. After a series of gain- and loss-of function approaches, upregulation of miR-382 or silencing of Anxa3 inhibited the EMT and lymph node metastasis, as evidenced by increased level of E-cadherin and decreased level of N-cadherin, vimentin, vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGFR)-3, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D. Overexpression of miR-382 or downregulation of Anxa3 was shown to inhibit colony formation, migration, and invasion abilities of PC cells. Further, tumor xenograft in nude mice in vivo also confirmed the inhibitory role of miR-382 and silenced Anxa3 in lymph node metastasis in PC. Thus, this study provides promising therapeutic targets for PC treatment.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study focused on the mechanism of miR-382 in epithelial mesenchymal transition and lymph node metastasis in PC in relation to Anxa3 and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. We found the inhibitory role of miR-382 in PC in vitro and in vivo.
