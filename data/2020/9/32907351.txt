Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a vital role in cancer development and progression. This study aimed to investigate the role and potential mechanism of circRNA filamin binding LIM protein 1 (circFBLIM1) in HCC. Methods: Exosomes were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and Western blot assay. The levels of circFBLIM1, miR-338, and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or Western blot. Glycolysis was analyzed by detecting glucose consumption, lactate production, ATP level, extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), and oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Cell viability was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Xenograft assay was performed to analyze tumor growth in vivo. The interaction among circFBLIM1, miR-338, and LRP6 was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Results: CircFBLIM1 was highly expressed in HCC serum exosomes and HCC cells. Inhibition of circFBLIM1 confined HCC glycolysis and progression. CircFBLIM1 knockdown blocked tumorigenesis in vivo. CircFBLIM1 was a sponge of miR-338 and promoted HCC progression and glycolysis by regulating miR-338. Moreover, miR-338 suppressed HCC progression and glycolysis via targeting LRP6. Mechanistically, circFBLIM1 functioned as an miR-338 sponge to upregulate LRP6. Conclusion: CircFBLIM1 facilitated HCC progression and glycolysis via modulating the miR-338/LRP6 axis, which may provide promising therapeutic targets for HCC.
