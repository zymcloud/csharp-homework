Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) improve glycaemic control and ameliorate liver steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis in patients with fatty liver disease. We aimed to study the impact of TZD and glycaemic control on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatic events in diabetic patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). We performed a retrospective cohort study on diabetic patients with CHB in 2000-2017 using a territory-wide electronic healthcare database in Hong Kong. Diabetes mellitus was identified by use of any antidiabetic medication, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c ) ≥6.5%, fasting glucose ≥7 mmol/L in two measurements or ≥11.1 mmol/L in one measurement and/or diagnosis codes. Use of antidiabetic medications was modelled as time-dependent covariates. Of 28 999 diabetic patients with CHB, 3963 (13.7%) developed liver-related events (a composite endpoint of HCC and hepatic events) at a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 7.1 (3.7-11.8) years; 1153 patients received TZD during follow-up. After adjusted for important confounders, TZD use was associated with a reduced risk of liver-related events (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-0.88; P = .019). Similar trends were observed in HCC (aHR 0.57) and hepatic events (aHR 0.35) separately. Compared to HbA1c of 6.5% at baseline, patients with HbA1c ≥7% had an increased risk of liver-related events; the risk further increased in 5795 (20.0%) patients with HbA1c ≥9% at baseline (aHR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04-1.26; P = .006). TZD use is associated with a lower risk of liver-related events in diabetic patients with CHB. Liver-related events are more common in patients with high HbA1c levels.
