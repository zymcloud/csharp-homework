Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies and is the third cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Surgery is the optimal treatment for early HCC; however, the majority of cases are not suitable for curative resection at the time of diagnosis. Surgical resection difficulties may be related to size, site, number of tumors, extrahepatic involvement, and patient general condition. Exophytic tumors were considered as relative contraindication for thermal ablation because of the risk of incomplete ablation or major complications as hemorrhage and seeding.Aim of this study:to evaluate the safety and efficacy of microwave ablation (MWA) of exophytic HCC in comparison with non-exophytic HCC.Methods:Prospective comparative study carried on 30 patients having 30 exophytic (six of those patients had another non-exophytic lesion) and 32 patients having 44 non-exophytic HCC lesions (22 had single lesion, 8 patients had 2 lesions, and 2 patients had 3 lesions) within Milan criteria. All patients were child A or B, they were subjected to full clinical assessment, laboratory investigations, and radiological investigations. Laparoscopic assisted percutaneous MWA was the procedure of choice in our study for all patients either having exophytic or non-exophytic lesions using no-touch wedge technique for exophytic lesions and direct puncture for non-exophytic lesions.Results:Technical success was 100% in both groups, all lesions were completely ablated as confirmed by LIOUS. There were no major complications or perioperative mortality and low incidence of local tumor progression in both exophytic and non-exophytic groups.Conclusion:Laparoscopic assisted MWA of exophytic HCC is safe and effective with comparable results to non-exophytic HCC. Exophytic HCC is not contraindication for MWA with proper technique selection.
