Purpose:The presence of microvascular invasion (MVI) is an unfavorable prognostic factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to construct a nomogram-based preoperative prediction model of MVI, thereby assisting to preoperatively select proper surgical procedures.Methods:A total of 714 non-metastatic HCC patients undergoing radical hepatectomy were retrospectively selected from Zhongshan Hospital between 2010 and 2018, followed by random assignment into training (N = 520) and validation cohorts (N = 194). Nomogram-based prediction model for MVI risk was constructed by incorporating independent risk factors of MVI presence identified from multivariate backward logistic regression analysis in the training cohort. The performance of nomogram was evaluated by calibration curve and ROC curve. Finally, decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to determine the clinical utility of the nomogram.Results:In total, 503 (70.4%) patients presented MVI. Multivariate analysis in the training cohort revealed that age (OR: 0.98), alpha-fetoprotein (≥400 ng/mL) (OR: 2.34), tumor size (>5 cm) (OR: 3.15), cirrhosis (OR: 2.03) and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (OR: 1.61) were significantly associated with MVI presence. The incorporation of five risk factors into a nomogram-based preoperative estimation of MVI risk demonstrated satisfactory discriminative capacity, with C-index of 0.702 and 0.690 in training and validation cohorts, respectively. Calibration curve showed good agreement between actual and predicted MVI risks. Finally, DCA revealed the clinical utility of the nomogram.Conclusion:The nomogram showed a satisfactory discriminative capacity of MVI risk in HCC patients, and could be used to preoperatively estimate MVI risk, thereby establishing more rational therapeutic strategies.
