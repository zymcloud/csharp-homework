Objective:The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of liver surface nodularity (LSN) and sarcopenia from preoperative computed tomography (CT) in patients with resectable metabolic syndrome (MS)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Patients with MS undergoing hepatectomy for HCC between 2006 and 2018 at a single center were retrospectively analyzed. LSN and sarcopenia were assessed on preoperative CT scans, and their association with severe (Clavien-Dindo grade 3-5) postoperative complications was analyzed on multivariate analysis. The influence of LSN and sarcopenia on overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) was assessed.Results:Overall, 110 patients (92 men [84%], mean 67.7 ± 7.7 years of age) were analyzed. Severe postoperative complications occurred in 34/110 (31%) patients. Patients with severe complications had a significantly higher LSN score (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.68 ± 0.05, optimal cut-off > 2.50) and were more frequently sarcopenic (47% vs. 13% without major complications, p 2.50 (OR 7.05, 95% CI 2.13-23.35; p 2.50 and sarcopenia predicted the risk of severe postoperative complications from 7% (no sarcopenia and LSN ≤2.50) to 71% (sarcopenia and LSN > 2.50; p Conclusions:The combination of LSN and sarcopenia derived from routine preoperative CT seems to help predict severe postoperative complications and stratification of RFS in patients with MS and resectable HCC.
