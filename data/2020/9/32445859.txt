Background & aims:There are insufficient population-level data on the effects of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Methods:We identified incident cases of IBD, with PSC (PSC-IBD) and without, from April 2006 to April 2016 and collected data on outcomes through April 2019. We linked data from national health care registries maintained for all adults in England on hospital attendances, imaging and endoscopic evaluations, surgical procedures, cancer, and deaths. Our primary aim was to quantify the effects of developing PSC in patients with all subtypes of IBD and evaluate its effects on hepatopancreatobiliary disease, IBD-related outcomes, and all-cause mortality, according to sex, race, and age.Results:Over 10 years, we identified 284,560 incident cases of IBD nationwide; of these, 2588 patients developed PSC. In all, we captured 31,587 colectomies, 5608 colorectal cancers (CRCs) 6608 cholecystectomies, and 41,055 patient deaths. Development of PSC was associated with increased risk of death and CRC (hazard ratios [HRs], 3.20 and 2.43, respectively; P 7), in contrast to those who received a diagnosis of IBD when older than 60 years (incidence rate ratio, Conclusions:In a 10-year, nationwide study, we confirmed that patients with PSC-IBD have increased risks of CRC, hepatopancreatobiliary cancers, and death compared to patients with IBD alone. In the PSC-IBD group, diagnosis of IBD at age younger than 40 years was associated with greater risks of CRC and all-cause mortality compared with diagnosis of IBD at older ages. Patients who receive a diagnosis of PSC at an age younger than 40 years, men, and patients of African Caribbean heritage have an increased incidence of PSC-related events.
