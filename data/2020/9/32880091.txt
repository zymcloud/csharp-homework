Purpose:We evaluated the feasibility and outcomes of immediate preoperative renal artery embolization (IPRAE) before complex nephrectomy for locally advanced RCC Â± inferior vena cava thrombus (IVCT).Methods:A comparative retrospective (2007-2017) multicenter study which included 145 patients with locally advanced RCC Â± IVCT: 99 radical nephrectomies vs. 46 radical nephrectomies with IPRAE identified in the prospective UroCCR national database (CNIL DR 2013-206; NCT03293563). IPRAE was performed under local anesthesia the day of nephrectomy (< 4 h prior to nephrectomy). The primary endpoint was peroperative blood loss (mL). Secondary outcomes were: tolerance of embolization (pain visual scale), success rate of IPRAE defined by complete devascularization of the kidney, perioperative complications according to Clavien score and postoperative GFR.Results:The baseline characteristics of IPRAE and the control groups were similar. Tumor staging was 14% T2b, 41% T3a, 27% T3b, 13% T3c, 6% T4. The success rate of IPRAE was 98%. Median artery embolizated per patient was 2 (Agochukwu and Shuch in World J Urol 32:581-589, 2014; Marshall et al. in J Urol 139:1166-1172, 1988; Yap et al. in BJU Int 110:1283-1288, 2012;Gill et al. in J Urol. 194:929-938, 2015; Wang et al. in Eur Urol 69:1112-1119, 2016). No severe complications occurred after IPRAE. Postembolization syndrome was reported in 7% (Clavien I-II). Mean peroperative blood losses in the IPRAE and control groups were: 726 Â± 118 ml and 1083 Â± 114 ml (P = 0.03). In a multivariate analysis that included: age, Karnofsky index, IPRAE (yes vs. no), IVCT (yes vs. no), tumor size and synchronous metastasis, no IPRAE and IVCT were significantly associated with increased peroperative bleeding.Conclusion:IPRAE before nephrectomy for locally advanced and/or IVCT tumors was well tolerated, was associated with lower peroperative bleeding and did not increase the incidence or severity of postoperative complications.
