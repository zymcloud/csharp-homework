Rationale:Immunotherapy and targeted therapy have attracted widespread attention in current clinical research, which could be considered as a good therapeutic option for treatment of refractory liver cancer.Patient concerns:The patient was a 37-year-old man with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. He was presented with hepatalgia and discomfort.Diagnosis:The computed tomography showed multiple intrahepatic masses, indicating primary liver cancer with multiple intrahepatic metastases.Interventions:After failed transarterial chemoembolization therapy, he was initially treated with immunotherapy pembrolizumab plus angiogenesis inhibitor lenvatinib, and after 3 months of treatment, the condition improved. However, the disease subsequently progressed. The next-generation sequencing identified a BRCA2 germline mutation in this patient. A poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, olaparib, plus nivolumab therapy was started and achieved stable disease.Outcomes:The patient achieved stable disease and improvement in hepatalgia for 3 months after the combination treatment of Olaparib and nivolumab.Conclusion:We identified a BRCA2 germline mutation in a patient with liver cancer. Our findings could offer an alternative management for patients with liver cancer harboring germline BRCA2 mutation.
