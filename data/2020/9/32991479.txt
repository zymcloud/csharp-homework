Previous research has revealed a positive relationship between GSD, cholecystectomy and primary liver cancer (PLC). However, previous studies had several limitations including the retrospective design, narrow assessment of potential confounders and lack of competing risk models in time-to-event analyses. We conducted a large prospective cohort study to explore the relationship between GSD, cholecystectomy and PLC. A total of 95,021 participants who had not been diagnosed with PLC previously were enrolled from the Kailuan Cohort study. Demographic characteristics and biochemical parameters were recorded at baseline for all participants. We used Cox regression models and competing risk regression models to evaluate the association of GSD and cholecystectomy with the risk PLC. A total of 306 incidental PLC cases were identified during a median follow-up of 9.05 (8.75-9.22) years per participant. Compared with the normal group, the multivariable HRs (95%CI) for the association of GSD and cholecystectomy with PLC were 1.77 (1.05-2.94), 5.25 (1.95-14.17). In the CS model, the multivariable HRs (95%CI) was 1.76 (1.05-2.94) for the association of GSD and cholecystectomy with PLC and 5.25 (1.95-14.17) for GSD and cholecystectomy. Similar results were also obtained in the SD model with corresponding multivariate HRs (95%CI) of 1.75 (1.01-3.00), 5.22 (1.90-14.07) in the GSD group and cholecystectomy group, respectively. GSD and cholecystectomy were associated with an elevated risk of PLC.Registration number: ChiCTR-TNRC-11001489.
