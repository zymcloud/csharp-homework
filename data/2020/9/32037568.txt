Long noncoding RNA colon cancer-associated transcript 2 (CCAT2) has been recently found to function as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanisms of CCAT2 in HCC development remain to be further explored. In the present study, we found that CCAT2 was abnormally upregulated in HCC cells and tissue specimens, exhibiting an inverse correlation with microRNA (miR)-145 expression. Mechanistic investigation showed that CCAT2 selectively blocked miR-145 processing, leading to decreased mature miR-145 presence. Both the in vitro and in vivo effects of CCAT2 knockdown on the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells were reversed by miR-145 inhibitor, indicating that miR-145 modulation accounts for CCAT2-meditated HCC progression. Furthermore, miR-145 mimic dramatically suppressed HCC cells' proliferation and metastasis, revealing a tumor suppressor role of miR-145 in HCC. Mechanistically, MDM2 was predicted to be a potential target of miR-145. The luciferase and western blot assay demonstrated that miR-145 mimic largely inhibited MDM2 3'-untranslated region luciferase activity and MDM2 expression, followed by the upregulation of p53/p21 expression. Finally, the coexpression of MDM2 in miR-145 mimic-transfected HCC cells was able to largely compromise the inhibitory effects of miR-145 mimic on HCC cells' proliferation and metastasis in vitro and tumor formation in a xenograft model, confirming MDM2 is the critical mediator of miR-145 in HCC. In summary, our findings indicated that CCAT2 selectively blocks the miR-145 maturation process and plays an oncogene in HCC. Furthermore, a novel CCAT2/miR-145/MDM2 axis was revealed in HCC development and might provide a new target in the molecular treatment of HCC.
