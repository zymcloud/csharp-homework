Characterization of lipids by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is of great interest because not only are lipids important structural molecules in both the cell and internal organelle membranes, but they are also important signaling molecules. MALDI-MSI combined with spatial image segmentation has been previously used to identify tumor heterogeneities within tissues with distinct anatomical regions such as the brain. However, there has been no systematic study utilizing MALDI-MSI combined with spatial image segmentation to assess the tumor microenvironment in the liver. Here, we present that image segmentation can be used to evaluate the tumor microenvironment in the liver. In particular, to better understand the molecular mechanisms of irradiation-induced hepatic carcinogenesis, we used MALDI-MSI in the negative ion mode to identify lipid changes 12 months post exposure to low dose 28Si and 137Cs γ ray irradiation. We report here the changes in the lipid profiles of male C3H/HeNCrl mice liver tissues after exposure to irradiation and analyzed using the spatial shrunken centroid clustering algorithm. These findings provide valuable information as astronauts will be exposed to high-charge high-energy (HZE) particles and low-energy γ-ray irradiation during deep space travel. Even at low doses, exposure to these irradiations can lead to cancer. Previous studies infer that irradiation of mice with low-dose HZE particles induces oxidative damage and microenvironmental changes that are thought to play roles in the pathophysiology of hepatocellular carcinoma.
