This study was designed to propose a classification of inferior vena cava tumor thrombus (IVCTT) and retrospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination therapy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and sequential percutaneous ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with IVCTT. All HCC patients with IVCTT who underwent the combination therapies of TACE and sequential percutaneous ablation therapy between January 2015 and December 2017 in Beijing Youan Hospital were included in the study. The demographic, clinical, and pathological data were recorded. The response rate and overall survival (OS) rate were statistically analyzed. A classification system of IVCTT types was proposed based on the anatomical structure and ablation technique, which contained five types of IVCTT. Different types of IVCTT require different ablation strategies. For the response rate of IVCTT, complete response was achieved in all six patients. The 1- and 2-year OS rates were 88.3% and 55.6%, respectively. The new classification system and corresponding ablation strategies proposed in this study provided guidance for the use of ablation therapy for IVCTT. The combination therapy of TACE and ablation is effective and safe for treating HCC with IVCTT.
