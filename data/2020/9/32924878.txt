Introduction:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are established procedures for treating hepatocellular cancer and selected malignancies with liver metastasis. The aim of this study is to describe a monoinstitutional case series of local approaches in patients with liver metastases from rare head and neck cancers (HNCs).Methods:This is a retrospective series of adult patients with HNC treated with liver locoregional approaches (TACE or RFA) at our institution from 2007 to 2018. In case of chemoembolization, the preferred chemotherapeutic drug was doxorubicin. Response according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) was assessed with contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans.Results:Thirty-four patients were treated (20 men, median age 58 years) with TACE (27), transarterial embolization (2), or RFA (7). Primary tumours were salivary gland (21), thyroid (6), nasopharyngeal (5), and sinonasal cancers (2). Seventeen patients (50%) had a single metastatic liver nodule; 70% of the remaining 17 patients had at least three liver metastases. The median diameter of the metastatic liver mass undergoing treatment was 39 mm (range 11-100 mm). Median follow-up was 27.6 months. Response rate was 35% (3% complete, 32% partial response). Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 6.9 and 19.6 months, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 59% of patients (21% grade â©¾ 3; no grade 5).Discussion:This retrospective case series demonstrates that locoregional radiologic approaches for rare HNCs with liver metastases are feasible. These procedures deserve further prospective studies before being considered safe and active in these malignancies where the availability of effective systemic treatments is lacking.
