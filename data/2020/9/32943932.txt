Objective:To investigate the effects of fatigue on the survival of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with sorafenib.Patients and methods:A retrospective analysis of 182 cases of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with sorafenib in our hospital from October 1, 2008, to October 31, 2017, showed clinical and pathological data and follow-up results. The clinical and pathological data as well as follow-up results of 182 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with sorafenib in our hospital from October 1, 2008, to October 31, 2018, were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were treated for at least 3 months. Patients were divided into three groups: fatigue grade I (n=74), fatigue grade II (n=62), and fatigue grade III (n=46), according to National Cancer Institute common terminology criteria for adverse events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0. Survival analysis between groups was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method (Log rank test), continuous variables were analyzed by t-test, and categorical variables were analyzed by chi-square test.Results:The overall survival (OS) of patients who were relieved of fatigue was 33.0±9.3 months, whereas the OS of patients who were not relieved of fatigue was 15.0±1.8 months (PConclusion:Patients, especially the elderly and infirm, were more susceptible to toxicity.
