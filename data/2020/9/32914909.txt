Background:Tumor stiffness (TS), measured by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), could be associated with tumor mechanical properties and tumor grade.Purpose:To determine whether TS obtained using MRE is associated with survival in patients with single nodular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatic resection (HR).Study type:Retrospective.Population:In all, 95 patients with pathologically confirmed HCCs.Field strength/sequence:1.5T/3D spin-echo echo-planar imaging MRE.Assessment:TS values of the whole tumor (TS-WT) and of a solid portion of the tumor (TS-SP) after excluding the necrotic area were measured on stiffness maps. Known imaging prognostic factors of HCC were also analyzed. After surgery, pathologic findings were evaluated from resected pathology specimens.Statistical tests:Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney U-test were performed to determine the significance of differences according to the tumor grade. Overall survival (OS) / recurrence-free survival (RFS) analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox multivariable models.Results:The average TS-WT was 2.14 Â± 0.74 kPa, and the average TS-SP was 2.51 Â± 1.07 kPa. The cumulative incidence of RFS was 73.1%, 63.1%, and 57.3% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The TS-WT, TS-SP, and tumor size (â‰¥5 cm) were significant prognostic factors for RFS (P Data conclusion:The TS-WT, TW-SP, and tumor size (â‰¥5 cm) were significant predictive factors of RFS after HR in patients with HCC.Level of evidence:4 TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE: 5.
