Background:Although clinical use of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin has been approved for patients infected with genotype 2 hepatitis C virus, patients ≥ 75-years-old have not been included in previous clinical trials.Aim:To evaluate the real-world safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for elderly patients (≥ 75-years-old) compared to nonelderly patients, we conducted a post-marketing prospective cohort study.Methods:We treated 265 patients with genotype 2 hepatitis C virus using standard approved doses of sofosbuvir (400 mg/d) plus ribavirin adjusted by body weight, administered orally for 12 wk.Results:Sustained virological response rates for the overall cohort, patients P = 0.842). Logistic regression analyses identified history of hepatocellular carcinoma treatment and alpha-fetoprotein as factors significantly associated with sustained virological response. Alpha-fetoprotein was the only independent factor identified. Sustained virological response rate was significantly lower for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treatment (91%) than for patients without history of hepatocellular carcinoma treatment (98%, P = 0.004). One patient (0.4%) discontinued treatment due to drug-induced pneumonia. Dose reduction or interruption of ribavirin was required for 12.1% (32/265) of patients because of anemia, including 7.7% (14/182) of patients < 75-years-old and 21.7% (18/83) of patients ≥ 75-years-old (P = 0.002).Conclusion:Although ribavirin dose reduction or interruption was required with advanced age, sofosbuvir plus ribavirin appears tolerable and highly effective even in patients ≥ 75-years-old.
