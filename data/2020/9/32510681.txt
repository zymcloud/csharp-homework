Aim:The landscape of cancer-related genetic aberrations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has gradually become clear through recent next-generation sequencing studies. However, it remains unclear how genetic aberrations correlate with imaging and histological findings.Methods:Using 117 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens of primary liver tumors, we undertook targeted next-generation sequencing of 50 cancer-related genes and digital polymerase chain reaction of hTERT. After classifying tumors into several imaging groups by hierarchal clustering with the information from gadoxetic acid enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, contrast-enhanced computed tomography, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, and diffusion-weighted imaging magnetic resonance imaging, the correlation between genetic aberrations and imaging and histology were investigated.Results:Most frequent mutations were hTERT (61.5%), followed by TP53 (42.7%), RB1 (24.8%), and CTNNB1 (18.8%). Liver tumors were classified into six imaging groups/grades, and the prevalence of hTERT mutations tended to increase with the advancement of imaging/histological grades (P = 0.026 and 0.13, respectively), whereas no such tendency was evident for TP53 mutation (P = 0.78 and 1.00, respectively). Focusing on the mutations in each tumor, although the variant frequency (VF) of hTERT did not change (P = 0.36 and 0.14, respectively) in association with imaging/histological grades, TP53 VF increased significantly (P = 0.004 and Conclusions:Increased prevalence of hTERT mutation and increased TP53 mutation VF are characteristic features of HCC progression, diagnosed with imaging/histological studies.
