Background and goal:The incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rising. We aimed to characterize risk factors for NAFLD-HCC development.Methods:We performed a retrospective case-control study of HCC cases from a cohort of NAFLD patients who underwent at least 2 computed tomography scans. NAFLD-HCC cases confirmed on contrast imaging and/or biopsy were included. Controls were NAFLD patients without HCC matched by sex and age. Clinical variables were assessed. Visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue were measured by computed tomography at 2 timepoints: before HCC diagnosis and at diagnosis.Results:We identified 102 subjects [34 HCC cases, 68 controls, 65% (n=66) males, mean age: 69 y] from 2002 to 2016. Cirrhosis was present in 91%. In multivariate analysis, statin use was protective against HCC [odds ratio (OR)=0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.07-0.60, P=0.004], while hypertension was a risk factor for HCC (OR=5.80, 95% CI: 2.01-16.75, P=0.001). In multivariate analysis, visceral adipose tissue in males was higher before HCC diagnosis and declined by HCC diagnosis in 86%, which was a significant difference compared with controls (OR=2.78, 95% CI: 1.10-7.44, P=0.04).Conclusions:In a cohort of NAFLD-HCC patients, statin use was protective against HCC, while hypertension conferred an increased risk. Visceral adiposity at baseline was not a risk factor, but was higher in male patients before HCC development, declining in the majority by HCC diagnosis.
