Bile duct necrosis (BDN) with biloma formation is a type of ischemic bile duct injury that is one of the serious complications associated with transarterial therapies, such as transcatheter chemoembolization therapy (TACE), and radioembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) for metastatic liver cancer from colorectal carcinoma. In terms of the occurrence of BDN and subsequent biloma formation, ischemic injury to the peribiliary vascular plexus (PBP), the supporting vessel of bile duct epithelium, is thought to be intimately associated. In this paper, we first describe the anatomy, blood supply, and function of the intrahepatic bile duct, and then illustrate the pathophysiology of BDN, and finally present the imaging findings of BDN. Under the process of BDN formation, ischemia of the PBP induces the disruption of the bile duct epithelial protection mechanism that causes coagulation and fibrinoid necrosis of the surrounding tissue by the detergent action of exuded bile acids, and eventually a biloma forms. Once BDN occurs, persistent tissue damage to the surrounding bile duct is induced by imbibed bile acids, and portal vein thrombosis may also be observed. On pre-contrast and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), BDN shows similar findings to intrahepatic bile duct dilatation, and, therefore, it is sometimes misdiagnosed. Differentiation of imaging findings on CT and ultrasound (US)/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging/MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is important for correct diagnosis of BDN.
