Background:We assessed the prognostic accuracy of ADV score (Î±-fetoprotein [AFP]-des-Î³-carboxyprothrombin [DCP]-tumor volume [TV] score) following resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT).Methods:This was a retrospective observational study. This study included 147 patients who underwent hepatic resection for HCC with PVTT. They were followed up for â‰¥ 66 months or until patient death.Results:The grades of PVTT were Vp1 in 121 (14.3%), Vp2 in 41 (27.9%), Vp3 in 71 (48.3%), and Vp4 in14 (9.5%) cases. Preoperative HCC treatment was performed in 48 (32.7%) patients. R0 and R1 resections were performed in 119 (81.0%) and 28 (19.0%) cases, respectively. The 5-year tumor recurrence, HCC-specific survival, and post-recurrence survival rates were 79.2%, 43.5%, and 25.4%, respectively. Neither PVTT grade nor history of preoperative HCC treatment was a significant prognostic indicator. Stratification in accordance with ADV scores of 1log- and 3log-intervals resulted in high prognostic accuracy in predicting tumor recurrence and patient survival. Following cluster analysis, the cutoff for ADV score was determined at 9log and was more prognostically significant in terms of tumor recurrence and patient survival than surgical curability or microvascular invasion. Further comparisons revealed that prognostic prediction with an ADV score cutoff at 9log was more accurate than that using the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital-PVTT score.Conclusions:ADV score is an integrated surrogate biomarker for post-resection prognosis in HCC with PVTT. Our prognostic prediction model using ADV scores provides reliable post-resection prognosis for patients with various grades of these tumors.
