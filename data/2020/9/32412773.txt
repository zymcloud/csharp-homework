Beta-glucosidase (GBA), also known as acid β-glucosidase, exhibits an activity of glucosylceramidase (EC 3.2.1.45). Three main isoforms of β-glucosidases have been identified in mammals: GBA1, GBA2, and GBA3. The deficiency of these enzymes leads to glucosylceramide accumulation, resulting in Gaucher's disease. The present study is focused on the cytosolic β-glucosidase, GBA3, and its relationship with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression of GBA3 mRNA in HCC was evaluated first using the TCGA database, and then by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays of 328 clinically characterized HCC samples and 151 non-tumor liver controls. Moreover, the presence of a correlation between GBA3 expression and clinicopathological characteristics of patients was examined. The obtained results indicated that the expression of GBA3 mRNA was significantly lower in HCC than in the adjacent non-tumor liver tissues. The expression of GBA3 was inversely related to the number of tumors (p=0.041), tumor size (p
