Background:Increasing evidence has demonstrated the correlation between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis and RNA binding proteins (RBPs) dysregulation. Thus, we aimed to develop and validate a reliable prognostic signature that can estimate the prognosis for HCC.Methods:Gene expression profiling and clinical information of 374 HCC patients were derived from the TCGA data portal. The survival-related RBP pairs were determined using univariate cox-regression analysis and the signature was built based on LASSO analysis. All patients were divided patients into high-and low-risk groups according to the optimal cut off of the signature score determined by time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The predictive value of the signature was further validated in an independent cohort.Results:A 37-RBP pairs signature consisting of 61 unique genes was constructed which was significantly associated with the survival. The RBP-related signature accurately predicted the prognosis of HCC patients, and patients in high-risk groups showed poor survival in two cohorts. The novel signature was an independent prognostic factor of HCC in two cohorts (all P Conclusion:The novel proposed RBP-related signature based on relative expression orderings could serve as a promising independent prognostic biomarker for patients with HCC, and could improve the individualized survival prediction in HCC.
