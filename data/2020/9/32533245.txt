Purpose:This prospective study was performed to investigate long-term (8-year) survival in patients with solitary large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranging from 5 to 7 cm who underwent transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and identify factors that significantly affected outcomes.Methods:Forty-eight patients with large HCC (36 men, 12 women; mean age, 57.0 ± 11.2 [range, 37-82] years) without fever or signs of infection were enrolled. All patients were treated with TACE + RFA. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors were assessed using the Cox hazards regression method.Results:The median OS duration was 47.0 months, and the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 8-year OS rates were 73%, 57%, 53%, and 27%, respectively. The median DFS duration was 9.05 (3.99-12.01) months, and the 1-, 3-, and 5-year DFS rates were 35%, 9%, and 0%, respectively. Cox hazards regression analysis revealed that the Child-Pugh class, platelet count, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), and DFS were independent predictive factors of OS (p = 0.000, 0.003, 0.020, and 0.000, respectively). The LMR and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were independent predictive factors of recurrence (p = 0.046 and 0.016, respectively).Conclusion:TACE + RFA may be a safe and effective treatment for selected solitary large HCC ranging from 5 to 7 cm. Measurement of the LMR (> 4) and PLR (≤ 100) in peripheral blood before the intervention might help to identify which patients with solitary large HCC are suitable for TACE + RFA.
