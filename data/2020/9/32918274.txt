Purpose:Describe sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and establish their history in the Brazilian public health system.Methods:Retrospective observational study was conducted using the database from the Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System (DataSUS). Patients with at least one claim of HCC between July/2011 and June/2016 were included. A record linkage methodology was performed to obtain longitudinal data across different databases. Demographic and clinical data were evaluated, including the time elapsed between diagnosis of HCC risk-factors and the cancer development. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics.Results:A total of 28,822 HCC cases were identified between July/2011 and June/2016. Mean age was 59.7 years (SD = 14.7), and most patients were men (55.9%). The highest relative number of HCC cases was detected in the south of Brazil (> 20 cases/100,000 inhabitants). About 86.5% of the patients had diagnosis of HCC without previous liver diseases. Only 8% had diagnosis of chronic viral hepatitis and 3.5% cirrhosis. About 76% were diagnosed at an advanced stage, and only 11% of the patients had early stage HCC. Approximately 58% of patients with previous underlying liver diseases were diagnosed at early stages, compared with only 24% of patients without prior record of underlying diseases.Conclusion:The diagnosis of HCC in the Brazilian public health is usually made in patients with no previous diagnosis of liver disease and in advanced stages, when no curative treatment is available and survival rates are low. Public health policies are key for the screening and monitoring liver disease and, consequently, HCC.
