Lessons learned:For patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma after failure of first-line sorafenib monotherapy, second-line axitinib provides modest efficacy with tolerable toxicity. The discrepant tumor responses and survival outcomes in trials using axitinib as salvage therapy highlight the importance of optimal patient selection with the aid of clinical biomarkers.Background:Multikinase inhibitors have been effective treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This multicenter phase II study explored the efficacy and safety of second-line axitinib for advanced HCC.Methods:Patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh A liver function, experiencing progression on first-line sorafenib monotherapy, were eligible. Axitinib 5 mg twice daily was given continuously with allowed dose escalation. Tumor assessment was performed according to RECIST version 1.1. The primary endpoint was rate of disease control.Results:From April 2011 to March 2016, 45 patients were enrolled. Thirty-seven patients (82%) tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen. The disease control rate was 62.2%, and the response rate was 6.7%, according to RECIST criteria. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 2.2 months and 10.1 months, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events were compatible with previous reports of axitinib.Conclusion:Second-line axitinib has moderate activity and acceptable toxicity for patients with advanced HCC after failing the first-line sorafenib monotherapy.
