More efficient biomarkers are needed to facilitate the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to identify candidate biomarkers for HCC detection by proteomic analysis. First, we performed a global proteomic analysis of 10 paired HCC and non-tumor tissues. Then, we validated the top-ranked proteins by targeted proteomic analyses in another tissue cohort. At last, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to validate the candidate biomarkers in multiple serum cohorts including HCC cases (HCCs), cirrhosis cases (LCs), and normal controls (NCs). We identified and validated 33 up-regulated proteins in HCC tissues. Among them, eight secretory or membrane proteins were further evaluated in serum, revealing that aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) and cathepsin A (CTSA) can distinguish HCCs from LCs and NCs. The area under the curves (AUCs) were 0.891 and 0.894 for AKR1B10 and CTSA, respectively, greater than that of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP; 0.831). Notably, combining the three proteins reached an AUC of 0.969, which outperformed AFP alone (P
