Conobea scoparioides (Cham. & Schltdl.) Benth. (syn. Sphaerotheca scoparioides Cham. & Schldtl.) (Plantaginaceae), popularly known as "pataqueira", "vassourinha-do-brejo" and/or "hierba-de-sapo", is a popular medicinal plant used to treat leishmaniasis, pain and beriberi. In addition, inhibition of cell adhesion, antioxidant, cytotoxic and leishmanicidal activities of compounds or fractions of C. scoparioides have been reported. In the present work, chemical constituents and in vitro and in vivo anti-liver cancer potential of essential oil (EO) from leaves of C. scoparioides were investigated using human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells as a cell model. EO was obtained by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus and characterized by GC-MS and GC-FID. The in vitro cytotoxic effect was evaluated on three human cancer cell lines (MCF-7, HepG2 and HCT116) and one human non-cancerous cell line (MRC-5) using the Alamar blue assay. Phosphatidylserine externalization and cell cycle distribution were quantified in HepG2 cells by flow cytometry after 48 h incubation. The effectiveness of EO in anti-liver cancer model was studied with HepG2 cells grafted on C.B. 17 SCID mice. The main constituents of EO were thymol methyl ether (62 %), thymol (16 %) and Î±-phellandrene (14 %). EO displayed an in vitro cytotoxic effect against all human cancer cell lines and caused externalization of phosphatidylserine and DNA fragmentation in HepG2 cells, suggesting induction of apoptotic-like cell death. In vivo tumor mass inhibition of 36.7 and 55.8 % was observed for treatment with EO at doses of 40 and 80 mg/kg, respectively. These results indicate in vitro and in vivo anti-liver cancer potential of EO from leaves of C. scoparioides.
