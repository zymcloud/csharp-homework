Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the world's most common cancers. For over ten years, the only medical treatment for it, has been the multikinase inhibitor Sorafenib. Currently, however, other first or second line therapeutic options have also shown efficacy against HCC, such as multikinase inhibitors (Regorafenib, Lenvatinib, and Cabozantinib), a monoclonal antibody against the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (Ramucirumab), and immune-checkpoint inhibitors (Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, Ipilimumab).Aim:Review the metabolic pathways of drugs that have been tested for treatment of HCC and the potential influence of liver failure over those pathways.Methods:Review of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s and European Medicines Agency (EMA)'s data sheets, results from clinical trials and observational studies.Results:This review summarizes the current knowledge about targets, metabolic pathways, drug interactions, and adverse events of medical treatments for HCC in cirrhotic patients.Conclusions:The new scenario of systemic HCC therapy includes more active drugs with different metabolic pathways and different liver adverse events. Clinical and pharmacological studies providing more data on the safety of these molecules are urgently needed.
