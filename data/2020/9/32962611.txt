Background:CASC15, one of long non-coding RNA, is involved in the regulation of many tumor biological processes, and is expected to become a new biological therapeutic target. This paper aims to elucidate the pathophysiological function of CASC15 in various tumors.Methods:The relationship between CASC15 and tumors was analyzed by searching references, and summarizes the specific pathophysiological mechanism of CASC15.Results:LncRNA CASC15 is closely related to tumor development, and has been shown to be abnormally high expressed in all kinds of tumors, including breast cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, bladder cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, cardiac hypertrophy, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, leukemia, melanoma, tongue squamous cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However, CASC15 has been found to be downexpressed abnormally in ovarian cancer, glioma and neuroblastoma. Besides, it is identified that CASC15 can affect the proliferation, invasion and apoptosis of tumors.Conclusion:LncRNA CASC15 has the potential to become a new therapeutic target or marker for a variety of tumors.
