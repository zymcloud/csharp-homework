Cancer nanomedicine is an emerging field of cancer therapeutics. Incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing worldwide, and currently, it is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. This study investigates the cytotoxic potential of β-sitosterol-assisted silver nanoparticles (BSS-SNPs) in HepG2 cells. The silver nanoparticles were synthesized using β-sitosterol as a reducing and stabilizing agent. The characterization of BSS-SNPs was done by UV-visible spectrophotometry and transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis. HepG2 cells were treated with different concentrations of BSS-SNPs for 24 hr, and cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assay. Intracellular ROS was investigated by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate staining. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) protein expression was investigated by immunofluorescence staining. Morphology-related to apoptotic changes were analyzed by annexin V staining. Intrinsic apoptosis pathwayrelated molecular markers were investigated by western blotting and PCR analysis. Spectrophotometry analysis confirmed a strong absorption peak at 420 nm, which showed the successful synthesis of BSS-SNPs. The TEM analysis indicated the spherical-, rod-, and hexagonal BSS-SNPs with the size ranges from 5 to 55 nm. BSS-SNPs significantly inhibited the proliferation and induced ROS and Nrf-2 expression in HepG2 cells. BSS-SNPs treatment caused apoptosis-related morphological changes and upregulated the pro-apoptotic markers such as bax, p53, cytochrome c, and caspases-9, -3 and downregulated bcl-2 expressions. Our findings suggest that BSS-SNPs might serve as potential drug candidates for HCC.
