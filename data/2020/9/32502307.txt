Background:In this study, we investigated long-term survival of cirrhotic patients without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the proper timing of liver transplantation in the era with recent progress of management.Methods:We first classified 217 non-transplant cirrhotic patients without HCC according to the long-term survival based on Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) scores and the MELD scores. We then compared them with the survival after liver transplantation in 114 patients with liver cirrhosis.Results:We classified into four groups (class A as CTP score of 5,6, B as 7,8, C as 9-12, D as 13-15) according to the long-term survival of the patients, the survivals of patients with class C and D were significantly worse compared with transplant patients (P Conclusions:Considering the long-term survival of patients with liver cirrhosis, CTP score of 9 and/or MELD score of 13 could be a proper timing for liver transplantation.
