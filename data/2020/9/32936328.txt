Purpose:The controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score has been reported to predict outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the prognostic significance of the CONUT score in patients with non-B non-C (NBNC) HCC remains to be established.Methods:The study comprised 246 patients who had undergone elective hepatic resection for HCC between April 2003 and October 2017. We retrospectively investigated the relation between preoperative CONUT score as well as clinicopathological characteristics and disease-free survival (DFS) as well as overall survival (OS).Results:In univariate analyses, CONUT score was associated with DFS and OS in patients with NBNC-HCC (p ≤ 0.01), while there was no significant association of CONUT score with DFS and OS in patients with HBV- and HCV-related HCC (p ≥ 0.1). Of the 111 patients with NBNC-HCC, 97 (87.4%) had CONUT score ≤ 3 (low CONUT score) and the other 14 (12.6%) had CONUT score ≥ 4 (high CONUT score). In the patients with NBNC-HCC, multivariate analysis identified age ≥ 65 years (p = 0.03), multiple tumors (p Conclusions:The CONUT score seems to be a reliable and independent predictor of both DFS and OS after hepatic resection for NBNC-HCC.
