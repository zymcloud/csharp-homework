Successful implementation of left ventricular assist devices lead to a prolonged survival in patients with chronic terminal heart failure. Thus, patients with pre-existing left ventricular assist devices with abdominal comorbidities requiring abdominal surgery, e.g. for malignancy, are upcoming issues. We carried out a major liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma in a patient with pre-existing left ventricular assist device. The importance of this case report is that it outlines the significance of oncologic resections in patients with left ventricular assist devices as an upcoming issue and provides an interdisciplinary approach.
