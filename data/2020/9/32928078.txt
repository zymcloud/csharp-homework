Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer with a high mortality rate and is usually detected at middle or late stage, missing the optimal treatment period. The current study aims to identify potential long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) biomarkers that contribute to diagnosis and prognosis of HCC.Method:The differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) in HCC patients were detected from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. LncRNAs signature was screened by LASSO regression, univariate and multivariate Cox regression. The models for predicting diagnosis and prognosis were established respectively. The prognostic model was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival curve receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and stratified analysis. The diagnostic model was validated by ROC. The lncRNAs signature was further demonstrated by functional enrichment analysis.Results:We found the 13-lncRNAs signature that had a good performance in predicting prognosis and could help to improve the value of diagnosis. In the training set, testing set and entire cohort, the low risk group had longer survival than the high risk group (median OS: 3124 vs 649 days, 2456 vs 770 days and 3124 vs 755 days ). It performed well in 1-, 3-, and 5- year survival prediction. 13-lncRNAs-based risk score, age and race were good predictors of prognosis. The AUC of diagnosis were 0.9487, 0.9265 and 0.9376 respectively. Meanwhile the 13-lncRNAs were involved in important pathways including the cell cycle and multiple metabolic pathways.Conclusion:In our study, the 13-lncRNAs signature may be a potential marker for prognosis of HCC and improve the diagnosis.
