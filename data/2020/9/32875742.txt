Introduction:Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) use in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing. Real-world data on efficacy and safety, however, are lacking.Methods:We conducted a retrospective review of all patients with advanced HCC seen at our center who received at least one dose of an ICI between May 2015 and June 2018. Data cutoff was December 31, 2018. Responses were evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 criteria.Results:Of 114 patients, 88.6% were male. Median age was 66 years, 96.5% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group of 0-1. 62.3% received monotherapy ICI. 18.4% of patients had Child-Pugh (CP) B disease on initiation of ICI, and 69.3% had an ALBI grade of 2. 54.4% were known to have chronic hepatitis B (HBV) or were previously infected, and 11.4% had hepatitis C. Baseline HBV viral load (VL) ranged from undetectable to 8 210 000 IU/mL. 35.1% received prior systemic treatment. 28.9% received prior sorafenib. Over a median follow-up duration of 13.8 months (10.4-15.8), ORR was 18.4%, and DCR was 50.9%. Median progression-free survival was 2.7 months (1.3-4.0), and median overall survival (OS) was 13.9 months (6.9-16.2). Thirty-one patients (27.2%) received further systemic therapy after ICI discontinuation. On multivariable analyses, lower albumin level, higher bilirubin level, diuretic-refractory ascites, and HBV-associated HCC were associated with poorer OS. 69.3% of patients experienced adverse events (AE) of any grade, 14.9% of these being grade 3-4. No grade 5 AE were observed. Use of antiviral therapy was associated with a lower risk of grade 3 or above hepatic AEs (P = 0.048), whereas high baseline HBV VL was not associated with an increased risk of reactivation or hepatic AE.Discussion:We have demonstrated that the real-world performance of ICIs in advanced HCC appears comparable to that observed in clinical trials for HCC patients with CP A cirrhosis. While prognosis of patients with advanced HCC and CP B cirrhosis remains poor even with ICI, usage of ICI is likely to be safe. Patients with HBV with a baseline HBV VL â‰¥100 IU/mL may receive ICI safely, especially if they are on antiviral treatment.
