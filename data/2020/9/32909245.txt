Purpose:Overexpression of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) contributes to tumorigenesis, metastasis, and poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Infigratinib-a pan-FGFR inhibitor-potently suppresses the growth of high-FGFR-expressing HCCs in part via alteration of the tumor microenvironment and vessel normalization. In this study, we aim to assess the utility of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a non-invasive imaging technique to detect microenvironment changes associated with infigratinib and sorafenib treatment in high-FGFR-expressing HCC xenografts.Procedures:Serial DCE-MRIs were performed on 12 nude mice bearing high-FGFR-expressing patient-derived HCC xenografts to quantify tumor microenvironment pre- (day 0) and post-treatment (days 3, 6, 9, and 15) of vehicle, sorafenib, and infigratinib. DCE-MRI data were analyzed using extended generalized kinetic model and two-compartment distributed parameter model. After treatment, immunohistochemistry stains were performed on the harvested tumors to confirm DCE-MRI findings.Results:By treatment day 15, infigratinib induced tumor regression (70 % volume reduction from baseline) while sorafenib induced relative growth arrest (185 % volume increase from baseline versus 694 % volume increase from baseline of control). DCE-MRI analysis revealed different changes in microcirculatory parameters upon exposure to sorafenib versus infigratinib. While sorafenib induced microenvironment changes similar to those of rapidly growing tumors, such as a decrease in blood flow (F), fractional intravascular volume (vp), and permeability surface area product (PS), infigratinib induced the exact opposite changes as early as day 3 after treatment: increase in F, vp, and PS.Conclusions:Our study demonstrated that DCE-MRI is a reliable non-invasive imaging technique to monitor tumor microcirculatory response to FGFR inhibition and VEGF inhibition in high-FGFR-expressing HCC xenografts. Furthermore, the microcirculatory changes from FGFR inhibition manifested early upon treatment initiation and were reliably detected by DCE-MRI, creating possibilities of combinatorial therapy for synergistic effect.
