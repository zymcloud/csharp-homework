Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most universal malignant liver tumors worldwide. However, there were no systematic studies to establish glycolysisâ€‘related gene pairs (GRGPs) signatures for the patients with HCC. Therefore, the study aimed to establish novel GRGPs signatures to better predict the prognosis of HCC.Methods:Based on the data from Gene Expression Omnibus, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium databases, glycolysis-related mRNAs were used to construct GRGPs. Cox regression was applied to establish a seventeen GRGPs signature in TCGA dataset, which was verified in two validation (European and American, and Asian) datasets.Results:Seventeen prognostic GRGPs (HMMR_PFKFB1, CHST1_GYS2, MERTK_GYS2, GPC1_GYS2, LDHA_GOT2, IDUA_GNPDA1, IDUA_ME2, IDUA_G6PD, IDUA_GPC1, MPI_GPC1, SDC2_LDHA, PRPS1_PLOD2, GALK1_IER3, MET_PLOD2, GUSB_IGFBP3, IL13RA1_IGFBP3 and CYB5A_IGFBP3) were identified to be significantly progressive factors for the patients with HCC in the TCGA dataset, which constituted a GRGPs signature. The patients with HCC were classified into low-risk group and high-risk group based on the GRGPs signature. The GRGPs signature was a significantly independent prognostic indicator for the patients with HCC in TCGA (log-rank P = 2.898e-14). Consistent with the TCGA dataset, the patients in low-risk group had a longer OS in two validation datasets (European and American: P = 1.143e-02, and Asian: P = 6.342e-08). Additionally, the GRGPs signature was also validated as a significantly independent prognostic indicator in two validation datasets.Conclusion:The seventeen GRGPs and their signature might be molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the patients with HCC.
