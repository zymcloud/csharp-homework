We report the second case of deceased donor liver transplantation in a patient co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Japan. A 48-year-old patient with hemophilia A was infected with HIV and HCV through contaminated factor VIII concentrate in his childhood and developed cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient was on the transplant list for a deceased donor liver. The patient had broad spectrum anti-HLA class I and II antibodies, which may be attributed to repeated whole blood transfusions in the past. Catastrophic coagulopathy during the surgery was predicted because of the underlying hemophilic status and severe thrombocytopenia requiring HLA-matched platelet products, which are difficult to obtain quickly. To maintain adequate platelet counts (> 5 × 104/µL) while awaiting liver transplantation, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist and rituximab were administered. During surgery, factor VIII concentrate was administered according to a previously planned protocol. Adequate hemostasis was obtained, and the operation was completed without uncontrollable coagulopathy. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 41. Detailed planning is required for surgical patients with hemophilia and HIV/HCV cirrhosis, especially for those with a diverse spectrum of anti-HLA antibodies.
