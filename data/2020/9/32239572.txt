Ailanthone (AIT) is a quassinoid natural product isolated from the worldwide-distributed plant Ailanthus altissima. The drug displays multiple pharmacological properties, in particular significant antitumor effects against a variety of cancer cell lines in vitro. Potent in vivo activities have been evidenced in mice bearing hepatocellular carcinoma, nonsmall cell lung cancer and castration-resistant prostate cancer. This review focusses on the mechanism of action of AIT, notably to highlight the capacity of the drug to activate DNA damage responses, to inhibit the Hsp90 co-chaperone p23 and to modulate the expression of several microRNA. The interconnexion between these effects is discussed. The unique capacity of AIT to downregulate oncogenic miR-21 and to upregulate the tumor suppressor miRNAs miR-126, miR-148a, miR-195, and miR-449a is presented. AIT exploits several microRNAs to exert its anticancer effects in distinct tumor types. AIT is one of the rare antitumor natural products that binds to and strongly inhibits cochaperone p23, opening interesting perspectives to treat cancers. However, the toxicity profile of the molecule may limit its development as an anticancer drug, unless it can be properly formulated to prevent AIT-induced gastro-intestinal damages in particular. The antitumor properties of AIT and analogs are underlined, with the aim to encourage further pharmacological studies with this underexplored natural product and related quassinoids. HIGHLIGHTS: Ailanthone (AIT) is an anticancer quassinoid isolated from Ailanthus altissima It inhibits proliferation and induces cell death of many cancer cell types The drug activates DNA damage response and targets p23 cochaperone Up or downregulation of several microRNA by AIT contributes to the anticancer activity Analogs or specific formulations must be developed to prevent the toxicity of AIT.
