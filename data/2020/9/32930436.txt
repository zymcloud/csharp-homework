Aberrations in epigenetic mechanisms provide a fertile platform for tumour initiation and progression. Thus, agents capable of modulating the epigenetic environment of neoplasms will be a valuable addition to the anticancer therapeutics. Flavones are emerging as befitting anticancer agents due to their inherent antioxidant activity and the ability to restrain epi-targets namely histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs have broader implications in pathogenesis of various cancers. Chrysin, a flavone possessing the ability to inhibit HDACs could prove as a potential anticancer drug. Thus, in this article we focussed on Chrysin and its distinct antineoplastic effect against bellicose malignancies including lung, colorectal, cervical, gastric, melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer. The underlying signalling cascades triggered by Chrysin for inducing cytotoxic effect in these cancer models are discussed. Importantly, approaches towards combinatorial treatments by Chrysin and commercial anticancer agents are taken into account. The downstream molecular mechanism aroused by combined therapy for abrogating onerous cancer chemoresistance is delineated as well. Moreover, the nano-combinatorial approach involving co-encapsulation of Chrysin with other herbal and non-herbal agents for clinical excellence is elucidated.
