Background:To evaluate early outcomes of venous reconstruction with peritoneal patch (PP) during resection for hepatic malignancies.Methods:Since May 2015, PP was considered as the first option for venous reconstruction in the case of lateral resection. Between May 2015 and June 2019, 579 consecutive hepatectomies for malignancies were performed at our institution. Among 27 patients requiring venous resection, PP was used in 22, who were included in the present study. Data from a prospectively collected database were analysed.Results:Tumour types were ten colorectal metastases (CRLM), six intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, four hilar cholangiocarcinomas, one hepatocellular carcinoma and one gallbladder carcinoma. Hepatectomies were major in 50% of cases. Eleven patients had hepatic vein resections, eight portal vein and three inferior vena cava. Venous reconstruction enabled resection in 12 (54.5%) patients, otherwise non-resectable. Among CRLM, the venous reconstruction allowed avoidance of major resection in eight (80%) cases. Median operative time was 456 min (range 270-960). Blood loss was a median 300 cc (range 40-1500), and blood transfusions were required in three patients (13.6%). At pathological examination, venous infiltration was confirmed in 14 (63.6%) patients. No vascular complications related to the patch were recorded. Post-operative major (Dindo III/IV) complications were observed in two (9%) patients. One patient died because of liver failure without vascular thrombosis and one due to biliary fistula complicated by arterial bleeding. Overall, post-operative mortality was 9% (2/22).Conclusions:Venous reconstruction with peritoneal patch during hepatectomy for malignancies can feasibly allow resection in otherwise unresectable patients and decrease the rate of major resection in colorectal liver metastases.
