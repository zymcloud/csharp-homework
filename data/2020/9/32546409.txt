This study evaluated the feasibility of contrast vector imaging (CVI) to characterize focal liver lesions. From July to October 2019, we prospectively enrolled 30 patients with focal liver lesions (hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC] [n = 19], metastasis [n = 8], combined HCC-cholangiocarcinoma [CC] [n = 1], intra-hepatic CC [n = 1] and sclerosed hemangioma [n = 1]). Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) was performed with high frame rate contrast harmonic imaging technique by one radiologist, and post-processing CVI was obtained and analyzed by two radiologists. On combined CVI with CEUS, the staining pattern was significantly predominant in HCCs (9/11, 81.8%), while peripheral rim was frequent in non-HCCs (5/8, 62.5%) (p = 0.020). HCCs exhibited feeding arteries (8/11, 45.5%) and high velocity variance (10/11, 90.9 %), whereas non-HCCs showed detour pattern (4/8, 50.0%) with either a high or low velocity variance (4/8, 50.0%, both), with no significant inter-group differences (p = 0.052 and 0.080, respectively). In conclusion, CVI was feasible and provided quantitative and multi-parametric information of different types of hepatic tumors.
