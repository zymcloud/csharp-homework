While tumor resection and liver transplantation (LT) represent potentially curative therapeutic options for patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the identification of the ideal surgical candidates has remained challenging. Just recently, miRNA-193a-5p was described as a tumor suppressor in murine and human HCC but only little is known about circulating miRNA-193a-5p in HCC patients. Here, we evaluated serum levels of miR-193a-5p by qPCR in 41 HCC patients undergoing tumor resection (n = 33) or LT (n = 8) and 20 controls. Circulating relative miR-193a-5p levels were significantly elevated in HCC patients compared to healthy controls. While relative miR-193a-5p levels were comparable between patients of different underlying disease etiology and tumor size, high relative miR-193a-5p levels were predictive for the patients' postoperative outcome, which was confirmed in uni- and multivariate Cox-regression analysis. As such, HCC patients with a preoperative relative miR-193a-5p level above the ideal cut-off value (3.57) had a median overall survival (OS) of only 451 days compared to 1158 days in patients with a relative miR-193a-5p level below this cut-off value. Our data support a novel function of miR-193a-5p as a biomarker in early-stage HCC patients that might help to identify the best surgical candidates in terms of postoperative outcome.
