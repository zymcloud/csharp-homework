Background and aim:The clinical utility of sorafenib plus hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (SoraHAIC) in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients remains unclear. We, therefore, conducted the current meta-analysis to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of SoraHAIC therapy on major outcomes with advanced HCC patients.Methods:A systematic search of The Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase databases was performed. The major outcomes in patients with advanced HCC were divided into SoraHAIC group and sorafenib group, which included overall response rate, overall survival, progressive disease, and adverse events.Results:Involving a total of 726 patients from 5 included studies, our meta-analysis demonstrated that SoraHAIC showed significantly more improvement than sorafenib alone in overall response rate [risk ratio=3.08; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.38-6.89; P=0.006] and complete response (risk ratio=5.84; 95% CI, 1.85-18.45; P=0.003). With regard to survival outcome, the combination therapy also significantly prolongs the median overall survival than sorafenib monotherapy (hazard ratio=0.59; 95% CI, 0.35-1.00; P=0.05). In addition, the risk of adverse events such as anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia was significantly greater in the combination group than in the sorafenib group (PConclusions:This meta-analysis indicated that SoraHAIC seems to be efficient and safe for advanced HCC patients. However, additional large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to further investigate the clinical benefit.
