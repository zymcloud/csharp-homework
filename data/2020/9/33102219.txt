The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is closely associated with the occurrence of distant metastases, which is likely due to circulating tumor cells (CTCs). However, the low number of CTCs is the main obstacle limiting research of the mechanism of CTC metastasis. Here, We evaluated the role of ubiquitin-specific protease 1 (USP1) in promoting CTC survival during blood-borne metastases. We observed that USP1 was frequently upregulated in CTCs and correlated with metastasis and a reduced overall survival rate of patients. Additionally, genetic knockout of USP1 the survival rate of CTCs. Further analyses showed that USP1 mediates oncogenic activity by deubiquitinating and stabilizing transducin Î²-like 1 X-linked receptor 1 (TBLR1), which plays essential roles in regulating Wnt signaling. These results demonstrated that USP1 may act as an essential factor in promoting the survival of CTCs and suggest that inhibition of USP1 is a potential strategy for HCC treatment.
