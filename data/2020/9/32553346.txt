The rise of mortality rate caused by hepatocellular carcinoma accelerates requirements of biosensors for early liver cancer diagnosis and treatment to improve the clinical prognosis and prolong the survival of patients. However, how to realize label-free, low-cost, easy and fast-detection is the major challenge in the design of biosensors. Water-gated organic field-effect transistors efficiently bridge the gap between semiconductor devices and biological systems, leading to an organic device suitable for health or body signal monitoring. Herein, a kind of high-performance water-gated organic field-effect transistor is developed through the optimization process. This method provides a label-free general sensing platform for the determination of liver cancer biomarker alpha-fetoprotein in 45 minutes, much quicker than traditional methods such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for several hours. In addition, with the detection limit lower than the cut-off value as well as the ability to achieve quantitative detection, this novel water-gated organic field-effect transistor enables a much broader analysis of other biomarkers in cancer patient samples.
