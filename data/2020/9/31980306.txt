Background:Aging of the population and prolonged life expectancy have significantly increased the number of elderly patients undergoing hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, potential benefits, especially long-term oncologic outcomes of hepatectomy for elderly patients with HCC remain unclear.Method:Patients treated with curative-intent hepatectomy for HCC in 8 Chinese hospitals were enrolled. Patients were divided into the elderly (â‰¥70 years old) and younger (Results:Of 2134 patients, 259 (12.1%) and 1875 (87.9%) were elderly and younger aged, respectively. Postoperative 30-day and 90-day mortality was comparable among elderly and younger patients. Compared with younger patients, the elderly had a worse 5-year OS (49.4% vs. 55.3%, P = 0.032), yet a better 5-year CCS (74.5% vs. 61.0%, P = 0.005) and a lower 5-year TTR (33.7% vs. 44.9%, P Conclusions:Age by itself is not a contraindication to surgery, and selected elderly patients with HCC can benefit from hepatectomy. Compared with younger patients, elderly patients have noninferior oncologic outcomes following hepatectomy for HCC.
