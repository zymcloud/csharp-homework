Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the cancers of highest incidence and mortality worldwide. The proliferation and invasion of tumor cells are the main reason for poor prognosis after HCC surgery. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has been shown to play a key role in the progression of HCC. LncRNA-CR594175 is one of the highly expressed lncRNAs in HCC tumors and their metastatic tumors that we have obtained by the High-throughput screening method.Methods:To elucidate the role of lncRNA-CR594175 in regulating the proliferation and invasion of human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, we operated through lncRNA-CR594175 silencing to inhibit the progression of HCC, either through in vitro or in vivo experiments.Results:We found that lncRNA-CR594175 was lower in adjacent non-cancerous tissues than in primary HCC, and was lower in primary HCC than in its metastasis. Silencing of lncRNA-CR594175 inhibited the proliferation and invasion of HepG2 cells and growth of subcutaneous tumors. The results revealed that lncRNA-CR594175, as a RNA sponge, broke the negative regulation of hsa-miR-142-3p on Catenin, beta-1 (CTNNB1), and once lncRNA-CR594175 was silenced, the hsa-miR142-3p regained its negative regulation on CTNNB1 which can promote HCC progression by activating the wnt pathway.Conclusions:Our present study demonstrated for the first time that lncRNA-CR594175 silencing suppressed proliferation and invasion of HCC cells in vivo and in vitro by restoring the negative regulation of hsa-miR-142-3p on CTNNB1, laying a solid theoretical base for using lncRNA-CR594175 as genetic target therapy for HCC and offering a reasonable explanation for inactivation of miRNA in different tumors or in the tumor at different stages.
