Background:To evaluate safety and clinical outcome of repeated transarterial 90Y (yttrium) radioembolization (TARE) in primary and metastatic liver cancer.Methods:Between 2009 and 2018, n=288 patients underwent TARE for treatment of malignant liver disease in a tertiary care hospital. This retrospective single center study analyzed the safety and outcome of patients (n=11/288) undergoing repeated resin microsphere TARE. Included patients suffered from hepatocellular carcinoma (n=3), colorectal cancer (n=2), breast cancer (n=2), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (n=3), and neuroendocrine carcinoma (n=1). All patients had shown either partial response (n=9) or stable disease (n=2) after first TARE. Lab parameters, response assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST/RECIST) at 3 months and overall survival was analyzed. Additionally, patients with repeated TARE were compared to a matched control group (n=56) with single TARE therapy. Kaplan Meier analysis was performed to analyze survival.Results:Patients after repeated TARE showed similar increase in lab parameters as compared to their first TARE. No case of radioembolization induced liver disease was observed. While n=5/11 patients showed a partial response and n=4/11 patients a stable disease after repeated TARE, only n=2/11 patients suffered from progressive disease. Median overall survival was 20.9±11.9 months for the repeated TARE group while it was 5.9±16.2 months for the control group.Conclusions:Repeated 90Y TARE is safe and can be of benefit for patients yielding a comparable degree of local disease control compared to patients with singular TARE.
