Inflammation-based markers are considered prognostic indicators for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver resection. However, there is little information concerning whether they are useful for HCC patients with clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH). In this study, 1452 patients were enrolled. Independent risk factors for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed for patients with and without CSPH. For HCC patients without CSPH, multivariate analysis suggested that microvascular invasion (MVI), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) ≥ 3, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) ≥ 150, tumor size > 5 cm, and the presence of a satellite lesion were independently associated with RFS. MVI, NLR ≥ 3, PLR ≥ 150, and advanced Barcelona clinical liver cancer (BCLC) stage contributed to mortality. However, neither NLR nor PLR showed any prognostic power in HCC patients with CSPH. For HCC patients with CSPH, tumor size > 5 cm, MVI, satellite lesion, and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade were independent risk factors for RFS, whereas tumor size > 5 cm, MVI, multiple tumors, ALBI grade and advanced BCLC stage showed prognostic power for OS. Our study confirmed CSPH influences the predictive ability of inflammation-based markers. This result reminds us to pay more attention to the influence of CSPH when we apply inflammation-based markers in patients with HCC after liver resection.
