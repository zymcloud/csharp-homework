Objective:Limited data are available regarding the effect of systemic therapy change in the post-cytokine era on survival of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients undergoing cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN).Methods:Overall, 161 patients with synchronously mRCC were retrospectively evaluated. The patients were classified into three groups based on the time of diagnosis: (i) early molecular-targeted therapy (mTT) (2008-2011), (ii) late mTT (2012-8/2016) and (iii) immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) eras (9/2016-2018). Overall survival (OS) after the diagnosis was compared among the eras.Results:Of the 161 patients, 52 (32%), 75 (46%), and 34 patients (21%) were classified into the early mTT, late mTT and ICI eras, respectively. OS was significantly longer in the ICI and late mTT eras than that in the early mTT era (P = 0.0065 and P = 0.0010, respectively) but did not significantly differ between the ICI and late mTT eras (P = 0.389). In 112 patients undergoing CN and systemic therapy, OS was significantly longer in the ICI and late mTT eras than that in the early mTT era (P = 0.0432 and P = 0.0498, respectively) but did not significantly differ between the ICI and late mTT eras (P = 0.320). Multivariate analysis of OS in the 161 synchronous mRCC patients revealed that the era was an independent factor (P < 0.0001), together with the histopathological type (P = 0.0130), CN status (P = 0.0010), International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk (P = 0.0002) and liver metastasis status (P = 0.0124).Conclusion:This retrospective analysis showed that systemic therapy change in the post-cytokine era improved OS of mRCC patients undergoing CN.
