Background:Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) have been proved to play important roles in various cellular physiological process. Recently, dysregulation of snoRNA SNORA71A has been found involved in tumorigenesis of various malignant cancers. However, the emerging effects of SNORA71A in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore the SNORA71A expression and its underlying significance in HCC.Methods:Expression of SNORA71A in cell lines and clinical specimens was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Then, all enrolled HCC patients were divided into low and high SNORA71A expression subgroups and then they were compared in the aspects of clinical features as well as survival outcome by respective statistical analysis methods.Results:SNORA71A was significantly downexpressed in SK-HEP-1 (P = 0.001), Huh-7 (P < 0.001), Hep3B (P < 0.001), and clinical HCC specimens (P = 0.006). Comparing the clinical features between SNORA71A expression subgroups, it showed that low SNORA71A expression was significantly associated with large tumor diameter, multiple lesions, capsular invasion, bad tumor differentiation, and TNM stage (P < 0.05). Furthermore, it was found that HCC patients with lower SNORA71A expression had higher risk in postoperative tumor relapse (median time: 9.5 vs. 35.2 months; low vs. high; P < 0.001) and poor overall survival (median time: 36.8 vs. 52.9 months; low vs. high; P < 0.001). Besides, SNORA71A expression served as independent risk factors for tumor-free (HR = 0.450; 95% CI [0.263-0.770]; P = 0.004) and long-term survival (HR = 0.289; 95% CI [0.127-0.657]; P = 0.003).Conclusions:Our study for the first time demonstrated that downregulation of SNORA71A could serve as a novel biomarker for clinical assessment and prognostic prediction of HCC patients.
