Liver is the most common site for neuroendocrine metastasis. However, primary neuroendocrine tumor is a rare focal hepatic lesion with a better prognosis than hepatocellular carcinoma and other malignant hepatic lesions. We present a case of primary hepatic neuroendocrine tumor in a 38-year-old female patient with a radiological diagnosis of atypical focal hepatic lesion, and a confirmed diagnosis on histopathology. Few radiology features like predominant cystic component with absence of focal lesion at any other site, aids the imaging diagnosis of primary hepatic neuroendocrine tumor.
