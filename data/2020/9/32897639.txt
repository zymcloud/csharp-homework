Background/purpose:The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for bile leakage in hepatic resections without biliary reconstructions using the large Japanese national clinical database (NCD).Methods:A total of 10 102 patients who had undergone hepatic resection involving more than one segment without biliary reconstructions for hepatocellular carcinoma during 2015-2017 were enrolled. Risk factors for bile leakage, with special reference to the type of hepatic resection, were identified by multivariable logistic regression analysis.Results:Bile leakage occurred in 726 patients (7.2%). Risk factors for bile leakage were as follows: male sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.58), diabetes mellitus (+) (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01-1.39), hemoglobin Conclusion:Central bisectionectomy, left trisectionectomy, and right anterior sectionectomy are high-risk types of hepatic resection for bile leakage.
