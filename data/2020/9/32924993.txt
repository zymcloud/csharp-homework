Background:Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLHCC) is an unusual variant of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Revealing the imaging features is important to the diagnosis of FLHCC.Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate the imaging characteristics of FLHCCs.Methods:This retrospective study included 29 patients with histopathologically proved FLHCC and 96 patients proved HCC. All patients underwent an ultrasound examination pre-operation.Results:The average maximum diameters of the FLHCC and HCC lesions were 7.4Â±4.1 cm and 4.1Â±3.0 cm, respectively. On the ultrasound, 79.3% of the FLHCCs and 12.3% of the HCCs showed the internal hyperechoic area; 48.3% of the FLHCCs and 3.3% of the HCCs displayed a strip-like attenuation. Calcification was noted in 20.7% of the FLHCCs, while none in HCCs. On the contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), all FLHCC lesions and 87.7% of the HCCs displayed hyperenhancement in the arterial phase. An internal, unenhanced central scar appeared in all FLHCCs, while none in HCCs.Conclusions:The ultrasonographic features of FLHCC lesions indicate that they are relatively large masses showing the internal hyperechoic area or strip-like attenuation or calcification on the US and hypervascularity with an unenhanced central scar on the CEUS as compared with conventional HCC lesions.
