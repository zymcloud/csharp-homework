Background:To accurately predict the survival rate of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing thermal ablation using nomograms taking early recurrence into account as a risk factor.Methods:A total of 591 patients receiving percutaneous thermal ablation were included in this study. The overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate was analyzed. Two prognostic nomograms with or without taking early recurrence into account as a risk factor were constructed using the independent predictors assessed by the multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. The performance of the nomograms, in terms of discrimination and calibration, was evaluated.Results:The cumulative RFS and OS rates at 1-, 3- and 5-year are 82.2%, 52.5%and 38.4%, 96.6%, 83.6% and 65.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis without considering the early recurrence shows that tumor number, Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) level, liver function, and GGT level are associated with OS. The early recurrence, tumor number, AFP level, and liver function are considered associated with the OS when considering early recurrence. Two different nomograms were developed from the above two results. Internal validation with 1,000 bootstrapped sample sets of the two nomograms shows the concordance indexes of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.624-0.748) for the baseline nomogram and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.754-0.857) for the early recurrence-based nomogram, with the latter significantly better in discriminating performance (Z statistics =92.19, PConclusions:The survival rate of patients with HCC undergoing radical thermal ablation can be reliably predicted by the nomogram presented in this study, which was developed by taking early recurrence into account.
