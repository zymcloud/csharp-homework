Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a rare but fatal tumor. The isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) genes are known to be mutated in ICC. IDH1/2 mutations tend to be accompanied by enhanced hypermethylation at a subset of genomic loci. We sought to clarify the clinicopathological features, including prognostic value, of ICCs with IDH1/2 mutation-associated hypermethylation at a subset of genes. The mutation status of IDH1/2 and methylation status of 30 gene CpG island loci were analyzed in 172 cases of ICC using pyrosequencing and the MethyLight assay, respectively. The mutation status of IDH1/2 was correlated with clinicopathological features and the DNA methylation status at 30 gene loci. Then, the clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed regarding three-tiered methylation statuses in genes showing IDH1/2 mutation-associated methylation. IDH1/2 mutations were found in 9.3% of ICCs, and IDH1/2-mutated tumors were associated with the histological subtype, including the bile ductular type and small duct type, and poor differentiation. Eight DNA methylation markers showed associations with IDH1/2 mutations, and ICCs with > 5/8 methylated markers were associated with the bile ductular type or small duct type, absence of mucin production, absence of biliary intraepithelial neoplasia, and presence of chronic liver disease. > 5/8 methylated markers were an independent prognostic marker associated with better survival in both cancer-specific survival and recurrence-free survival. In summary, by analyzing the association between IDH1/2 mutations and DNA methylation in individual genes, we developed a panel of DNA methylation markers that were significantly associated with IDH1/2 mutations and were able to identify a subset of ICC with better clinical outcomes.
