The evolution of cirrhosis is marked by quantitative and qualitative modifications of the fibrosis tissue and an increasing risk of complications such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our purpose was to identify by FTIR imaging the spectral characteristics of hepatic fibrosis in cirrhotic patients with and without HCC. FTIR images were collected at projected pixel sizes of 25 and 2.7 Î¼m from paraffinized hepatic tissues of five patients with uncomplicated cirrhosis and five cirrhotic patients with HCC and analyzed by k-means clustering. When compared to the adjacent histological section, the spectral clusters corresponding to hepatic fibrosis and regeneration nodules were easily identified. The fibrosis area estimated by FTIR imaging was correlated to that evaluated by digital image analysis of histological sections and was higher in patients with HCC compared to those without complications. Qualitative differences were also observed when fibrosis areas were specifically targeted at higher resolution. The partition in two clusters of the fibrosis tissue highlighted subtle differences in the spectral characteristics of the two groups of patients. These data show that the quantitative and qualitative changes of fibrosis tissue occurring during the course of cirrhosis are detectable by FTIR imaging, suggesting the possibility of subclassifying cirrhosis into different steps of severity.
