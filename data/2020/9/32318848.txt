Objectives:To quantify and compare the fat fraction of background liver and primary liver lesions using a triple-echo-gradient-echo sequence. M&M: This IRB-approved study included 128 consecutive patients who underwent a liver MRI for lesion characterization. Fat fraction from the whole lesion volume and the normal liver parenchyma were computed from triple-echo (consecutive in-phase, opposed-phase, in-phase echo times) sequence.Results:Forty-seven hepatocellular carcinoma (HCCs), 25 hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs), and 56 focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) were included. The mean intralesional fat fraction for various lesions was 7.1% (range, 0.5-23.6; SD, 5.6) for HCAs, 5.7% (range, 0.8-14; SD, 2.9) for HCCs, and 2.3% (range, 0.8-10.3; SD, 1.9) for FNHs (p = 0.6 for HCCs vs HCA, p Conclusion:Triple-echo-gradient-echo is a feasible technique to quantify fat fraction of background liver and primary liver lesions. Intralesional fat fraction obtained from lesion whole volume is greater for HCCs and HCA compared to FNH. When trying to distinguish FNH and HCA, an intralesional fat fraction Key points:• Triple-echo technique is feasible to quantify intralesional fat fraction of primary liver lesions. • Whole volume intralesional fat fraction is greater for HCCs and HCA compared to FNH. • An intralesional fat fraction
