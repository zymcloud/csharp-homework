Introduction:Liver transplantation is the standard treatment for end-stage liver disease. Brazil holds the third highest number of liver transplants performed per year, but center maldistribution results in high discrepancies in accessing this treatment. In 2012, an interstate partnership successfully implemented a new liver transplantation program in the middle west of Brazil. Here, we report the results of the first 500 liver transplants performed in this new program and discuss the impacts of a new transplant center in regional transplantation dynamics.Methods:We reviewed data from the first 500 consecutive deceased donor liver transplants performed in the new program during an 8-year period. We analyzed data on patients' clinical and demographic profiles, postoperative outcomes, and graft and recipient survival rates. Univariate survival analysis was conducted using log-rank tests to compare the groups.Results:Almost half (48%) of the procured organs and 40% of the recipients transplanted in our center were from outside our state. Recipient 30-day mortality was 9%. Overall recipient survival at 1 year and 5 years was 85% and 80%, respectively. Mortality was significantly associated with higher Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (P Discussion:The new transplantation program treated patients from different regions of Brazil and became the reference center in liver transplantation for the middle west region. Despite the recent implementation, our outcomes are comparable to experienced centers around the world. This model can inspire the creation of new transplantation programs aiming to democratize access to liver transplantation nationwide.
