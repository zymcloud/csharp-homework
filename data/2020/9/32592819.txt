Since humans are exposed to different mycotoxins through daily intake, there is increasing concern about the adverse effects of the interactions between them. Cytotoxicity of sterigmatocystin (STE) and nivalenol (NIV) alone and in combination in human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cells was evaluated by MTT assay. Furthermore, ROS production and alteration of ΔΨm as mechanisms of action were assessed. Cells were treated with concentrations ranging from 0.15 to 5 μM for NIV and from 0.78 to 50 μM for STE individually and in binary combinations. The combination ratio between the mixture STE + NIV was 10:1. The IC50 values of NIV ranged from 0.96 to 0.66 μM, whereas no IC50 values were obtained for STE at any time tested. For the combinations studied, synergistic, antagonistic and addictive effects were obtained with the two type of analyses performed, the isobologram analysis and the Combenefit method. No relevant effects on ROS and ΔΨm were observed. In conclusion, predictive models based on combination data could help to better understand the interactions between mycotoxins and their implications in food safety assessment. However, a further analysis of the molecular mechanism underlying these interactive effects is required.
