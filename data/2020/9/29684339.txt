Tumor lysis syndrome is a potentially lethal complication of chemotherapy, usually associated with aggressive hematologic malignancies. We describe the case of a young patient with metastatic hepatocellular cancer who developed rapid and fatal tumor lysis syndrome following initiation of sorafenib therapy. Although rare with sorafenib therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma, tumor lysis syndrome is serious complication. Patients with a high burden of disease at therapy initiation should have their metabolic parameters measured prior to starting therapy and closely followed for the first 1-2 weeks while being treated.
