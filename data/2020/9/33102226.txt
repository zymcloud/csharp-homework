Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-ICC) is an uncommon and aggressive form of primary liver cancer. Currently, there are no international guidelines for optimal management. For localized tumors, radical resection represents the preferred treatment option, whereas for advanced tumors, systemic therapies recommended for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are often selected. Emerging information from comparative cohort studies, genomic and transcriptomic data sets are starting to build a case for rationalized approaches to systemic treatment in the advanced setting specific to cHCC-ICC.
