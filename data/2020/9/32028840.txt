Introduction:Oral cavity malignancies constitute 30% of head and neck cancers. The most common distant metastatic sites of glottic carcinoma are usually lung, liver and bone. Although the cutaneous metastasis of head and cancers have been reported with an incidence of 0.7-2.4%, skin metastasis of glottic carcinoma is extremely rare.Case report:A 69-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department with hemoptysis, dyspnea, weakness in lower extremities and difficulty in swallowing. There were subcutaneous lesions with a diameter of 2-5 cm in the scalp, posterior chest wall, nose and abdomen. In addition, there was an ulcerating, painful mass on the right lateral part of the tongue. The biopsy of lesions on tongue and skin revealed a glottic squamous cell carcinoma with cutaneous metastasis.Management and outcome: The patient was treated with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on day 1, cetuximab 500 mg/m2 on day 1 and 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2 daily on days 1 and 2, repeated every two weeks. After the first cycle of chemotherapy, the lesions on the skin regressed and dysphagia improved.Discussion:There are limited data about the incidence, diagnostic measures and treatment modalities of glottic cancer with cutaneous metastasis. Our case could provide an important experience to literature by its atypical presentation and treatment-sensitive nature.
