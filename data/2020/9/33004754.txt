Objective:The objective is to evaluate the application of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) in the diagnosis of the left-lobe hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic patients with contraindication to percutaneous biopsy.Materials and methods:Thirty-eight consecutive patients with liver cirrhosis and suspected left-lobe HCC and with contraindication for percutaneous biopsy undergoing EUS-FNB between January 2011 and December 2014 were included in this study. The final diagnosis was obtained through histopathology of surgical samples or clinical and imaging results with follow-up. Using the final diagnosis as the gold standard, the diagnostic performance of EUS-FNB for HCC detection was evaluated.Results:Among 38 patients, EUS-FNB was successfully performed in 34 cases, in which adequate biopsy specimens were obtained for histopathological examination in 30. For the 30 patients with biopsy results, 25 cases were confirmed to have HCC, while five cases had benign lesions according to the final diagnosis. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy rates of EUS-FNB in the diagnosis of HCC were 88.0% (22/25), 100.0% (5/5), 100.0% (22/22), 62.5% (5/8), and 90.0% (27/30), respectively. Self-limiting bleeding occurred in three patients.Conclusions:EUS-FNB is a sensitive and safe diagnostic modality for cirrhotic patients with suspected HCC located in the left lobe, especially those for whom percutaneous biopsy is contraindicated.
