Purpose:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks fifth among the common cancers worldwide. Hepatocarcinogenesis is a multiple-phases process, which involves changes in cellular genomes including high cell proliferation.In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship of NGAL level at the time of diagnosis with mortality in patients diagnosed with HCC.Material and methods:A total of 35 patients who developed HCC on the ground of HBV(+) and 30 healthy subjects were included in the study. Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC), Okuda staging system, and Milan criteria were used for staging of the patients with HCC.Results:The mean age of all patients was 59.54 ± 11.57 years. Seventeen (48.6%) HCC patients died during 1-year follow-up. Survival of the patients who met the Milan criteria was longer (log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test, χ2 = 5.353, p = 0.021). Kaplan-Meier curve was drawn for NGAL cut-off value, mortality was found to be higher in patients with a NGAL level higher than 217.50 (log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test, χ2 = 15.540, p Conclusion:In this study, we found that high levels of NGAL at the time of diagnosis were associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients.
