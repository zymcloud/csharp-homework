Aims:Competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) play essential roles in cancer pathogenesis and those in exosomes have been the promising biomarkers for cancer diagnose and therapy. We aim to identify potential active ceRNA pairs in cancer blood exosomes by combining TCGA and exoRBase.Main methods:Two strict screening criteria were implemented, including hypergeometric test on the targets predicted by RNA22 for differential miRNAs and Pearson test on the candidate mRNAs and lncRNAs for each cancer. Then2638292, 4925485 and 70669 ceRNAs in blood exosomes are available for colorectal cancer (CRC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), respectively.Key findings:A comprehensive functional analysis on differential miRNAs in cancer blood exosomes indicates that they play important roles in development of cancer by degrading or inhibiting the post-transcription translation level of mRNA or by acting as mediators to regulate the expression of mRNA. Topological and biological functional analysis of ceRNA networks demonstrate that hub ceRNAs involve in cancer-related biological pathways and processes, so as to influence the occurrence and development of cancer and would be the potential biomarkers for three cancers. Finally, we designed a web-accessible database, ExoceRNA Atlas (https://www.exocerna-atlas.com/exoceRNA#/) as a repository of ceRNAs in blood exosomes. It can friendly search, browse and visualize ceRNA networks of the query genes along with giving the detailed functional analysis results. The entire ceRNA data can also be freely downloaded.Significance:ExoceRNA Atlas will serve as a powerful public resource for identifying ceRNAs and greatly deepen our understanding their functions in cancer exosomes.
