Engineered nanoparticles are utilized as drug delivery carriers in modern medicine due to their high surface area and tailorable surface functionality. After in vivo administration, nanoparticles distribute and interact with biomolecules, such as polar proteins in serum, lipid membranes in cells, and high ionic conditions during digestion. Electrostatic forces and steric hindrances in a nanoparticle population are disturbed and particles agglomerate in biological fluids. Little is known about the stability of nanoparticles in relation to particle surface charge. Here, we compared three different surface-stabilized silver nanoparticles (50 nm) for intracellular agglomeration in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2). Nanoparticles stabilized with branched polyethyleneimine conferred a positive surface charge, particles stabilized with lipoic acid conferred a negative surface charge, and particles stabilized with polyethylene glycol conferred a neutral surface charge. Particles were incubated in fetal bovine serum, simulated lung surfactant fluid, and simulated stomach digestion fluid. Each nanoparticle system was characterized via microscopic (transmission electron, fluorescence, and enhanced darkfield) and spectroscopic (hyperspectral, dynamic light scattering, and ultraviolet-visible absorption) techniques. Results showed that nanoparticle transformation included cellular internalization, agglomeration, and degradation and that these changes were dependent upon surface charge and incubation matrix. Hyperspectral analyses showed that positively charged silver nanoparticles red-shifted in spectral analysis after transformations, whereas negatively charged silver nanoparticles blue-shifted. Neutrally charged silver nanoparticles did not demonstrate significant spectral shifts. Spectral shifting indicates de-stabilization in particle suspension, which directly affects agglomeration intracellularly. These characteristics are translatable to critical quality attributes and can be exploited when developing nano-carriers for nanomedicine.
