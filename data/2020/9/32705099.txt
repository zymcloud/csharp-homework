Recent studies have shown the potential of magnetic hyperthermia in cancer treatments. However, the underlying mechanisms involved have not been yet fully described. In particular, the cell death related to magnetic hyperthermia observed in cultures incubated with low concentration of magnetic nanoparticles and under a low intensity alternating magnetic field, in which a macroscopic temperature rise is not observed, is still not understood. In the present study, we investigate the production of intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) as a mechanism to induce cell death under these conditions. In this study, the production and influence of ROS on the viability of HepG2 human hepatoma cells (used as a model cell line) are analyzed under the application of variable magnetic fields using hyperthermia agents, such as biomimetic magnetic nanoparticles (BMNPs) mediated by magnetosome MamC protein from Magnetococcus marinus MC-1. The results show that intracellular ROS production increases up to ∼90% following upon the exposure of AMF to HepG2 cells containing BMNPs, which could determine the loss of cell viability (up to ∼40% reduction) without a significant rise in temperature. Such ROS production is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction caused by the application of AMF to cells containing BMNPs.
