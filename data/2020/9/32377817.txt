The objective response rate of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with anti PD-L1/PD-1 therapy is low. Discovering the signaling pathways regulating PD-L1 might help to improve ICB response rates. Here, we investigate transcription factors IRF-1 and IRF-2 signaling pathways regulating PD-L1 in HCC cells. In vivo studies show that IRF-1 and PD-L1 mRNA expression in human HCC tumors are significantly repressed compared with noncancerous background liver. IRF-1, IRF-2, and PD-L1 mRNA expression correlated positively in HCC tumors. Increased IRF-1 mRNA expression was observed in patients with well-differentiated or early stage HCC tumors. In vitro studies show that IFN-γ induces PD-L1 mRNA and protein expression through upregulation of IRF-1 in mouse and human HCC cells. IRF-1, IRF-2, and PD-L1 mRNA expression is upregulated in murine HCC by co-culture with effector T cells from spleen cells incubated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies. IRF-2 over-expression down-regulates IFN-γ induced PD-L1 promoter activity and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. We identify two IRF-1 response elements (IRE1/IRE2) in the upstream 5'-flanking region of the CD274 (PD-L1) gene promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis shows both IRE1 and IRE2 are functional in transfection promoter assays. IRF-1 traditionally functions as tumor suppressor gene. However, these novel findings show a complex role for IRF-1 which upregulates PD-L1 in the inflammatory tumor microenvironment. IRF-1 antagonizes IRF-2 for binding to the IRE promoter element in PD-L1 which gives new insight to the regulation of PD-L1/PD-1 pathways in HCC ICB therapy.
