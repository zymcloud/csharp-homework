Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered as responsible for initiation, maintenance and recurrence of solid tumors, thus representing the key for tumor eradication. The antitumor activity of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from different stem cell sources has been investigated with conflicting results. In our study, we evaluated, both in vitro and in vivo, the effect of EVs derived from human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and from a population of human liver stem cells (HLSCs) of mesenchymal origin on renal CSCs. In vitro, both EV sources displayed pro-apoptotic, anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects on renal CSCs, but not on differentiated tumor cells. Pre-treatment of renal CSCs with EVs, before subcutaneous injection in SCID mice, delayed tumor onset. We subsequently investigated the in vivo effect of MSC- and HLSC-EVs systemic administration on progression of CSC-generated renal tumors. Tumor bio-distribution analysis identified intravenous treatment as best route of administration. HLSC-EVs, but not MSC-EVs, significantly impaired subcutaneous tumor growth by reducing tumor vascularization and inducing tumor cell apoptosis. Moreover, intravenous treatment with HLSC-EVs improved metastasis-free survival. In EV treated tumor explants, we observed both the transfer and the induction of miR-145 and of miR-200 family members. In transfected CSCs, the same miRNAs affected cell growth, invasion and survival. In conclusion, our results showed a specific antitumor effect of HLSC-EVs on CSC-derived renal tumors in vivo, possibly ascribed to the transfer and induction of specific antitumor miRNAs. Our study provides further evidence for a possible clinical application of stem cell-EVs in tumor treatment.
