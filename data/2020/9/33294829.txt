Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important biological mediators that regulate numerous cellular processes. New experimental evidence suggests that lncRNAs play essential roles in liver development, normal liver physiology, fibrosis, and malignancy, including hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. In this review, we summarise our current understanding of the function of lncRNAs in the liver in both health and disease, as well as discuss approaches that could be used to target these non-coding transcripts for therapeutic purposes.
