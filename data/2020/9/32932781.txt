AU-rich element-binding proteins (AUBPs) represent important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. AUBPs can bind to the AU-rich elements present in the 3'-UTR of more than 8% of all mRNAs and are thereby able to control the stability and/or translation of numerous target mRNAs. The regulation of the stability and the translation of mRNA transcripts by AUBPs are highly complex processes that occur through multiple mechanisms depending on the cell type and the cellular context. While AUBPs have been shown to be involved in inflammatory processes and the development of various cancers, their important role and function in the development of chronic metabolic and inflammatory fatty liver diseases (FLDs), as well as in the progression of these disorders toward cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), has recently started to emerge. Alterations of either the expression or activity of AUBPs are indeed significantly associated with FLDs and HCC, and accumulating evidence indicates that several AUBPs are deeply involved in a significant number of cellular processes governing hepatic metabolic disorders, inflammation, fibrosis, and carcinogenesis. Herein, we discuss our current knowledge of the roles and functions of AUBPs in liver diseases and cancer. The relevance of AUBPs as potential biomarkers for different stages of FLD and HCC, or as therapeutic targets for these diseases, are also highlighted.
