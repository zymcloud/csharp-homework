Background:The prognosis for advanced Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)is still very poor. Despite initial usefulness of immune checkpoint inhibitor (PD-1), phase 3 trials failed to show significant benefit of PD-1 inhibition with nivolumab or pembrolizumab in the first and second line therapy of HCC. Clinical evidence of PD-1 inhibition in patients with advanced and heavily pretreated HCC outside clinical trials is extremely limited. In this study, we analyzed the clinical experience with PD-1 inhibition in patients with heavily pretreated HCC.Methods:Between May 2016 and January 2019 14 patients with advanced and heavily pretreated HCC were treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab at the University Hospital Bonn, Germany. Base line characteristics prior to immunotherapy, immunohistochemistry of different immunological markers, beneficial outcome and safety were recorded and retrospectively analyzed.Results:Immunotherapy with PD-1 inhibition was well tolerated and resulted in significant clinical benefit as last line therapy. Median overall survival (OS) was 6.6 months (95%CI:3.9-11.8), progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.3 months (95%CI:2.4-11.7) and overall response rate (ORR) was 30.8%. One patient reached a complete remission.Conclusions:Despite numerous pretreatments, PD-1 inhibition was well tolerated and showed clinical benefit in patients with heavily pretreated HCC.
