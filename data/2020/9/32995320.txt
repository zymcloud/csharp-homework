An increase in the average life expectancy, paralleled by a demographic shift in the population with end-stage liver disease lies behind the rising demand for liver transplantation (LT) among the elderly. Some of the most common indications for LT including hepatocellular carcinoma, alcohol-related liver disease, chronic hepatitis C and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease tend to affect older patients. Transplant professionals are faced with an increasing demand for LT among elderly patients in an age of organ shortage and it is important that risk and benefits are carefully weighed in order to achieve the optimum use of precious liver grafts.
