Background:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is one of the most important risk factors for liver failure which can lead to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Approximately 170-200 million (almost 3% of the world's population) people have been reported to have HCV infection worldwide. HCV has six genotypes and multiple subtypes. HCV genotyping and identification of subtypes are critical steps for HCV vaccine development.Materials and methods:In this community-based study, we aimed to investigate the HCV genotypes in infected patients referring to the laboratory of Hajar Hospital of Shahrekord city (the capital of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province) in Iran from November 21, 2016, to October 21, 2017. During 2016-2017, the sera were obtained from 2377 individuals referring to the laboratory of Hajar Hospital of Shahrekord, Iran. The anti-HCV antibody was tested for all sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. Following HCV RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis, HCV genotype detection was performed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.Results:Genotypes 3, 1a, and 1b were found in 28.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.0%-40.0%), 9.5% (95% CI: 2.1%-17.0%), and 3.2% (95% CI: 0.0%-7.6%) of the patients, respectively. In 5 patients (7.9%, 95% CI: 1.1%-14.8%), however, we did not observe any genotypes. We could not find any significant difference between the plasma viral load of infected patients and different genotypes. There was no significant difference either between age groups and genotypes (P > 0.05).Conclusion:The findings of the present study determined that HCV genotype 3 was the predominant genotype followed by the genotypes 1a and 1b in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province.
